In the mouse, transcription stops when oocytes undergo meiotic maturation to form unfertilized eggs and does not resume until after fertilization. The appearance of proteins whose synthesis is dependent on DNA transcription (i.e. zygotic gene expression) does not occur until after the fertilized egg (one-cell embryo) develops to the two-cell stage. Since only a small number of genes are transcribed at this time, their regulatory regions must exhibit some features that are distinctive. As a first step towards identifying those features, we sequenced the region upstream of the <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> gene, one of the first genes expressed at the beginning of mouse development, and searched for unusual characteristics.</p><p>The mouse TEAD&#x0002f;TEF family of transcription factors consists of four genes that are expressed to different extents in a variety of adult tissues, but only <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> is expressed during the first 7 days of embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c5">5</xref> and references therein). mTEAD-specific transcription factor activity is not detected in mouse oocytes, but it is detected as soon as zygotic gene expression begins at the two-cell stage in mouse development and then increases as embryos progress to the four-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c4">4</xref>). These changes in TEAD transcription factor activity are accompanied by changes in <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> RNA, but not by changes in the expression of other <italic>mTEAD</italic> genes. While <italic>mTEAD-1</italic> and <italic>mTEAD-3</italic> RNAs are also detected in oocytes, they are 2- to 5-times less than <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> and they are completely degraded after fertilization. In fact, embryos homozygous for a disruption in mTEAD-1 survive long past the pre-implantation development stage (the first 4 days post-fertilization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c6">6</xref>), consistent with the initial appearance of significant levels of <italic>mTEAD-1</italic> RNA in embryos about day 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c4">4</xref>). In contrast, &#x0223c;5000 copies of <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> mRNA are present in each oocyte and this mRNA is recruited to polysomes only when development proceeds to the two-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c7">7</xref>), coincident with the initial appearance of mTEAD transcription factor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c4">4</xref>). <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> RNA is degraded in two- and four-cell embryos, but then increases 50-fold as pre-implantation embryos progress from the four-cell stage to blastocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c4">4</xref>). These observations are consistent with degradation of maternally inherited mRNA in two-cell embryos followed by transcription of the <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> gene during pre-implantation development. Thus, <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> is one of the first genes expressed at the beginning of mouse development, where it presumably plays a role in activating transcription of other genes during pre-implantation development.</p><p>Efforts to identify sequences that regulate <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> transcription led to the unexpected discovery of a novel spermatocyte-specific gene that is closely linked to <italic>mTEAD-2</italic>. Recently, the same gene has been identified as a relative of the <italic>Dickkopf</italic> family of proteins and given the name <italic>Soggy</italic> (<italic>mSgy</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c8">8</xref>). Here we show that <italic>mSgy</italic> is a single copy gene that lies only 3.8 kb upstream from <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> and is transcribed in the opposite direction. Moreover, we have shown that the expression patterns for these two genes differ dramatically, despite the fact that their regulatory sequences lie in close proximity. Thus, the mouse <italic>mSgy</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>mTEAD-2</italic> locus provides an excellent paradigm for elucidating mechanisms involved in differential gene expression during mammalian development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning the mouse <italic>Soggy</italic> gene</title><p>Using PCR and primers (5&#x02032;-GTTGGAGGTGATGGCAGCCCT-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-ACAGGATGATCTTGCGACGG-3&#x02032;) located within exon 2 of <italic>mTEAD-2</italic>, Genome Systems (St Louis, MO) screened a BAC library made from Sv129 mouse embryonic stem cells and identified one clone that contained the <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> gene (Clone address BACM-75i6). This BAC clone was then digested with either <italic>Sac</italic>I restriction endonuclease to release an &#x0223c;7.8 kb DNA fragment or <italic>Sac</italic>I and <italic>Xho</italic>I restriction endonucleases to release &#x0223c;5.7 and &#x0223c;2.1 kb DNA fragments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f1">1</xref>). These DNA fragments were subcloned into either the <italic>Sac</italic>I site or the <italic>Sac</italic>I and <italic>Xho</italic>I sites of Bluescript KS (Stratagene) and both strands were sequenced using the ABI BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (PE Biosystems, AGCT Inc.; GenBank accession no.

Therefore, in an effort to identify this gene, a complete cDNA was isolated from the Marathon cDNA-ready mouse testis library (Clontech) using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c9">9</xref>). The 5&#x02032;-half of the cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification using a unique primer within <italic>mSgy</italic> (KK281, 5&#x02032;-GGAACAGTCGACTAAAGCTTTGGAG-3&#x02032;) and a primer (AP1; Clontech) that anneals to the linker-adapter present on both ends of the cDNAs in this library.

A single PCR product was observed. This product was cloned into pCR (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The same sequence was found in three independent clones, thus identifying the 5&#x02032;-end of the <italic>mSgy</italic> mRNA. Similarly, the 3&#x02032;-half of the cDNA was obtained using another unique primer (KK277, 5&#x02032;-ACTGAGGGTCTTGCTGCTGCT-3&#x02032;) within <italic>mSgy</italic> and the AP1 primer.</p><p>Combinatorial PCR was done in order to obtain a single full-length <italic>mSgy</italic> cDNA clone from the two clones identified by 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-RACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c10">10</xref>). The locations of primers KK277 and KK281 meant that PCR products obtained by 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-RACE would overlap by 140 bp, thus allowing the PCR products to anneal during simultaneous PCR amplification of a mixture of the two DNA fragments. pCR clones containing the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-RACE products were chosen such that the AP1 primer site was adjacent to a &#x02018;reverse&#x02019; primer (5&#x02032;-GGAAACAGCTATGACCATG-3&#x02032;) site situated within the pCR vector. The 5&#x02032;-RACE clone was amplified using the &#x02018;reverse&#x02019; and KK281 primers and the 3&#x02032;-RACE clone was amplified using the &#x02018;reverse&#x02019; and KK277 primers. The resulting amplicons were purified using a Qiagen PCR purification kit and 1&#x00025; of each DNA product was combined and amplified using only the &#x02018;reverse&#x02019; primer.

A novel gene was discovered &#x0223c;3.8 kb upstream of <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f1">1</xref>) and cloned as described in Materials and Methods. The 860 bp cDNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f2">2</xref>) contained three potential ATG translation initiation codons, one TAA termination codon, a signal for polyadenylation (AATAAA) and an open reading frame of 230&#x000a0;amino acids that encoded a protein with a theoretical size of 26.7 kDa and a pI of 7.98. Subsequent searches of the GenBank, PDB, SwissProt, PIR and PRF databases revealed that this gene had recently been identified as a member of the <italic>Dickkopf</italic> gene family and named <italic>Soggy</italic> (<italic>mSgy</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c8">8</xref>).</p><p>Although <italic>mSgy</italic> mRNA was clearly expressed <italic>in vivo</italic> (see below; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c8">8</xref>), it was possible that the <italic>mSgy</italic> gene existed at multiple genomic loci and that the copy located upstream of <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> was a pseudogene. Therefore, to determine whether or not <italic>mSgy</italic> exists as a single copy gene, mouse genomic DNA was digested with various restriction endonucleases and the DNA products were fractionated by gel electrophoresis, transferred to a membrane and then hybridized with a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f1">1</xref>) containing the first four exons of <italic>mSgy</italic>. As expected for a single copy gene with the restriction sites indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f1">1</xref>, each of the five enzymes tested released a single intense band (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f3">3</xref>). Digestion with either <italic>Bgl</italic>II or <italic>Eco</italic>RI released a single intense band that must have resulted from the <italic>Bgl</italic>II and <italic>Eco</italic>RI restriction sites upstream of <italic>mSgy</italic> and unidentified <italic>Bgl</italic>II and <italic>Eco</italic>RI sites downstream of the probe. Digestion with either <italic>Bam</italic>HI or <italic>Pst</italic>I released the expected fragments of &#x0223c;2 and &#x0223c;3.6 kb, respectively, resulting from one internal restriction site and one upstream external site. Additional fragments that might have been expected with <italic>Pst</italic>I and <italic>Bam</italic>HI from downstream unidentified restriction sites were not observed, presumably because the fragments produced lacked sufficient overlap with the probe. For example, <italic>Hin</italic>dIII released a strong &#x0223c;5 kb fragment that resulted from the <italic>Hin</italic>dIII site within <italic>mSgy</italic> and the next unidentified <italic>Hin</italic>dIII site downstream of <italic>mSgy</italic>, as well as a faint &#x0223c;0.8 kb fragment that resulted from the internal <italic>Hin</italic>dIII site and the next <italic>Hin</italic>dIII site upstream. This band was faint, presumably because it only partially overlapped with the probe. These results revealed that <italic>mSgy</italic> is a single copy gene that lies just upstream of <italic>mTEAD-2</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Translation start sites for <italic>mSgy</italic></title><p>Analysis of the <italic>mSgy</italic> cDNA sequence using the ATG program (http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.hri.co.jp&#x0002f;atgpr&#x0002f; ) selected the first methionine of the open reading frame as the most likely translation start site, although sequences surrounding this ATG deviated from the Kozak consensus sequence 4 nt downstream (&#x0002b;108), where a T was found instead of a G (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f2">2</xref>). Therefore, it was possible that translation of this gene actually began further downstream. In fact, the ATG program suggested that Met66 and Met85 could also act as translation start sites. Therefore, to determine which Met codon is the primary translation initiation site, different fragments of the <italic>mSgy</italic> cDNA were translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Nucleotides 1&#x02013;834, containing the complete <italic>mSgy</italic> coding sequence, produced a protein of &#x0223c;30 kDa as well as two minor proteins of &#x0223c;23 and &#x0223c;21 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f4">4</xref>). The 30 kDa protein, initiated at Met1, accounted for &#x0223c;75&#x00025; of the total mSGY protein synthesized. Nucleotides 233&#x02013;834 (beginning with Met66) efficiently produced only the two smaller proteins and nt 318&#x02013;834 (beginning with Met85) produced only the smallest of the three proteins, confirming that all three Met codons could act as translational start sites. The amount of protein produced when the first two Met codons were deleted increased dramatically, consistent with the fact that the third Met codon matched a perfect Kozak consensus sequence and therefore resulted in efficient translation in the absence of upstream Met codons. Thus, in agreement with the scanning model of translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c13">13</xref>), the primary translation initiation site is at the first Met codon, although secondary translation initiation events can also occur at either of the next two downstream Met codons, but at a reduced frequency.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription start sites for <italic>mSgy</italic></title><p>Transcription initiation sites for <italic>mSgy</italic> were mapped by primer extension analysis of RNA using the 5&#x02032;-end of the cDNA sequence as a reference point.

No &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;DNA fragments were detected when the primer extension reaction was carried out either in the absence of RNA or with RNA from mouse F9 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f5">5</xref>), which do not express <italic>mSgy</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f8">8</xref>). In contrast, eight &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;DNA fragments were detected when mouse testis RNA was used as the substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f5">5</xref>). One fragment began at the same G residue in the antisense strand that had been detected by the 5&#x02032;-RACE reaction that generated this cDNA. However, most initiation events occurred 86&#x02013;95 bp upstream of the first Met codon (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Regulatory sequences for <italic>mSgy</italic></title><p>As the first step towards identifying sequences that regulate <italic>mSgy</italic> transcription, sequences upstream of <italic>mSgy</italic> were tested for their ability to promote expression of a plasmid-encoded reporter gene following transfection of mouse cells. Various DNA fragments from the <italic>mSgy</italic> upstream region were cloned 67 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the firefly luciferase gene. These luciferase plasmids were then co-transfected into mouse cells together with another plasmid containing the &#x003b2;-galactosidase gene driven by the CMV promoter. The level of luciferase activity in each assay was then corrected for differences in transfection efficiency by normalizing it to a constant level of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity. The results were expressed as stimulation above the level of luciferase activity observed in the absence of a promoter. SV40 T antigen promoter activity observed in each experiment (also normalized to &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity) was used as a standard for comparing results from several independent experiments. The effects of these sequences on luciferase gene activity was examined in four established mouse cell lines, of which only EL4 expressed its endogenous <italic>mSgy</italic> gene (described below).</p><p>The &#x0223c;2.5 kb region (&#x0002b;77 to &#x02013;2485) upstream of the <italic>mSgy</italic> gene stimulated luciferase expression 4- to 6-fold in the <italic>mSgy</italic>&#x000a0;non-expressing cell lines F9, TM3 and TM4, consistent with the presence of a promoter in this region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f6">6</xref>). However, as sequences were deleted progressively from the &#x02013;2485 terminus, promoter activity increased to a level of 15- to 25-fold above background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f6">6</xref>). These levels were within &#x000b1;2-fold of the levels observed with the SV40 T antigen promoter in the same cells using the same assay (data not shown), suggesting that <italic>mSgy</italic> promoter elements lie between nt &#x0002b;77 and &#x02013;894. Sequences further upstream repress this promoter activity. In support of this conclusion, this repression was relieved in mouse EL4 cells when sequences in the vicinity of &#x02013;1344 to &#x02013;2485 were present (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f6">6</xref>). Since EL4 cells express their endogenous <italic>mSgy</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f8">8</xref>), they appear to contain a transacting factor that can bind to this region and relieve the repression induced by sequences in the vicinity of &#x02013;875 to &#x02013;894.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of <italic>mSgy</italic> mRNA</title><p>The general expression pattern for <italic>mSgy</italic> in the adult mouse was determined by blotting&#x02013;hybridization of RNA from various adult mouse tissues using <sup>32</sup>P-labeled DNA probes specific either for <italic>mSgy</italic> or &#x003b2;<italic>-actin</italic> mRNA. In adult mouse tissues <italic>mSgy</italic> mRNA was detected as a single major species of &#x0223c;1.3 kb that was present only in the testis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f7">7</xref>A and B). In mouse embryos <italic>mSgy</italic> mRNA was not detected until day 15 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f7">7</xref>). Since sexual differentiation in mice begins around day 13, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization was carried out on 13-day-old embryos in an effort to identify cells that first express the <italic>mSgy</italic> gene. However, although <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> mRNA was detected in this analysis, <italic>mSgy</italic> mRNA was not (data not shown). These data suggest that expression of <italic>mSgy</italic> begins after sexual differentiation occurs and that it is expressed only in the testis, consistent with the fact that the <italic>mSgy</italic> gene was identified from an expressed sequence tag library prepared from mouse testis.</p><p>Blotting&#x02013;hybridization for <italic>mSgy</italic> mRNA was also used to determine if <italic>mSgy</italic> was expressed in established mouse cell lines. F9 embryonal carcinoma cells are pluripotent stem cells that can be stimulated to differentiate into parietal endoderm. TM3 cells were derived from testicular Leydig cells. TM4 cells were derived from testicular Sertoli cells. EL4 cells were established from a carcinogen-induced lymphoma. <italic>mSgy</italic> RNA was detected only in EL4 cells, where the level of <italic>mSgy</italic> expression was &#x0223c;100-fold less than in mouse testis, as judged by the relative amounts of RNA applied to each gel lane and by the ratio of <italic>mSgy</italic> mRNA to &#x003b2;<italic>-actin</italic> mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f8">8</xref>).</p><p>To identify the specific cell types that express the <italic>mSgy</italic> gene within the testis, <italic>mSgy</italic> mRNA was detected by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization using the entire <italic>mSgy</italic> cDNA as probe. <italic>mSgy</italic> mRNA was abundant in all of the seminiferous tubules in the testis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f9">9</xref>A), where it was specifically associated with the developing spermatocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f9">9</xref>B and C). <italic>mSgy</italic> mRNA was absent from the darkly staining spermatogonia that line the basement membrane of the tubules, as well as from the mature spermatids that lie in the center of the tubules. Although Sertoli and Leydig cells cannot be identified with certainty in these sections, <italic>mSgy</italic> RNA was not detected by blotting&#x02013;hybridization in either TM3 cells (derived from Leydig cells) or TM4 cells (derived from Sertoli cells) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f8">8</xref>). Therefore, <italic>mSgy</italic> appears to be expressed exclusively in developing spermatocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> mRNA</title><p>The general expression pattern for <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> in the adult mouse was determined by blotting&#x02013;hybridization of the same RNA samples used above to detect <italic>mSgy</italic> and &#x003b2;<italic>-actin</italic>. Both the major &#x0223c;2.4 kb and the minor &#x0223c;4.2 kb <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> RNA species were present in all of the adult tissues examined, albeit at significantly different levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f7">7</xref>A and B). In contrast to <italic>mSgy</italic> RNA, <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> RNA was easily detected in F9, TM3 and TM4 cells, but not in EL4 cells or mouse testis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f8">8</xref>), suggesting that only one of these two genes was expressed in a particular cell type.</p><p>Previously reported blotting&#x02013;hybridization of RNA samples from adult mouse tissues concluded that <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> was expressed in the adult testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c4">4</xref>). These data were collected using a pre-made northern blot of mouse tissue RNA samples purchased from Clontech; the same results were obtained using a new blot purchased from the same company (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f7">7</xref>A). However, the amount of <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> RNA in a sample of mouse testis RNA purchased from Clontech was &#x0223c;10-fold less (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f7">7</xref>B). This was not a hybridization artifact, because it was reproducible in several independent trials and the ratio of <italic>mSgy</italic> RNA to <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><italic>-actin</italic> RNA was essentially the same in all testis RNA samples. Therefore, the testis RNA used in the pre-made tissue blots from Clontech appeared to be contaminated with <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> RNA from another tissue.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, tissue slices through mouse testis were subjected to <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization using a probe specific for <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> mRNA. The results confirmed that <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> was expressed poorly in testis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f10">10</xref>A), particularly when compared with <italic>mSgy</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f9">9</xref>A). Moreover, closer examination of seminiferous tubules failed to identify <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> expression in any particular cell type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f10">10</xref>C and E). Therefore, we conclude that <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> is expressed poorly, if at all, in those cells that strongly express the <italic>mSgy</italic> gene.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Several promoters have been identified in mammals that function bi-directionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c14">14</xref> and references therein). In each case, the two antipodal genes are coordinately expressed and their gene products either have similar functions or participate in the same metabolic pathway. The data presented here reveal the first example, to our knowledge, of two antipodal mammalian genes whose regulatory sequences lie in close proximity but whose expression patterns differ dramatically. <italic>mSgy</italic> is a single copy gene that lies 3.8 kb upstream from <italic>mTEAD-2</italic>, which has been mapped to chromosome 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c15">15</xref>). <italic>mSgy</italic> is transcribed in the opposite direction from <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> and its regulatory sequences occupy &#x0003e;50&#x00025; of the intergenic region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f1">1</xref>). Remarkably, results from RNA blotting&#x02013;hybridization and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analyses revealed that <italic>mSgy</italic> and <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> were differentially regulated both temporally and spatially. <italic>mSgy</italic> was expressed late during embryonic development and then only in the spermatocytes of the adult testis. <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> was expressed at the very beginning of mouse development and then later in a variety of adult tissues, but little, if at all, in the testis. Moreover, cell lines that expressed one of these genes did not express the other. Thus, the <italic>mSgy</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>mTEAD-2</italic> locus provides a unique paradigm for differential regulation of gene expression during mammalian development.</p><p>This regulation likely involves positive as well as negative transcriptional modulators that specifically affect each gene. The promoter&#x0002f;enhancer region for the <italic>mSgy</italic> gene was localized to nt &#x0002b;77 to &#x02013;894. Levels of promoter activity of 4- to 6-fold above background were observed with sequences proximal to the transcription start sites (&#x0002b;77 to &#x02013;429). However, addition of sequences from &#x02013;429 to &#x02013;875 increased promoter activity to 15- to 25-fold above background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f6">6</xref>), comparable to the activity observed using the SV40 T antigen promoter. Surprisingly, in cells that do not express their endogenous <italic>mSgy</italic> gene (F9, TM3 and TM4), further extension of this region resulted in decreasing levels of promoter activity, suggesting that the region between &#x02013;875 and &#x02013;2485 contained sequences that repressed the <italic>mSgy</italic> promoter. In contrast, in cells that do express their endogenous <italic>mSgy</italic> gene (EL4), promoter activity resided between &#x0002b;77 and &#x02013;645. Extension of this region to &#x02013;894 resulted in repression of promoter activity, while further extension relieved this repression. Therefore, cells that express the <italic>mSgy</italic> gene appear to harbor the same repression mechanism for <italic>mSgy</italic> that exists in non-producing cells, except that <italic>mSgy</italic>-producing cells appear to relieve this repression by producing a factor that interacts with sequences in the vicinity of &#x02013;1344 to &#x02013;2485.</p><p>Previous analysis of <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> transcription by S1 nuclease protection and primer extension revealed multiple transcription initiation sites and the absence of a TATAA consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c15">15</xref>). Similarly, transcription of <italic>mSgy</italic> produced a single &#x0223c;1.3 kb RNA that began at several different nucleotide locations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f5">5</xref>). Some initiation events occurred at nt &#x0002b;1 in the cDNA sequence, as expected, and some as far away as nt &#x0002b;39, but most initiation events occurred from nt &#x0002b;12 to &#x0002b;19, consistent with the fact that a TATAA consensus sequence was not present in or around this region. Therefore, both the <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> and <italic>mSgy</italic> genes are driven by a TATA-less promoter.</p><p>Since these two genes are transcribed in opposite directions, their regulatory sequences must lie in close proximity. In fact, results from transient expression assays, like the ones used here to define the <italic>mSgy</italic> promoter region, reveal that the <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> regulatory region lies within the <italic>Spe</italic>I&#x02013;<italic>Pst</italic>I DNA fragment that overlaps the transcription start site for <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f1">1</xref>; K.Kaneko, unpublished results). Therefore, one might expect <italic>mSgy</italic> and <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> to share a common pattern of expression, similar to previous reports where two neighboring genes that are driven by a single bi-directional promoter appear to be regulated coordinately. However, the expression patterns for <italic>mSgy</italic> and <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> were strikingly different.</p><p>Taken together, the results from RNA blotting&#x02013;hybridization and RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization reveal that the spatial and temporal patterns of expression for <italic>mSgy</italic> differ dramatically from those for <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> and suggest that mouse cells can express either <italic>mSgy</italic> or <italic>mTEAD-2</italic>, but not both. <italic>mSgy</italic> expression does not begin until about day 15 of embryonic development (2&#x000a0;days after sex differentiation begins) and then appears to be confined exclusively to developing spermatocytes in the seminiferous tubules of the adult testis. Several studies of mammalian spermatogenesis have shown that RNA synthesis occurs primarily in primary spermatocytes during the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c16">16</xref>). In contrast, <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> transcription begins at the four- to eight-cell stage of pre-implantation development (2 days after fertilization) and then continues to be expressed in various adult tissues such as heart, lung, muscle and kidney. The amount of <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> mRNA in testis was minimal to non-detectable. The original RNA blotting&#x02013;hybridization results using a commercial blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f7">7</xref>A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c4">4</xref>) revealed significant levels of <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> expression in testis, but subsequent RNA blotting&#x02013;hybridization of independent samples of testis RNA revealed little <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> expression when poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA was used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f7">7</xref>B) and no <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> expression when total RNA was used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f8">8</xref>). These conclusions were confirmed by <italic>in situ</italic> RNA hybridization of thin sections through testis in which cell-specific <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> expression was not detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f10">10</xref>), particularly in comparison with <italic>mSgy</italic> expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f9">9</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that <italic>mSgy</italic> and <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> are not expressed in the same cell types. Since <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> is expressed strongly in ovaries where most of its mRNA is confined to the granulosa cells within the ovarian follicles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f7">7</xref>B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c4">4</xref>), it is possible that <italic>mSgy</italic> is involved in the production of sperm while <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> is involved in the production of oocytes.</p><p>The close proximity of the regulatory regions of <italic>mSgy</italic> and <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> underscores the fact that regulators of their respective transcriptions do not interfere with one another. This is dramatically revealed in developing spermatocytes, where <italic>mSgy</italic> is strongly expressed while <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> expression is barely detectable (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f10">10</xref>). One possible mechanism of how this is achieved is through the existence of insulator-like sequences between the two genes. Insulator sequences isolate genes from controlling elements in adjacent genes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c17">17</xref>). For example, the &#x0223c;8 kb region that separates the <italic>iab</italic>-7 and <italic>iab</italic>-8 regulatory regions within the bithorax complex allow those regulatory regions to function autonomously in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c18">18</xref>). Recently, Alu&#x0002f;B1 elements have been reported to exert position-independent and copy number-dependent expression on heterologous transgenes in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c19">19</xref>), suggesting that Alu&#x0002f;B1 elements can act as insulators. Since several Alu&#x0002f;B1 elements are found in the 3.8 kb region between the <italic>mSgy</italic> and <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd546f1">1</xref>), they may allow these two closely linked genes to be differentially expressed.</p><p>Although the function of the mSGY protein is not known, its partial homology to the <italic>Dickkopf</italic> (<italic>Dkk</italic>) gene family suggests that it may function as an inhibitor of Wnt proteins. Wnt proteins are a vertebrate family of secreted glycoproteins that mediate cell proliferation and fate determination in both adults and embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c20">20</xref>). Dkk is a family of secreted proteins that antagonize Wnt function by binding to Wnt proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c8">8</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>mWnt-1</italic>, like <italic>mSgy</italic>, is expressed only in the developing spermatocytes of testis in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd546c21">21</xref>), suggesting that <italic>mSgy</italic> may be involved in regulation of Wnt function during spermatogenesis. However, if the same pattern of <italic>mSgy</italic> translation occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> as it does <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>mSgy</italic> mRNA may produce both secreted and non-secreted forms of the protein, each of which may have a distinct function.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd546f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The 10 kb region encompassing the 5&#x02032;-ends of the mouse <italic>mSgy</italic> and <italic>mTEAD-2</italic> genes.
