However, the precise mechanisms that drive AHR remain unclear. We identified a novel subset of natural killer T (NKT) cells that expresses the interleukin 17 receptor B (IL-17RB) for IL-25 (also known as IL-17E) and is essential for the induction of AHR. IL-17RB is preferentially expressed on a fraction of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells but not on other splenic leukocyte populations tested.

Indeed, overexpression of these Th2 cytokines results in the development of AHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). However, efforts to ameliorate experimental asthma with antibodies against Th2 cytokines have generally proven unsuccessful. Among these, only IL-13 seems to be a key cytokine responsible for goblet cell hyperplasia, airway remodeling, and AHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), because inhibition of IL-13 activity, but not that of other Th2 cytokines, by a blocking antibody suppresses both AHR and airway inflammation.</p><p>IL-25 (also known as IL-17E), a member of the structurally related IL-17 cytokine family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), has recently been reported to be produced by activated Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) and mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), resulting in enhancement of AHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Administration of a blocking antibody against IL-25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) or IL-25&#x02013;deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) eliminates Th2 responses. Conversely, systemic expression of either human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>) or mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) IL-25, or administration of recombinant IL-25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), induces Th2-type immune responses, including increased serum IgE levels, blood eosinophilia, and pathological changes in the lung and other tissues. These findings clearly demonstrate a pivotal role of IL-25 as a mediator of Th2 responses, suggesting that IL-25 lies upstream of the classical Th2 cytokine responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>).</p><p>NKT cells characterized by the expression of an invariant antigen receptor encoded by <italic>V&#x003b1;14J&#x003b1;18</italic> in mice or <italic>V&#x003b1;24J&#x003b1;18</italic> in humans are also involved in the development of asthma, because NKT cell&#x02013;deficient J&#x003b1;18<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice fail to develop antigen-induced AHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Th2 cells are not always essential for NKT cell&#x02013;mediated AHR development, because activation of NKT cells induces AHR in the absence of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in <italic>MHC class II</italic>&#x02013;deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). These findings suggest that NKT cells are directly involved in the development of AHR independent of Th2 responses in some conditions. In this report, we investigated the role of IL-25 in NKT cell&#x02013;dependent AHR induction in mouse models and found that IL-17RB, a receptor for IL-25, was selectively expressed on a fraction of mouse NKT cells, which preferentially produced IL-13 and induced the development of AHR upon stimulation with IL-25.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>We first investigated the role of IL-25 in the development of AHR in relation to NKT cells because of previous findings that IL-25 induces Th2-biased responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). The receptor for IL-25, termed IL-17RB or EVI27/IL-17BR, was originally found to bind IL-17B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Interestingly, however, the receptor binds IL-25 with higher affinity than IL-17B. Therefore, this receptor is now termed IL-17RB/IL-25R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). To identify mouse IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, we generated specific mAbs (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080698/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080698/DC1</ext-link>) by immunization with a recombinant IL-17RB&#x02013;Ig fusion protein (Fig. S2). We first investigated IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the spleen by mouse IL-17RB mAb to confirm the previous findings that IL-17RB expression is detected on a fraction of non&#x02013;B/non&#x02013;T (NBNT), c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, Fc&#x003b5;RI<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells in the mesenteric lymph node (Fig. S3), which has identified as IL-4&#x02013;, IL-5&#x02013;, IL-13&#x02013;producing cells in response to IL-25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). NKT cells were distinct from the NBNT c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells based on the expression of c-kit<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, Fc&#x003b5;RI<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, V&#x003b1;14-J&#x003b1;18<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transcripts detected by RT-PCR (Fig. S4). Moreover, IL-17RB was preferentially expressed on a fraction of &#x003b1;-galactosylceramide (&#x003b1;-GalCer)/CD1d dimer<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells but not on other cell types, including NBNT c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, &#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, CD19<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells, CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs, DX5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells, or noninvariant NKT cells in the spleen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Phenotypic and gene expression profiles of splenic IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells.</bold> (A) Identification of IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from BALB/c mice.

Based on our current understanding, NKT cells are divided into two populations based on CD4/CD8 expression: a CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and a CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> double-negative (DN) population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Using an IL-17RB mAb, we found that one third of the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> but none of the DN NKT cells expressed IL-17RB, indicating the existence of three subpopulations: DN, IL-17RB<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, and IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Moreover, the majority of IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells were dimly positive for CD69 and CD122 compared with brightly positive DN NKT and IL-17RB<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The expression level of CD62L by IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells was low, comparable to that on IL-17RB<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells and similar to that of conventional memory T cells, whereas it was quite high on DN NKT cells. In addition, IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells (3%), like IL-17RB<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells (11%), barely expressed an NK receptor, NKG2D, which was highly expressed on the majority (&#x0003e;60%) of DN NKT cells, suggesting their cytotoxic nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p><p>To investigate cytokine and chemokine gene expression profiles on IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells, we performed quantitative real-time PCR using primer sets as shown in Table S1 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080698/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080698/DC1</ext-link>). The expression of the Th2 chemokine receptor <italic>CCR4</italic> was several times higher on IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells than on the other subsets, whereas no significant differences were found in <italic>CXCR6</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), which is important for NKT cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). The results are consistent with the previous findings that NKT cells require CCR4 to localize to the airways and to induce AHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><p>Concerning cytokine production of IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells, it is reported that NKT cells produce both Th1 and Th2 cytokines at the same time upon stimulation with their ligand, &#x003b1;-GalCer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Surprisingly, IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells expressed lower levels of Th1-related transcripts, such as <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;</italic>, <italic>T-bet</italic>, <italic>Stat4</italic>, <italic>IL-18R&#x003b2;</italic>, and <italic>IL-12R&#x003b2;2</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), whereas higher levels of the Th2-related transcript <italic>IL-4</italic> were detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). In contrast, transcripts for cytotoxic effector molecules, such as <italic>Granzyme</italic>, <italic>Perforin</italic>, and <italic>killer receptors</italic> (<italic>KIRa1</italic>, <italic>KIRc1</italic>, <italic>KIRd1</italic>, and <italic>KIRg1)</italic>, were expressed mainly in DN NKT cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>), supporting the previous findings that DN NKT but not CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells predominantly mediate antitumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) and also that NKG2D was predominantly expressed on DN NKT cells, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>. The expression levels of <italic>IL-17A</italic> and <italic>ROR&#x003b3;t</italic> transcripts in IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells, which are high in Th17 cells, were lower than those in DN NKT cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>). These results on surface phenotypes and mRNA expression profiles clearly indicate that IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells are Th2-type NKT cells and are distinct from other NKT cells, such as DN NKT cells or IL-17&#x02013;producing NKT cells.</p><p>Next, we analyzed the function of IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells in response to IL-25 in vitro. IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT but not CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> IL-17RB<sup>&#x02212;</sup> nor DN NKT cells responded to IL-25 in a dose-dependent manner only in the presence of APCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), which is similar to previous findings on the requirement of two signals, such as IL-12 and CD1d on APCs for IFN-&#x003b3; production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) and for IL-21 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), in NKT cell activation. Under these conditions, IL-25&#x02013;activated IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells mainly produced IL-13, along with modest production of IL-4, but barely produced IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Moreover, IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells produced Th2 chemokines such as thymus and activation-regulated chemokine/CCL17, macrophage-derived chemokine/CCL22, and C10/CCL6 as well as eosinophil chemotactic factor&#x02013;L (ECF-L) upon stimulation with IL-25 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). These results indicate that IL-25 triggers IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells to preferentially produce the IL-13, Th2 chemokines, and ECF-L important for recruitment of eosinophils.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Properties of splenic IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells.</bold> (A and B) Proliferation (A) and cytokine production (B) of DN, IL-17RB<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, and IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells.

Because high expression of <italic>ROR&#x003b3;t</italic> is one of the markers for Th17 cells, low expression of <italic>ROR&#x003b3;t</italic> in IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>) indicates that IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells are distinct from IL-17&#x02013;producing NKT cells.

Intriguingly, IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells were fairly abundant in Th2-prone BALB/c and DBA2/cr mice but were barely detectable in Th1-prone C57BL/6 and C3H/HeN mice (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080698/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080698/DC1</ext-link>).

Under these conditions, the mice failed to develop AHR. When the mice were subsequently treated with IL-25 instead of PBS, they developed AHR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). In contrast, even after treatment with IL-25, NKT cell&#x02013;deficient J&#x003b1;18<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice failed to develop significant AHR, comparable to that seen in the PBS-treated control mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Unlike WT mice, J&#x003b1;18<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice treated with IL-25 significantly reduced numbers of airway macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in the lung (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>).</p><p>Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the lung tissue of IL-25&#x02013;treated WT mice revealed that the levels of infiltration of inflammatory mononuclear cells into the peribronchiolar region were higher in WT mice with severe tissue destruction compared with those in J&#x003b1;18<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. No inflammatory cell infiltration was detected in untreated WT or J&#x003b1;18<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>).

To further investigate the effects on allergic responses mediated by IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells, we examined cytokine production in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of IL-25&#x02013;treated WT or J&#x003b1;18<sup>&#x02212;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;</sup> mice and controls. The production of IL-5 and IL-13, which plays a crucial role in the recruitment of eosinophils and Th2 cells, respectively, were detected only in IL-25&#x02013;treated WT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref>). Even though IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells did not produce IL-5 upon IL-25 stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>), they produced ECF-L (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>), which is important for the recruitment of eosinophils producing IL-5. These results strongly suggest that IL-25 acts directly on NKT cells and induces AHR.</p><p>We then investigated whether IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells are involved in the development of IL-25&#x02013;dependent AHR, and we depleted IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells with 3H8 IL-17RB mAb. Among the NKT cell populations, the majority of IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells were &#x003b1;-GalCer/CD1d dimer<sup>hi</sup> TCR&#x003b2;<sup>hi</sup>, indicating that the expression level of TCR&#x003b1; and TCR&#x003b2; on IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells was higher than that on other IL-17RB<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NKT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT depletion persisted for at least 5 d after 3H8 IL-17RB mAb injection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>), whereas no effects were detected on other cell types, such as CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T, &#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T, and NBNT c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080698/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080698/DC1</ext-link>).

The cell transfer of IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells, but not IL-17RB<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NKT cells nor PBS alone, restored AHR induced by OVA plus IL-25, indicating that IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells in the lung are functionally equivalent to those in the spleen. In addition, when equal numbers of cells were transferred, the severity of AHR induced by enriched IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells was almost three times higher than the total spleen NKT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>), consistent with the ratio of IL-17RB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NKT cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).
