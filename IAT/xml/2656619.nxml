We used zebrafish as a model organism to study the functions of Ka/Ks-predicted novel human exons, which were identified from a comparative evolutionary genomics analysis.</p><p>In this study, a novel gene, designated as <italic>puf-A</italic>, was cloned and functionally characterized, and its homologs in zebrafish, mouse, and human were identified as one of the three homolog clusters which were consisted of 14 related proteins with Puf repeats. Computer modeling of human Puf-A structure and a pull-down assay for interactions with RNA targets predicted that it was a RNA-binding protein. Specifically, Puf-A contained a special six Puf-repeat domain, which constituted a unique superhelix half doughnut-shaped Puf domain with a topology similar to, but different from the conventional eight-repeat Pumilio domain. <italic>Puf-A</italic> transcripts were uniformly distributed in early embryos, but became restricted primarily to eyes and ovaries at a later stage of development. In mice, <italic>puf-A</italic> expression was detected primarily in retinal ganglion and pigmented cells. Knockdown of <italic>puf-A</italic> in zebrafish embryos resulted in microphthalmia, a small head, and abnormal primordial germ-cell (PGC) migration. The latter was confirmed by microinjecting into embryos <italic>puf-A</italic> siRNA containing <italic>nanos</italic> 3&#x02032; UTR that expressed in PGC only. The importance of Puf-A in the maturation of germline stem cells was also implicated by its unique expression in the most primitive follicles (stage I) in adult ovaries, followed by a sharp decline of expression in later stages of folliculogenesis. Taken together, our study shows that <italic>puf-A</italic> plays an important role not only in eye development, but also in PGC migration and the specification of germ cell lineage. These studies represent an exemplary implementation of a unique platform to uncover unknown function(s) of human genes and their roles in development regulation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Comparing human and mouse/rat genomic sequences, Nekrutenko <italic>et al</italic>. predicted new human protein-coding exons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004980-Nekrutenko1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This approach takes advantage of the fact that in coding regions, synonymous substitutions occur much more frequently than non-synonymous ones.

When we started this study, 4,768 of the originally predicted new exons were already recognized as genes or pseudogenes, so we used the remaining 8,943 potential novel human exons to search for zebrafish orthologs in a zebrafish database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/</ext-link>). From this <italic>in silico</italic> analysis, we found 308 potential genes that had yet no defined biological function (unpublished data). In this study, we chose a novel <italic>puf-A</italic> gene from the 308 potential genes to characterize its function in zebrafish, mouse, and human.</p><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) has become a favorite vertebrate model for genetic and developmental studies due to its attributes such as a small body size, rapid development, frequent reproductive cycles (1&#x0223c;2 weeks), short maturation period (3 months), large-scale genetic screening, and easy maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004980-Fishman1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Puf proteins have been found in various organisms, including yeast, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, mouse, and human, but their function is largely unclear. The first Puf protein, Pumilio, identified from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, was known to repress translation of <italic>hunchback</italic> mRNA in the posterior half of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, thereby permitting abdominal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004980-Murata1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, compared with human related proteins in the other two categories, human Puf-A and human C14orf21 showed no significant similarity and human Puf-A and Pumilio (PUM1) shared only 21&#x00025; identity in the aligned 241 amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004980-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004980-t001">Table 1</xref>).

In this study, the zebrafish was used as a model for analyzing the structure and functions of a novel gene, <italic>puf-A</italic>. This has proved to be an efficient strategy for a detailed analysis of the function of a gene. This approach provides an outstanding platform for understanding the functions of novel genes and their roles in controlling development of an organ or organism.</p><p>It was found that the <italic>puf-A</italic> gene was primarily expressed in the eyes and ovaries and to a lesser degree in the brain and kidneys of adult zebrafish. In the eyes of adult zebrafish and mice, the Puf-A protein was mainly expressed in retina ganglion cells. During embryogenesis, the formation of retinal neurons follows a phylogenetically conserved order, and all six retinal neuron types are generated from common multipotent progenitors, with retinal ganglion cells being the first neurons to occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004980-Cepko1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004980-Vetter1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, zebrafish morphants of 3- and 5-dpf embryos showed incomplete differentiation patterns in the retina, suggesting that the Puf-A protein may have important roles in the development of retinal progenitors.</p><p>Additionally, during embryonic development, knockdown of the <italic>puf-A</italic> gene led to a reduction in the number of PGCs and their abnormal migration, suggesting that Puf-A is involved in the maintenance and migration of these primitive germ cells. The adult zebrafish ovary is a useful vertebrate model to study oocyte development and its regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004980-Raz1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, the expression of <italic>puf-A</italic> was predominantly in stage I follicles in adult ovaries and became undetectable in stage II and III follicles during subsequent oocyte development. It was noted that the most primitive germline stem cells, oogonia, were not readily distinguishable from stage I follicles. Thus, the transition of oogonia into stage I follicles was not investigated in this study. Taken together, these findings indicated that in zebrafish Puf-A not only regulates PGC development but may also play a role in germline stem cells up to stage I follicles.</p><p>In total, 14 puf-related proteins of zebrafish, mice, and humans were identified by the SMART server. The Puf-A in this study with its newly identified roles in eyes and PGCs corresponds to the zebrafish LOC394185, mouse D19Bwg1357e, and human KIAA0020. There are three groups of Puf-related proteins: the Puf-A homolog cluster, the C14orf21 homolog cluster, and the PUM1/PUM2 homolog cluster. The Puf-A and C14orf21 homologs could be separated into two homolog clusters and the proteins of their members were similar to each other within the same cluster, but easily distinguishable from members of the other clusters. For example, the Puf-As in humans, mice, or zebrafish were similar to each other, but showed only &#x0223c;21&#x00025; identity with the human Pumilio (PUM1) protein. In the PUM1/PUM2 homolog cluster, there are more than one member proteins in each animal species, especially in zebrafish (six homologous genes in the PUM1/PUM2 cluster have been annotated, but await further characterizations of their proteins).</p><p>The Puf family proteins are characterized by their tandem Puf repeats with &#x0223c;35&#x02013;39 amino acids in each repeat. Each repeat consists of three &#x003b1;-helixes, which bind to its RNA recognition residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004980-Wang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. A typical RNA recognition motif such as the Pumilio homolog domain usually contains eight tandem Puf repeats. Our computer modeling indicated that the Puf domain of the Puf-A homologs in humans, mice, zebrafish and yeast (data not shown) consists of six Puf repeats and the topographic characteristics predicted it to be a new RNA binding protein. Furthermore, using a pull-down assay, we had found potential RNA targets for puf-A bindings, conceivably leading to the suppression of target gene expression. In fact, Puf6p, the homolog protein of puf-A in yeast, was shown to be involved in the repression of ASH1 mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004980-Gu1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This model of human Puf-A also suggested that its Puf domain exhibited a structural feature with six Puf-repeats and a middle region of the Puf domain that mimics exactly two additional Puf repeats. In addition, the asymmetric distribution of the electrostatic potentials of the amino acid side chains on the surfaces of the Puf domain of Puf-A suggests that the concave surface of the domain binds RNA, while the convex face may react with not yet identified interacting proteins such as nanos.</p><p>RNA-binding proteins play important roles in RNA-related cellular processes, including RNA splicing, export, translation, stabilization, and degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004980-Lunde1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004980-Keene1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004980-ColegroveOtero1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

One microliter of the reaction mixture was separated on 10&#x00025; SDS/PAGE, blotted and incubated with streptavidin-AP, followed by development with NBT-BCIP reagents.(B) For in vivo experiment, the puf-A 5&#x02032;-UTR and its partial coding region were added onto pEYFP-N1 plasmid which contained CMV promoter and YFP gene to generate ppuf-A-YFP. Then 4.6 ng of the puf-A-MO1 or puf-A-5mmMO1 was co-injected to embryo with ppuf-A-YFP plasmid at 100 pg per embryo. The numbers of embryo with YFP expression were enumerated at 1dpf. As shown, 15/48 embryos injected puf-A-YFP plasmid exhibited fluorescence at 100 pg/embryo dosage, while none of the 113 embryos co-injected with the puf-A-MO1 had YFP expression. In contrast, co-injection with the mismatch control, puf-A-5mmMO1, did not affect the expression of YFP.
