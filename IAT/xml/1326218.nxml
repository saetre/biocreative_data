The development of an effective therapeutic for EBOV is a daunting public health challenge and is hampered by a paucity of knowledge regarding filovirus pathogenesis. This report describes a successful strategy for interfering with EBOV infection using antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs). A combination of EBOV-specific PMOs targeting sequences of viral mRNAs for the viral proteins (VPs) VP24, VP35, and RNA polymerase L protected rodents in both pre- and post-exposure therapeutic regimens. In a prophylactic proof-of-principal trial, the PMOs also protected 75&#x00025; of rhesus macaques from lethal EBOV infection. The work described here may contribute to development of designer, &#x0201c;druggable&#x0201d; countermeasures for filoviruses and other microbial pathogens.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a highly lethal hemorrhagic fever that results in up to 50&#x00025;&#x02013;90&#x00025; mortality in humans. There are currently no available vaccines or therapeutics to treat EBOV infection. To date, multiple pre- and post-exposure therapeutic strategies, primarily focused on bolstering the host immune response or inhibiting viral replication, have been undertaken with limited success. Here, Bavari and colleagues report the development of a successful therapeutic regimen for EBOV infection based on antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs). PMOs are a subclass of chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides that interfere with the translation of viral mRNA, thus inhibiting viral amplification. Using a cell-free translation system, a cell-based assay, and survival studies in rodents, we identified several efficacious EBOV-specific PMOs. Further, prophylactic administration of a combination of three EBOV-specific PMOs specifically targeting VP24, VP35, and the viral polymerase L protected rhesus macaques from lethal EBOV infection. This is the first successful antiviral intervention against filoviruses in nonhuman primates. These findings may serve as the basis for a new strategy to quickly develop virus-specific therapies in defense against known, emerging, and genetically engineered bioterrorism threats.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Warfield KL, Swenson DL, Olinger GG, Nichols DK, Pratt WD, et al.

These EBOV-specific PMOs demonstrated sequence-specific inhibition when compared with a PMO molecule with a MARV-specific sequence or PMOs containing EBOV-scrambled sequences in a reporter-based in vitro translation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g001">Figure 1</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g001">1</xref>D). No inhibition was observed for the scrambled or nonspecific PMO at up to 10 &#x003bc;M concentration for the EBOV VP24, VP35, or L RNA targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g001">Figure 1</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g001">1</xref>D). To determine whether the EBOV-specific PMOs could reduce viral propagation in vitro, VeroE6 cells were pretreated with the PMOs at a concentration of 20 &#x003bc;M and then infected with a multiplicity of infection of 1. Treatment with the EBOV VP24-, VP35-, or L-specific PMO was able to consistently reduce the viral titers in the EBOV-infected VeroE6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). A combination of the three PMOs also reduced the viral titers in the VeroE6 cells, but did not show an enhanced effect as compared with treatment with any one of the PMOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). In the same assay, the viral titers in the scrambled PMO-treated cells were nearly identical to those observed in untreated VeroE6 cells, and the PMOs did not cause obvious cytotoxicity at concentrations used in this assay (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>EBOV-Specific PMOs Protect Rodents against Lethal EBOV Infection</title><p>To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of the EBOV-specific PMOs, we first determined the survival of mice treated with individual PMOs at 24 h and 4 h before challenge with 1,000 plaque-forming units (pfu) of mouse-adapted EBOV. The three PMOs exhibited a wide range of efficacy against lethal EBOV infection. Both the VP24- and VP35-specific PMOs provided nearly complete protection when the mice were pretreated twice with 500 &#x003bc;g doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g002">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g002">2</xref>B, <italic>p &#x0003c; </italic>0.001 for both VP24 and VP35 PMO treatment versus PBS treatment). In contrast, and despite its strong activity in the cell-free translation assay, the L-specific PMO conferred survival to ~30&#x00025; of treated mice at the 500-&#x003bc;g dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, <italic>p &#x0003d;</italic> 0.5 for both doses of the L PMO compared with PBS-treated mice). As expected, treatment of the mice with a Marburg-specific VP24, VP35, or L PMO did not provide protection against EBOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g002">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g002">2</xref>C). Next, we investigated whether a combination of all these PMOs could further enhance efficacy. We found that when the VP24-, VP35-, and L-specific PMOs were administered together at 24 h and 4 h before lethal EBOV challenge, this resulted in robust protection at all the doses tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, <italic>p &#x0003d;</italic> 0.00001, 0.001, and 0.0136, respectively, for the 500-, 50-, and 5-&#x003bc;g EBOV-specific PMO-treated mice compared with the PBS-treated mice). To investigate the usefulness of the PMO in a post-exposure regimen, mice were treated with a single dose of the three PMOs administered 24 h after EBOV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). The PMO-treated EBOV-infected mice were fully protected at the 500-&#x003bc;g doses, and at lower doses the post-challenge treatment provided enhanced protection (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.00001, 0.0136, and 0.2105, respectively, for the 500-, 50-, and 5-&#x003bc;g PMO-treated mice compared with the PBS-treated mice). Mice receiving a single PMO treatment 4 h before infection showed similar protection (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.00001, 0.237, and 1.0, respectively, for the 500-, 50-, and 5-&#x003bc;g PMO-treated mice compared with the PBS-treated mice). Here, a single dose of PMO at 24 hpi was used and, at the highest concentration, the combination of PMOs completely protected EBOV-infected mice. In this single-dose therapeutic regimen, the lower PMO dosages did not provide complete protection. It may be possible that repeated injections of lower concentrations of EBOV-specific PMOs could provide equivalent protection to fewer administrations of higher amounts. Importantly, multiple injections (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003e; 5) of nonspecific PMOs did not enhance survival of EBOV-infected rodents (unpublished data).</p><p>Examination of tissues 3 d after infection showed that treatment of mice with the combination of EBOV-specific PMOs slowed viral spread compared to mice treated with the scrambled PMO. Infected cells were easily observed in the spleens of the mice treated with the scrambled PMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), whereas few EBOV-infected cells could be found in the spleens of the anti-EBOV PMO-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). By 6 d after viral inoculation, EBOV infection was fulminant in the spleens of both EBOV and scrambled PMO-treated animals (unpublished data) and had spread to the livers of both mice treated with scrambled and combination PMOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g003">Figure 3</xref>C&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g003">3</xref>D). However, the extent of the infection was limited in the EBOV-specific combination PMO-treated mice, and, unlike the scrambled PMO-treated mice, EBOV antigen was not detectable within hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g003">Figure 3</xref>C&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g003">3</xref>D). Viral antigen was not observed in the kidney on day 3; however, on day 6, viral antigen was more readily observed in the kidneys of the scrambled PMO-treated compared with the combination PMO-treated mice (unpublished data). Further, the viral titers in the spleen, liver, and kidney of the PMO-treated, infected animals corroborated the observed pattern of antigen staining within the tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g003">Figure 3</xref>E).</p><p>To determine whether mice treated with the PMOs generated immune responses to EBOV, they were tested for EBOV-specific cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. 4 wk after infection, the mice demonstrated both CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses to multiple EBOV-specific peptides, including NP and VP35 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, unpublished data). They also generated strong serum EBOV-specific antibody responses that were similar to the post-challenge antibody responses of mice protected by a therapeutic vaccine containing Ebola virus-like particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020001-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. To find out if the generated immune responses were protective, PMO-treated mice were rechallenged with another dose of 1,000 pfu of EBOV 4 wk after surviving the initial challenge, and all the mice were completely protected from the second lethal EBOV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.000001).</p><p>To verify the effectiveness of the PMO treatment in another EBOV animal model, we infected guinea pigs with EBOV and treated them with a single dose of the PMO combination either 24 h before or 24 h or 96 h after EBOV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Survival was greatly increased in guinea pigs receiving the treatment 96 h after EBOV infection (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.029, compared with untreated guinea pigs), in contrast to guinea pigs treated 24 h before or after infection (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.5 and 0.227, respectively, compared with untreated guinea pigs). The mean viral titer for each group, measured on 7 dpi, closely mirrored the survival rates observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Results of a logistic regression indicated that reduction of the viral titer had a significant effect on the survival outcome of PMO-treated guinea pigs (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0292). With each log10 reduction in viral titer, there was a 56&#x00025; decrease in the odds of surviving challenge (odds ratio &#x0003d; 0.434). It remains to be determined if administration of multiple or larger PMO doses might have increased the efficacy of the PMO treatments in the guinea pigs.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>PMO Pretreatment Protects Rhesus Monkeys</title><p>Based on the encouraging results both in vitro and in rodents, we designed a small proof-of-concept trial in nonhuman primates. Rhesus monkeys were treated with the VP35 PMO only (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4) or a combination of the VP24, VP35, and L PMOs (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4) from 2 d prior to EBOV infection through day 9 of the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). An initial study tested the efficacy of the VP35 PMO, the compound that exhibited the highest activity in mice. Unfortunately, all of the VP35 PMO-treated monkeys, as well as the untreated control monkey, died within the time-to-death expected for EBOV-infected rhesus macaques (days 7, 7, 8, 8, and 7, respectively). In contrast, treatment of rhesus macaques with a combination of the VP24, VP35, and L PMOs showed substantial efficacy. Two PMO-treated monkeys survived the EBOV challenge with few clinical signs beyond mild depression from days 6&#x02013;9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). A third PMO-treated monkey cleared the EBOV infection and remained aviremic from days 9&#x02013;14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g006">Figure 6</xref>C), but died of a severe bacterial infection, with no evidence of ongoing EBOV infection, on day 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, unpublished data). The fourth PMO-treated monkey succumbed to EBOV infection on day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Three na&#x000ef;ve control monkeys used in this experiment received no treatment and succumbed to EBOV infection on days 7, 9, and 10. Since the VP35 PMO alone did not provide any protection to nonhuman primates, these data suggest that a combination of PMOs is more efficacious than a single-target PMO treatment and also suggests that protection in the combination PMO-treated monkeys is not due to nonspecific effects of PMO administration.</p><p>We were able to identify only a few early clinical signs or laboratory values that correlated with survival. The laboratory tests that most closely predicted survival were viral titers, platelet counts, and liver-associated enzymes in the blood. The monkeys that did not survive infection had detectable virus by day 5, in stark contrast to the PMO-treated monkeys that survived, which had little to no detectable viremia on days 3&#x02013;14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). Both the PMO-treated and na&#x000ef;ve monkeys exhibited thrombocytopenia, although the PMO-treated monkeys that survived did not have platelet counts much below 100,000 at any time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). Similarly, all the monkeys experienced increases in their liver-associated enzyme levels, including alkaline phosphatase. However, the levels in the surviving monkeys did not climb as high as those that succumbed to the infection and returned to normal levels within the month after the EBOV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g006">Figure 6</xref>E, unpublished data).</p><p>No correlation was found between survival and multiple other hematological values, body temperature, serum cytokines (measured by a Human 25-plex kit from Biosource, Camarillo, California, United States), or fibrin degradation products (unpublished data). Importantly, PMO administration did not induce early (0&#x02013;2 dpi) detectable serum IFN, TNF, or other cytokines in the nonhuman primates (unpublished data), indicating that the protection was likely not due to nonspecific effects via induction of innate immunity. Since the surviving PMO-treated monkeys had low to undetectable viremias following infection, we assessed the immune responses of the surviving monkeys.

The data presented here are in line with our working hypothesis that a combination of PMOs that target multiple viral genes can slow EBOV replication, allowing enough time for development of antiviral immune responses and viral clearance.</p><p>Cell-free experiments demonstrated that the EBOV-specific PMOs were efficient at inhibiting EBOV mRNA translation and that MARV-specific PMOs had no effect on translation of corresponding EBOV genes. While the reporter-based in vitro assays appeared to be good indicators of sequence-specific activity of PMOs, it seems that in the case of EBOV, the in vitro translation assays were not fully predictive of the rodent efficacy data. Using VeroE6 cells we showed that EBOV replication was moderately suppressed in cells treated with EBOV-specific PMOs. However, no visible difference was observed when comparing the ability of a single PMO and the combination of three PMOs to reduce viral growth. The PMOs used in these studies were not conjugated with peptides that facilitate cellular uptake. We have observed lower cellular uptake of naked PMOs compared with peptide-conjugated PMOs by Vero E6 cells (unpublished data), and this may explain the moderate inhibition observed in the in vitro replication assay. Nonetheless, the data summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020001-g001">Figure 1</xref> clearly indicate the feasibility of specific gene targeting by unconjugated PMO and the favorable antiviral activity of these compounds.</p><p>Here, we have presented data demonstrating a therapeutic intervention that interferes with viral replication. We hypothesize that the efficacy of this strategy relies on the ability of PMOs, by reducing viral replication, to create a window of opportunity for the immune system to clear the otherwise lethal infection. This approach does not result in sterile protection, as evidenced by the robust anti-EBOV immune responses in the surviving mice and nonhuman primates, and by the mild clinical signs (thrombocytopenia, liver enzyme elevations, depression, and lethargy) observed in the PMO-treated monkeys. It is likely that successful treatment of patients infected with EBOV will require a multifaceted approach consisting of an antiviral, and therapeutics for symptom and disease management &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020001-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020001-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Post-exposure treatment with PMOs was the most efficacious against EBOV in rodents, and, presumably, this is explained by the pharmacokinetic properties of PMO. Following parenteral injection, PMOs are cleared from the bloodstream within hours, but accumulate and remain within tissues such as spleen and liver for days (unpublished data). By administering PMO after challenge, it is likely that higher concentrations were available in the circulation and tissues during the peak of viral replication. Thus, the PMOs may have been able to reduce amplification of EBOV during this critical timeframe, allowing development of appropriate host immune responses to the otherwise lethal viral infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020001-b027">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020001-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. Since effective treatment seemed to require critical timing of PMO administration, and nonhuman primates are highly sensitive to EBOV infection, we decided to both pretreat and administer daily doses of PMOs after viral challenge in the proof-of-concept nonhuman primate studies. While short-term stability in vivo is an unfavorable property for a potential therapeutic, it should be noted that for a deadly acute infection that has only a short period of treatment in the clinic, repeated administration of a life-saving drug is entirely feasible. Along these lines, future studies may show that the pharmacokinetics of PMO can be enhanced by other modifications or alternative routes of administration or regimen to improve efficacy.</p><p>In order to corroborate the in vitro data and narrow down the number of antiviral lead candidates, the EBOV mouse model was an obvious choice for testing multiple candidate PMOs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020001-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. While the mouse model has several differences in pathogenesis compared with EBOV infection of nonhuman primates and humans &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020001-b031">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020001-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, it is widely accepted as an appropriate model for rapid testing of potential antivirals before proceeding to NHP trials. While the differences in the pathology may severely hamper the predictive value of mouse studies using therapeutic strategies that rely on targeting mouse-specific virus&#x02013;host interaction or the pathologic response by rodents, interventions that target viral replication can be evaluated with a high degree of confidence in this model. Antiviral efficacy in rodents may not always be predictive of efficacy in nonhuman primates, although an antiviral compound that is unsuccessful in rodents will most likely also fail in nonhuman primates, justifying initial screening in rodent models.</p><p>We have initiated a drug-discovery strategy to identify &#x0201c;druggable,&#x0201d; efficacious anti-filovirus PMOs. This proof-of-principle study using PMOs demonstrates favorable anti-EBOV activity both in vitro and in vivo; thus, these molecules represent a pool of potential lead compounds for further evaluation and optimization. Future studies will focus on determining the most favorable PMO dose and regimen and also the therapeutic potential of these molecules. Additionally, antisense PMO designed to target other regions within the EBOV genome will be pursued. Genetically designed microbial therapeutics, such as antisense PMOs or other sequence-based approaches, allow quick hit-to-lead optimization and may accelerate time-to-drug development. Together, these strategies could result in a highly efficacious therapeutic treatment regimen for lethal viral infections. Nucleotide-based antivirals, such as PMOs, can be easily produced in large quantities, have already been tested in human clinical trials, and have appropriate safety profiles for use with humans &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020001-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.
