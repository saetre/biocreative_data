However, the signaling pathways that regulate macrophage-induced ADCC are poorly defined. To understand the regulation of macrophage-mediated ADCC, we used human B cell lymphoma coated with Rituximab as the tumor target and murine macrophages primed with IFN&#x003b3; as the effectors. Our data demonstrate that the PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt pathway is activated during macrophage-induced ADCC and that the inhibition of PtdIns 3-kinase results in the inhibition of macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity. Interestingly, downstream of PtdIns 3-kinase, expression of constitutively active Akt (Myr-Akt) in macrophages significantly enhanced their ability to mediate ADCC. Further analysis revealed that in this model, macrophage-mediated ADCC is dependent upon the release of nitric oxide (NO). However, the PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt pathway does not appear to regulate NO production. An examination of the role of the PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt pathway in regulating conjugate formation indicated that macrophages treated with an inhibitor of PtdIns 3-kinase fail to polarize the cytoskeleton at the synapse and show a significant reduction in the number of conjugates formed with tumor targets. Further, inhibition of PtdIns 3-kinase also reduced macrophage spreading on Rituximab-coated surfaces. On the other hand, Myr-Akt expressing macrophages displayed a significantly greater ability to form conjugates with tumor cells. Taken together, these findings illustrate that the PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt pathway plays a critical role in macrophage ADCC through its influence on conjugate formation between macrophages and antibody-coated tumor cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In recent years, monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab and alemtuzumab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Adams1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> have emerged as effective therapeutic agents in the treatment of human malignancies.

Fc&#x003b3;RI and RIII are activating receptors while Fc&#x003b3;RIIb is an inhibitory receptor.

The aim of this study was to identify the signaling pathways that play a crucial role in macrophage response to antibody-coated tumor cells. For this purpose, we have used Rituximab-coated human Burkitt's B cell lymphoma cell line Raji cells as tumor targets. Rituximab is a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody specific for CD20 antigen expressed on B cells. Rituximab has been shown to be effective in the treatment of various forms of B cell malignancies including the aggressive and indolent B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) as well as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Plosker1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. We demonstrate a critical role for the PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt pathway in macrophage mediated ADCC against tumor cells. We first show that IFN&#x003b3; primed macrophages mediate Rituximab-dependent killing of B cell lymphoma. The interaction of macrophages with antibody-coated tumor targets leads to the activation of multiple signaling events including the activation of tyrosine kinases and PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt. Pharmacological inhibition of PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt completely abolished macrophage cytotoxicity indicating that the activation of PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt is critical for macrophage cytotoxicity. Consistent with this, murine peritoneal macrophages expressing overactive Akt (Myr-Akt) showed significantly enhanced ADCC compared to their wild-type counterparts. Further analysis of the role of the PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt pathway in macrophage ADCC reveals that this pathway regulates macrophage cytotoxicity at the level of conjugate formation between the effector macrophages and antibody-coated tumor cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cells, antibodies and reagents</title><p>Raw 264.7 cells and Raji cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5&#x00025; fetal bovine serum.

The surface area occupied by these cells was measured using Morphometry software and showed a significant difference in the areas occupied by DMSO treated cells as opposed to those treated by Ly294002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004208-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). On the other hand, Myr-Akt macrophages occupied a significantly greater surface area as compared to WT macrophages on Rituximab-coated surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004208-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004208-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004208.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>The PtdIns 3-Kinase/Akt pathway enhances the spreading of macrophages on antibody-coated surfaces.</title><p>A.

The PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt pathway was found to be required for efficient conjugate formation as well as spreading of macrophages on antibody-coated surfaces. In the case of NK cells, studies have shown that conjugate formation is a critical step for the lysis of tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Billadeau1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Gismondi1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Our findings similarly indicate that cytoskeletal rearrangements and thereby conjugate formation constitute a pre-requisite for effective cytolysis of antibody-coated tumor cells by monocytes/macrophages as well.</p><p>PtdIns 3-kinase regulates a diverse array of cellular activities such as cell growth, survival, cytoskeletal changes and trafficking of intra-cellular organelles. The activation of PtdIns 3-kinase leads to changes in the actin cytoskeleton through the activation of various downstream proteins. PtdIns 3-kinase-dependent activation of Vav leads to the activation of Rac1 which has been shown to be involved in actin reorganization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Koyasu1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Patel1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. During Fc&#x003b3;R-mediated phagocytosis, our group has demonstrated that activation of Akt downstream of PtdIns 3-kinase up-regulates phagocytic process through the activation of p70S6 kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Ganesan1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Arf6 is reported to be essential for actin assembly during Fc&#x003b3;R-mediated phagocytosis as well as for NK cell ADCC and the activation of Arf6 depends on PtdIns 3-kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Galandrini1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Zhang1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Further it has been shown that PtdIns 3-kinase activity is also involved in the regulation of membrane availability during engulfment of large size particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Cox1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-May1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. In this report, we show that PtdIns 3-kinase activation during macrophage response to antibody-coated tumor cells leads to the activation of Akt and thereby regulates the cytotoxic response at least in part by promoting effective contact between macrophages and tumor cells. In addition to the activation of Akt, PtdIns 3-kinase may also be involved in the regulation of monocyte/macrophage cytotoxicity through its influence on other proteins involved in actin remodeling as discussed earlier. Further studies are required to test the possible involvement of PtdIns 3-kinase with respect to these pathways.</p><p>The role of PtdIns 3-kinase during actin remodeling is well established. However, few studies report the involvement of Akt as a modulator of cytoskeletal changes. Studies in chicken embryonic fibroblasts indicated that activation of Akt by PtdIns 3-kinase induced actin reorganization promoting cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Qian1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. In the same study, authors demonstrated that constitutive activation of Akt was sufficient to activate actin assembly and resulted in increased cell migration even in the presence of Ly294002. A previous study from our group showed that constitutively active Akt increased the phagocytic efficiency of macrophages suggesting that over-active Akt enhances the cytoskeletal rearrangement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Ganesan1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In both studies, it was further demonstrated that Akt stimulates actin cytoskeleton through p70S6 kinase. Interestingly, our findings reported here show that inhibition of p70S6K by rapamycin has no effect on the ability of macrophages to lyse Rituximab-coated B cells. This suggests that Akt can modulate actin assembly in other ways. Recently, it has been shown that Akt directly interacts with actin leading to phoshorylation of actin at Akt consensus sites in Ly294002-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Vandermoere1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Akt has been shown to associate with and phosphorylate yet another protein involved in actin remodeling called Girdin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Enomoto1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>IFN&#x003b3; is known to be a potent activator of macrophage tumoricidal activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Le1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Pace1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The treatment of macrophages with IFN&#x003b3; has been reported to stimulate TNF&#x003b1; and nitric oxide production by macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-Schroder1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004208-RomieuMourez1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data indicate that activation of Fc&#x003b3;R upon IFN&#x003b3; priming results in enhanced TNF&#x003b1; and nitric oxide production. Fc receptor clustering is known to induce TNF&#x003b1; production even in absence of IFN&#x003b3; priming. Thus synergistic increase in TNF&#x003b1; production upon co-stimulation with IFN&#x003b3; and antibody-coated tumor cells was not surprising. However, to our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating enhanced NO production by IFN&#x003b3;-primed macrophages when stimulated further by immune-complexes.</p><p>The inability of IFN&#x003b3;-primed macrophages to lyse B cells in the absence of antibody opsonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004208-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) has several implications. It indicates that Fc&#x003b3;R clustering on macrophages by Rituximab-coated B cells is an important event and contributes to the conjugate formation with tumor cells. The priming of macrophages by IFN&#x003b3; alone leads to the production of nitric oxide, which is essential for the cytotoxicity towards B cells. However, mere release of nitric oxide is not sufficient for cytolysis of B cells if they are not occupied by a specific antibody. The activation of the PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt pathway by antibody-coated tumor cells results in stable ligation of tumor cells with macrophages thereby allowing the killing of targets by nitric oxide.</p><p>Collectively our findings demonstrate a critical role for the PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt pathway in macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity against Rituximab-coated B cell lymphomas. We show that the PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt pathway is required for occupation of greater surface areas on antibody-coated surfaces. Moreover, the formation of efficient cytolytic synapse between macrophages and Rituximab-coated B cells is completely dependent upon the PtdIns 3-kinase/Akt pathway.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The
