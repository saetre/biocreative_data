In addition, Apc plays an important role in multiple cellular functions, including cell migration and adhesion, spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation. However, its role during adult hematopoiesis is unknown. We show that conditional inactivation of <italic>Apc</italic> in vivo dramatically increases apoptosis and enhances cell cycle entry of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)/ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), leading to their rapid disappearance and bone marrow failure. The defect in HSCs/HPCs caused by <italic>Apc</italic> ablation is cell autonomous. In addition, we found that loss of <italic>Apc</italic> leads to exhaustion of the myeloid progenitor pool (common myeloid progenitor, granulocyte-monocyte progenitor, and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor), as well as the lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor pool. Down-regulation of the genes encoding Cdkn1a, Cdkn1b, and Mcl1 occurs after acute <italic>Apc</italic> excision in candidate HSC populations. Together, our data demonstrate that Apc is essential for HSC and HPC maintenance and survival.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; CAFC, cobblestone area&#x02013;forming cell; CLP, common lymphoid progenitor; CM, chimeric mice; CMP, common myeloid progenitor; GMP, granulocyte-monocyte progenitor; HPC, hematopoietic progenitor cell; HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; LMPP, lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor pool; MEP, megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor; PB, peripheral blood; pI-pC, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid; qRT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Hematopoiesis is a tightly regulated process in which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) undergo self-renewal and give rise to more differentiated progenitor populations, such as common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) and common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), as well as more restricted granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs), which develop into all mature blood cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Maintenance of the HSC pool, which is essential for homeostasis of the hematopoietic system, requires the integrated regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that the PcG (Polycomb group) proteins, such as Bmi1, Pcgf2, and Phc1, are important in the regulation of HSC maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). In addition, transcription factors, such as Etv6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), Gfi1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), HoxB4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), and Zfx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) have been implicated in the regulation of HSC self-renewal. Deletion of <italic>Pten</italic>, which encodes an important signal transducer, leads to a transient expansion of HSCs and depletion of the HSC pool over time, indicating that it has a critical role in the maintenance of HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). However, the Cdkn1a and Cdkn2c cell cycle inhibitors have an opposing role in regulating the self-renewal of HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> results in increased proliferation and impaired self-renewal of HSCs. In contrast, loss of function of <italic>Cdkn2c</italic> leads to enhanced HSC self-renewal. Finally, apoptosis is a pivotal mechanism for regulation of the HSC pool, and antiapoptotic proteins, such as Mcl1 and Birc5 (Survivin), are required for the survival of HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>adenomatous polyposis coli</italic> (<italic>APC</italic>) tumor suppressor gene is involved in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer, via regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin through the Wnt signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). APC is essential for the formation of the APC&#x02013;Axin&#x02013;GSK3-&#x003b2; destruction complex, which mediates the phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitylation of &#x003b2;-catenin for proteosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). In addition to regulation of the Wnt pathway, APC plays a role in cell migration, cell adhesion, spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation. With respect to cell migration, APC regulates stabilization and polymerization of microtubules through association with EB1 (end binding 1) and microtubules. APC also binds IQGAP1 (GTPase activating protein 1), which mediates cell polarization and directional migration. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor Asef is stimulated by its interaction with APC and, subsequently, promotes cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Recent reports indicate that APC may function with Asef and catenins to regulate cell&#x02013;cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Mutations in APC induce chromosome instability, suggesting that WT APC also has a role in the maintenance of chromosome stability during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Although poorly understood, the mechanism by which APC regulates spindle assembly and chromosomal segregation may involve interaction with EB1 to regulate the dynamics and organization of microtubules, as well as association of APC with Bub checkpoint proteins to ensure proper attachment of microtubules to the kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we have examined the function of <italic>Apc</italic> in the hematopoietic system in vivo by conditional inactivation of <italic>Apc</italic> in hematopoietic cells in the mouse. We found that loss of <italic>Apc</italic> in vivo resulted in rapid lethality. The <italic>Apc</italic> mutant mice displayed a dramatic reduction in HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and failed to maintain normal hematopoiesis. The effect of <italic>Apc</italic> deficiency on HSC and HPC maintenance involves increased apoptosis, as well as increased proliferation. In addition, we found that depletion of <italic>Apc</italic> leads to dramatic apoptosis of hepatocytes in vivo, indicating that Apc plays a role in the regulation of cell survival in multiple tissues. Collectively, our studies reveal that endogenous <italic>Apc</italic> plays a critical role in regulating HSC and HPC maintenance and adult hematopoiesis.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title><italic>Apc</italic> is expressed in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells</title><p>To examine the relative expression levels of <italic>Apc</italic> transcripts in primitive hematopoietic cells, we used a combination of cell purification and real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) techniques.

As compared with other animal models for important regulators of HSC maintenance, such as Bmi1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>), Pten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), Cdkn1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), and Mcl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), the effect of <italic>Apc</italic> ablation on HSC maintenance is more rapid and striking. In addition, <italic>Apc</italic> mutant HSCs failed to reconstitute hematopoiesis in lethally irradiated recipient mice. This intrinsic functional failure was also observed in the context of a WT microenvironment, indicating that the effect is cell autonomous.</p><p>Regulation of the cell cycle of HSCs plays an important role in the maintenance of the HSC pool. Most HSCs are maintained in a quiescent state and divide once within a 2&#x02013;4-wk period in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Enforced cell cycle entry as a result of deletion of <italic>Cdkna1</italic> or <italic>Pten</italic> leads to exhaustion of the HSC pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Consistent with previous findings that overexpression of <italic>Apc</italic> blocks cell cycle progression from G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> to the S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), we demonstrated that deletion of <italic>Apc</italic> increased the proportion of proliferating HSCs and myeloid progenitors markedly. The proportion of HSCs that exit G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> and enter the S phase is increased about threefold on average in <italic>Apc</italic>-deficient mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Thus, an increase in the proportion of proliferating cells caused by ablation of <italic>Apc</italic> contributes to the exhaustion of the HSC pool in <italic>Apc</italic> mutant mice. In addition, we found that both <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> are expressed at lower levels in <italic>Apc</italic> mutant LSK cells, suggesting that the role of Apc in regulating cell cycle progression may be associated with its function in negatively modulating the activity of cyclin&#x02013;CDK complexes.</p><p>Regulation of apoptosis is also critical for the maintenance of the HSC pool. Loss of survival factors, such as Mcl1 and Birc5, leads to depletion of BM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Consistent with previous results that conditional inactivation of <italic>Apc</italic> in the neural crest induces massive apoptosis during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), we found that loss of <italic>Apc</italic> significantly increased the frequency of apoptosis in HSCs and HPCs, which contributes to the loss of hematopoietic homeostasis. In addition, we demonstrated that deletion of <italic>Apc</italic> also induces apoptosis of hepatocytes in vivo. The expression of <italic>Mcl1</italic> is down-regulated in the <italic>Apc</italic> mutant LSK population, which may contribute to induction of apoptosis in <italic>Apc</italic>-deficient HSCs. Loss of <italic>Apc</italic> is associated with chromosomal instability and missegregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), raising the possibility that induction of apoptosis by loss of <italic>Apc</italic> in hematopoietic cells may result, in part, from an increased frequency of chromosome missegregation.</p><p>Our data also suggests that inactivation of <italic>Apc</italic> in vivo leads to a block in multilineage differentiation. Differentiation of the erythroid lineage was blocked at early erythroblast stages, whereas development of B cells was blocked at the LMPP stage. Gounari et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>) demonstrated that loss of <italic>Apc</italic> disrupts thymic development. We have extended these observations and determined that <italic>Apc</italic> ablation results in an absence of ETP, DN2, and DN3 T cells and a delay in the DN4 and DP transitions during T cell development. Collectively, our data indicate that Apc is a key regulator of hematopoiesis.</p><p>In line with the role of Apc as an antagonist of the Wnt pathway, loss of <italic>Apc</italic> leads to the accumulation of intracellular &#x003b2;-catenin in hematopoietic cells from thymus and spleen, HSCs, HPCs, and subsets of mature BM cells, indicating that loss of <italic>Apc</italic> may activate the Wnt pathway by stabilizing &#x003b2;-catenin in HSCs, HPCs, and other hematopoietic cells. The involvement of Wnt signaling in regulating HSC activity is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Activation of Wnt signaling by overexpression of stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin enhances the self-renewal of HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Conversely, enhanced expression of Axin, a negative regulator of the Wnt pathway, resulted in inhibition of HSC proliferation in vitro and decreased reconstitution capacity of HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). In addition, stimulation of the Wnt pathway with purified Wnt protein in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), or a small-molecule inhibitor of GSK3&#x003b2; in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), promotes the self-renewal of HSCs. Nonetheless, in vivo studies have yielded unexpected results. Conditional inactivation of &#x003b2;-catenin did not affect the function of HSCs and hematopoiesis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). However, Kirstetter et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>) and Scheller et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>) showed that conditional expression of stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin in hematopoietic cells in vivo results in disrupted function of HSCs and lethality in mice. A caveat is that it is not yet known whether the magnitude of Wnt signaling resulting from expression of stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin reflects physiological conditions in hematopoietic cells. Our data showed that <italic>Apc</italic>-deficient mice share some common phenotypic features, such as enhanced cell cycle entry of HSC, as well as multilineage defects, with mice expressing stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin in hematopoietic cells, suggesting that the function of Apc in the hematopoietic system may, in part, be mediated by the regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin stabilization. In addition, tight regulation of the magnitude of signaling through the Wnt pathway by Apc may be required for the maintenance and differentiation of HSCs and HPCs. However, loss of Apc results in more severe defects in HSCs as compared with overexpression of &#x003b2;-catenin, suggesting that additional signaling pathways may be involved in mediating the effect. Recently, down-regulation of Apc has been implicated in activation of the mTOR pathway independent of &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Whether activation of the mTOR signaling pathway resulting from loss of <italic>Apc</italic> enhances protein synthesis, leading to a synergistic growth-stimulatory effect with stabilization of &#x003b2;-catenin in <italic>Apc</italic> mutant HSCs, remains to be determined.</p><p>Although there are some common features, our data indicate that acute physiological loss of <italic>Apc</italic> in HSCs has some consequences that are distinct from those of aberrant stabilization and constitutive activation of &#x003b2;-catenin. For example, <italic>Apc</italic> ablation resulted in extremely rapid depletion of HSCs, which is in contrast to the expansion of HSCs observed after expression of constitutively active &#x003b2;-catenin in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). In addition, <italic>Apc</italic> ablation increased the frequency of apoptosis of HSCs and HPCs and led to a marked reduction in the pool of myeloid progenitors, whereas expression of constitutively active &#x003b2;-catenin did not affect apoptosis in HSCs or the size of the myeloid progenitor pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Thus, the mechanism by which loss of <italic>Apc</italic> increases the frequency of apoptosis in HSCs may be independent of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling. Apc is a multidomain protein that interacts with several other proteins, and has been implicated in multiple cellular functions in addition to regulation of the Wnt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). In this regard, the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> homologue of <italic>Apc</italic> plays a role in the orientation of asymmetrical cell division of male germline stem cells, suggesting that Apc may contribute to maintaining the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Whether <italic>Apc</italic> regulates the self-renewal of HSCs by controlling asymmetrical cell division is unknown. In addition, Apc regulates thymocyte development through regulation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling and control of chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Collectively, the available data suggest that other cellular functions of <italic>Apc</italic> may also contribute to its critical role in maintaining the integrity of the HSC and progenitor compartments. The rapid lethality of <italic>Apc</italic> mutant mice may be the result of synergistic effects resulting from defects in multiple cellular functions of Apc.</p><p>In the gastrointestinal system, <italic>Apc</italic> is expressed in colonic epithelial cells, where its expression is lower at the bottom and higher in the upper portions of the crypts, suggesting that there is an increase in the level of <italic>Apc</italic> expression with maturation of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Loss of <italic>Apc</italic> function is believed to lead to expansion of the intestinal stem cell compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that <italic>Apc</italic> has a differential effect in HSCs and intestinal stem cells, i.e., exhaustion of the HSC pool versus expansion of the intestinal stem cell pool, and that the function of Apc in regulating self-renewal of adult stem cells is cell context dependent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title><italic>Apc</italic> mutant mice.</title><p><italic>Apc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice carrying a conditionally targeted allele of <italic>Apc</italic> (APC<sup>580s</sup>; reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) were generated from embryonic stem cells obtained from T.
