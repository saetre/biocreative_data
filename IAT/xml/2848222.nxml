Univariate analysis suggested that differentiation might be correlated with K-ras mutations (<italic>p </italic>= 0.05), which was confirmed by a logistic regression model (<italic>p </italic>= 0.04). The median overall survival (OS) and median survival after metastasis were 44.0 and 18.0 months, respectively, in the mutant K-ras group, and 53.3 and 19.0 months, respectively, in the wild K-ras group. K-ras mutation was not an independent prognostic factor for OS or survival after metastasis (<italic>p </italic>= 0.79 and 0.78, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In Chinese patients with CRC, EGFR mutations were rare, and K-ras mutations were similar to those of Europeans.

Upregulated EGFR is correlated with both poor prognosis and increased metastatic potential in numerous epithelial malignancies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Further investigation has recently revealed that, in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with mutated EGFR, higher response rates and longer survival time could be achieved with the use of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. The mutations were centered on exon 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain and were mostly detected in Asian patients with NSCLC, which suggested that gefitinib played an important role in the Chinese population[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It has been reported that the mutation incidence in colorectal cancer (CRC) was approximately 0.34% to 3.00% in western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In contrast, the mutation incidence was reported to be as high as 12% in a study from Japan of 33 patients with CRC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, the differences between Western and Eastern patients with CRC have not been clearly documented, and no data from Chinese patients with CRC are currently available.</p><p>The K-ras gene is located downstream in the EGFR signal pathway. The Ras protein is activated transiently as a response to extracellular signals, such as growth factors, cytokines, and hormones that stimulate cell surface receptors. It can switch between an inactive state, in which the proteins are bound to guanosine-diphosphates, and an active state, in which conversion to guanosine-triphosphate (GTP) occurs. Mutant activated forms of Ras proteins have an impaired intrinsic GTPase activity, which renders the protein resistant to inactivation by regulatory GTPase-activating proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Approximately 20% to 50% of patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma have a K-ras mutation, and 90% of the mutations were found in codons 12 and 13, followed by codon 61[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Studies have recently confirmed that a mutant K-ras gene could lead to resistance to cetuximab and panitumumab in metastatic CRC (mCRC), suggesting that K-ras status should be considered when selecting patients with mCRC as candidates for panitumumab or cetuximab monotherapy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Mutations in both EGFR and K-ras will promote the progression of resistance to anti-EGFR targeting therapy. Limited data in the Chinese population prompted this study, which was performed to explore mutations in EGFR and K-ras gene in Chinese patients with CRC and provide evidence for the efficacy-prediction of EGFR targeting therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue samples</title><p>Study approval was provided by the Medical Ethical Committees of the Fudan University Cancer Hospital, Shanghai, China, a specialist cancer hospital serving mainland China (60% of patients attend from other provinces, many of whom have late-stage disease).

The main reason for this finding is somatic mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain, which are more prevalent in Asian patients with NSCLC. Therefore, these mutations might be considered biomarkers for the use of gefitinib in the treatment of NSCLC. However, this study did not find similar results in Chinese patients with CRC. In total, 101 paraffin-section from colorectal adenocarcinoma samples were selected, and mutations in EGFR exon 18-21 were identified. Only 2.0% of the samples had mutations in exon 18 or 21, which was similar to that in the Western population. Substitutions of A2183G (Lys728Arg) in exon 18 and A2546T (Gln849Leu) and G2611A (Ala871Thr) in exon 21 were the only three mutations detected. No mutations were found in exon 19 or 20, which was different from the results in NSCLC, in which the principal mutation was a deletion in exon 19. The mutation incidence varied among different studies. Barber et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] reported a 0.34% mutation incidence of Gly719Ser in 293 CRC samples in the USA, and Ogino et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] found a 3.3% incidence of Gly724Ser in 30 samples, while no mutations were detected in Lynch et al.'s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]study of 20 samples. However, a study from Japan reported by Nagahara et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] found a relatively higher mutation incidence of 12% (4 of 33 samples). The mutations were all substitutions of Glu749Lys in exon 19 and Glu762Gly and Ala767Thr in exon 20. This study found that EGFR mutations were rare in Chinese patients with CRC, which was similar to the results from Western countries, but greatly different from those in Chinese patients with NSCLC.</p><p>EGFR-TKIs have shown satisfactory efficacy as first-, second-, or third-line therapy for patients with NSCLC with EGFR mutations. Similar studies of patients with CRC have been performed to investigate the application of EGFR-TKIs in this setting. A phase II study showed that two doses of gefitinib (250 mg/day and 500 mg/day) resulted in a partial response rate of 1% (1 of 110 patients) with a median progression-free survival of 1.9 months[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Townsley et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] treated 39 patients with mCRC with erlotinib. Of 31 evaluable patients, 19 (61%) had progressive disease, and 12 (39%) had stable disease. However, there was a reduction in phosphorylated EGFR and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase in tumor tissue after treatment. From these studies, gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy seems unlikely to be effective for patients with CRC. The lower response rate for mCRC could be explained by a lower incidence of EGFR mutations than that found in NSCLC.</p><p>Further trials have focused on the combination of TKIs and chemotherapy. In a phase II study, the combination of capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and erlotinib seemed to have promising activity for patients who had received prior chemotherapy with a relatively high response rate (25%) and progression free survival (PFS) (5.4 months) compared with previous reports of either infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin or capecitabine and oxaliplatin in a similar patient population[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-FU (FOLFOX-4) in combination with gefitinib in patients who failed irinotecan as a second-line therapy achieved a response rate of 33%, which was higher than that of FOLFOX-4 alone (10%)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, phase III trials are needed to eradicate selection bias before conclusions about the efficacy of the combination of EGFR-TKIs and chemotherapy can be confirmed.</p><p>In total, 34 mutations (32.7%) were found in 33 samples in this study, including common mutations in codons 12 and 13 and 3 novel mutations in codons 45, 69, and 80. The mutation incidence and most sites of mutation were all concordant with those reported in previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, only one mutation in codon 13 was detected in the Chinese CRC samples, which is less than that reported in western studies. The three mutations found in codons 45, 69, and 80, which have not previously been reported, suggest that, occasionally, CRC in Chinese patients might have different biologic behavior and drug resistance although it is rarely detected. This is an exciting result because it suggests the possibility that other differences between Chinese and Western patients with CRC could be present, which could help in finding new individual treatments for Chinese patients. No mutations in codon 61 were detected in this study. It was reported in Western studies that approximately 90% of the activating mutations were found in codons 12 and 13 of exon 1 and ~5% in codon 61 located in exon 2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Similarly, the mutation incidence of codon 61 was 0-4.8% in domestic reports. Therefore, our results were concordant with that of previous studies.</p><p>Differences in the categorical variables of sex, age, tumor sub-localization, pathology, differentiation, and UICC stage between patients with and without K-ras mutations were evaluated for significance with both chi-squared test and multivariate analyses. Only the factor of differentiation was potentially correlated with K-ras mutations (<italic>p </italic>= 0.05), which suggested that poor differentiation might predict K-ras mutations. This correlation was confirmed by multivariate analysis done with a logistic regression model. Duke's stage, lymph node metastasis, special pathology, and other factors were suggested as possible parameters related to K-ras mutations in previous studies, but no correlation has been achieved yet[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Currently, no conclusion can be made due to the lack of a meta-analysis, but this investigation will be continued with a larger sample.</p><p>Correlations between K-ras mutations and survival in CRC have been controversial. Although a notable shortening of OS was noted for the K-ras mutation subgroup compared with the wild K-ras subgroup, no statistical significance was detected by univariate and multivariate analysis. Similarly, no correlation was found between survival after metastasis and K-ras mutations by univariate and multivariate analyses. Some investigators have concluded that K-ras mutations could lead to poor survival, especially when anti-EGFR antibodies plus chemotherapy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] were used, while others have found no significant correlation between K-ras mutations and survival[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], which was consistent with this study. However, some studies have shown that specific nucleotide mutations, inducing amino acid mutations, might be relevant to survival[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. For example, Gly12Val mutations in codon 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and the G&#x0003e;A mutation in codon 13[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]both might induce poor survival. As only a few mutations in codon 12 and only one in codon 13 were detected in this study, and the follow-up time was insufficient, it was difficult to identify a definite correlation between K-ras mutations and survival. A further study with a larger sample size is ongoing, and more encouraging results might be found.</p><p>In NSCLC, K-ras mutations are related to the resistance of EGFR-TKIs, which are the opposite of EGFR mutations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Some studies have recently indicated that K-ras mutations are responsible for the low response rate to EGFR monoclonal antibodies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A similar result has been found in another large study, which confirmed that wild-type K-ras was required for panitumumab (an EGFR monoclonal antibody) efficacy in patients with mCRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. At the 2009 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, there was an encouraging report of 540 samples from the CRYSTAL trial that were analyzed to evaluate treatment effect stratified by K-ras mutation status (Rougier et al. 2009, unpublished data). A statistically significant difference was seen in favor of cetuximab for best overall response (<italic>p </italic>= 0.0025), reducing the risk of progression (<italic>p </italic>= 0.0167) for patients with K-ras wild-type mutations, while no benefit was seen from the addition of cetuximab for the K-ras mutation subgroup. These data demonstrated that the treatment effect of cetuximab in patients with K-ras wild-type mutations was significantly enhanced compared with standard chemotherapy alone, whereas patients with a K-ras mutation could not be shown to benefit from cetuximab treatment. Therefore, K-ras status detection is recommended before the use of EGFR monoclonal antibodies. However, most patients with recurrent or metastatic disease in our study were not treated with EGFR monoclonal antibodies because they were mostly treated between 2004 and 2007. When cetuximab became available in 2006 in China, 13 patients were treated with this drug as a first- to third-line treatment, although many patients with recurrent or metastatic disease were not given cetuximab for financial reasons. Prior to 2006, conventional treatment was given. Due to the limited data on cetuximab treatment, we expect more studies on the relationship between K-ras mutations and cetuximab efficacy in the Chinese population because cetuximab is much more widely used in our hospital at present.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>EGFR mutations are rare in Chinese patients with CRC, which is similar to the results in those with NSCLC. Therefore, gefitinib might be ineffective for CRC. K-ras mutations were similar in Chinese patients with CRC to that in Western populations, and substitutions in codon 12 are the most common mutations. Poor differentiation is an independent factor related to K-ras mutation. K-ras mutation might not be a prognostic factor but may be a predictor of resistance to EGFR monoclonal antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ZYX and CJ both participated in the design of the study, sample collections and follow-up of the patients, performed the statistical analysis, and drafted the manuscript.
