During autophagy, cytoplasmic components are sequestered into double membrane structures called autophagosomes, which then fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, where degradation occurs (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klionsky, 2007</xref>). Currently, there are 31 autophagy-related (<italic>Atg</italic>) genes in yeast, and 18 Atg proteins are essential for autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizushima, 2007</xref>). Most yeast <italic>Atg</italic> genes have orthologues in higher eukaryotes and encode proteins required for autophagy induction, autophagosome nucleation, expansion, and completion, and final retrieval of Atg protein complexes from mature autophagosomes (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levine and Yuan, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Depending on the physiological and pathological conditions, autophagy has been shown to act as a pro-survival or pro-death mechanism in vertebrates (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levine and Yuan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maiuri et al., 2007</xref>). In the case of growth factor withdrawal, starvation, and neurodegeneration, autophagy has been shown to function in cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boya et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lum et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Komatsu et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, autophagy has been found to act as a cell death mechanism in derived cell lines where caspases or apoptotic regulators are impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shimizu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2004</xref>). The nature and perhaps level of the stress stimulus may also be important in determining whether autophagy promotes cell survival or cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boya et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maiuri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Overlaps between components in apoptosis and autophagic pathways have been described. Upstream signal transducers in apoptotic pathways, including TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), TNF, Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), and death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), have been shown to play a role in autophagy regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prins et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Inbal et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mills et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thorburn et al., 2005</xref>), and two apoptotic inducers, including sphingolipid and ceramide, can activate autophagy in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ghidoni et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scarlatti et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, two recent studies demonstrate physical and functional interactions between components of apoptosis and autophagy. First, the antiapoptosis protein, Bcl-2, suppresses autophagy through a direct interaction with Beclin 1, a protein required for autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pattingre et al., 2005</xref>). Second, Atg5, which is cleaved by calpain, associates with Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, leading to cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release and caspase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yousefi et al., 2006</xref>). Further examples and discussion of the connections between apoptosis and autophagy can be found in several recent reviews on this topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ferraro and Cecconi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maiuri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thorburn, 2008</xref>). The current findings indicate that there is a complex relationship between apoptosis and autophagy, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between the two processes are still largely unknown.</p><p>Autophagy is observed in several <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> tissues during development, and thus <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is useful as a model to study autophagy in the context of a living organism. 14 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> annotated genes share significant sequence identity with the yeast <italic>Atg</italic> genes, and, overall, eight <italic>D. melanogaster Atg</italic> homologues have already been shown to be required for autophagy function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scott et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry and Baehrecke, 2007</xref>). In addition, recent studies demonstrated the role of autophagy in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> physiological cell death. Loss of <italic>Atg</italic> genes, including <italic>Atg1</italic>, <italic>Atg2</italic>, <italic>Atg3</italic>, <italic>Atg6</italic>, <italic>Atg7</italic>, <italic>Atg8</italic>, <italic>Atg12</italic>, and <italic>Atg18</italic>, inhibited proper degradation of salivary glands during development. Overexpression of Atg1 induced premature salivary gland cell death in a caspase-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry and Baehrecke, 2007</xref>). In contrast, caspase activity was required for Atg1-mediated apoptotic death in the fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scott et al., 2007</xref>). Mutation of <italic>Atg7</italic> resulted in an inhibition of DNA fragmentation in the midgut but led to an increase of DNA fragmentation in the adult <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Juhasz et al., 2007</xref>). Together, these results further suggest that the mechanistic role of autophagy in cell death and the interrelations between autophagy and apoptosis may be tissue and/or context dependent.</p><p>The adult <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ovary contains 15&#x02013;20 ovarioles comprised of developing egg chambers, which consist of 16 germ line cells (15 nurse cells and 1 oocyte) surrounded by a layer of somatic follicle cells. The germ line cells originate from stem cells that undergo mitosis to form 16-cell cysts in a specialized region called the germarium. In the late stage of oogenesis, the nurse cells support the development of the oocyte by transferring to it their cytoplasmic contents. After this &#x0201c;dumping&#x0201d; event, the nurse cells undergo cell death, and their remnants are engulfed by the surrounding follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">King, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spradling, 1993</xref>). In addition to this late-stage developmental cell death, egg chambers can be induced to die at two earlier stages, during germarium formation (in region 2) and mid-oogenesis, by factors such as nutrient deprivation, chemical insults, and altered hormonal signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drummond-Barbosa and Spradling, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCall, 2004</xref>). In some respects, cell death during <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> oogenesis is similar to the death of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larval salivary glands. Both nurse cells and salivary gland cells are large and polyploid, and the entire tissues undergo cell death simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCall, 2004</xref>). Notably, morphological features of autophagy have been described during mid-oogenesis cell death in a related species, <italic>Drosophila virilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Velentzas et al., 2007</xref>), which suggests that the cell death process in ovaries and salivary glands share additional similarities.</p><p>Previous studies have focused on characterizing the role of autophagy genes in cell death and determining the paradoxical functions of autophagy (pro-survival and pro-death) in various cell lines and organisms. However, a systematic approach that investigates the involvement of cell death genes in starvation-induced autophagy has not been conducted. Here, we present RNAi analyses to determine whether known cell death&#x02013;related genes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> play a role in autophagy regulation in the lethal (2) malignant blood neoplasm (<italic>l(2)mbn</italic>) cell line. We also used <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genetics to investigate a role for the effector caspase <italic>death caspase-1</italic> (<italic>Dcp-1</italic>) and the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family member <italic>Bruce</italic> in autophagy regulation in vivo during <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> oogenesis. Further, we examine the function of autophagy genes <italic>Atg7</italic> and <italic>Atg1</italic> in starvation-induced germ line cell death in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ovary.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The RNAi screening assay identifies known positive and negative regulators of starvation-induced autophagy in <italic>D. melanogaster l(2)mbn</italic> cells</title><p>To quantify starvation-induced autophagy, we used a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> tumorous larval hemocyte cell line, <italic>l(2)mbn</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ress et al., 2000</xref>), and used LysoTracker green (LTG) dye, which has been shown previously to label lysosomes and autolysosomes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scott et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klionsky et al., 2007</xref>). Flow cytometry was used to acquire LTG fluorescence of individual cells. Under nutrient-full medium conditions, we detected a basal level of LTG labeling in <italic>l(2)mbn</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). When cells were transferred into amino acid&#x02013;deprived medium for 2 h, we observed a detectable increase in LTG labeling. After 4 h of amino acid deprivation, a further increase in the percentage of cells with high LTG fluorescence levels (LTG<sup>high</sup> population) was observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). To confirm that autophagy is indeed up-regulated under nutrient-deprived conditions in <italic>l(2)mbn</italic> cells, we constructed a stable <italic>l(2)mbn</italic> cell line expressing mammalian microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)/Atg8 fused to GFP protein, a widely used marker for autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klionsky et al., 2007</xref>). During autophagy, LC3 conjugates to phosphatidylethanolamine, which then inserts into the autophagosomal membrane. Thus, localization of GFP-LC3 changes from a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern to a punctate autophagosomal membrane-bound pattern that can be monitored by microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mizushima et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klionsky et al., 2007</xref>). As expected, the percentage of cells with more than three GFP-LC3 puncta (GFP-LC3 positive) was increased from 9% (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 216) in the nutrient-full condition to 32% (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 200) in the nutrient-starved condition for 2 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Further, to confirm that LTG labeling correlates with autophagy levels in <italic>l(2)mbn</italic> cells, we used the pharmacological autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3MA) and bafilomycin A1 (Baf). 3MA blocks autophagy by inhibiting phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seglen and Gordon, 1982</xref>). Baf is a specific inhibitor of lysosomal proton pumps and prevents the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamamoto et al., 1998</xref>). In <italic>l(2)mbn</italic> cells, both autophagy inhibitors significantly reduced LTG fluorescence levels after starvation treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). Consistently, the addition of 3MA also decreased the numbers of GFP-LC3&#x02013;positive cells after starvation treatment. As expected, the addition of Baf, which is known to increase the numbers of autophagosomes by preventing their lysosomal degradation, resulted in increased GFP-LC3 puncta in starved cells (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712091/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712091/DC1</ext-link>). These results indicate that our flow cytometry&#x02013;based LTG assay is able to detect changes in the autophagy levels of <italic>l(2)mbn</italic> cells in response to starvation and autophagy-inhibiting drug treatments.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Quantification of starvation-induced autophagy in <italic>D. melanogaster l(2)mbn</italic> cells.</bold> (A) Flow cytometry analysis of <italic>l(2)mbn</italic> cells starved for 2 h (2h S) or 4 h (4h S) showed an increase in LTG fluorescence levels (x axis) compared with control cells in full-nutrient medium (C).

(C) Flow cytometry analysis of 4-h starved cells were incubated with 3MA (4h S &#x0002b; 3MA) and Baf (4h S &#x0002b; Baf).

Results represent the mean value &#x000b1; SD from at least three independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1821127f01"></graphic></fig><p>To further validate our flow cytometry&#x02013;based LTG assay and determine its sensitivity, we used RNAi to specifically inhibit <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> autophagy genes. Currently, there are 14 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genes that share significant sequence identity with yeast <italic>Atg</italic> genes, and seven <italic>D. melanogaster Atg</italic> homologues have already been shown to be essential for starvation-induced autophagy in the larval fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scott et al., 2004</xref>). In our assay, RNAi of 11 <italic>D. melanogaster Atg</italic> homologues individually resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the LTG<sup>high</sup> population after starvation treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref> and Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712091/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712091/DC1</ext-link>). The effects on LTG staining by RNAi or 3MA were modest in size (e.g., 30&#x02013;48% change relative to the <italic>Hs</italic>-RNAi&#x02013;negative control in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>) but reproducible and statistically significant. The limited magnitude of the detectable effects may be due, at least in part, to the nature of this dye as an acidophilic probe that detects autolysosomes but also background lysosomal staining. As with any RNAi-based screen, incomplete target knockdown may also be a contributing factor. Comparison of our RNAi-mediated results with previous in vivo results from the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larval fat body (Table S1) indicates that <italic>l(2)mbn</italic> cells require the same autophagy genes as the fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scott et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In higher eukaryotes, starvation-induced autophagy is suppressed by components of the insulin/class I PI3K and target of rapamycin (TOR) pathways (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levine and Yuan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klionsky, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maiuri et al., 2007</xref>). To determine whether PI3K and TOR pathways are required for starvation-induced autophagy in <italic>l(2)mbn</italic> cells, we designed double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) against several genes in these pathways. RNAi of <italic>Tor</italic> or <italic>RheB</italic>, negative regulators of autophagy, showed an increase in LTG<sup>high</sup> cells compared with <italic>Hs</italic>-dsRNA (negative control)-treated cells after starvation treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). In contrast, RNAi of <italic>Pten</italic>, <italic>Tsc1</italic>, <italic>Tsc2</italic>, and <italic>S6k</italic>, positive regulators of autophagy, showed a reduction in the LTG<sup>high</sup> population (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). These results indicate that components of TOR and PI3K pathway are essential to regulate starvation-induced autophagy in <italic>D. melanogaster l(2)mbn</italic> cells. These results also demonstrate that our primary screening method, a flow cytometry&#x02013;based LTG assay, is capable of detecting alterations induced by RNAi-mediated knockdown of positive and negative regulators of autophagy. Thus, this method can be used to identify novel components in starvation-induced autophagy. To ensure that the changes in LTG fluorescence levels were caused by alterations in autophagy, we used GFP-LC3 to track changes in autophagosome formation in cells. RNAi of <italic>Tor</italic> showed an increase in the numbers of GFP-LC3 positive cells after starvation treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>). In contrast, reduction of <italic>Pten</italic> expression by RNAi resulted in a decrease in the number of the GFP-LC3&#x02013;positive cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>). Together, these two methods allow us to monitor the dynamic steps, formation of autophagosomes (GFP-LC3), and autophagosome-lysosome fusion (LTG), during autophagy.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of known cell death&#x02013;related genes in autophagy regulation in <italic>l(2)mbn</italic> cells using RNAi.</bold> (A) The percentage of LTG<sup>high</sup> cells was reduced by <italic>hid-</italic>RNAi (P &#x0003d; 0.006) but not by <italic>rpr</italic>, <italic>grim</italic>, and <italic>skl</italic>-RNAi.

Only dsRNA corresponding to <italic>hid</italic> but not <italic>rpr</italic>, <italic>grim</italic>, or <italic>skl</italic> showed an effect on autophagy by this assay. RNAi of <italic>hid</italic> decreased the percentage of LTG<sup>high</sup> cells after starvation treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Previous studies showed that the Ras&#x02013;Raf&#x02013;MAPK pathway specifically inhibits the proapoptotic activity of <italic>hid</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergmann et al., 1998</xref>). To determine whether the Ras&#x02013;Raf&#x02013;MAPK pathway also plays a regulatory role in autophagy in <italic>l(2)mbn</italic> cells, we designed dsRNAs to target these three components. RNAi of <italic>Ras</italic>, <italic>phl</italic> (also known as <italic>raf</italic>), or <italic>rl</italic> (also known as <italic>MAPK</italic>) all further enhanced the LTG fluorescence levels, suggesting that, like in apoptosis, they have an inhibitory role in autophagy regulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). A second set of dsRNAs, nonoverlapping with the first set of dsRNAs, was designed to validate these new findings, and consistent results were observed (Fig. S1 B). In addition, GFP-LC3 was used to track changes in autophagosome formation in cells. RNAi of <italic>hid</italic> showed a decrease in the numbers of cells with GFP-LC3 puncta (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>), whereas RNAi of <italic>Ras</italic>, <italic>phl</italic>, or <italic>rl</italic> all resulted in a significant increase in the numbers of GFP-LC3&#x02013;positive cells after starvation treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>).</p><p>All RHG family members, Rpr, Hid, Grim, and Skl, bind to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> IAP-1 (DIAP1) and inhibit its antiapoptotic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hay et al., 2004</xref>). To test whether DIAP1 (encoded by <italic>th</italic>) is a putative downstream mediator of Hid-dependent autophagy in <italic>l(2)mbn</italic> cells, dsRNA was designed specifically to target <italic>th.</italic> We found that <italic>th</italic>-dsRNA&#x02013;treated cells showed no difference in LTG fluorescence levels compared with <italic>Hs</italic>-dsRNA (negative control)-treated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Interestingly, our data showed that reduced expression of <italic>Bruce</italic>, another IAP family member protein, further increased the LTG fluorescence levels after starvation treatment (confirmed using nonoverlapping dsRNAs; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>; see Fig. S1 C). RNAi of <italic>Bruce</italic> expression also resulted in an increase in GFP-LC3 puncta after starvation treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>). These results suggest that Bruce, instead of DIAP1, could be the downstream target of Hid during starvation induced autophagy in <italic>l(2)mbn</italic> cells.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether the transducers of apoptotic signals, <italic>Ark</italic>, <italic>Buffy</italic>, and <italic>debcl</italic>, are required for starvation-induced autophagy. Reduced expression of <italic>Ark</italic>, the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> homologue of mammalian <italic>Apaf-1</italic>, did not affect the LTG fluorescence levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). RNAi of two Bcl-2 family members, <italic>Buffy</italic> or <italic>debcl</italic>, resulted in a decrease in the percentage of LTG<sup>high</sup> cells after starvation treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Consistently, reduction of <italic>Buffy</italic> and <italic>debcl</italic> expression by RNAi decreased the percentage of GFP-LC3&#x02013;positive cells after starvation treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>). Reduced expression of <italic>Ark</italic>, <italic>Buffy</italic>, and <italic>debcl</italic> was determined using quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR; Fig. S1 D). In addition, we reduced expression of the tumor suppressor <italic>p53</italic> by RNAi and found that starvation-induced autophagy was inhibited (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Results were further confirmed using nonoverlapping dsRNAs (Fig. S1 C).</p><p>To investigate the requirement of caspases, the final effectors of apoptosis, in starvation-induced autophagy, we designed gene-specific dsRNAs corresponding to seven different <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> caspases. RNAi of just one caspase, <italic>Dcp-1</italic>, but not others resulted in a decrease in the percentage of LTG<sup>high</sup> cells after starvation treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). A second dsRNA against <italic>Dcp-1</italic>, nonoverlapping with the first dsRNA, yielded a similar result (Fig. S1 C). Reduction of <italic>Dcp-1</italic> expression by RNAi was determined using QRT-PCR (Fig. S1 D). Consistent with the LTG derived data, RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>Dcp-1</italic> resulted in a decrease in GFP-LC3&#x02013;positive cells after starvation treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>).

We used a transgenic fly line that expresses a GFP-LC3 fusion protein under the control of the upstream activating sequence (<italic>UASp</italic>) promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rusten et al., 2004</xref>).

We also observed numerous GFP-LC3 puncta in nutrient-deprived degenerating stage 8 chambers, but a diffuse GFP-LC3 pattern was detected in healthy egg chambers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>).

We have shown here that six known cell death genes and the Ras&#x02013;Raf&#x02013;MAPK signaling pathway not only function in apoptosis but also act to regulate autophagy in <italic>D. melanogaster l(2)mbn</italic> cells. We cannot rule out the possibility that additional cell death genes that we screened may also function in autophagy but were not detected in our assay because of insufficient knockdown by RNAi, a long half-life of the corresponding proteins, and/or functional redundancy.</p><p>Consistent with our in vitro data, the involvement of Hid in autophagy regulation has been demonstrated in <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> Overexpression of Hid induced autophagy in the fat body, larval epidermis, midgut, salivary gland, Malpighian tubules, and trachea epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Juhasz and Sass, 2005</xref>). Further, expression of the constitutively active Ras form (Ras<sup>V12</sup>), which has been shown to inhibit Hid activity in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergmann et al., 1998</xref>), can also block Hid-induced autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Juhasz and Sass, 2005</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> salivary glands, the Ras signaling pathway has also been shown to inhibit the autophagy process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry and Baehrecke, 2007</xref>). Based on our loss-of-function findings and these previous gain-of-function studies, we speculate that the Ras&#x02013;Raf&#x02013;MAPK pathway acts upstream to inhibit Hid activity in autophagy.</p><p>Poor nutrition has a dramatic effect on egg production in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Flies fed on a protein-deprived diet showed an increase in cell death in germaria and midstage egg chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drummond-Barbosa and Spradling, 2001</xref>). These two stages have been proposed to serve as nutrient status checkpoints where defective egg chambers are removed before the investment of energy into them. The molecular mechanisms of germarium cell death are still largely unknown, and Daughterless, a helix-loop-helix transcription factor, was the only known regulator involved in cell death of germaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). Nurse cell death during mid-oogenesis is also different from most developmental cell death in other <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> tissues because apoptotic regulators such as <italic>rpr</italic>, <italic>hid</italic>, or <italic>grim</italic> are not required for cell death in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peterson et al., 2007</xref>). However, the activity of caspases, particularly Dcp-1, was shown to be required for mid-oogenesis cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laundrie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baum et al., 2007</xref>). Our findings implicate several additional genes, <italic>Dcp-1</italic>, <italic>Bruce</italic>, <italic>Atg7</italic>, and <italic>Atg1</italic>, in nutrient deprivation&#x02013;induced cell death in the germarium, as well as during mid-oogenesis.</p><p>Other forms of cell death, such as autophagic cell death, have been proposed previously to be involved in the elimination of defective egg chambers during mid-oogenesis. Known signaling pathways, including the insulin and ecdysone pathways, have been shown to be required not only for the survival of nurse cells in mid-oogenesis; they are also known to regulate the autophagy process, supporting the notion that autophagy plays a role in mid-oogenesis cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drummond-Barbosa and Spradling, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCall, 2004</xref>). Features of autophagy were observed during <italic>D. virilis</italic> mid-oogenesis cell death as shown by monodansylcadaverine staining and transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Velentzas et al., 2007</xref>). Our results using GFP-LC3 and LTG demonstrate that autophagy occurs in degenerating midstage egg chambers and also in germaria of nutrient deprived <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. We found that mutation of <italic>Atg7</italic> results in a significant decrease of autophagy in dying mid-stage egg chambers and in germaria of starved flies, further supporting the presence of autophagy during these stages.</p><p>The role of autophagy in cell survival or cell death is still not well resolved and is likely to be context dependent. Our results show that autophagy contributes to the cell death process in the ovary. Loss of Atg7 or Atg1 activity in both dying midstage egg chambers and germaria leads to decreased TUNEL staining, which indicates a reduction in DNA fragmentation. Consistent results were observed previously in the larval midguts of <italic>Atg7</italic> mutants, which also showed an inhibition of DNA fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Juhasz et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, lack of autophagy function does not appear to affect nuclear DNA condensation in nurse cells. Nurse cells in degenerating stage 8 egg chambers of starved <italic>Atg7</italic> mutants or <italic>Atg1</italic> GLCs appeared to still have condensed nuclei, as shown by DAPI staining (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, B and D</xref>). Thus, based on <italic>Atg7</italic> and <italic>Atg1</italic> mutant analyses, autophagy contributes to DNA fragmentation but not all aspects of nurse cell death. Future studies are required to determine how autophagy is connected to known pathways leading to DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation during cell death.</p><p>The IAP family member Bruce was shown previously to repress cell death in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vernooy et al., 2002</xref>). Bruce was also shown to protect against excessive nuclear condensation and degeneration, perhaps by limiting excessive caspase activity, during sperm differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arama et al., 2003</xref>). Other IAP family members have been shown to bind caspases via a BIR domain and inhibit apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Riedl and Shi, 2004</xref>). The presence of a BIR domain in Bruce suggests that it may also have caspase-binding activity. We found that lack of Bruce function resulted in an increase in both LTR and TUNEL staining in germaria and degenerating midstage egg chambers. Thus, the <italic>Bruce</italic> mutant-degenerating phenotype in ovaries suggests that Bruce might function normally to restrain or limit caspase activity in this tissue. Because we found that Dcp-1 and Bruce are both required for the regulation of autophagy and DNA fragmentation in germaria and dying midstage egg chambers, it is possible that Bruce acts to bind and degrade Dcp-1 in nurse cells under nutrient-rich conditions. Future studies using epistasis and protein interaction analyses will be required to test this prediction. We cannot rule out the possibility that other IAP proteins, such as DIAP1, and other caspases also play a role during these stages. However, at least in response to starvation signals, Bruce and Dcp-1 play a nonredundant dual role in the regulation of autophagy and cell death in the ovary.</p><p>Numerous studies have linked caspase function to apoptosis, but recent findings indicate that caspases are also required for nonapoptotic processes including immunity and cell fate determination (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kumar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kuranaga and Miura, 2007</xref>). We have shown here that Dcp-1 is also required for starvation-induced autophagy. In the ovary, it appears that both apoptotic and autophagic events occur in the germaria and midstage egg chambers after nutrient deprivation. It is possible that Dcp-1 coordinates autophagy and apoptosis at these two nutrient status checkpoints to ensure elimination of defective egg chambers in the most efficient manner possible. <italic>Dcp-1</italic> mutants exhibit intact nuclei in stage 8 defective egg chambers, which indicates a block in both DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation, and further supports a dual regulatory role for Dcp-1 in mid-oogenesis cell death. Dcp-1 might function to induce autophagosome formation while coordinately acting upon alternate proteolytic targets to complete execution of apoptosis. Future studies to elucidate upstream regulators and downstream substrates of Dcp-1 in cells undergoing autophagy or apoptosis will help to establish the regulatory mechanisms governing the crosstalk between these two cellular processes. Given the multiple cellular effects associated with autophagy, our results also have important therapeutic implications for the use of modulators of caspase or IAP activity in the treatment of cancer and other diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture conditions</title><p><italic>D. melanogaster l(2)mbn</italic> cells (provided by A.
