Oesophageal adenocarcinoma arises from Barrett's oesophagus, progresses rapidly and is usually fatal. The contribution of perturbed TGF&#x003b2; signalling in the promotion of metastasis in this disease has not been elucidated. We therefore investigated the role of TGF&#x003b2; in Barrett's associated oesophageal adenocarcinoma using a panel of cell lines (OE33, TE7, SEG, BIC, FLO). 4/5 adenocarcinoma cell lines failed to cell cycle arrest, down-regulate c-Myc or induce p21 in response to TGF&#x003b2;, and modulation of a Smad3/4 specific promoter was inhibited. These hyperproliferative adenocarcinoma cell lines displayed a TGF&#x003b2; induced increase in the expression of the extracellular matrix degrading proteinases, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), which correlated with an invasive cell phenotype as measured by <italic>in vitro</italic> migration, invasion and cell scattering assays. Inhibiting ERK and JNK pathways significantly reduced PAI and uPA induction and inhibited the invasive cell phenotype. These results suggest that TGF&#x003b2; Smad-dependent signalling is perturbed in Barrett's carcinogenesis, resulting in failure of growth-arrest. However, TGF&#x003b2; can promote PAI and uPA expression and invasion through MAPK pathways. These data would support a dual role for TGF&#x003b2; in oesophageal adenocarcinoma.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transforming Growth Factor &#x003b2; (TGF&#x003b2;), and the components of its signal transduction pathway, are known to demonstrate tumour suppressor activity. In many human cancers, there are inactivating mutations in components of the TGF&#x003b2; pathway resulting in uncontrolled proliferation. In addition, through its actions on both the tumour cells and the surrounding stromal cells, TGF&#x003b2; can enhance invasion, motility and metastasis. TGF&#x003b2; can thus play a dual role in the initiation and malignant progression of human cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000177-Akhurst1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000177-Masui1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>TGF&#x003b2; signalling occurs through activation of type I and II trans-membrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, which leads to the phosphorylation of Smad 2 and 3. This complex, in association with Smad 4 translocates to the nucleus resulting in transcriptional activation of downstream targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000177-Liu1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The anti-proliferative effects of TGF&#x003b2; in normal epithelial cells are achieved through the inactivation of cyclin dependent kinases (cdk) 2, 4 and 6, which lead to cell cycle arrest. This is mediated by the rapid induction of the cdk4/6 inhibitor p15<sup>INK4B</sup>, and the cdk2 inhibitor p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup>. Another key event in TGF&#x003b2; mediated cell cycle arrest involves the repression of c-Myc. This transcription factor binds the promoters of p15<sup>INK4B</sup> and p21<sup>CIP1/WAF1</sup> and suppresses their expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000177-Bailey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Rapid transcriptional down-regulation of c-Myc by TGF&#x003b2; relieves this repression, allowing binding of the heteromeric Smad complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000177-Seoane1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

As a result there is stimulation of angiogenesis and upregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) degrading proteinases.

Recent <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence suggests that inactivation of SMAD4, lack of RUNX3 and inability to degrade SnoN may be some of the causes for the unresponsiveness of oesophageal cancer to TGF&#x003b2; anti-proliferative effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000177-Torquati1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000177-Onwuegbusi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

To determine whether TGF&#x003b2; can simultaneously affect proliferation (cell cycle, c-Myc and p21 expression) and invasion indices (ECM proteinase expression and functional invasive characteristics) in oesophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines; 2). To elucidate the cell signalling pathways involved in these responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Lack of anti-proliferative response to TGF&#x003b2;</title><p>First, the effect of TGF&#x003b2; on cell cycle progression and expression of cell cycle associated genes, p21 and c-myc, was assessed. The control experimental conditions were cells treated with serum free media (SF), which is known to induce cell cycle arrest, and cells treated with SF media followed by release into the cell cycle by complete media (C), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). All cells maintained in serum free media for 24 h demonstrated an increase in the proportion of cells in G0/G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g001">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>). The cells were also arrested by stimulation with UV light as determined by a BrdU incorporation assay (data not shown). However, when cultured in the presence of TGF&#x003b2; (T) only 1/5 BE adenocarcinoma cell lines (OE33), exhibited an increase in the fraction of cells in G0/G1 (11&#x00025; OE33 p&#x0003c;0.05), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g001">Fig 1A, 1B</xref>). Since the inhibition of proliferation in response to TGF&#x003b2; would be expected to occur as a result of an up-regulation of p21<sup>CIP/WAF1 </sup>and a decreased expression of c-Myc, the effect of TGF&#x003b2; on these mRNA expression levels was examined. Real time PCR demonstrated that only OE33 cells exhibited a significant increase in p21 and decrease in c-Myc expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>), (p&#x0003c;0.05 in both cases). TGF&#x003b2; is thus unable to significantly alter the expression of c-myc and p21 mRNA, and halt cell cycle progression in 4/5 BE invasive adenocarcinoma cell lines. This is in keeping with our previous data on cell proliferation measured using the MTT assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000177-Onwuegbusi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Impaired Smad-dependent transcriptional regulation</title><p>Nuclear translocation of Smad 2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and phosphorylation of Smad 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g003">Fig 3B</xref>) were observed in all cell lines following stimulation with TGF&#x003b2;. Nuclear accumulation of Smad2/3 in BIC, which does not express Smad4, confirms early work suggesting that Smad4 is not necessary for Smad 2/3 nuclear translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000177-Liu1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The nuclear translocation of Smad 2/3 and of the phosphorylation of Smad 2 and 3 attest to the functionality of the TGF&#x003b2; pathway. However, the cells remain unable to decrease their proliferation as a result of TGF&#x003b2; stimulation. Therefore, to determine whether the inability of TGF&#x003b2; to regulate the cell cycle is secondary to a lack of Smad dependent transcriptional regulation we used a (CAGA)<sub>12</sub>-luciferase reporter. The lack of Smad 4 expression in BIC makes this cell line the perfect negative control for transcriptional regulation of the TGF&#x003b2; pathway. BIC and SEG both display no transcriptional activity while the low transcriptional activity in TE7 and FLO may not be sufficient to trigger an anti-proliferative response. Only the TGF&#x003b2; responsive cells, OE33, demonstrated a marked induction of transcriptional activity in TGF&#x003b2; treated cells compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) (68&#x000b1;5.5; p&#x0003c;0.01). Hence, the non-responsiveness to the anti-proliferative effects of TGF&#x003b2; may be due, at least partly, to a lack of Smad-dependent transcriptional regulation, which might stem from Smad4 inactivation, the inability to degrade SnoN and possibly other unknown mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000177-Edmiston1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000177-Onwuegbusi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>MAPK dependent TGF&#x003b2; induction of genes associated with ECM regulation</title><p>The ability of TGF&#x003b2; to regulate the genes uPA and PAI, which are associated with ECM modulation, was then assessed. All cell lines, with the exception of BIC up-regulated either PAI and/or uPA in response to TGF&#x003b2;. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>; OE33, FLO p&#x0003c;0.001; TE7, SEG p&#x0003c;0.05 for PAI and OE33, SEG, FLO p&#x0003c;0.01; TE7, p&#x0003c;0.05 for uPA). TGF&#x003b2; was thus able to up-regulate the expression of both genes associated with ECM modulation in 4/5 cell lines, including three lines (TE7, SEG and FLO) that lacked Smad-dependent transcriptional responses and growth suppression by TGF&#x003b2;.</p><p>To characterise the molecular basis for the differential responses of the cell lines to TGF&#x003b2;, we analysed some of the Smad independent kinase pathways known to activate genes associated with ECM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000177-Derynck1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> Overall, the levels of phosphorylated JNK did not vary following TGF&#x003b2; treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The levels of phosphorylated Akt and ERK1/2 were increased in TE7 (1.6 and 5.3 fold respectively) and SEG (1.7 and 1.8 fold respectively) following 4 hours of stimulation with TGF&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000177.s002">Figure S1</xref> shows densitometry data). Only pAKT was increased in OE33 (1.8 fold) following treatment but very little variation was observed in BIC and FLO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000177.s002">figure S1</xref>). There was no change in total expression levels of these kinases (data not shown). BIC cells did not show an induction of uPA, PAI and Smad independent kinase pathways and were therefore not studied further.</p><p>Inhibition of PI3Kactivity by LY294002 resulted in a variable effect on PAI expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Specifically, in OE33 and SEG, TGF&#x003b2; induced up-regulation of PAI mRNA was significantly diminished by LY294002 (OE33, SEG p&#x0003c;0.001). Inhibition of ERK activity by PD98059 significantly diminished TGF&#x003b2; induced up-regulation of PAI mRNA in all cell lines (OE33, TE7 p&#x0003c;0.05; SEG p&#x0003c;0.001; FLO p&#x0003c;0.01), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Following inhibition of JNK activity by SP600125 there was a reduction of the TGF&#x003b2; induced up-regulation of PAI by a minimum of 50&#x00025; in all cell lines analysed (p&#x0003c;0.05 for all cell lines). These findings were generally confirmed for a second of each class of kinase inhibitor (wortmannin, U0126 and Curcumin), (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000177.s001">table S1</xref>), although ERK inhibition with UO126 was less effective than PD98059 possibly because of differential specificity of these inhibitors for MEK1 and 2. A similar pattern was seen when uPA expression was assessed in inhibitor treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Whereas, the effects of PI3K inhibition had a variable effect on uPA expression, inhibition of ERK by PD98059, and inhibition of JNK by SP600125 markedly reduced (by a minimum of 40&#x00025;) the TGF&#x003b2; induction of uPA in all BE adenocarcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Overall, the most consistent results were seen with the JNK inhibitors since both inhibitors (SP600125 and Curcumin) significantly reduced the up-regulation of PAI and uPA in all cell lines, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000177.s001">table S1</xref>).</p><p>Next we determined whether inhibition of these kinase pathways had an effect on PAI and uPA enzyme activity, as well as expression levels. Zymography and reverse zymography indicated that TGF&#x003b2; induces an increase in the proteolytic activity of uPA (increase in the white band intensity), and an increase in the ability of PAI to retard the action of uPA in all cells lines analysed (increase in the dark band intensity), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g007">Fig 7A&#x02013;D</xref>, compare lane C with T). The inhibition of PI3K activity by LY294002, and inhibition of ERK signalling by PD98059 resulted in a variable effect on uPA and PAI activity depending on the cell line (densitometry given as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000177.s003">figure S2</xref>). Inhibition of JNK by SP600125 resulted in the most consistent decrease in activity of uPA and PAI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g007">Figure 7A&#x02013;D</xref>, compare lane T with SP for each cell line with a variation between 0.1 and 0.5 fold on densitometric analysis, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000177.s003">figure S2</xref>). The expression and the enzyme activity data thus suggests that activation of the ERK and JNK pathways is important for TGF&#x003b2; induced up-regulation of PAI and uPA in BE adenocarcinoma cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>TGF&#x003b2; increases invasive cellular properties via activation of kinase pathways</title><p>We determined the ability of TGF&#x003b2; to influence the invasiveness of cells using three <italic>in vitro</italic> assays: aggregation, invasion and wounding. An aggregation assay measures the ability of cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner; invasion assays through matrigel measures the ability of cells to degrade the basement membrane and to migrate through it while the wounding assay only measures the ability of cells to migrate to occupy an empty space. Therefore a highly invasive cell <italic>in vitro</italic> should not form aggregates, should migrate through matrigel and to close up a wound.

In order to examine the effect of kinase inhibitors these were only used in the cells lines exhibiting an increase in their invasive phenotype for a particular assay in response to TGF&#x003b2;.</p><p>Therefore, aggregation was performed for TE7, SEG, FLO and OE33, invasion for TE7, SEG and OE33 and wounding for OE33. With regards to aggregation, the presence of all three kinase inhibitors diminished the cell scattering ability (a higher score denotes less scattering) of TGF&#x003b2; in all the cell lines to a greater or lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). The increase in TGF&#x003b2;-induced invasion observed in TE7, SEG and OE33 cells was significantly inhibited by LY294002 in TE7 cells (p&#x0003c;0.05), by SP600125 in SEG (p&#x0003c;0.05) and by all three inhibitors in OE33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g008">Figure 8B</xref>; p&#x0003c;0.001, LY294002; p&#x0003c;0.01, PD98059; p&#x0003c;0.001, SP600125).

Overall inhibition of the JNK pathway with SP600125 had the most consistent effect seen in SEG, FLO and OE33 in all three of the assays.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>These data suggest a dual role of TGF&#x003b2; in the regulation of both the proliferative and invasive properties of BE adenocarcinoma <italic>in vitro</italic>. 4/5 BE cell lines are unable to mount an anti-proliferative response to TGF&#x003b2;. However, the loss of TGF&#x003b2; responsiveness is selective, such that the same cell lines that fail to exhibit an anti-proliferative response demonstrate a TGF&#x003b2; dependent increase in the expression of PAI and uPA via PI3K, ERK and JNK (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000177-t002">Table 2</xref>). The effect of kinase inhibitors on expression levels and the enzyme activity of uPA and PAI suggest that the ERK and JNK MAPK pathways may play a role.

Given that all of the unresponsive cells in our panel do not demonstrate a TGF&#x003b2; induced increase in transcriptional activity of a TGF&#x003b2; reporter plasmid, defective Smad-mediated signal transduction is a possible underlying mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g003">Figure 3</xref>). However, since the Smad3/4 reporter construct is not the native promoter and may miss possible enhancer or suppressor elements this conclusion must be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, other mechanisms such as the inability to degrade SnoN have been described in oesophageal cells as a possible reason for a lack of responsiveness to TGF&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000177-Edmiston1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In contrast, there was a modest TGF&#x003b2; dependent activation of kinase pathways (PI3K, ERK and JNK MAPK) in BE adenocarcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

Targets of the MAPK pathways ERK and JNK include the transcription factors c-Fos, c-Jun and ATF-2, which can undergo c-Fos/c-Jun or c-Jun/ATF-2 heterodimerisation to form AP-1.

The involvement of PAI and uPA in invasion may explain the functional significance of the inhibition of kinase pathways on the invasive properties of oesophageal adenocarcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g008">Figure 8</xref>). It is worth noting that OE33 was the only cell line that had a demonstrable increase in the SMAD reporter construct as well as increased kinase activity in response to TGF&#x003b2;l. For this cell line it is not possible to rule out a contribution of Smad activation in the TGF&#x003b2;l response of OE33 cells although the invasive properties were significantly reduced by kinase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000177-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>uPA and PAI expression through the activity of ERK and JNK may also be relevant for tumour progression <italic>in vivo</italic>.

The Smad dependent anti-proliferative response is lost; however, the ability of TGF&#x003b2; to induce ECM genes PAI and uPA prevails. This occurs predominantly through the ERK and JNK MAPK pathways, and thus contributes to the invasive properties of the oesophageal tumour cell. Such a differential response utilising different cell signalling pathways may allow TGF&#x003b2; to play a role in both the initiation and progression of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>For this study cell lines derived from Barrett's adenocarcinoma were used.
