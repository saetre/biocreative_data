In diseased vessels, platelets contribute to thrombus formation, leading to vessel occlusion and tissue infarction. Two receptors promote platelet activation through distinct but complementary roles: glycoprotein VI (GPVI), which together with integrin &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 binds collagen, and integrin &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3, which recognizes several ligands, including fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>).</p><p>GPVI associates with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)&#x02013;containing FcR&#x003b3;, which undergoes phosphorylation by Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) after GPVI cross-linking. Once phosphorylated, the FcR&#x003b3; ITAM binds and activates Syk, initiating a signaling cascade that results in platelet spreading, secretion of soluble mediators, and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). For platelet aggregate stabilization under the shear flow conditions of the blood vessels, activation of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 is required. In resting platelets, &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 is present in a low-affinity state and is unable to bind soluble ligands. Agonist-initiated intracellular signals result in increased affinity of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3, a process known as inside-out signaling. Ligand binding to activated &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 then generates a second wave of PTK-initiated signals, known as outside-in signaling, that promotes firm platelet adhesion and spreading. The adaptor protein Src homology 2 (SH2) domain&#x02013;containing leukocyte phosphoprotein of 76 kD (SLP76) is central to the signaling pathways induced by engagement of GPVI and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3.</p><p>SLP76 was originally described as a regulator of TCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), and it functions as a scaffold to nucleate a multimolecular complex after TCR engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). SLP76 was subsequently shown to be important for signaling in other hematopoietic lineages, including platelets. Platelets from SLP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals do not couple GPVI engagement with activation of the downstream signaling cascade, resulting in failed degranulation or aggregation in response to collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). SLP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets show a marked reduction in spreading when adhered to a fibrinogen-coated surface, indicating that SLP76 is critical for signaling downstream of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). These in vitro defects suggested that SLP76 was important for platelet function in vivo. However, it had not been feasible to test this question given the vascular development abnormalities of SLP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that lead to significant hemodynamic compromise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>).</p><p>SLP76 is composed of four modular domains: a C-terminal SH2 domain, a proline-rich region, a sterile &#x003b1; motif domain, and an N-terminal acidic domain that contains three tyrosine phosphorylation motifs (Y<sup>112</sup>ESP, Y<sup>128</sup>ESP, and Y<sup>145</sup>EPP). Phosphorylated Y112 and Y128 are recognized by SH2 domain&#x02013;containing proteins, including Vav (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) and noncatalytic region of tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Y145 is recognized by the Tec family kinases IL-2&#x02013;inducible T cell kinase (Itk) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). The critical role of these N-terminal tyrosines for SLP76 function was initially shown in T cells, where SLP76 with a mutation in all three tyrosines (Y3F) was unable to rescue TCR signaling in SLP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Jurkat cells and failed to rescue T cell development in SLP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Retroviral transduction of SLP76-deficient bone marrow with the Y3F mutant followed by transplant into irradiated recipients resulted in the development of platelets with defects in GPVI and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). The precise mechanism by which these N-terminal tyrosines contribute to SLP76 function during platelet activation is not well understood.</p><p>In this paper, we explore the role of these tyrosines in platelet function in vitro and in vivo. Our data indicate that SLP76 Y145 is essential for normal thrombus formation in a model of arterial injury and that mutation of either Y145 or both Y112 and Y128 results in significant alterations in signaling downstream of GPVI and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3. Generation of knock-in (KI) mice with mutations in SLP76 tyrosines allowed us to ask whether these phosphorylation sites act independently or in combination during SLP76 function. Using a genetic complementation approach, we find that all three phosphorylatable tyrosines are required within the same SLP76 molecule for platelet activation.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Mice with mutant SLP76 tyrosines are resistant to thrombus formation</title><p>Although we and others have documented severe signaling defects in platelets from SLP76-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), it has been impossible to assess the consequences of SLP76 deficiency on platelet function in vivo, because mice lacking this adaptor protein manifest a severe vascular abnormality associated with cardiac hypertrophy, altered hemodynamics, and abnormal connections between blood and lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). This vascular defect is also present in mice in which an SLP76 Y3F mutant is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Recently, we found that mice in which two of these tyrosines (Y112 and Y128) or an individual tyrosine (Y145) have been altered to phenylalanine are born at Mendelian ratios, have no overt vascular phenotype, and have normal platelet counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Therefore, we used these animals to probe the importance of SLP76 and, in particular, its N-terminal tyrosines for in vivo platelet function.</p><p>WT or KI mice expressing SLP76 containing either combined mutations in Y112 and Y128 (Y112/128F mice) or a single mutation in Y145 (Y145F mice) were studied in a model of arterial thrombosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). For these experiments, the carotid artery was exposed for thrombus induction by topical application of 10% FeCl<sub>3</sub>, a protocol that leads to local denudation of the vessel endothelium and exposure of collagen fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). To monitor vessel occlusion, a Doppler flow probe was used to measure the rate of blood flow through the artery, with each experiment lasting 30 min after application of the irritant. A flow rate &#x0003c;0.1 ml/min for the duration of the study was scored as a stable occlusive thrombus. Animals in which blood flow stopped but then resumed were scored as having an unstable thrombus.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Impaired thrombus formation in mice with mutations in SLP76 tyrosines.</bold> (A) Schematic of SLP76 KI mice.

In contrast, 69% (9 out of 13) of Y145F mice never formed a thrombus after injury. Among the four mice that did occlude, the time to initial occlusion was delayed (14.9 &#x000b1; 2.4 min), and two of these animals formed unstable thrombi that embolized soon after formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Y112/128F mice showed a milder defect in thrombus formation, with 25% (3 out of 12) failing to occlude blood flow.</p><p>To visualize platelet aggregation, we modeled thrombus formation ex vivo by examining platelet dynamics under physiological flow conditions. Platelets in whole blood were perfused over collagen at variable shear rates from 400 to 1,300 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 4 min. Blood from WT mice exhibited robust accumulation of densely packed platelets on collagen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Y145F platelets adhered less well to collagen (33.3 &#x000b1; 2.3% surface coverage by Y145F platelets vs. 50.3 &#x000b1; 1.9% surface coverage by WT platelets), and the overall thrombus volume was markedly reduced (0.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> &#x000b1; 0.06 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup> compared with 10<sup>5</sup> &#x000b1; 0.06 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup> as measured from WT samples; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). Platelets from the Y112/128F mice efficiently covered the collagen surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>); however, the overall thrombus volume (0.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> &#x000b1; 0.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup>) tended to be smaller than that seen with WT platelets. Collectively, these data suggest that only Y145 is necessary for firm adhesion to collagen; however, mutation of either Y145 or combined mutations of Y112 and Y128 impairs signaling events necessary for the formation of tight platelet aggregates under flow. These data make it clear that other regions of SLP76 are important for platelet adhesion and aggregate formation on collagen, as the analysis of platelets isolated from SLP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice revealed a much more dramatic phenotype with very few platelets adhering to collagen (0.09 &#x000b1; 0.01% surface coverage at 1,300 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and with a complete absence of detectable aggregates (0.01 &#x000b1; 0.001 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>SLP76 Y145 is critical for GPVI-induced aggregation</title><p>To investigate the mechanism underlying the defect in thrombus formation in SLP76 KI mice, we tested whether Y145F or Y112/128F platelets aggregate in solution in response to collagen. Similar to SLP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets, Y145F or Y112/128F platelets showed a marked defect in aggregation in response to low-dose collagen (2.5 &#x003bc;g/ml; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Raising the collagen concentration increased aggregation in cells from both KI animals; however, platelets from Y145F mice required a much higher collagen concentration (10 vs. 3.3 &#x003bc;g/ml) to reconstitute a normal response (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and C</xref>). In contrast, SLP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets manifested a barely detectable response, even to the highest dose of collagen stimulation, indicating that the Y145 mutation or the combined Y112/Y128 mutation results in a reduction but not a complete loss of SLP76 function.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Y145F mutation inhibits GPVI-mediated platelet aggregation.</bold> (A&#x02013;D) Platelets were stimulated with various doses of collagen (A) or CVX (B), and aggregation was assessed for 5 min.

We measured aggregation in platelets stimulated with the GPVI agonist convulxin (CVX). Before proceeding with the analysis, we confirmed that the cell-surface expression of GPVI is equivalent between SLP76 KI and WT platelets (unpublished data). Y112/128F platelets exhibited a mild reduction in CVX-induced aggregation, with the difference compared with WT cells greatest at the lowest (0.2 nM) dose of agonist (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and D</xref>). Strikingly, aggregation of Y145F platelets was completely abolished, with only a minor shape change in response to the highest concentrations (1 nM) of CVX. SLP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets exhibited minimal responses to high-dose CVX (as high as 5 nM was tested). To ensure that the abnormal responses were restricted to SLP76-dependent pathways, we stimulated platelets from all mice with two G protein&#x02013;coupled receptor agonists (ADP or thrombin) and observed normal aggregation responses (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080240/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080240/DC1</ext-link>; and not depicted).</p><p>The fact that the Y145F platelets responded, albeit less well, to collagen but not to CVX suggests that the function of the integrin &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 may be retained in the setting of this SLP76 mutation. To test &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 function in platelets from the SLP76 KI mice, we used a blocking mAb directed against the &#x003b1;2 component of the integrin. Although blocking &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 on WT platelets resulted in slightly delayed aggregation to collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), this same treatment completely inhibited the collagen response of Y145F platelets, even at high collagen concentrations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Y112/128F platelets showed an intermediate phenotype in which inhibition of &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 significantly reduced but did not completely abrogate the collagen response. These results indicate that aggregation of SLP76 KI platelets to higher doses of collagen relies on &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1. Thus, the abnormal aggregation phenotype of the mutant platelets appears to be caused by decreased signaling via GPVI in Y112/128F platelets and a complete lack of this response in Y145F platelets.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b1; Granule secretion and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation are reduced in Y112/128F and severely defective in Y145F platelets</title><p>After GPVI stimulation, platelet aggregation is accompanied by secretion of &#x003b1; granule contents.

To investigate the contribution of SLP76 tyrosines to GPVI-induced &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation, platelets from WT or SLP76 KI mice were stimulated with CVX in the presence of soluble fluorophore-conjugated fibrinogen. Resting platelets from all mice bound fibrinogen poorly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Similar to what we observed for P-selectin up-regulation, the combined Y112/128F mutation resulted in a smaller increase in fibrinogen binding relative to WT cells (9.6 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x02013; vs. 14.8 &#x000b1; 0.9&#x02013;fold induction relative to the resting state), a response that was absent in SLP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets. The Y145F mutation dramatically reduced the ability of GPVI signaling to couple to increased fibrinogen binding (5.6 &#x000b1; 2.6&#x02013;fold induction relative to the resting state).

Stimulation of WT cells with CVX led to a dramatic increase in SLP76 phosphorylation using the panphosphotyrosine-specific antibody 4G10 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, lane 2). In SLP76 Y112/128F cells, phosphorylation of Y145 was greatly diminished (lane 4). Because residues 112, 128, and 145 are the only tyrosine phosphorylation sites detected by 4G10 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), these results indicate a dependency of intact Y112 and/or Y128 for optimal Y145 phosphorylation. Furthermore, Y145 and Y128 show cooperation in phosphorylation of Y128. Using a phospho-specific antibody to Y128, we found a decrease in Y128 phosphorylation in Y145F platelets (bottom blot, lane 2 vs. lane 6). In five separate experiments, quantification of Y128 phosphorylation revealed a decrease ranging from 30 to 50%. These data suggest that the diminished phosphorylation of SLP76 from the Y145F cells observed using 4G10 (top blot, lane 2 vs. lane 6) is likely caused by loss of Y145 and diminished phosphorylation of Y128. This reduction in the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues is not caused by diminished levels of SLP76 expression (top and bottom blots, lane 2 vs. lanes 4 and 6). The altered phosphorylation of the SLP76 mutants is also not caused by decreased PTK activity, as activation of Syk and phosphorylation of its substrate linker for activation of T cells (LAT) are not affected in the SLP76 KI platelets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Optimal phosphorylation of SLP76, Btk, and PLC&#x003b3;2 is dependent on synergy between Y112, Y128, and Y145 during GPVI signaling.</bold> Washed platelets from various mouse strains were left unstimulated (&#x02212;) or stimulated with 0.8 nM CVX (&#x0002b;) for 90 s (A and C&#x02013;F) or for 30 and 90 s (B) in the presence of apyrase.

Because a high CVX concentration (1 nM) induces a nearly normal aggregation response in Y112/128F but not in Y145F platelets, we investigated the dose dependency of CVX on GPVI-induced PLC&#x003b3;2 phosphorylation in KI cells.

SLP76 was shown to be central for platelet activation in vitro, but its role in vivo was unknown. In this study, we show that mice containing mutations in SLP76 tyrosines manifest significant alterations in signaling downstream of collagen receptor GPVI and integrin &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 in vitro and are protected, to varying degrees, from thrombus formation in vivo.</p><p>Mobilization of intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and the duration of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling have been shown to play critical roles in platelet secretion, integrin activation, and the formation of stable platelet aggregates in flowing blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Y145F and Y112/128F KI platelets exhibit impaired secretion and aggregation responses and form smaller thrombi under flow. The reduction in PLC&#x003b3;2 phosphorylation observed in KI platelets after GPVI stimulation suggests that compromised Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling could underlie these functional defects.</p><p>Based on studies in cell lines from several laboratories (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>), a model emerged positing that Y112 and Y128 are both required for SLP76 to associate with Vav and that Tec family PTKs bind to Y145; however, there are other domains of SLP76 that may contribute to this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). We predicted that SLP76 isolated from the Y112/128F mice would not associate with Vav and that the interaction between Y145F SLP76 and Itk in T cells or Btk in platelets would be diminished. Therefore, we were surprised to find no evidence of diminished binding between the tyrosine mutants of SLP76 and their binding partners, either in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) or in platelets. Thus, we focused on whether the SLP76 partner proteins Btk and Vav were modified after GPVI stimulation.</p><p>We examined inducible Btk phosphorylation in platelets from WT and SLP76 mutant mice. The absence of SLP76 results in a marked reduction in GPVI-stimulated phosphorylation of Btk (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), suggesting failed induction of its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), and inducible Btk phosphorylation was only marginally rescued by the expression of SLP76 Y145F. Thus, we speculate that one possible mechanism by which SLP76 tyrosines regulate PLC&#x003b3;2 activation and intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is by affecting GPVI-induced Btk activity. If a major function of Y145F is to facilitate Btk activation, the signaling phenotype of Y145F platelets should be similar to Btk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or to mice that are deficient in both Btk and its family member Tec. Indeed, although Btk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets are not as defective as Y145F platelets in response to GPVI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), Btk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>Tec<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets have a phenotype similar to that of Y145F mice.</p><p>In contrast to Y145F cells, platelets expressing Y112/Y128F show only mild defects in GPVI-mediated platelet activation. The fact that phosphorylation of Btk was also diminished in Y112/128F cells suggests that another biochemical event may be differentially preserved in these cells. We detected a selective loss of Vav phosphorylation in Y145F but not in Y112/128F platelets stimulated via GPVI. Vav plays a critical role in platelet activation, at least in part by regulating GPVI-induced PLC&#x003b3;2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). These results were surprising, as we predicted that Vav phosphorylation may be preserved in Y145F platelets and absent in Y112/128F platelets, as seen in the T cell compartment of these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Although the cause of the reduced Vav phosphorylation in Y145F and not Y112/128F mice remains unknown, this defect likely contributes to the differential impairment of GPVI signaling observed in Y145F versus Y112/128F platelets.</p><p>The most severe phenotype of Y112/128F platelets was in outside-in signaling by &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3. Our preliminary studies indicate that Vav1 phosphorylation was diminished in Y112/128F downstream of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 engagement. Vav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>Vav3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets exhibit reduced spreading on fibrinogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), consistent with our findings. We speculate that SLP76 via Y112 and/or Y128 may help recruit Vav proteins to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3, where they can be phosphorylated by Syk and facilitate actin reorganization. It is intriguing to speculate that defective platelet spreading might account for the smaller aggregate size in Y112/128F platelets compared with WT in an in vitro thrombus formation assay.</p><p>Comparing biochemical and functional readouts of GPVI and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 signaling, we find that the mutant that exhibits more profound GPVI signaling defects (Y145F) also shows a more severe thrombosis defect. These results agree with evidence indicating a significant role for GPVI signaling in collagen-mediated platelet activation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). There is also compelling evidence that &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 is important for thrombus formation, because mice deficient in &#x003b2;3 integrin are protected against thrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Studies of Y112/128F platelets indicate that although it is necessary for fibrinogen-dependent platelet spreading, the role of SLP76 in outside-in signaling by &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 appears less important for thrombus formation. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the contributions of SLP76-dependent signals downstream of GPVI versus &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 to platelet activation in vivo.</p><p>The generation of mice containing complementary mutants of SLP76 provided a unique opportunity to study SLP76 functions in vivo. Our simplistic prediction was that two SLP76 molecules with complementary phosphorylation sites would become part of a larger signaling network and complement each other in trans, thus rescuing the defective functional responses seen in platelets that express either Y112/128F or Y145F. We found that Y112/128F and Y145F mutants do not complement each other during GPVI signaling. One potential explanation for this lack of cooperation is that mutations in individual tyrosines disrupt phosphorylation of the adjacent sites, thus making complementation improbable. Indeed, our results suggest that phosphorylation of SLP76 tyrosines occurs in a coordinated fashion, demonstrating interdependence between Y128 and Y145 sites.</p><p>In contrast to the lack of complementation in platelets, coexpression of Y112/128F and Y145F mutants within the T cell compartment rescues the defective T cell development and function found in the individual Y112/128F or Y145F mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). One potential explanation for the difference between T cells and platelets is the mechanism by which ITAMs of the GPVI or TCR are coupled to an SLP76-nucleated complex. Although both SLP76 and LAT are essential for TCR signaling, SLP76 can support signaling downstream of GPVI in the absence of LAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). A recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>) demonstrated that LAT oligomerizes after TCR cross-linking, which could allow for the transactivation of the signaling proteins associated with LAT, such as SLP76. LAT clustering has not been shown in platelets. Alternatively, the number of ITAMs available to support signaling in T cells (10 ITAMs) versus platelets (2 ITAMs) may allow for the formation of a larger complex, which might be necessary for the complementation of these mutations. A similar requirement for cis-mediated adaptor function has been demonstrated for SLP65&#x02013;B cell linker (a two ITAM&#x02013;containing signaling complex), where two complementary mutations in tyrosines responsible for binding PLC&#x003b3;2 were not able to complement each other to support BCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Thus, SLP76 family adapters might function to nucleate a single molecular scaffold, but if organized into larger oligomerized complexes and supported by multiple ITAMs, as they potentially are in T cells, multiple SLP76 molecules could cooperate in trans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Reagents.</title><p>Antibodies were purchased from the following vendors: 4G10 and Vav1 (Millipore); pSLP76 (Y128; BD Biosciences); mouse SLP76 (eBioscience); pPLC&#x003b3;2 (Y1217), pSyk (Y525/526), pLAT (Y191), PLC&#x003b3;2, and p38 (Cell Signaling Technology); and Syk, PLC&#x003b3;2, Vav, and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.).
