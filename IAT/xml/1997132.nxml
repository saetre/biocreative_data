Strong selection in favour of the &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>allele &#x02013; a consequence of protection from severe malarial infection afforded by heterozygotes &#x02013; has been associated with a high degree of extended haplotype similarity. The relationship between classical &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes and long-range haplotype similarity may have both anthropological and clinical implications, but to date has not been explored. Here we evaluate the haplotype similarity of classical &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes over 400 kb in population samples from Jamaica, The Gambia, and among the Yoruba of Nigeria (Hapmap YRI).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The most common &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>sub-haplotype among Jamaicans and the Yoruba was the Benin haplotype, while in The Gambia the Senegal haplotype was observed most commonly. Both subtypes exhibited a high degree of long-range haplotype similarity extending across approximately 400 kb in all three populations. This long-range similarity was significantly greater than that seen for other haplotypes sampled in these populations (P &#x0003c; 0.001), and was independent of marker choice and marker density. Among the Yoruba, Benin haplotypes were highly conserved, with very strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) extending a megabase across the &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>mutation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Two different classical &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes, sampled from different populations, exhibit comparable and extensive long-range haplotype similarity and strong LD. This LD extends across the adjacent recombination hotspot, and is discernable at distances in excess of 400 kb. Although the multi-centric geographic distribution of &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes indicates strong subdivision among early Holocene sub-Saharan populations, we find no evidence that selective pressures imposed by <italic>falciparum </italic>malaria varied in intensity or timing between these subpopulations. Our observations also suggest that <italic>cis</italic>-acting loci, which may influence outcomes in sickle cell disease, could lie considerable distances away from &#x003b2;-globin.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The sickle mutation (&#x003b2;<sup>s</sup>) of the beta-globin locus (HBB), which in the homozygous state gives rise to sickle cell anaemia, is associated with five "classical" haplotypes, each with different geographic distributions across sub-Saharan Africa, Arabia and India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes were first identified by the presence or absence of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in the 70 kilobases (kb) surrounding HBB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and subsequently found to be characterized by strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) across a 'hot spot' of recombination just 5' of HBB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The multi-centric geographical distribution of classical &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes reflects the recency of strong selection pressures imposed by <italic>falciparum </italic>malaria on local human populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Classical &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>haplotypes.

Five other <italic>globin </italic>synthesis genes are shown along with the approximate positions of four RFLP sites used to designate the five classical &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>haplotypes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-8-52-1"/></fig><p>Classical &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes are named according to their putative geographical origins &#x02013; Benin, Bantu (Central African), Cameroon, Senegal and Arab. In general, within ethnic groups in which the &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>allele has a high frequency, one particular &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotype usually predominates; for instance, the Senegal &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotype is the most commonly observed &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotype in Senegal, although the Benin haplotype is also present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The Benin haplotype is very common (~92%) among the Yoruba in Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and also is common in Jamaica (~71%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], although Bantu and Senegal types also occur in the Jamaican population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The geographical distribution of classical &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes has been attributed to independent origins of the &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] but the role of gene conversion in the transfer of the original mutation(s) between haplotypes has also been discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Possession of the &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>allele in the heterozygous form (HbAS) confers a very strong protection against severe malarial infection compared to mutant (HbSS) and wild-type (HbAA) homozygotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This selective advantage results in a rapid increase in the frequency of the &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>allele over several generations in regions of high malarial endemicity. This rise in frequency occurs at a faster rate than meiotic recombination can break down the haplotype background on which the allele first arose. Therefore, like other recently selected alleles such as those found in the <italic>glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase </italic>or <italic>lactase </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>allele would be expected to maintain its ancestral haplotypic relations over a relatively long genetic distance. We previously used the &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>allele as a practical example of recent selection in our description of <sc>HAPLOSIMILARITY</sc>, a method of evaluating long-range haplotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Using 20 high-frequency SNP markers spaced across 414 kb in a sample of Gambian cord bloods we demonstrated a high degree (approximately 60%) of similarity among haplotypes associated with the &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This was considerably higher than haplotype similarity scores for surrounding alleles and also higher than neutral expectations derived from coalescent simulations.</p><p>To date, the relationship between classical &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes and the long-range similarity expected of haplotypes associated with the &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>allele has not been defined. A better understanding of classical &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes is of particular relevance to anthropological and population genetic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and may also be useful for understanding the varying clinical outcomes seen among individuals with sickle cell disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, we chose to extend the results of our previous study by investigating &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotype similarity in two additional populations; specifically asking whether classical &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes demonstrate strong haplotype similarity over extended physical distances (ie over hundreds of kb). To do so, we analyzed 76 &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>chromosomes from Jamaica, identified in a sample of 30 HbSS individuals and a sample of 133 participants from a population survey, as well as 16 &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>chromosomes from 60 unrelated Yoruba participants in the International HapMap Project. We then contrasted these results with the analysis of 37 &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>chromosomes identified in our previous study of 191 cord blood samples in The Gambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Jamaican &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotype similarity</title><p>In the Jamaican population, 26 SNPs met our selection criteria (see Methods) and these were used to construct haplotypes over approximately 200 kb both 5' and 3' of the &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>allele (a total of 400 kb &#x02013; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Fifty-eight of the 76 &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes identified (76%) were of the Benin type. Thirty-six (68%) of these Benin haplotypes were identical across 400 kb investigated, and several of the remaining haplotypes differed from the common haplotype at only two or three loci (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>SNPs used for haplotype construction in Jamaicans.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">rs number<sup><italic>a</italic></sup></td><td align="center">Chr loc<sup><italic>a</italic></sup></td><td align="center">Dist from HbS (bp)<sup>b</sup></td><td align="center">Alleles<sup><italic>c</italic></sup></td><td align="center">MAF<sup><italic>d</italic></sup></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">rs872165</td><td align="center">5381108</td><td align="center">-176300</td><td align="center">C/A</td><td align="center">0.29</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs1498468</td><td align="center">5367607</td><td align="center">-162799</td><td align="center">T/C</td><td align="center">0.33</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs2647598</td><td align="center">5332852</td><td align="center">-128044</td><td align="center">T/C</td><td align="center">0.41</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs7929631</td><td align="center">5324552</td><td align="center">-119744</td><td align="center">T/G</td><td align="center">0.33</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs7938837</td><td align="center">5319683</td><td align="center">-114875</td><td align="center">C/G</td><td align="center">0.28</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs3898917</td><td align="center">5284937</td><td align="center">-80129</td><td align="center">G/T</td><td align="center">0.27</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs3888708</td><td align="center">5274956</td><td align="center">-70148</td><td align="center">C/A</td><td align="center">0.89</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs2156918</td><td align="center">5253468</td><td align="center">-48660</td><td align="center">C/G</td><td align="center">0.23</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs2855122</td><td align="center">5233812</td><td align="center">-29004</td><td align="center">A/G</td><td align="center">0.42</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Xmn1</td><td align="center">5232745</td><td align="center">-27937</td><td align="center">-/+</td><td align="center">0.10</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hind3</td><td align="center">5231293</td><td align="center">-26485</td><td align="center">-/+</td><td align="center">0.44</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hind3</td><td align="center">5226375</td><td align="center">-21567</td><td align="center">-/+</td><td align="center">0.12</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs916111</td><td align="center">5225919</td><td align="center">-21111</td><td align="center">A/T</td><td align="center">0.17</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs2071348</td><td align="center">5220722</td><td align="center">-15914</td><td align="center">A/C</td><td align="center">0.10</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hinc2</td><td align="center">5217034</td><td align="center">-12226</td><td align="center">-/+</td><td align="center">0.15</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs16911905</td><td align="center">5205866</td><td align="center">-1058</td><td align="center">G/C</td><td align="center">0.29</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs11036364</td><td align="center">5205580</td><td align="center">-772</td><td align="center">A/G</td><td align="center">0.24</td></tr><tr><td align="left">HbS (rs334)</td><td align="center">5204808</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">A/T</td><td align="center">0.06</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs4910726</td><td align="center">5156896</td><td align="center">47912</td><td align="center">A/C</td><td align="center">0.17</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs4910722</td><td align="center">5153293</td><td align="center">51515</td><td align="center">A/G</td><td align="center">0.20</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs4910715</td><td align="center">5132596</td><td align="center">72212</td><td align="center">G/T</td><td align="center">0.48</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs2472523</td><td align="center">5123701</td><td align="center">81107</td><td align="center">G/A</td><td align="center">0.06</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs2472527</td><td align="center">5118600</td><td align="center">86208</td><td align="center">T/C</td><td align="center">0.05</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs7114854</td><td align="center">5100498</td><td align="center">104310</td><td align="center">A/C</td><td align="center">0.20</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs17497</td><td align="center">5014184</td><td align="center">190624</td><td align="center">G/C</td><td align="center">0.44</td></tr><tr><td align="left">rs2499953</td><td align="center">4967481</td><td align="center">237327</td><td align="center">A/G</td><td align="center">0.26</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup><italic>a </italic></sup>&#x02013;

The HS score is a measure of the mean similarity of haplotypes calculated by assessing the frequency of distinct haplotypes in smaller, overlapping, sliding windows (see Methods). HS scores range from small values approaching zero (all haplotypes are distinct) to one (all haplotypes are the same). We modified the existing algorithm to determine confidence limits for the estimates of haplotype similarity by bootstrapping the sample of haplotypes 1000 times. The HS score for Jamaican &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>Benin haplotypes was 0.689 (95% CI 0.685 &#x02013; 0.693). By contrast, haplotypes that were identical to the Benin type, as defined by RFLPs, but associated with the major allele (&#x003b2;<sup>A</sup>, N = 93) had an HS score of 0.132 (95% CI 0.131 &#x02013; 0.133) which was significantly less (P &#x0003c; 0.001) than the score for the &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>Benin haplotypes.</p><p>We also considered whether the high degree of haplotype similarity among &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>Benin haplotypes was simply the consequence of a relatively small number of &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>Benin haplotypes having a higher similarity by chance. To do so, we constructed 1000 samples of haplotypes that were not of the &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>Benin type (i.e. both &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>and &#x003b2;<sup>A </sup>non-Benin haplotypes); each sample consisted of the same number of haplotypes as the number of &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>Benin chromosomes present in the dataset. The mean HS score (HS = 0.133, 95% CI 0.132 &#x02013; 0.134) of these non-&#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>Benin haplotypes was significantly lower (P &#x0003c; 0.001) than that obtained for &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>Benin haplotypes, suggesting that the high degree of haplotype similarity observed for &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>Benin haplotypes was unlikely to be the consequence of sampling error.</p></sec><sec><title>Yoruba &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes</title><p>We wanted to determine whether our observations were unique to the Jamaican population, as well as ascertain the extent to which the strong similarity of &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>Benin haplotypes might have been the result of the relatively low marker density employed (one SNP per 16 kb). To do this we utilized SNPs genotyped in Yoruba family trios (the YRI dataset, see Methods) of the International HapMap Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>We first considered parental haplotypes constructed from family trios (see methods) using 181 SNPs spaced across the same 400 kb investigated in the Jamaican sample. Using this increased marker density (&#x02248; 1 SNP every 2 kb), 14 of the 15 &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes observed were noted to be of the Benin type (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Again, a high degree of haplotype similarity was noted among the haplotypes (HS = 0.805, 95% CI 0.802 &#x02013; 0.808), and, as before, this was significantly higher (P &#x0003c; 0.001) than that observed among equivalent samples of non-&#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>Benin haplotypes (mean HS = 0.221, 95% CI 0.220 &#x02013; 0.222). Thus, a high degree of &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>haplotype similarity appears to be a general feature of &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>Benin haplotypes which is independent of both the country of origin and the marker density used to construct the haplotype. This strong haplotype similarity was also reflected in the pattern of LD around the &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>allele in this population. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the SNP corresponding to the &#x003b2;<sup>S</sup>/&#x003b2;<sup>A </sup>allele demonstrated strong LD (mean D' 0.830) with alleles of almost all markers across the 400 kb investigated, and this extended across the 5' recombination hot spot.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Pattern of HBB LD in Yoruba.

Without <italic>a priori </italic>knowledge of the extent or rate of LD decay along the chromosome, we arbitrarily chose to consider haplotype similarity over a distance of 1 Mb. To do so, an additional 220 SNPs were added from the HapMap YRI dataset, providing a final set of 401 SNPs to cover approximately 500 kb on either side of &#x003b2;<sup>S</sup>. Five of the 14 &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>Benin haplotypes were identical across the 1 Mb evaluated, and the haplotypes still exhibited a high degree of similarity (HS = 0.702, 95% CI 0.698 &#x02013; 0.706).</p></sec><sec><title>Gambian &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes</title><p>We also re-evaluated the similarity among &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>haplotypes analysed in our previous studies in the Gambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. RFLP genotypes were not available in this dataset so we examined haplotypes constructed from the six SNPs genotyped in the 70 kb surrounding the &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>allele (see Methods). Using these markers we found that a single haplotype dominated the distribution, comprising 30 of the 37 haplotypes evaluated (81%). Although we were unable to assign this 'most common' haplotype to one of the classical haplotype groups with absolute certainty, it is of a similar frequency to that expected for the Senegal &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotype in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, when compared to other markers in the same 70 kb region, this 'most common' Gambian haplotype was clearly different from the &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>Benin haplotypes observed in the other two populations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These observations, taken together, suggest that this 'most common' haplotype represents the Senegal &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotype. Analysis of this 'SNP-defined' Senegal haplotype revealed a high degree of long-range haplotype similarity (HS = 0.827, 95% CI 0.825 &#x02013; 0.829), wherein 16 (51%) of the haplotypes were identical across the entire 400 kb region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Most common Gambian &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>haplotypes.

To our knowledge this is the first time that classically described &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>haplotypes have been shown to extend over such long genomic distances. We were also able to demonstrate that this conserved &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>haplotype similarity was related to a pattern of strong extended LD around the &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>allele. Comparable results were found for three different population groups, using differing markers and marker densities. The number of other classical &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>haplotypes in the groups sampled was not large enough for us to make definitive statements about all classically-described &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>haplotypes; however, since the high degree of haplotype similarity we observed is almost certainly the result of recent selection, and the selective force underlying these observations &#x02013; severe malaria infection &#x02013; also applies to other &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>haplotypes, it seems likely that a high degree of long-range haplotype similarity will be seen on other &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>chromosomes as well. Our findings provide a framework for further investigating the anthropology of the &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>allele, including its selection dynamics across the African Diaspora and the origin of classical &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>haplotypes, and may have implications for other selected alleles in the genome as well as for the search for genetic modifiers of sickle cell disease.</p><p>As an example, Afro-Caribbean and African &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes have differing demographic and social histories, with concomitant differences in the duration and extent of malarial selection pressure on the allele. The large-scale importation of slaves from Africa to Jamaica some 400 years ago, forcibly moved persons from an area where the selective force in favour of the &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>allele was strong &#x02013; malaria remains a major cause of mortality in equatorial Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], to one where the selective force was substantially less &#x02013; endemic malaria is not likely to have been a major cause of mortality in Jamaica and was eradicated from the island in 1963 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We might then expect differences in malarial selection between African and Afro-Caribbean populations. Similarly, the strong geographic sub-division of &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>haplotypes across Africa, which presumably resulted from sub-division of early Holocene sub-Saharan Africans, suggests potential differences in the duration and intensity of malaria among the African population groups sampled as well. These observations suggest that we might have expected significant differences in the degree of haplotype similarity across the three populations.</p><p>The HS score in Jamaica was quantitatively less than that in Africa, albeit using differing marker sets and sample sizes. Conversely, a comparison of HS scores generated using only the 16 SNPs that were typed in all three populations, did not demonstrate significant differences between populations (data not shown), despite the expectation of selection differences between the two African groups and even more so between the African groups and the Jamaican sample. This observation is somewhat surprising, although there are likely to be other forces at work which are not accounted for in our appraisal. In the Jamaican population, for instance, there is the potential influence of genetic drift, admixture of sickle haplotypes from across Africa, as well as the non-random survival of individual sickle haplotypes; in our sample the frequency of Benin &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>haplotypes among population samples (68%) was similar to that in &#x003b2;<sup>S</sup>&#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>individuals (78%), albeit with differing sample sizes. Equally, it may be that the differences in the selection pressures themselves are too subtle, too complex, or too recent to affect LD patterns of common SNPs/RFLPs. This would be beneficial for detecting selection from population-based surveys such as the HapMap project, which is already being used as a tool to screen for recently selected alleles in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. A more extensive evaluation of LD/haplotype decay in larger and more diverse datasets with a denser set of markers would help to clarify this.</p><p>There remains some uncertainty surrounding the implications of the 5' recombination 'hot spot', both with regard to the origin of the &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>allele and to signals of recent selection around HBB. For instance, using sequence data over 5.2 kb, Wood et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] found that the recombination hotspot was responsible for attenuation of the haemoglobin C selection signal (HbC); however, strong LD extending over 100 kb and across the &#x003b2;-globin recombination hot spot has also been described in relation to positive malarial selection of the Hemoglobin E (HbE) allele in Southeast Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In our dataset, using the Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (EHH) score of the Long-range Haplotype test (LRH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we did not find any substantive differences in haplotype homozygosity between common &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes 5' of &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>and those extending 3' of &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>in either Jamaican or Gambian samples (the EHH score is the probability that any two haplotypes extending outwards from a core haplotype or SNP will be the same at a given distance away from the SNP &#x02013; see Methods). Among the Yoruba, 5' haplotypes appeared to have less similarity and a steeper decline in similarity than 3' haplotypes over 200 kb, but at 1 MB, 5' and 3' haplotypes had comparable degrees of similarity (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). The inconsistency of these preliminary results precludes definitive statements about either the impact of the recombination hot spot on the signature of &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>selection or the contribution of gene conversion to the origin of classical &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>haplotypes; however, a combined approach of short-range sequencing and dense long-range SNP data may help to resolve some of these issues.</p><p>Lastly, we offer a note on the potential clinical relevance of our findings. The extent of LD between markers on the haplotypes evaluated may have implications for studies of genetic modifiers of sickle cell disease. To date, such studies have used the strong LD in the surrounding 70 kb to generate hypotheses about local variants that are likely to modulate the HbSS phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Future attempts to identify genetic modifiers of sickle cell disease will have to account for the extended LD observed here, which may require a consideration of cis-acting variants or genes located hundreds to thousands of kilobases away. This approach may provide new candidate loci that either modulate the sickle phenotype or influence traits such as hereditary persistence of foetal haemoglobin, which are known to modify clinical outcomes in the beta-haemoglobinopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that common &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>haplotypes from different populations exhibit a high degree of haplotype similarity, with concomitant strong LD, over hundreds of kilobases despite the adjacent 5' recombination hotspot. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this has been described. These findings suggest little support for differences in selective pressures on &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>between major population subdivisions, and may have implications for association studies of genetic modifiers of sickle cell disease in <italic>cis </italic>with the &#x003b2;-globin cluster. Further studies, using both simulated and actual data from multiple populations, are needed to clarify the effects of recombination and population demography on long-range haplotype similarity and LD in the region of this well-established example of a recently selected allele.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>DNA samples from Jamaican adults were obtained by randomly sampling from a population survey that has been described in detail previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

All study samples were anonymised. Use of these samples for the purposes of this study was approved by the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI)/University of the West Indies (UWI) Faculty of Medical Sciences Ethics committee. Gambian DNA samples were extracted from a set of cord bloods recruited at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Faraja, The Gambia. Permission for the collection, storage and use of these samples for genetic research was granted by the Joint Gambian Government/MRC Ethics Committee. Cell lines from individuals used in Phase 1 of the HapMap project from the Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI dataset) were obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] as transformed B-lymphocytes from peripheral blood (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> for sample details).

SNPs were chosen on the basis of validation (preferably in an African-related population), available frequency data, and a desired SNP density of approximately one SNP per 10 kb. Chosen SNPs (including the HbS SNP) were genotyped using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (SEQUENOM) on PEP DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] in 137 Jamaican population samples (SNP assay details are available in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). SNPs with greater than 10% missing data, genotypes not consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P &#x0003c; 0.01), or minor allele frequencies &#x0003c; 5% were then excluded, resulting in a final set of 22 SNPs. The frequency of the HbS haplotype was 6% in the population sample, which compares favourably with the 5% figure obtained in larger-scale surveys of Jamaicans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Five RFLP sites were additionally genotyped in the same samples using the restriction enzymes Hinf I, Hinc II, Hind III in HbG1, Hind III in HbG2, and Xmn I. Hinf I digests were uninformative as there were multiple Hinf I sites in the amplified PCR fragment; the remaining restriction digests were therefore used to define classically-described &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes. SNP selection and typing in the 380 Gambian cord blood samples was very similar to the procedure used for the Jamaican samples, and has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Publicly available SNPs genotyped in the YRI dataset from HapMap release #20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] were chosen from a one megabase region spanning first 200 kb and then 500 kb on either side of the &#x003b2;<sup>S </sup>allele (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). SNPs were chosen on the basis of being polymorphic in the population sampled, having passed HapMap quality control measures, and providing an approximate marker density of one SNP per 2 kb (N = 398). Three RFLP sites &#x02013; Hind III in HbG1, Hind III in HbG2, and Xmn I (see below)- and the HbS SNP (see above) were independently genotyped in the same samples, for a total of 401 SNPs. Along with SNP rs968857 (which is the same as the Hinc II RFLP), these were used to define classically-described &#x003b2;<sup>s </sup>haplotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>RFLP genotyping</title><p>HBB PCR Primers (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>) used to amplify products for RFLP genotyping were designed with careful consideration of the high degree of homology in the region due to gene duplication; this resulted in relatively large amplification fragments. The HBG2 fragment (2734 bp in length) amplified the HBG2 gene and contained restriction sites for both Hind III and Xmn1. The HBG1 fragment (2909 bp in length) amplified the HBG1 gene and contained the restriction site Hind III. The HBB fragment (1200 bp in length) amplified the HBB gene and contained the restriction site Ava II. The recognition site for Hinc II was in an intergenic region with unique flanking sequence, so a small fragment of 118 bp containing it was amplified.</p><p>For each PCR reaction 2 &#x003bc;l of genomic DNA at 5 ng/&#x003bc;l was added to 6 &#x003bc;l of PCR mix.

The PCR mix was the same for all fragments except HBG1 (2909 bp) for which 3.3 &#x003bc;l of each of the forward and reverse primers was used.</p><p>PCR protocols for the HBG1 and HBG2 RFLP fragments consisted of an initial five cycle denaturation of 96&#x000b0;C for 1 minute, 94&#x000b0;C for 45 seconds, 62&#x000b0;C for 2.5 minutes, and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 minute; followed by a 29 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 45 seconds, 65&#x000b0;C for 2.5 minutes, and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 minute, and a final extension of 72&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes and 15&#x000b0;C for 15 minutes. The PCR protocol for the Hinc2 fragment differed only with regard to the main cycling conditions which required an annealing temperature of 65&#x000b0;C for 45 seconds and an extension temperature of 72&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds. The HBB fragment did not require the initial 5 cycle denaturation; instead 35 cycles consisting of 96&#x000b0;C for 1 minute, 94&#x000b0;C for 45 seconds followed by an annealing temperature of 56&#x000b0;C for 45 seconds, and a 72&#x000b0;C extension for 1 minute was used.</p><p>Restriction enzymes and their buffers were ordered from New England BioLabs (Ipswich, MA, USA); digests were carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
