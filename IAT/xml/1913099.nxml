We used oligonucleotide microarrays to monitor (in vitro) differential gene expression in group A streptococci during pharyngeal cell adherence, the first overt infection stage. We present neighbor clustering, a new computational method for further analyzing bacterial microarray data that combines two informative characteristics of bacterial genes that share common function or regulation: (1) similar gene expression profiles (i.e., co-expression); and (2) physical proximity of genes on the chromosome. This method identifies statistically significant clusters of co-expressed gene neighbors that potentially share common function or regulation by coupling statistically analyzed gene expression profiles with the chromosomal position of genes. We applied this method to our own data and to those of others, and we show that it identified a greater number of differentially expressed genes, facilitating the reconstruction of more multimeric proteins and complete metabolic pathways than would have been possible without its application. We assessed the biological significance of two identified genes by assaying deletion mutants for adherence in vitro and show that neighbor clustering indeed provides biologically relevant data.

Several factors, however, limit the power of such analyses, including inadequate statistical analysis and insufficient sample replication, both of which do not account for experimental variability, and often result in arbitrary thresholds for significance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, unknown bacterial genes can confound the interpretation of expression profiles, restricting many microarray studies to the differential expression of well-characterized genes.</p><p>Several methods are available to organize gene expression profiles and to assist in extracting functional or regulatory gene information from microarray datasets. Clustering algorithms group genes by similarities in expression patterns, based on the assumption that co-expressed genes share common function or regulation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;; however, clustering solely by co-expression patterns may not reveal a considerable amount of information contained in array data. These methods often: (1) produce unreliable data by missing known gene members of biological pathways; (2) fail to distinguish truly related gene clusters from coincidental groupings; and (3) identify clusters containing only unknown genes that may lack either common function or regulation, a considerable limitation for genomes containing a large percentage of undefined genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. Because no tools exist to interpret unknown gene clusters or to assess their significance and completeness, a significant portion of bacterial expression profiles are not interpretable using current clustering methods.</p><p>We introduce neighbor clustering as a new tool for analyzing bacterial microarray data that addresses some of these limitations by incorporating the physical position of genes on the bacterial chromosome into the analysis of expression data. Information about gene function and regulation is stored intrinsically in the bacterial genome structure, as genes with common function or regulation tend to be physically proximate on the chromosome and often linked as operons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. We incorporated these positional data into a series of neighbor clustering algorithms, named GenomeCrawler, that identifies groupings of potentially related genes from array data by combining two informative characteristics of bacterial genes that share common function or regulation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b003">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;: (1) similar gene expression profiles (i.e., co-expression); and (2) physical proximity of genes on the chromosome. The algorithms also recalculate the statistical significance of each gene as a member of a particular cluster, as well as the significance of each resulting grouping as a whole, to ensure accuracy of cluster assignments. This process ultimately identifies significant clusters of co-expressed gene neighbors that likely share common function or regulation.</p><p>We used this approach to analyze microarray expression data from group A streptococci <italic>(Streptococcus pyogenes)</italic> during adherence to human pharyngeal cells, the first overt infection step &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. The ability of all bacterial pathogens to infect the human host depends upon coordinated regulation of diverse gene sets that are required for survival in host environments. Although recent microarray studies have highlighted the molecular responses of streptococci in relevant host conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, characterizing differentially expressed loci during pharyngeal cell adherence is critical for understanding the molecular basis for host colonization.

Although the mechanisms mediating these responses are not known, the results of these studies indicate that streptococci sense and, on a transcriptional level, respond to various signals and cues in the pharyngeal cell environment.</p><p>We undertook the present study to understand and to assess more accurately the genome-wide transcriptional responses of streptococci during one of the earliest recognized stages of infection, namely adherence to human pharyngeal cells. We compared data generated before and after neighbor clustering to show that this method provides a more comprehensive view of transcription by: (1) identifying more differentially expressed genes than even traditional, rigorous statistical analyses; (2) reconstructing intact biological pathways that statistical significance analysis could not reconstruct; and (3) providing preliminary insight and clues about the function or regulation of uncharacterized genes by associating their co-expression with physically proximate, functionally defined genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Adherence-Mediated Differential Expression</title><p>We developed spotted oligonucleotide arrays of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pyogenes</named-content> SF370 (an M1 serotype) genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d; and compared the transcriptomes of streptococci that adhere to Detroit 562 human pharyngeal cells to non-adherent (&#x0201c;associated&#x0201d;) streptococci within the same experiment.

Furthermore, SpeB abolishes internalization (following adherence) of certain streptococcal strains by epithelial cells (including Detroit 562 cells), a process mediated in part by the fibronectin-binding protein F &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;.

For example, RopB (encoded by <italic>spy2042</italic>), a member of the Rgg family of response regulators, interacts with a number of regulatory networks throughout the streptococcal genome (e.g., <italic>mga, csrRS, sagA, and fasBCA</italic>), affecting the transcription of numerous proteins, virulence factors, and two-component regulatory systems &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. Although the delineation of genes influenced by RopB (or any identified transcriptional regulator) is beyond the scope of this study, our initial analysis did identify the upregulation of a two-component regulatory system, encoded by <italic>spy1236&#x02013;1237</italic>. The functions of these particular loci are not yet known, and their adherence-mediated upregulation represents new targets in the study of regulators that function during host cell contact.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Neighbor Clustering</title><p>Our initial analysis revealed the differential expression of a wide range of functionally diverse genes and provided insight into the adaptive response of streptococci to host cell contact. However, despite a rigorous statistical approach, this analysis, like many previous microarray studies, identified the differential expression of a large number of unknown genes (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 21) and a number of incomplete biological pathways (e.g., F0F1 ATPase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d; and folate biosynthesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;) by failing to detect the differential expression of a number of known gene pathway members (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030132-t001">Table 1</xref>). To overcome these limitations and to extract more functional information from the array dataset (including more complete biological pathways), we developed the neighbor clustering algorithms to combine the physical position of genes on the streptococcal chromosome with gene expression data. Neighbor clustering was designed to identify expanded groupings of potentially related genes from our array data by incorporating two reliable predictors of genes that share common function or regulation, namely physical proximity and similar expression profiles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We implemented this approach by developing an algorithm with dynamic windowing (GenomeCrawler) that sequentially stepped through the microarray data and identified clusters of adjacent genes exhibiting similar fold changes in expression. Because the genome contains many possible clusters, we restricted the algorithm's search space to identify only spatially related clusters. GenomeCrawler applied a separate permutation algorithm, using the sum of each gene's <italic>t-</italic>statistics to calculate adjusted <italic>P</italic> values (<italic>P</italic><sub>K</sub>) for each cluster, which corresponded to the probability of assembling a cluster by chance. Significance was assigned to clusters with <italic>P</italic><sub>K</sub> &#x0003c; 0.05, and the resulting groupings are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030132-t003">Table 3</xref>. Because individual genes could be members of many different significant clusters, GenomeCrawler then applied a distinct permutation algorithm to calculate the probability (<italic>P</italic><sub>C</sub>) that a gene was clustered coincidentally. Calculation of <italic>P</italic><sub>C</sub> values relies on Bayes' Theorem, in which the probability of a gene's log<sub>2</sub>-fold change (<italic>P</italic><sub>F</sub> value) is combined with the cluster probability itself (<italic>P</italic><sub>K</sub> value). We stress that <italic>P</italic><sub>C</sub> reflects the significance of a gene based on its cluster context rather than a recapitulation of <italic>P</italic><sub>F</sub>. This ensures a strong dependency between <italic>P</italic><sub>F</sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub>C</sub>, preventing a gene with a relatively low log<sub>2</sub>-fold change from being scored as significant simply because it is clustered with a gene with a highly significant <italic>P</italic><sub>F</sub> value. Finally, GenomeCrawler calculated the overall significance of differentially expressed genes (<italic>P</italic><sub>E</sub> values) by integrating differential expression probabilities (<italic>P</italic><sub>F</sub>) and cluster context probabilities (<italic>P</italic><sub>C</sub>). We developed a plotting application (GenomeSpyer) that represents the chromosome as a linear molecule to visualize GenomeCrawler output, with genes displayed on the <italic>x</italic>-axis and their log<sub>2</sub>-fold change magnitudes on the <italic>y</italic>-axis.

For example, the nine-gene operon that spans genes <italic>spy0738&#x02013;0746</italic> encodes streptolysin S, a potent cytolytic toxin that promotes internalization and host tissue dissemination &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. Though the differential expression of the individual genes was not significant following our initial statistical analysis, GenomeCrawler identified a significant downregulated cluster containing all nine genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030132-t003">Table 3</xref>). Adherence-induced downregulation of streptolysin S is consistent with its previously determined role in host cell internalization &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;; however, without neighbor clustering, expression of this operon was not evident immediately.</p><p>Although individual gene members of Type I clusters may not be statistically significant as a result of technical variability within experiments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, the genetic structure of certain Type I operons may provide an alternative explanation. For example, the streptolysin operon encodes an internal terminator downstream of the <italic>sagA</italic> gene (the first gene in the operon), which modulates the abundance of particular mRNA species (e.g., <italic>sagA</italic> mRNA versus the polycistronic message for all nine genes) under different environmental conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. If transcription is internally disrupted by such a terminator, the abundance of the <italic>sagA</italic> transcript may be much greater than the polycistronic message; such disproportionate transcript levels would affect log<sub>2</sub>-fold change values and impact the statistical significance of individual genes within these types of clusters. Thus, in addition to helping resolve clusters that would not be easily recognized because of experimental technical variability, the neighbor clustering method may help to resolve operons with such internal terminators and regulators.</p><p>These results demonstrate that neighbor clustering effectively reconstructed a number of complete pathways and loci from processed array data. Importantly, because functional gene data are not incorporated into its algorithms, GenomeCrawler is not biased toward identifying &#x0201c;expected&#x0201d; clusters. Curating the dataset following its application may make the algorithms less user-friendly; however, the elimination of such bias is essential for this type of analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Type II Clusters</title><p>Based on the Type I cluster results, we speculated that genes contained in Type II clusters might be related by function or regulation. Type II groupings contain a combination of both known and unknown gene members and could provide preliminary clues about the function of unknown genes within a particular cluster by associating their expression with neighboring genes of known and defined function. Alternatively, co-expression of genes results from common regulation, and Type II associations may suggest shared regulatory mechanisms for clustered genes. We note, however, that despite the statistical framework with which groupings are assigned, experimental evidence is necessary to confirm functional or regulatory relatedness.

A total of 256 genes reported in this study were also detected by our analysis, and the magnitude and log<sub>2</sub>-fold change were found to be in agreement for 81&#x00025; of the genes.

However, these results provided further supporting evidence that the GenomeCrawler algorithms can identify (1) a larger group of genes than a rigorous statistical analysis alone and (2) biologically relevant groupings in other microarray datasets, even if they contain fewer replicates than presented in our study.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>Although GenomeCrawler improves bacterial array analyses, it has limitations: it cannot identify regulons comprising genes dispersed throughout the genome by virtue of its design, it does not specifically interrogate single-gene operons, and it only applies to genomes with available and accurate experimental information (expression data and gene annotations). We recognize that incorporating intergenic distance and transcription direction into the algorithms would reduce processing time. Adding available clusters of orthologous groups (COG) information into a downstream processing step could decrease errors by minimizing clustering of unrelated genes.</p><p>Nonetheless, neighbor clustering provided a more comprehensive view of the transcriptome of group A streptococci during adherence to human pharyngeal cells, a critical step in the infection program of this organism. We found that even a rigorous statistical analysis of well-replicated microarray data produced a dataset that was somewhat limited, although certainly more informative than assigning arbitrary thresholds for significance. As described in other microarray reports, we had initially identified a number of incomplete biological pathways in which we did not detect the differential expression of a number of known pathway members. Neighbor clustering was able to extend the results by identifying more differentially expressed genes and reconstructing more intact biological pathways.</p><p>Neighbor clustering, despite the statistical framework with which it assigns groupings, would be valuable to microarray data analysis only if it produced biologically relevant data. Although biological testing of every identified gene or cluster is unrealistic, we provided evidence, through the creation and testing of isogenic deletion mutants and through the identification of clusters of known, functionally related genes from a published streptococcal array study, that the algorithms produce results that are pertinent to the biology of streptococci. This may be of particular importance for data in which the relationship between clustered genes is not obvious, and may facilitate the organization of larger datasets into more meaningful packages. It is also possible that GenomeCrawler (in its current form) could be used to interrogate intergenic portions of the genome (such as those encoding small noncoding RNAs or sRNAs), if probes representing such regions were included on the microarray, and experimental conditions were designed to promote their differential expression. Finally, because of the common architecture of bacterial chromosomes, the neighbor clustering algorithms may be applicable to microarray datasets from other prokaryotes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Spotted oligonucleotide microarrays.</title><p>Sense strand oligonucleotides (primarily 55-mers), representing the 1,769 open reading frames in the genome of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pyogenes</named-content> strain SF370 (M1 serotype) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d; were designed and produced by Illumina (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.illumina.com">http://www.illumina.com</ext-link>).

During the assignment of neighbor clusters, we did not associate genes with functional annotations to prevent biasing the formation of clusters toward those that were &#x0201c;expected.&#x0201d; The GenomeCrawler algorithm, written in the statistical language R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org">http://www.R-project.org</ext-link>), steps through the expression data and identifies adjacent gene groupings that exhibit similar expression fold changes. The algorithm varies window size and applies a gap penalty for including in a cluster those genes that we did not observe experimentally to be present or genes that did not exhibit differential expression between sample and control.</p><p>GenomeCrawler calculates statistical significance of all putative resulting neighbor clusters (<italic>P<sub>K</sub></italic> value), using a permutation algorithm with the sum of the <italic>t</italic>-test statistics (generated by Cyber-T) from each gene within a given cluster as the metric for comparison. We then inspected the output visually and disqualified groupings that violate the neighbor cluster definition based on established guidelines for functionally coupled gene pairs: genes occur on the same DNA strand and adjacent genes are separated by &#x02264;300 bp &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030132-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. We further restricted qualifying clusters to contain genes with a uniform direction of differential expression (i.e., all upregulated or all downregulated). Visual inspection is necessary because we have not yet had success at incorporating these specific parameters into the algorithms. To emphasize the importance of such inspections, we included the output prior to disqualifications for comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030132-st004">Table S4</xref>). We disqualified the following groupings: 491 contained genes located on different DNA strands; 127 contained adjacent genes separated by greater than 300 bp; and 24 contained genes that did not exhibit a uniform direction of expression. Since a specified gene could be a member of many different clusters, the cluster that generated the lowest <italic>P<sub>K</sub></italic> value &#x02264; 0.05 and met all of the defined conditions of a neighbor cluster (as detailed in the text) is the one that we reported. The GenomeSpyer algorithm, also written in R, provides a method to view the GenomeCrawler output and to visualize clusters and their respective gene members. The GenomeSpyer plots of all datasets derived from this study can be found as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030132-sg002">Figures S2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030132-sg004">S4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3n"><title>Theoretical basis for GenomeCrawler.</title><p>Conceptually, <italic>P</italic><sub>F</sub> reflects the physical change in gene expression between sample and control, whereas <italic>P</italic><sub>C</sub> reflects the significance of a gene in the context of a cluster and is based on combined information about genome structure (i.e., genome position) and activity (i.e., measured changes in expression). <italic>P</italic><sub>C</sub> reflects the cluster context and is not merely a recapitulation of the effect related by <italic>P</italic><sub>F</sub> for an individual gene, because on its own the <italic>P</italic><sub>F</sub> of a single gene is not sufficient to generate an informative <italic>P</italic><sub>C</sub> (i.e., <italic>P</italic><sub>C</sub> &#x0003c;&#x0003c; 1).
