In vertebrates, a great deal is known about muscle specification as well as how somitic cells, as a cohort, generate the early myotome. However, the cellular mechanisms that generate long muscle fibers from short cells and the molecular factors that limit elongation are unknown. We show that zebrafish fast muscle fiber morphogenesis consists of three discrete phases: short precursor cells, intercalation/elongation, and boundary capture/myotube formation. In the first phase, cells exhibit randomly directed protrusive activity. The second phase, intercalation/elongation, proceeds via a two-step process: protrusion extension and filling. This repetition of protrusion extension and filling continues until both the anterior and posterior ends of the muscle fiber reach the MTJ. Finally, both ends of the muscle fiber anchor to the MTJ (boundary capture) and undergo further morphogenetic changes as they adopt the stereotypical, cylindrical shape of myotubes. We find that the basement membrane protein laminin is required for efficient elongation, proper fiber orientation, and boundary capture. These early muscle defects in the absence of either <italic>laminin&#x003b2;1</italic> or <italic>laminin&#x003b3;1</italic> contrast with later dystrophic phenotypes in <italic>laminin&#x003b1;2</italic> mutant embryos, indicating discrete roles for different laminin chains during early muscle development. Surprisingly, genetic mosaic analysis suggests that boundary capture is a cell-autonomous phenomenon. Taken together, our results define three phases of muscle fiber morphogenesis and show that the critical second phase of elongation proceeds by a repetitive process of protrusion extension and protrusion filling. Furthermore, we show that laminin is a novel and critical molecular cue mediating fiber orientation and limiting muscle cell length.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Despite the importance of muscle fiber development and tendon attachment, this process is incompletely understood in vertebrates. One critical step is muscle fiber elongation; muscle precursor cells are short and subsequent elongation/fusion generates long, multinucleate muscle fibers. Using a vertebrate model organism, the zebrafish, we find that single round myoblasts elongate to span the entire width of the myotome prior to fusion. Using rigorous and objective mathematical characterization techniques, we can further divide muscle development into three stages: short precursor cells, intercalation/elongation, and boundary capture/myotube formation. The second phase, elongation, occurs via a two-step mechanism of protrusion extension and filling. Myotube formation involves boundary capture, where the ends of muscle fibers anchor themselves to the myotome boundary and stop elongating. We show that the protein laminin is required for boundary capture, normal fiber length, and proper fiber orientation. Genetic mosaic experiments in laminin-deficient embryos reveal that boundary capture is a cell autonomous phenomenon. Wild-type (normal) cells capture the boundary appropriately and stop elongating in laminin-deficient embryos. Although adhesion to laminin has been implicated in muscular dystrophies where the attachment between muscle cells and tendons fails, no early developmental requirements for laminin in fast muscle morphogenesis have been shown until now.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Muscle specification and morphogenesis during early development are critical for normal muscle physiology. In vertebrates, most of the musculature is derived from somites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Hollway1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Buckingham1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Somites are segmentally reiterated structures delineated by somite boundaries. As development proceeds, a portion of the somite gives rise to skeletal muscle fibers that comprise the myotome. The terminal ends of myotomal muscle fibers attach to somite boundaries, which then become myotome boundaries. In teleost fishes, myotome boundaries give rise to the myotendinous junction (MTJ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Long1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Myotome development is perhaps best understood in amniotes.

The first myocytes to translocate come from the dorsomedial lip, but later in development myocytes translocate from all dermomyotome borders as well as the central region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Kahane1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-BenYair1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Time-lapse analysis in the chick embryo has shown that spatial domains of the somite differ in cell behaviors that generate the primary myotome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Gros1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The above studies have elucidated cell movements that generate the myotome. However, although it is known that short, mononucleate, muscle precursor cells generate long, functional multinucleate muscle fibers, it is not known how this occurs. Interestingly, the early zebrafish and chick myotomes have been described as containing mononucleate muscle fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Gros1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Waterman1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Our intent in undertaking this study was to utilize the advantages of the zebrafish system to shed light on early muscle development in a vertebrate model.</p><p>Elucidation of the cellular mechanisms that underlie muscle fiber development and tendon attachment is critical for a comprehensive understanding of muscle development. Towards this end, muscle morphogenesis has been studied in different model systems. C2C12 myoblasts in culture elongate slightly prior to differentiation, align with each other, and fuse to generate a multinucleate myotube <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Ohtake1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. We have called this scenario elliptical growth. In grasshopper embryos, the first muscle cells elongate between attachment sites prior to fusion. These cells extend many processes in multiple directions while elongating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Ho1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. We have termed this scenario branching. Elegant studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have shown that muscle morphogenesis occurs when myoblasts fuse to generate long, multinucleate myotubes and identified a number of proteins required for myoblast fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Beckett1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Chen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Extremely exciting recent studies have shown that there is some conservation of molecular mechanisms that mediate muscle cell fusion between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Moore1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Srinivas1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

This suggests that myoblast fusion does not mediate the earliest stages of muscle morphogenesis in vertebrates, but occurs after initial muscle fiber elongation. These distinct mechanisms of morphogenesis in different systems highlight the fact that a mechanistic study of muscle fiber morphogenesis in vertebrates has not yet been undertaken. Identification of discrete morphogenetic steps that mediate muscle fiber morphogenesis in vertebrates is necessary to provide a framework for future molecular analyses.</p><p>Adhesion of muscle fibers to the basement membrane is critical for muscle function. The basement membrane attaches muscle fibers to connective tissue that then attaches to the skeletal system; this attachment is critical for force transduction from muscle to bone. One major component of the basement membrane is laminin. Laminin is a heterotrimeric protein composed of &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits that generate at least 15 different isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-LeBleu1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The importance of laminins in muscle physiology is evidenced by the fact that mutations in <italic>lam&#x003b1;2</italic> result in muscular dystrophies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Hoffman1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Nigro1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

In order to determine whether the basement membrane is critical during early development for muscle fiber elongation and attachment, it is first necessary to understand the cellular basis of muscle fiber elongation and attachment.</p><p>The relative simplicity of zebrafish skeletal muscle, where slow and fast-twitch fibers are spatially segregated, makes it an ideal model system to study muscle cell elongation and MTJ morphogenesis.

We focused on fast-twitch fiber morphogenesis in zebrafish embryos. Our goal was to develop methods with which discrete functions for proteins involved in muscle morphogenesis could be identified. Towards this goal, we utilized time-lapse analysis, genetic mosaic analysis, and three different mathematical tools including a powerful wavelet-based image analysis formalism to provide novel insight into cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie muscle fiber elongation and subsequent attachment to the nascent MTJ.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Three Phases of Fast-Twitch Muscle Cell Elongation</title><p>Although the elongation of somitic cells is critical for actin-mediated contractility that underlies muscle function, the cellular and molecular basis of elongation in vertebrates is not well understood.

This type of time-lapse analysis, where all cells are labeled, provides an initial framework with which to focus further investigation into fast-twitch fiber morphogenesis.

The difference between the fusion and remaining scenarios is the timing of fusion relative to elongation. In the fusion scenario, fusion of short myoblasts is the major morphogenetic event that drives fiber elongation. Fusion of multiple short cells generates a long, multinucleate myotube in one step as in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Beckett1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In the remaining scenarios, cells elongate prior to fusion. We analyzed nuclear content of elongating and recently elongated cells and found that mononucleate fast-twitch cells elongate to the MTJ prior to fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000219-g004">Figure 4F&#x02013;H</xref>, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;108 cells). Thus, the first fast-twitch fibers in zebrafish do not fuse prior to elongation.</p><p>The remaining scenarios are branching, elliptical growth, and protrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000219-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The difference between the branching scenario and the elliptical growth/protrusion scenarios is the amount, size, and direction of protrusive activity. In grasshopper, the first muscle cells to elongate have extensive protrusions in many different directions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Ho1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. This is depicted in the branching scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000219-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, the elliptical growth and protrusion scenarios depict cells that elongate in a fixed direction. Both time-lapse analysis and analysis of cell morphology in fixed embryos indicate that fast-twitch fibers in zebrafish embryos elongate in a fixed direction and do not exhibit a branching morphology with multiple protrusions extended in different directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000219-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000219-g004">4</xref>). Rather, fast-twitch cells extend long (&#x0003e;4 &#x000b5;m) protrusions along their long axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000219-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000219.s004">Movie S3</xref>). These results indicate that the branching scenario does not apply to initial fast-twitch muscle morphogenesis in zebrafish.</p><p>The two remaining scenarios differ in the nature of elongation. The elliptical growth scenario depicts elongation as a continuous process reminiscent of a balloon filling. The protrusion scenario suggests that elongation is incremental and proceeds via a 2-step mechanism: protrusion extension and protrusion thickening. Time-lapse analysis suggests that fast-twitch cells extend protrusions that subsequently thicken (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000219-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000219-g002">2</xref>). Geometrical models were developed and used to determine how area and perimeter would change through time if cells were elongating via the two different scenarios. The major difference between the two models is the nature of dynamic changes in area and perimeter during elongation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref> for details). Area and perimeter increase linearly in the elliptical growth model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000219-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and incrementally in the protrusion model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000219-g003">Figure 3 A1</xref>). The incremental nature of growth in the protrusion model is because the perimeter increases slightly more when the protrusion extends, but the area increases slightly more when the protrusion thickens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000219-g003">Figure 3 A1</xref>). Therefore the difference between the two models is how area and perimeter values change as the cell grows: linear changes occur in the elliptical growth model and incremental changes in the protrusion model. In all cells examined, the rate of area increase is higher than the rate of perimeter increase as is predicted by both models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000219-g003">Figure 3 B3</xref>). However, area and perimeter increase incrementally during fast-twitch muscle cell elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000219-g003">Figure 3 B1, B2</xref>). Thus, analysis of area and perimeter dynamics supports the two-step intercalation model.</p><fig id="pgen-1000219-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000219.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Mathematical Analysis of Area and Perimeter Dynamics.</title><p>A) Geometric modeling of relative changes in area and perimeter that would result if cells elongated as ellipses, as if they were filling like balloons.

The filament index of these cells was also similar to live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000219-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Fast-twitch cells in this phase were mononucleate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000219-g004">Figure 4 H</xref> shows one focal plane of a mononucleate cell that is elongated but irregularly shaped when examined in three dimensions, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000219.s005">Movie S4</xref>, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;108).

These data suggest the intriguing possibility that the transition from an irregularly shaped long cell to a rod-shaped myotube may involve fusion. Our use of dextran-labeled cells in a field of unlabeled cells clearly highlights the morphological complexity of elongating fast-twitch muscle cells and indicates that it is not possible to unambiguously identify multinucleate cells utilizing a nuclear marker as well as a marker that denotes all cells (such as phalloidin). Thus, we do not know the exact timing of muscle cell fusion or whether fusion contributes to the morphogenesis of irregularly shaped long fibers into regularly shaped, cylindrical myotubes. However, it is evident that the first fast-twitch muscle cells do not fuse in order to elongate.</p><p>The filament index of fixed muscle cells, as in live cells, is significantly different between each phase (data not shown, two-tailed t-test, p&#x0003c;0.01 for all comparisons). These data support the time-lapse analyses and provide new tools for analysis of morphogenetic defects in various mutant/morphant embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Quantification of Anisotropy Indicates that Each Phase of Muscle Fiber Morphogenesis Is Accompanied by a Significant Increase in Ordered Structure</title><p>The identification of discrete, mathematically distinct phases provides a paradigm by which muscle morphogenesis in mutant embryos can be assessed. The above data also indicate that the morphology of fixed cells is not significantly different than live cells. However, although obtaining single labeled cells within a field of unlabeled cells in fixed embryos is easier than time-lapse analysis, it is not feasible in all model systems. We thus looked for a different mathematical tool to quantify cellular organization. Ideally such a tool would allow objective quantification of cellular structure with an easier experimental preparation such as staining with phalloidin to outline all cells. Therefore, we adapted and applied the 2D Wavelet-Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM) method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Arneodo1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Khalil1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. This method can be used to quantify the amount of structure, or order, of objects that do not necessarily have a well defined boundary. We used this approach to quantify the structural organization of cellular lattices during muscle fiber elongation. The WTMM analysis filters an image with the gradient of a smoothing function (i.e. a wavelet) at a given size scale. Places within the image where the intensity variation is maximal are given by the wavelet-transform modulus maxima (i.e. the WTMM). Next, the positions of maximal intensity variation along these maxima chains are identified. These are the WTMM maxima, or WTMMM. At these nodes, the direction where the signal has the sharpest variation is calculated. An arrow that points upward has an angle of &#x003c0;/2 and an arrow that points down has an angle of &#x02212;&#x003c0;/2. The anisotropy factor <italic>F<sub>a</sub></italic> is then calculated from the probability density function, <italic>P<sub>a</sub></italic>(<italic>A</italic>), of the angles <italic>A</italic> of the WTMMM vectors. <italic>F<sub>a</sub></italic> is defined in such a way that randomness, isotropy, has a value of <italic>F<sub>a</sub></italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0. Any value of <italic>F<sub>a</sub></italic>&#x0003e;0 quantifies the extent of departure from isotropy. A randomly structured cell lattice has arrows pointing in all directions and a low anisotropy factor. The arrows point in all directions because the direction of maximal intensity variation is random. A more organized cell lattice will have more arrows pointing in the same direction and a stronger anisotropic signature. More arrows will point in the same direction in an ordered cell lattice because the direction of maximal intensity variation will be the same between multiple cells. Thus, this formalism objectively provides a quantitative assessment of morphological structure.

Three broad phases of morphogenesis underlie the transition from a somite comprised of short muscle precursor cells to a myotome comprised of elongated muscle fibers. First, short muscle precursor cells exhibit dynamic protrusive activity, but do not undergo large-scale shape changes. The second phase, intercalation/elongation, occurs via a repetitive two-step process of protrusion extension and filling and requires <italic>lam&#x003b2;1</italic> and <italic>&#x003b3;1</italic> to proceed efficiently. The third phase encompasses boundary capture as well as shape changes that generate a more regularly shaped myotube.

Recent work demonstrated that <italic>laminin</italic> plays a critical role in boundary capture during notochord morphogenesis in the ascidian <italic>Ciona savignyi</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Veeman1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. We have previously demonstrated that the MTJ captures elongating muscle fibers, but it was not known what ECM components were relevant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Henry1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. It was also not known if the cessation of muscle fiber elongation is cell autonomous or mediated by community effects. Here we show that laminin is one component of the MTJ that stops elongating fibers. This result, combined with the work of Veeman et al., suggests that roles for laminin in boundary capture may be conserved, at least within chordates. We also show that wild-type cells in <italic>lam&#x003b3;1</italic> morphant embryos have a reduced ability to cross the MTJ. The fact that wild-type cells are less able to cross the MTJ, but do not rescue their <italic>lam&#x003b3;1</italic>-deficient neighbors, suggests that boundary capture is a cell autonomous process. These data also suggest that MTJ breakdown in <italic>lam&#x003b2;1</italic>and <italic>&#x003b3;1</italic>-deficient embryos is a local event caused by the failure of elongating muscle fibers to stop when they reach the MTJ. We do not currently know why 75&#x00025; of elongating muscle cells in <italic>lam&#x003b2;1</italic> and <italic>&#x003b3;1</italic>-deficient embryos do stop elongating, but 25&#x00025; do not. We hypothesize that the MTJ boundary is not homogenous. In this scenario, the absence of laminin would leave &#x0201c;holes&#x0201d; in the MTJ and muscle cells would elongate through these holes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000219-g008">Figure 8B, B1</xref>). Future experiments will be directed towards identifying additional molecular cues involved in boundary capture.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Zebrafish Husbandry</title><p>Zebrafish embryos were obtained from natural spawnings of adult fish kept at 28.5&#x000b0;C on a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle and were staged according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Kimmel1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>F59 was utilized to visualize slow fibers as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Devoto1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Crow1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.

This stage is ideal because anterior, older somites have formed muscle but posterior somites have not. Thus, all the phases of muscle morphogenesis are represented within single embryos. Images representing all phases were obtained utilizing a Zeiss Axioimager equipped with an Apotome as mentioned above. Each image and focal plane was evaluated and the phase (short precursor, etc.) determined. The phase that was identified represented most cells within a focal plane. Because muscle cell elongation is an exceedingly dynamic process, cells within different focal planes within the same z-series are sometimes at different phases of elongation. Each image was then cropped into 256&#x000d7;256 pixel sub-images. This cropping is necessary to eliminate other tissues in the embryos such as residual yolk platelets and neural tissue. Cropping was also necessary because fast muscle cells in the dorsal and ventral halves of somites angle slightly towards the middle. We thus flipped all ventrally derived panels so that the WTMMM vector angles for dorsal and ventral halves would not cancel each other out within a single sub-image. At least 10 images for at least 5 different embryos were analyzed for each phase.</p><p>The 2D WTMM method is a multifractal image analysis formalism introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000219-Arneodo1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, where the different dilations of the analyzing wavelet reveal quantitative roughness information at every length scale considered.
