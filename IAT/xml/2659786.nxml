In this study, we show that <italic>CDKN1C</italic> is repressed in breast cancer cells mainly through histone modifications. In particular, we show that <italic>CDKN1C</italic> is targeted by histone methyltransferase EZH2-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and can be strongly activated by inhibition of EZH2 in synergy with histone deacetylase inhibitor. Consistent with the overexpression of <italic>EZH2</italic> in a variety of human cancers including breast cancer, <italic>CDKN1C</italic> in these cancers is downregulated, and breast tumors expressing low levels of <italic>CDKN1C</italic> are associated with a poor prognosis. We further show that assessing both <italic>EZH2</italic> and <italic>CDKN1C</italic> expression levels as a measurement of EZH2 pathway activity provides a more predictive power of disease outcome than that achieved with <italic>EZH2</italic> or <italic>CDKN1C</italic> alone. Taken together, our study reveals a novel epigenetic mechanism governing <italic>CDKN1C</italic> repression in breast cancer. Importantly, as a newly identified EZH2 target with prognostic value, it has implications in patient stratification for cancer therapeutic targeting EZH2-mediated gene repression.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) are a large family of proteins that regulate cell cycle progression, cell proliferation and differentiation. CDKIs show widespread involvement in tumor suppression and are deregulated in many types of human cancers by genetic and epigenetic alterations. Loss of expression of CDKIs, such as p16<sup>INK4A</sup>, due to promoter DNA hypermethylation, is frequent in human cancer and the CDKIs downregulation is associated with aberrant cell proliferation and tumor growth. In addition to promoter DNA methylation, histone modifications also play a role in inactivation of the CDK inhibitors. It has been shown that H3K9 methylation can occur at p16<sup>INK4A</sup> independently of DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Bachman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, inactivation of the INK4A locus by other mechanisms such as Polycomb-associated histone H3K27 methylation have also been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Karnik1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Bracken1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Kotake1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Pharmacological reagents have been used to understand the regulatory components of gene silencing in cancer. DNA methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-C) has been used extensively to restore the expression of genes silenced by DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Jones1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors such as Trichostatin A (TSA) can induce gene expression by reversing repressed chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Marks1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. These two classes of agents can also act in synergy for the reactivation of epigenetically silenced genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Cameron1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to histone deacetylation, histone methylation also contributes to gene silencing. In particular, Polycomb protein EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste 2) is a histone methyltransferase that is often overexpressed in human cancers and is associated with cancer aggressiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Kleer1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Bachmann1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this study, we report that the <italic>CDKN1C</italic> is repressed in breast cancer by multiple epigenetic mechanisms.

In an effort to comprehensively understand the epigenetic events in breast cancer, we performed gene expression analysis in various breast cancer cell lines treated with DZNep, TSA or Aza, alone or in various combinations. We found that <italic>CDKN1C</italic> can be strongly induced by a combination of DZNep and TSA treatment compared to a modest induction by Aza (see below). This finding suggests that <italic>CDKN1C</italic> expression in breast cancer is predominately regulated by histone modifications instead of DNA hypermethylation.</p><p>To validate this finding, we first examined the relationship between the DNA methylation status of the <italic>CDKN1C</italic> promoter and the levels of <italic>CDKN1C</italic> expression in various breast cancer cell lines as well as the non-cancerous breast epithelial cell line (MCF10A). To this end, we have used methylation-specific PCR (MSP) to examine three regions flanking the entire CpG island surrounding the transcription start site (TSS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005011-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that the immediate promoter regions (M2 and M3) appeared to be unmethylated in all the breast cancer cell lines tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005011-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), though the similar regions have been previously found to be methylated in lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Pateras1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In a more distal region (M1) 500 bp upstream of the TSS, DNA was found to methylated in certain breast cancer cell lines, including BT-474 and MDA-MB-231, as well as in MCF10A cells, indicating this methylation is not cancer specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005011-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Bisulfite genomic sequencing results further confirmed the lack of methylation in M2 and M3 regions in SK-BR-3, BT-474 and MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005011-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Examination of <italic>CDKN1C</italic> expression from our breast cancer cell lines gene expression database indicates that <italic>CDKN1C</italic> expression displayed varied levels of expression but in general was reduced in most of the breast cancer cell lines (except the MDA-MB-231 cells) as compared to MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005011-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with quantitative PCR to assess the following histone marks: the repressive chromatin marks H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H3K9me2, and H4K20me3, as well as activating H3K4me3 and acetylated histone (H3K9/14 ac) that are normally associated with gene activation. A series of PCR primer sets were designed to probe the 4 kb chromatin region surrounding the <italic>CDKN1C</italic> TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005011-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We comprehensively characterized the chromatin state in SK-BR-3, BT-474, MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A cell lines in which <italic>CDKN1C</italic> is expressed at different levels. We detected an abundant H3K27me3 in a region approximately 300 bp downstream of the TSS in SK-BR-3 cells that express the lowest level of <italic>CDKN1C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005011-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This was also observed to a lesser extend in BT-474 cells that express a modest level of <italic>CDKN1C</italic>, and at low rates in MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A cells that express abundant <italic>CDKN1C</italic>. Consistent with the enrichment of H3K27me3, we also detected a strong binding of H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 to the <italic>CDKN1C</italic> promoter in SK-BR-3, to a lesser extend in BT-474 cells but not in MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A cells. Thus, levels of enrichment of EZH2 and H3K27me3 correlate very well (inversely) with the levels of <italic>CDKN1C</italic> expression across these diverse cell lines. This finding is consistent with the notion that EZH2 and the associated H3K27me3 enrichment are correlated with gene repression in cancer cells, and the majority of H3K27me3 is detected in the region downstream of the TSS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Yu1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Zhao1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Barski1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Pan1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0005011-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005011.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Histone modifications at <italic>CDKN1C</italic> locus in breast cancer cells.</title><p>(A) Schematic representation of <italic>CDKN1C</italic> locus, TSS (transcription start site).

This suggests that <italic>CDKN1C</italic> is marked by both repressive and activating histone marks in SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells; a bivalent chromatin state that is generally associated with gene repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Bernstein1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Mikkelsen1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Higher abundance of acetylated H3 (H3K9/14ac) was detected in <italic>CDKN1C</italic>-expressing MCF10A, MDA-MB-231 and BT-474 cells but was less detectable in SK-BR3 cells that express a lowest level of <italic>CDKN1C</italic>, indicating a positive correlation of H3K9/14ac with <italic>CDKN1C</italic> expression in these cells. We also detected the presence of another repressive mark H3K9me2 in BT-474 cells but not in other three cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005011-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the chromatin states reflecting the abundance of repressive H3K27me3; activating H3K4me3 and H3K9/14ac, as well as their combinatorial effects, correlate well with the levels of <italic>CDKN1C</italic> expression in these cells. Other repressive histone modifications such as H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 were not detected at the <italic>CDKN1C</italic> locus (data not shown).</p><p>To further determine the association of H3K27me3 with the level of <italic>CDKN1C</italic> expression in human breast tumors, we took the advantage of an independent microarray dataset of human breast tumors stained with H3K27me3 in Oncomine microarray database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oncomine.org">www.oncomine.org</ext-link>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005011-g002">Figure 2C</xref> shows that breast tumors stained positive for H3K27me3 display a consistent downregulation of <italic>CDKN1C</italic> compared with those negative for H3K27me3. Of important note, genes exhibiting the similar expression patterns to <italic>CDKN1C</italic> include <italic>KRT17</italic>, <italic>KRT5</italic> and <italic>LAMB3</italic> that have been validated to be EZH2 target in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Tan1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the data from both clinical breast tumor samples and cancer cell lines all support that <italic>CDKN1C</italic> downregulation in breast cancer is associated with a higher level of H3K27me3.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Robust activation of <italic>CDKN1C</italic> expression by a combination treatment with DZNep and TSA</title><p>The different chromatin configurations at <italic>CDKN1C</italic> in SK-BR-3, BT-474 and MDA-MB-231 cells may predict differential response of <italic>CDKN1C</italic> expression to various epigenetic drug treatments. We next treated these breast cancer cell lines with DZNep, TSA, or Aza alone or in various combinations and performed quantitative RT-PCR to assess the changes of <italic>CDKN1C</italic> expression upon these treatments. To determine the specificity of the gene response, other CDKI family members were also included for the expression analysis. The results indicate that the combination of DZNep with TSA resulted in a robust induction of <italic>CDKN1C</italic> expression in SK-BR-3 cells, whereas the single drug treatment or other drug combinations, such as DZNep/Aza or TSA/Aza, did not give rise to such a strong induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005011-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). As a marked contrast to <italic>CDKN1C</italic>, other CDKI family members did not respond to a similar extent, revealing the sensitivity of <italic>CDKN1C</italic> to this combination treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005011-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, in BT-474 cells that display a lower abundance of H3K27me3, DZNep/TSA treatment only induced a 12-fold induction of <italic>CDKN1C</italic>, as opposed to a 70-fold induction in SKBR-3 cells.

Taken together with the previous results, the data further support the conclusion that H3K27me3 level in <italic>CDKN1C</italic> is closely associated with its expression inversely. It also suggests that inhibition of H3K27me3 by DZNep alone is insufficient but requires TSA treatment for a full reactivation of <italic>CDKN1C</italic>. Lack of response of other <italic>CDKN</italic> family members to DZNep/TSA indicates the lack of similar chromatin state in these genes. Indeed, we found that other CDKIs, such as <italic>CDKN1D</italic>, were not marked by H3K27me3 in SK-BR-3 cells (data not shown).

Lack of dominate effect of DNA methylation, together with RT-PCR analysis, indicate that <italic>CDKN1C</italic> expression in breast cancer is maintained at low or basal levels rather than completely silenced. Indeed, <italic>CDKN1C</italic> can be only modestly induced by Aza but strongly induced by DZNep/TSA that targets both EZH2-mediated histone methylation and deacetylation. This finding indicates that DZNep/TSA might preferentially target genes whose repression is associated with H3K27me3 but not those completely silenced by DNA methylation. This is consistent with a recent study showing that EZH2 functions to maintain the low expression of target genes that lack DNA methylation but is not required for maintaining gene silencing predominantly caused by DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-McGarvey3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We show that <italic>CDKN1C</italic> carries both repressive (H3K27me3) and activating (H3K4me3) chromatin marks, revealing a &#x0201c;bivalent&#x0201d; chromatin state.

Thus, the detection of a strong H3K4me3 in the <italic>CDKN1C</italic> promoter is consistent with the lack of DNA methylation in the vicinity of the <italic>CDKN1C</italic> promoter as we observed in breast cancer cells. A &#x02018;bivalent&#x02019; chromatin mark (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) has been originally described in embryonic stem (ES) cells that is generally associated with genes transcribed in low levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Bernstein1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Azuara1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

The retention of the bivalent domain without DNA methylation indicates that this epigenetic mechanism also exists in cancer cells, which might also contribute to the malignant transformation together with the well-characterized DNA methylation. This finding has obvious therapeutic implications. As described above, these bivalent genes that are lowly transcribed (not completely silenced) might be most susceptible to histone modifying compounds such as DZNep/TSA as illustrated in this study, but not to DNA demethylating agents. These genes might contain important tumor suppressors that have been overlooked historically. We therefore speculate that the above described epigenetic treatment might open a new avenue for cancer therapeutics that aim to target this aberrant epigenetic process that has been previously under-appreciated in cancer.</p><p>Our comprehensive epigenetic analysis of these observations highlights the emerging concept that multiple epigenetic mechanisms collaborate to repress gene expression in cancer cells. Furthermore, our results indicate that DNA methylation and EZH2-H3K27me3 might not be mechanistically linked as previously suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Vire1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, we did not detect methylated DNA in EZH2-H2K27me3 enriched region in <italic>CDKN1C</italic>. Conversely, in the <italic>CDKN1C</italic> promoter region that appears to be methylated (such as in BT-474 cells), no EZH2-H3K27me3 was detected. This finding is consistent with the recent genomic scale analysis showing that H3K27me3-mediated gene silencing and DNA methylation target different set of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Kondo1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-GalYam1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, a recent report shows that Polycomb repression signature genes can predict clinical outcome of multiple solid tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005011-Yu1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings thus suggest the utility of EZH2 target genes as prognostic marks.

This might suggest that measuring both EZH2 and its target gene activity as the readout might be more accurate in predicting the activity of this silencing pathway. Indeed, our data suggest that EZH2 alone is insufficient but requires other factors such as HDAC to assure a full functionally in repression of certain genes. Therapeutically, this information may provide significant values in patient stratification for potential clinical use of EZH2 inhibitors as anti-cancer agents. Such agents may be particularly useful for patients with breast cancer harboring <italic>EZH2</italic>-mediaed repression of <italic>CDKN1C</italic>. Furthermore, we show that upregulation of <italic>EZH2</italic> and the corresponding downregulation of <italic>CDKN1C</italic> occur in multiple human cancers.
