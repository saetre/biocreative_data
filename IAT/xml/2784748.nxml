splicing occurs co-transcriptionally, and takes place throughout the nucleoplasm of eukaryotic cells. Splicing decisions are controlled by networks of nuclear RNA-binding proteins and their target sequences, sometimes in response to signalling pathways. Sam68 (Src-associated in mitosis 68 kDa) is the prototypic member of the STAR (Signal Transduction and Activation of RNA) family of RNA-binding proteins, which regulate splicing in response to signalling cascades. Nuclear Sam68 protein is concentrated within subnuclear organelles called SLM/Sam68 Nuclear Bodies (SNBs), which also contain some other splicing regulators, signalling components and nucleic acids.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We used proteomics to search for the major interacting protein partners of nuclear Sam68. In addition to Sam68 itself and known Sam68-associated proteins (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins hnRNP A1, A2/B1 and G), we identified hnRNP L as a novel Sam68-interacting protein partner. hnRNP L protein was predominantly present within small nuclear protein complexes approximating to the expected size of monomers and dimers, and was quantitatively associated with nucleic acids. hnRNP L spatially co-localised with Sam68 as a novel component of SNBs and was also observed within the general nucleoplasm. Localisation within SNBs was highly specific to hnRNP L and was not shared by the closely-related hnRNP LL protein, nor any of the other Sam68-interacting proteins we identified by proteomics. The interaction between Sam68 and hnRNP L proteins was observed in a cell line which exhibits low frequency of SNBs suggesting that this association also takes place outside SNBs. Although ectopic expression of hnRNP L and Sam68 proteins independently affected splicing of <italic>CD44 </italic>variable exon v5 and <italic>TJP1 </italic>exon 20 minigenes, these proteins did not, however, co-operate with each other in splicing regulation of these target exons.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we identify hnRNP L as a novel SNB component. We show that, compared with other identified Sam68-associated hnRNP proteins and hnRNP LL, this co-localisation within SNBs is specific to hnRNP L. Our data suggest that the novel Sam68-hnRNP L protein interaction may have a distinct role within SNBs.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Alternative splicing is regulated in part by a network of signalling pathways which respond to extracellular stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. One molecule with a key role linking signalling and splicing is Sam68 (Src-associated in mitosis 68 kDa). Sam68 is the prototypic member of the STAR (Signal Transduction and Activation of RNA) family of RNA-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Sam68-dependent splicing events impact upon important cellular decisions such as choices between cell survival and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Sam68 has also been recently shown to play an important role in neurogenesis through splicing regulation of specific pre-mRNAs important for neural development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Homozygous null Sam68 mice have pleiotropic defects in bone morphogenesis, spermatogenesis and motor coordination suggesting widespread anatomical functions for the encoded protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Sam68 has been reported to be associated with a number of different proteins involved in RNA processing, transcription, and cell signalling. Sam68 induces ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase)-mediated inclusion of <italic>CD44 </italic>variable exon v5 in response to Ras activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Activation of <italic>CD44 </italic>exon v5 splicing by Sam68 involves interactions with U2AF65 to facilitate v5 exon definition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Sam68 also interacts with the splicing repressor hnRNP A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and nuclear transcriptional regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The amino acid sequence of Sam68 protein contains several consensus motifs that mediate protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions in response to different stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In most somatic cells, Sam68 protein is exclusively nuclear, but Sam68 can also interact with cytoplasmic signalling molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Sam68 protein has also been observed in the cytoplasm of secondary spermatocytes, where it is associated with polysomes and is involved in translational regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In cancer cells, Sam68 protein exhibits a general nucleoplasmic distribution but is also concentrated within subnuclear structures called SLM/Sam68 Nuclear Bodies (SNBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although the exact function of SNBs is unknown, they have been shown to contain some other splicing regulators, signalling components and nucleic acids. Although Sam68 has a number of reported interacting protein partners, its major associated proteins are not yet known. In this study, we searched by proteomics for the major interacting protein partners of nuclear Sam68. Our data reveal hnRNP (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein) L as a novel Sam68-associated nuclear protein and a novel component of SNBs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>hnRNP L is a novel Sam68-interacting protein</title><p>Sam68 protein is expressed at high levels in the nuclei of prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We immunoprecipitated endogenous Sam68 protein in nuclear extracts prepared from LNCaP cells. Western analysis confirmed that Sam68 protein was efficiently immunoprecipitated by rabbit antisera specific for Sam68, but not by normal rabbit IgG (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Further analysis of the immunoprecipitates using SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining revealed a number of immunoprecipitated proteins, including a protein of ~68 kDa and a protein co-migrating with IgG heavy chain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; compare lanes 1 and 4), as well as a number of other distinct proteins. Peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time Of Flight) mass spectrometry was carried out on each of the immunoprecipitated proteins. The Mascot search engine was used to match peptides with statistically significant MOWSE (Molecular Weight Search) scores mapping across full-length protein sequences obtained from the Swiss-Prot database (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). We identified the ~68 kDa band as Sam68 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), and other co-immunoprecipitated proteins as the known Sam68-interacting proteins hnRNP A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), hnRNP G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), and hnRNP A2/B1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Proteomic analysis identifies hnRNP L as a major nuclear Sam68-interacting protein</bold>.

By Coomassie staining, the levels of co-precipitated hnRNP A1 and hnRNP G were similar to the level of immunoprecipitated Sam68, but there was considerably less co-immunoprecipitated hnRNP L (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lane 1). Hence, to independently confirm the novel Sam68-hnRNP L interaction, both Sam68 and hnRNP L proteins were separately immunoprecipitated in LNCaP cell nuclear extracts using their cognate antibodies prior to Western analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, left and right panels). hnRNP L protein was efficiently immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal antibody specific for hnRNP L, and also co-immunoprecipitated by the antisera to Sam68 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, left panel). Likewise, Sam68 protein was efficiently immunoprecipitated by its cognate antisera, and also co-immunoreprecipitated by the anti-hnRNP L antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, right panel). Similar to previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], we observed hnRNP L to migrate as a doublet, and both of these isoforms interacted with Sam68 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, left panel). No or very weak immunoprecipitation was observed in the absence of either antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, both panels, lane 4).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Sam68 and hnRNP L proteins associate via protein-protein interactions and are not bridged by nucleic acids</bold>.

Anti-FLAG M2 agarose was used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged proteins from HEK293 cells, and co-immunoprecipitated GST fusion proteins were detected using antisera specific to GST. Consistent with the observed interactions of endogenous proteins, hnRNP L-GST was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with Sam68-FLAG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 3), but could not be co-immunoprecipitated in cells transfected with an empty FLAG vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 4).</p><p>Note that all immunoprecipitations of both endogenous (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and FLAG-tagged proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) were carried out in the presence of Benzonase nuclease to ensure that the detected associations were mediated by protein-protein interactions and not bridged by nucleic acids.</p></sec><sec><title>Sam68 and hnRNP L are both present in small protein complexes which are quantitatively associated with nucleic acids</title><p>Sam68 is quantitatively associated with small nuclear protein complexes of a size compatible with either monomers or dimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In order to investigate and compare the size ranges of any endogenous nuclear complexes containing hnRNP L protein, we analysed velocity gradient fractions of HEK293 cell nuclear extracts prepared either without pretreatment or after prior micrococcal nuclease (MNase) treatment to eliminate any nucleic acid dependent complexes (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]). Similarly to previously published data for Sam68, following MNase treatment, hnRNP L (monomeric molecular weight ~70 kDa) protein was mainly present in small stable protein complexes (of less than 158 kDa) corresponding to the expected size of monomeric or dimeric molecular complexes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, upper panel). Also like Sam68, hnRNP L protein was quantitatively associated with nucleic acids since it migrated with much larger complexes without prior MNase digestion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, lower panel).</p></sec><sec><title>hnRNP L uniquely co-localises with Sam68 as a novel component of SNBs</title><p>Within the nuclei of cancer cells, Sam68 protein exhibits a general nucleoplasmic distribution but is also concentrated within distinct peri-nucleolar structures called SNBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We compared the localization of Sam68 and hnRNP L proteins in cancer cell lines using indirect immunofluorescence (representative images are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Confocal microscopy demonstrated that the endogenous Sam68 and hnRNP L proteins directly overlapped within SNBs in 100% of all cells examined. In addition to SNBs, further large pools of hnRNP L and Sam68 proteins were seen in the general nucleoplasm, and in the case of hnRNP L, towards the nuclear periphery in Saos-2 cells (the position of representative SNBs are indicated by arrows in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: note also a large population of both Sam68 and hnRNP L proteins outside SNBs). In parallel experiments, using the same combination of secondary antisera, no co-localisation was observed between Sam68 protein (identified using specific rabbit antisera) and SC35-containing splicing speckles (identified using a specific mouse monoclonal antibody) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The distribution of Sam68 and hnRNP L proteins was examined in three different cell lines (LNCaP, Saos-2 and HeLa) and found to be very similar suggesting that the hnRNP L association with SNBs may be ubiquitous (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>, and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Furthermore, the other identified Sam68-associated proteins (hnRNP A1, A2/B1, and G) identified in our proteomic screen exhibited diffuse subnuclear distributions and did not localise within SNBs (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Endogenous hnRNP L protein co-localises with Sam68 within SNBs</bold>.

We carried out further experiments to test if hnRNP LL protein would be also found within SNBs. Surprisingly, these experiments indicated that hnRNP LL protein exhibits a nucleoplasmic distribution outside SNBs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). The observed hnRNP LL distribution was punctate and somewhat reminiscent to that of splicing speckles.

To test whether the association of Sam68 and hnRNP L was dependent on the presence of SNBs, we performed side-by-side immunoprecipitations in whole cell extracts obtained from LNCaP and NIH3T3 cells (only ~5.5% of NIH3T3 cells have SNBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

Although SNBs contain some splicing regulators and RNA, they do not detectably contain key spliceosome components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Hence SNBs are not thought to be sites for active pre-mRNA splicing, which takes place in the general nucleoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Both Sam68 and hnRNP L proteins are independently implicated in the regulation of distinct alternative splicing events during which exon inclusion can be either activated or repressed depending on the target transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although active splicing of Sam68 and hnRNP L target pre-mRNAs is unlikely to take place within SNBs, we also detected significant nucleoplasmic populations of both Sam68 and hnRNP L proteins outside SNBs, and protein interactions between Sam68 and hnRNP L occurred equally well in a cell line which exhibits a low frequency of SNBs. These observations raise the question as to whether the Sam68-hnRNP L interaction might have a co-operative effect on pre-mRNA splicing in the general nucleoplasm.</p><p>Since ectopically expressed Sam68 protein stimulates splicing inclusion of <italic>CD44 </italic>variable exon v5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and <italic>TJP1 </italic>exon 20 inclusion is repressed by hnRNP L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], we examined the effect of both Sam68 and hnRNP L protein expression on these known target exons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). We firstly monitored splicing in HEK293 cells transfected with a minigene containing <italic>CD44 </italic>variable exon v5 together with expression constructs encoding Sam68, hnRNP L or both (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Ectopic expression of hnRNP L protein stimulated exon v5 inclusion albeit with a lower potency than Sam68 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). We carried out similar experiments with a minigene containing <italic>TJP1 </italic>exon 20 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Due to the low levels of expression of <italic>TJP1 </italic>exon 20, it was not easy to draw clear conclusions from this experiment, however ectopic expression of either hnRNP L or Sam68 proteins alone appeared to repress exon 20 inclusion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). Together, these experiments indicate that both Sam68 and hnRNP L proteins can regulate the same pre-mRNA splicing events in the same direction, with hnRNP L activating <italic>CD44 </italic>exon v5 inclusion like Sam68, and Sam68 repressing <italic>TJP1 </italic>exon 20 inclusion like hnRNP L. Importantly in either case, however, co-expression of hnRNP L and Sam68 proteins did not have a significant additive effect on either <italic>TJP1 </italic>exon 20 skipping or <italic>CD44 </italic>exon v5 inclusion (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, compare lanes 2, 3 and 4). Hence it seems unlikely that the general nucleoplasmic populations of hnRNP L and Sam68 proteins co-operate in splicing control of these shared target exons, despite their observed interaction, localisations, and ability to regulate these target exons by themselves.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>The Sam68-hnRNP L protein interaction does not significantly impact on splicing regulation of two known target exons</bold>.

The stoichiometry of the Sam68-associated proteins recovered by immunoprecipitation, their spatial localisations, and analysis of endogenous complexes using velocity gradient centrifugation analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] are most consistent with a number of distinct small Sam68-containing protein complexes (predominantly monomeric and dimeric-sized), rather than a single large complex containing each of the identified Sam68-interacting proteins. Like Sam68 and the Sam68-interactor hnRNP G, but not hnRNP A1, hnRNP L protein was quantitatively associated with nucleic acids since it migrated with much larger complexes without prior MNase digestion before velocity gradient centrifugation.</p><p>hnRNP L protein has previously been described in discrete perinucleolar structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], which we here now identify as SNBs. Although the exact functions of SNBs are not fully understood, they are known to contain other STAR proteins (SLM-1 and SLM-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the splicing factor YT521B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], Scaffold Attachment Factors SAFB1 and SAFB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and the protein kinase BRK/Sik (Breast Tumour Kinase/Src-related Intestinal Kinase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. SNBs also contain nucleic acids including RNA, and on heat-shock additionally recruit hnRNP A1 and other splicing factors including arginine-serine-rich (SR) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Like Sam68, hnRNP L is implicated in coupling signaling and splicing: hnRNP L regulates signal-dependent splicing of <italic>CD45 </italic>exon v4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and <italic>STREX </italic>(stress axis-regulated exon) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Despite the spatial and physical associations of Sam68 and hnRNP L detected in our study, Sam68 and hnRNP L proteins did not either co-operate or antagonize each others' splicing activity on target exons. In contrast, the generally nucleoplasmic Sam68-associated protein hnRNP G potently inhibited Sam68-mediated splicing of <italic>CD44 </italic>exon v5 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Our protein interaction analyses indicated that the interaction between Sam68 and hnRNP L is independent of nucleic acids. Using a directed yeast two-hybrid system, a direct protein-protein interaction has been demonstrated between the STAR-family protein rSLM-2 and hnRNP L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], suggesting, by analogy, that the Sam68-hnRNP L interaction may also be direct. However, we were unable to detect such an interaction by directed yeast two hybrid analysis (unpublished observations).</p><p>Amongst all the Sam68-associated proteins we investigated in this study, the subnuclear distribution of hnRNP L protein is specifically within SNBs. Consistent with the known nuclear functions of hnRNP L, SNBs have been suggested as potential nuclear sites for the regulation of RNA processing by signalling pathways. However, we found that the homologous hnRNP LL protein which is also implicated in signal-dependent <italic>CD45 </italic>splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], did not localize to SNBs. Hence SNBs are not a default location for all nuclear RNA-binding proteins involved in signaling and RNA processing. hnRNP LL protein lacks some proline- and glycine-rich regions present within the hnRNP L amino acid sequence, and by analogy with Sam68, it is possible that these motifs are required for interactions with signaling molecules and SNB localization. The distinct nuclear localization we observe for hnRNP LL may suggest somewhat diverged functions and so provide some explanation for the evolutionary maintenance of both hnRNP L and LL proteins within cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have identified hnRNP L as a novel Sam68-interacting protein partner and component of SNBs. Despite hnRNP L and Sam68 proteins also localizing to the general nucleoplasm, where pre-mRNA splicing occurs, we did not observe a role for the novel Sam68-hnRNP L protein interaction on splicing of known target exons for these RNA-binding proteins. The spatial localization of hnRNP L protein within SNBs further implicates a role for these organelles in coupling signaling to RNA processing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture and DNA transfection</title><p>LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS) (PAA Laboratories).
