This ability is largely attributed to Schwann cells, glia cells of the peripheral nervous system that are able to dedifferentiate, proliferate and redifferentiate after injury, foster axonal regrowth, and rebuild myelin sheaths. Schwann cells also constitute a key lineage in nerve development, supporting the survival of neurons and axons as well as providing myelination for efficient saltatory nerve conduction. Thus, understanding the regulatory mechanisms that guide Schwann cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, dedifferentiation, and redifferentiation after injury is of paramount importance for nerve biology in health and disease.</p><p>TGF&#x003b2; is a key factor involved, triggering Schwann cell proliferation or apoptosis, depending on the cell maturation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eccleston et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ridley et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atanasoski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Parkinson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Antonio et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, the same growth factor can induce growth arrest and differentiation of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schiller et al., 2004</xref>). The mechanisms underlying these cell type&#x02013;specific effects of TGF&#x003b2; on the cell cycle are largely unknown.</p><p>TGF&#x003b2; is a ubiquitously expressed cytokine that affects crucial biological processes such as proliferation, immunity, and wound healing. Indeed, TGF&#x003b2; is an antiproliferative agent in various tissues, including epithelial cells, and mutations in its signaling pathway are frequently found in epithelial cancers. TGF&#x003b2; is also involved in fibrotic diseases including lung fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, hypertrophic scars, and keloids, and the inhibition of its pathway may constitute a treatment for fibrosis.</p><p>We have found that the protooncogene Ski (Sloan-Kettering viral oncogene homologue), a crucial negative regulator of TGF&#x003b2; signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luo, 2004</xref>), plays a key role in the control of Schwann cell proliferation and myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atanasoski et al., 2004</xref>). In epithelial cells, activation of TGF&#x003b2; receptors leads to phosphorylation of the signaling proteins Smad2/3. In turn, the latter form a complex with Smad4, translocate to the nucleus, and induce the expression of a specific set of downstream genes. Ski regulates and inactivates this mechanism by binding to Smad2/3. Additionally, Ski action is modulated by its interaction with multiple other partners, including SnoN, c-Jun, retinoic acid receptor, Gli3, histone deacetylase 1, N-CoR, mSin3a, MeCP2, HIPK2, Skip, C184M, NF1, GATA1, and retinoblastoma protein (Rb; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luo, 2004</xref>). Rb is of particular interest in this context as a nuclear tumor suppressor regulating the G1/S-phase transition. Its hypophosphorylated form arrests cells in G1 phase by binding to the transcription factor E2F to repress its activity. When hyperphosphorylated, Rb releases E2F. The latter is thus activated and promotes entry into S phase. In vitro studies indicate that c-Ski is required for the transcriptional repression mediated by Rb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tokitou et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>In epithelial cells, TGF&#x003b2; promotes cycle arrest through down-regulation of c-myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pietenpol et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandrow et al., 1995</xref>), inhibition of Cdk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Polyak et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cipriano and Chen, 1998</xref>) and Cdk4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hannon and Beach, 1994</xref>) activities, and inhibition of E2F-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schwarz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iavarone and Massague, 1999</xref>). The cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk2 and Cdk4/Cdk6 regulate E2F-dependent transcription through phosphorylation of Rb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horton et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Connell-Crowley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lundberg and Weinberg, 1998</xref>). Therefore, by inhibiting Cdk2 and Cdk4 activities in epithelial cells, TGF&#x003b2; mediates cell cycle arrest by preventing hyperphosphorylation and thus inactivation of Rb.</p><p>In Schwann cells, TGF&#x003b2; does not induce growth arrest and differentiation but, on the contrary, stimulates proliferation. This difference compared with epithelial cells is intriguing and prompted us to search for its molecular basis. We show that in Schwann cells, in contrast to epithelial cells, TGF&#x003b2; does not alter Ski expression and up-regulates Rb, particularly its hyperphosphorylated form. Furthermore, TGF&#x003b2; triggers Ski and Rb relocalization as a complex to the cytoplasm most likely to promote TGF&#x003b2;-induced Schwann cell proliferation. This regulatory mechanism, occurring in Schwann cells but not in epithelial cells, is crucially dependent on the levels of Ski expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>TGF&#x003b2; induces Schwann cell proliferation but decreases proliferation in epithelial cells and promotes their differentiation</title><p>Previous studies indicated that TGF&#x003b2; is able to induce Schwann cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atanasoski et al., 2004</xref>) or apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Parkinson et al., 2004</xref>) in vitro<italic>,</italic> depending on the culture conditions.

TGF&#x003b2; treatment significantly up-regulated total Rb as well as hyperphosphorylated <sup>ser780</sup>pRb (serine780-phosphorylated Rb) protein levels in proliferating Schwann cells, whereas dbcAMP-induced differentiation had no detectable effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and E</xref>). In WB-F344 cells, TGF&#x003b2;-induced differentiation did not significantly alter total Rb levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>) but strongly decreased the level of <sup>ser780</sup>pRb (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>) in functional agreement with decreased proliferation.

To examine this issue further, we analyzed the intracellular localization of Rb in conjunction with Ski by immunofluorescence and cell fractionation methods. In DM-cultured Schwann cells, total Rb (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), and <sup>ser780</sup>pRb (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3, B and D</xref>) were almost exclusively found in the nucleus. After 48-h treatment with TGF&#x003b2;, however, a fraction of the proteins was present in the cytoplasm. This was surprising because Rb is a nuclear regulator of the G1/S-phase transition, and the cytoplasm was an unexpected subcellular localization for this protein. Parallel analysis of Ski localization revealed that Ski was concentrated in the nucleus (with minor amounts occasionally present in the perinuclear region) of DM-cultured Schwann cells, but after TGF&#x003b2; treatment for 48 h, Ski was mainly found in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A, B, and D</xref>). A time course analysis after TGF&#x003b2; treatment showed that both Ski and Rb started to be relocalized into the cytoplasm after 6 h, reaching a maximum after 48 h (unpublished data). In differentiated Schwann cells (after treatment with dbcAMP), Ski and Rb were concentrated in the nucleus, and no cytoplasmic localization was observed (unpublished data). WB-F344 cells showed Ski and <sup>ser780</sup>pRb expression in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and no obvious relocalization was observed after TGF&#x003b2; treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and E</xref>). We were unable to investigate the subcellular localization of total Rb in WB-F344 cells because of a dramatic change in the quality of the commercially available anti-Rb antibodies and the lack of suitable alternative reagents.

To approach this issue systematically, we started with quantitative assessments of Ski and Rb expression in developing rat sciatic nerves. Our Western blot analysis shows that Ski protein is present at every stage of postnatal development from postnatal day (P) 0 to adult in rat sciatic nerves, with a transient peak at P21 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). This peak of expression was surprising, and we therefore also measured the expression levels of Ski in mouse sciatic nerves. Here, Ski expression was not increased at P21 (unpublished data), leaving us with the only explanation of species-specific differences of unknown functional relevance. We then measured total Rb levels. Total Rb was expressed at all developmental time points and in the adult at comparable levels. In contrast, <sup>ser780</sup>pRb levels were high at early stages of postnatal development (from P0&#x02013;4) when rat Schwann cells proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stewart et al., 1993</xref>) and decreased progressively until the adult stage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Immunohistochemical stainings revealed that at P0, both Ski and <sup>ser780</sup>pRb are present and partially colocalize in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, but the majority of each protein is localized in the Schwann cell cytoplasm. In adult rat sciatic nerves, however, Ski staining was equal in Schwann cell nuclei and cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C and E</xref>). The levels of <sup>ser780</sup>pRb in adult Schwann cells were generally low, and the residual expression was mostly restricted to the nucleus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, D and E</xref>). In the adult rat sciatic nerves, we detected some signal, presumably in axons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>), which is likely to be nonspecific if the low expression of <sup>ser780</sup>pRb at this stage is considered. As anticipated from our in vitro results and expression data, we were able to coimmunoprecipitate Ski and <sup>ser780</sup>pRb from both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of P7 rat sciatic nerves, but not at the adult stage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>).

If 60% of endogenous Ski was knocked down (Ski-40%), Schwann cells were growth arrested in DM, and TGF&#x003b2; did not significantly promote proliferation. Interestingly, if Ski expression was knocked down to undetectable levels in DM-cultured Schwann cells, proliferation was increased, and TGF&#x003b2; reduced this proliferation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>). We interpret these data as suggesting that Ski is also involved in the control of non-TGF&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated Schwann cell proliferation and that a low level of Ski expression is sufficient for this regulation. If we consider the effect triggered by TGF&#x003b2; on DM-cultured Schwann cells, TGF&#x003b2; appears to be largely unable to stimulate their proliferation in the absence of Ski. Consistent with this notion, Ski knockdown blocked <sup>ser780</sup>pRb relocalization to the Schwann cell cytoplasm in the presence of TGF&#x003b2; (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>). In DM, no cytoplasmic localization of <sup>ser780</sup>pRb was observed in either control cells or when Ski was down-regulated (unpublished data). Additionally, neither total Rb nor <sup>ser780</sup>pRb levels were affected by Ski down-regulation in growing medium (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710161/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710161/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>We next examined the influence of Ski knockdown on Schwann cell differentiation using the marker protein P0.

TGF&#x003b2; can trigger Schwann cell proliferation or apoptosis, depending on culture conditions and maturation stage, whereas it mediates epithelial cell growth arrest and differentiation. In our culture conditions, TGF&#x003b2; induced Schwann cell proliferation. Furthermore, TGF&#x003b2; mediated the growth arrest of WB-F344 rat epithelial cells and promoted their differentiation, as indicated by size increase and SMA expression used as differentiation markers. Schwann cells are a key lineage in nerve development, supporting axonal growth and providing myelination, and TGF&#x003b2; is an important regulator of Schwann cell proliferation during perinatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Antonio et al., 2006</xref>). The reasons why TGF&#x003b2; promotes Schwann cell proliferation but induces growth arrest and differentiation of other cell types such as epithelial cells are largely unknown. In this study, we identify and describe a novel pathway induced by TGF&#x003b2; in Schwann cells involving Ski and Rb and regulated by Ski levels of expression. The different regulation of this pathway in Schwann cells and epithelial cells is likely to be a major determinant of the observed differences in the outcome of TGF&#x003b2; signaling in Schwann cells compared with epithelial cells.</p><p>In a previous study, we have found that Ski is involved in the control of Schwann cell proliferation and myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atanasoski et al., 2004</xref>). The protooncogene Ski is a negative regulator of TGF&#x003b2;-induced Smad2/3 activation and can interact with several different partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luo, 2004</xref>). Thus, to identify TGF&#x003b2;-regulated pathways differing between Schwann cells and epithelial cells, we investigated the expression of described partners of Ski in cultured Schwann cells and epithelial cells. Rb was up-regulated in TGF&#x003b2;-treated Schwann cells, whereas it remained unaltered in epithelial cells. Furthermore, TGF&#x003b2; increased <sup>ser780</sup>pRb levels in Schwann cells but strongly decreased <sup>ser780</sup>pRb in epithelial cells, which, in principle, is consistent with the observed increase in proliferation of TGF&#x003b2;-treated Schwann cells and the growth-arrested and differentiated state of TGF&#x003b2;-treated epithelial cells. However, the up-regulation of both total Rb and <sup>ser780</sup>pRb in TGF&#x003b2;-treated Schwann cells was peculiar. The classical definition of Rb is that of a negative regulator of the G1/S-phase transition. This function of Rb is achieved through its hypophosphorylated form by binding and inactivation of the transcription factor E2F. The hyperphosphorylated form of Rb is thought to be functionally inactive. Thus, the unusual Rb regulation in Schwann cells prompted us to follow up on this issue.</p><p>We found that after treatment with TGF&#x003b2;, <sup>ser780</sup>pRb started to be relocalized to the cytoplasm of Schwann cells within 6 h, and relocalization was maximal after 48 h. This finding was surprising because Rb has been described as a nuclear protein. In the glioblastoma cell line T98G, however, serum induces cytoplasmic localization of the three pocket proteins p107, p130, and Rb and the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of p130 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chestukhin et al., 2002</xref>). It has been speculated that the pocket family members accumulate in the cytoplasm during the late G1 phase of the cell cycle to provide a rapid and efficient way to relieve pocket protein&#x02013;mediated repression of E2F-dependent transcription. Additionally, in transformed human lung fibroblasts in which a Cdk4 mutation leads to loss of sensitivity to p16 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiao et al., 2006</xref>), hyperphosphorylated Rb is increased and mislocalized to the cytoplasm. This is possibly one of the reasons for allowing these transformed cells to evade growth-regulatory constraints. These previous studies used tumor cells that have acquired various mechanisms allowing escape from cell cycle exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chestukhin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiao et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, we show here that cytoplasmic relocalization of Rb also occurs in primary Schwann cells during proliferation and is likely an important component of the normal regulatory circuit in this cell type. If Schwann cells were treated with TGF&#x003b2;, Ski and <sup>ser780</sup>pRb moved in concert to the Schwann cell cytoplasm where Ski and <sup>ser780</sup>pRb partially colocalized and interacted. This is likely to be of physiological importance also in vivo because a similar cytoplasmic colocalization and interaction of Ski with <sup>ser780</sup>pRb was observed in early postnatal development of the sciatic nerve when Schwann cells still proliferate. Whether hyperphosphorylated Rb plays an active role in the regulation of cytoplasmic Ski (for example, by regulating its stability) remains to be determined.</p><p>Overexpression of Ski induced Rb hyperphosphorylation and the colocalization of both proteins in the cytoplasm of Schwann cells and epithelial cells. Furthermore, proliferation of Schwann cells and epithelial cells was stimulated independently of TGF&#x003b2;, and TGF&#x003b2; was unable to trigger efficient growth arrest and differentiation of Ski-overexpressing epithelial cells. These results indicate that a high expression of Ski promotes proliferation and suggest that at least a part of this effect is caused by the increased phosphorylation of Rb and its sequestration in the cytoplasm. These findings are in partial disagreement with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atanasoski et al., 2004</xref>) in which Ski overexpression did not promote proliferation of Schwann cells in DM but decreased TGF&#x003b2;-induced proliferation and up-regulated myelin gene transcripts and the myelin protein periaxin. We have not been able to identify the causes for these differences. We must assume that they are caused by different culture conditions or unknown biological variants. Different fetal calf sera, pituitary extracts, or preparation variability of primary Schwann cells are potential candidates.</p><p>When Ski was knocked down in Schwann cells, TGF&#x003b2; was no longer able to stimulate proliferation compared with the DM condition, and there was no or very reduced phospho-Rb (pRb) cytoplasmic localization. When Ski was knocked down to undetectable levels, TGF&#x003b2; even decreased proliferation. These results indicate that Ski expression modulates the effect of TGF&#x003b2; on Schwann cell proliferation and pRb relocalization to the cytoplasm and suggest that pRb cytoplasmic localization is very likely to account for at least a part of TGF&#x003b2;-induced proliferation of Schwann cells.</p><p>Our results further indicate that Ski is also involved in the control of other pathways than those induced by TGF&#x003b2; because stimulated proliferation and a decrease of the myelin protein P0 were observed when Ski expression was knocked down to undetectable levels in Schwann cells cultured in DM only. These results are in agreement with our previous data showing reduced levels of myelin gene expression in Ski-deficient peripheral nerves and the lack of myelin in cultured dorsal root ganglia in the absence of Ski (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atanasoski et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In our present settings, dbcAMP was able to up-regulate the Schwann cell differentiation marker P0 in the absence of Ski, and overexpression of Ski did not affect the expression of P0 and other differentiation markers. These data suggest that culture conditions modulate Ski effects on Schwann cell differentiation. It is possible, although it remains to be demonstrated, that Ski does not act primarily on Schwann cell differentiation. The decrease of myelin proteins in DM in the absence of Ski could be the result of increased proliferation. In the present study, we show that Ski regulates proliferation depending on its level of expression and its subcellular localization. However, we cannot exclude that Ski is also directly involved in the control of Schwann cell differentiation under certain conditions. Importantly, proliferation and differentiation were not always interdependent in Schwann cells because we observed that proliferation was induced in Ski-overexpressing Schwann cells without affecting the expression of differentiation markers. In this study, we have focused our investigation on the function of Ski in the regulation of the TGF&#x003b2; pathway. However, Ski seems to also regulate pathways that are not induced by TGF&#x003b2;, and further work is necessary to fully understand the functions of Ski in Schwann cell biology.</p><p>In addition to the multiple effects of TGF&#x003b2; on the cell cycle, proliferation, and differentiation addressed in this study, TGF&#x003b2; also mediates Schwann cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Parkinson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Antonio et al., 2006</xref>). In fact, the balance of TGF&#x003b2;-mediated control of Schwann cell proliferation and apoptosis has been elegantly documented in TGF&#x003b2; receptor II&#x02013;null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Antonio et al., 2006</xref>). Elucidating the molecular basis of the pathways mediating the apoptosis effects and the potential relationship to the mechanisms described here will be important topics for further studies. On a broader scale, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms controlling Schwann cell proliferation and survival are of wider significance to provide the basis to develop treatment of peripheral nerve tumors (Schwann cell hyperplasia), inherited peripheral neuropathies, and common peripheral neuropathies secondary to diabetes, cancer chemotherapeutic agents, toxins, and autoimmune disorders. Schwann cells are also under evaluation in transplantation paradigms to augment regeneration, when accident-caused large gaps in peripheral nerves have occurred, and as auxiliary cells in nonregenerating central nervous system lesions (e.g., spinal cord repair). Profound knowledge of the control of Schwann cell proliferation and differentiation is of key importance for the success of such applications in regenerative medicine.</p><p>With regard to epithelial cells, TGF&#x003b2; signaling plays a critical role in the control of epithelial tumor formation as a tumor suppressor. We show here that if Ski levels are high, there is a concomitant increase in <sup>ser780</sup>pRb, proliferation is stimulated, and TGF&#x003b2; is unable to promote growth arrest and differentiation. It is interesting to note in this context that Ski levels are up-regulated in many tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nomura et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fumagalli et al., 1993</xref>). Up-regulation of Ski and its interaction with Rb in the cytoplasm may therefore constitute a mechanism by which cancer cells are able to escape from cell cycle exit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Primary Schwann cells were derived from P2&#x02013;3 Wistar rat sciatic nerves and dissociated in 0.3 mg/ml collagenase type I (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2.5 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) in DME (Invitrogen) at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% air for 1 h.</p><p>After the addition of DME containing 10% FCS (Invitrogen), cells were centrifuged at 500 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, resuspended in DME containing 10% FCS, 1:500 penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10 &#x003bc;M cytosine arabinoside (Sigma-Aldrich), and plated on plastic dishes coated with poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich).
