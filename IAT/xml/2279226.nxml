These activities are frequently interlinked, and many chromatin remodelling enzymes contain motifs that recognise modified histones. Here we adopt a peptide ligation strategy to generate specifically modified chromatin templates and used these to study the interaction of the Chd1, Isw2 and RSC remodelling complexes with differentially acetylated nucleosomes. Specific patterns of histone acetylation are found to alter the rate of chromatin remodelling in different ways. For example, histone H3 lysine 14 acetylation acts to increase recruitment of the RSC complex to nucleosomes. However, histone H4 tetra-acetylation alters the spectrum of remodelled products generated by increasing octamer transfer <italic>in trans</italic>. In contrast, histone H4 tetra-acetylation was also found to reduce the activity of the Chd1 and Isw2 remodelling enzymes by reducing catalytic turnover without affecting recruitment. These observations illustrate a range of different means by which modifications to histones can influence the action of remodelling enzymes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Histone</kwd><kwd>Acetylation</kwd><kwd>Snf2</kwd><kwd>Nucleosome</kwd><kwd>Chromatin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Packaging DNA into nucleosomes and higher-order chromatin structures restricts access to the underlying genetic material. Thus, the manipulation of chromatin is a key step in many nuclear processes such as transcription, replication and repair. One of the means by which eukaryotes achieve this is through the use of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes that non-covalently alter its structure. These enzymes are members of a diverse group of proteins named after the archetypal <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Snf2 protein; the Snf2 family. Multiple members of this family of proteins are present in the sequenced genomes of eukaryotes of which the chromatin remodelling enzymes form distinct sub-groupings.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Recent crystal structures of the catalytic domain of two Snf2 related proteins<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> highlight structural similarities with the RecA domain found in a broad range of helicase related proteins. Snf2 proteins use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to alter DNA&#x02013;protein interactions. However, unlike <italic>bona fide</italic> helicases, the action of chromatin remodelling enzymes is not generally associated with separation of DNA strands. Instead they act to catalyse dynamic transitions in chromatin structure. This can result in a variety of different outcomes. <italic>In vitro</italic>, chromatin remodelling enzymes have been shown to cause alterations to DNA accessibility, effects on DNA and chromatin topology, partial or complete removal or exchange of histones from nucleosomes and translational changes in the position of the intact histone octamer along DNA.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>How these proteins interact with chromatin and the mechanism by which chromatin remodelling is achieved remains unclear. However, in many cases it is apparent that histone tail domains are important regulators of chromatin remodelling. Genetically, there are links between histone tails and remodelling. Deletion of the H2B tail bypasses the need for the SWI/SNF complex in the regulation of several genes,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> and deletion of the H2A tail affects transcription of some SWI/SNF dependent genes.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Importantly, post-translational modifications of histone tails affect chromatin remodelling. The recruitment and activity of the SWI/SNF complex <italic>in vivo</italic> is widely linked to that of the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex.<xref rid="bib7 bib8 bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7&#x02013;9</sup></xref> In addition, many chromatin remodelling complexes contain domains shown to bind modified amino acids, such as bromo- and chromodomains, PHD and WD40 domains.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In these cases modifications have been proposed to act as epitopes that facilitate recruitment of proteins containing the appropriate recognition domains. For example, histone acetylation has been found to facilitate retention of SWI/SNF on nucleosome arrays<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> in a way that is dependent on bromodomains within the Snf2 protein.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p><p>The majority of the best characterised modifications occur within the non-globular histone tail domains which protrude from the core of the nucleosome. These histone tails constitute up to 30% by mass of histones, but are not visible in the crystal structures of nucleosomes due to their high intrinsic flexibility and have been thought to be largely unstructured.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Their importance is highlighted by the fact that deletion of histone tails has wide spread effects on chromatin structure and gene regulation.<xref rid="bib14 bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14&#x02013;16</sup></xref> Histone modifications have been correlated with a variety of chromatin states. On a genome-wide basis, histone H3 K4 tri-methylation and H3 acetylation are strongly correlated with active transcriptional start sites, phosphorylated H2A.X foci mark sites of DNA damage, and H3 K9 tri-methylation promotes the formation of heterochromatin <italic>via</italic> interaction with HP1.<xref rid="bib10 bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10,17</sup></xref> This suggests that histone post-translational modifications are an important means by which cells spatially and temporally regulate specific loci independently of bulk chromatin.</p><p>Rigorously studying the effect of histone tail modifications <italic>in vitro</italic> has been hampered by the difficulty in isolating histones with defined and homogeneous modifications. To circumvent this we have adopted an approach to chemically synthesise modified histones by means of native chemical ligation. This technology has previously been applied to generating chromatin with uniform histone N-terminal tail modification patterns.<xref rid="bib18 bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18&#x02013;20</sup></xref> Using this approach we show that histone modifications can affect nucleosome remodelling <italic>via</italic> distinct pathways. Tetra-acetylation of histone H3 results in a modest increase in the rate of intrinsic nucleosome repositioning. The ATP-dependent remodelling enzyme RSC shows a striking preference for H3 but not H4 tetra-acetylated chromatin, remodelling this 16-fold faster than the control. By measuring the kinetic parameters of the remodelling reaction with a real-time ATPase assay, we show that this is due to a lower <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value for H3 acetylated nucleosomes. In contrast, tetra-acetylation of histone H4 affects nucleosome remodelling by the Isw2 enzyme <italic>via</italic> altering the <italic>K</italic><sub>cat</sub> rather than the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of the ATPase reaction. We also show that the yeast Chd1 enzyme is dependent on the H4 tail for efficient nucleosome remodelling in a manner similar to Isw2. Remarkably, histone H4 tetra-acetylation affects the rate of RSC catalysed nucleosome transfer <italic>in trans</italic> but not nucleosome sliding <italic>in cis</italic>. Thus, nucleosome modifications can affect enzyme catalysed remodelling reactions by altering the outcome of the reaction, through allosteric effects on ATPase activity and by acting as binding epitopes for recruitment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of modified chromatin</title><p>Modified histones were generated by ligating a bacterially expressed <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> globular histone containing an N-terminal cysteine and a tail peptide with the modification of choice synthesised chemically as a C-terminal thioester. The ligation was based on the protocol described by Dawson &#x00026; Kent<xref rid="bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21,22</sup></xref> and used thiophenol as the catalyst (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(a)). A key requirement of the globular histone is that it has an uncapped N-terminal cysteine available for ligation. One strategy that has been used previously to ensure that the initiator methionine is removed is the introduction of a protease cleavage site just before the cysteine to expose it post-translationally.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Mass spectrometry (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Data, Figure 1</xref>) and the work of other laboratories<xref rid="bib19 bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19,23</sup></xref> show that removal of the initiator methionine <italic>in vivo</italic> by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> methionine aminopeptidases is efficient when cysteine is the adjacent amino acid. This alleviates the requirement for more complex systems for generation of N-terminal cysteine residues.</p><p>Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals that under the conditions used, ligation does not proceed to completion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(b), lane 1). However, the full-length modified histone can be separated from the unreacted globular domain and tail peptide <italic>via</italic> multiple rounds of ion exchange chromatography to obtain material that was greater than 95% pure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(b)). The overall efficiency of ligation and subsequent purification is approximately 20% (data not shown). When modified histones were combined with other core histones to form histone octamers and purified by size exclusion chromatography, they displayed identical elution profiles to unmodified octamers (data not shown). Modified histone octamers could be reconstituted onto DNA fragments to form nucleosomes. Interestingly, acetylation of H3 and to a lesser extent H4 reduced the migration of nucleosomes on native polyacrylamide gels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(c)). This has been observed previously in the Bradbury laboratory using hyperacetylated histones purified from HeLa cells<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> and suggests that linker DNA conformation may be affected. This altered electrophoretic migration is not due to the ligation procedure as nucleosomes containing methylated lysine residues did not show this behaviour (not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Lysine acetylation can alter intrinsic nucleosome mobility</title><p>Although nucleosomes are stable with respect to dissociation, they can undergo a range of dynamic fluctuations in their structure. For example, following thermal incubation nucleosomes are frequently observed to redistribute to thermodynamically favoured locations.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> This movement of nucleosomes from one translational position on DNA to another can be followed using native PAGE.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Acetylated and control nucleosomes were reconstituted onto differentially labelled fluorescent DNA, mixed, incubated thermally and run on a native gel (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(a)). The different nucleosomes can then be visualised separately using selective excitation and emission filters. From this the proportion of nucleosomes at the initial and final position can be measured at each time point. The rate at which nucleosomes accumulate at their destination can then be plotted and a hyperbolic curve fitted to the data enabling the initial rate of redistribution to be estimated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(b)&#x02013;(e)). This approach has proved more reliable at directly comparing the behaviour of different nucleosomes.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p><p>Although native thiol ligation results in a normal peptide bond without the introduction of unusual chemical moieties, it requires the presence of a cysteine residue at the point of ligation. For this reason, the unmodified control nucleosomes used as a reference are point mutants containing a cysteine at the equivalent position to the modified histones. The sites selected for ligation involved substitution of cysteine for amino acids with similar overall dimensions (e.g serine to cysteine). None the less it was important to show that introduction of these mutations did not affect the behaviour of nucleosomes. <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Data, Figure 2</xref> shows a comparison of the thermal mobility of wild-type and cystein point mutant nucleosomes showing that the cystein mutations themselves have no discernable effect. The effects of the cysteine point mutations were also compared to wild-type histone sequences in other assays described below and in all cases no significant effect was detected (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Data, Figures 2, 3, 4</xref>; and data not shown). As a histone bearing the relevant cysteine point mutation is most closely matched to the product of a peptide ligation reaction, we have generally presented data using the point mutant as a control rather than the wild-type histone sequence. However, we are not aware of any cases where the choice of control affects the conclusions drawn.</p><p>H4 acetylated nucleosomes were observed to be repositioned at the same rate as control nucleosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(b)). In contrast, nucleosomes containing acetylated H3 relocated twice as fast as the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(c) and (e)). To test to what extent this was due to the partial neutralisation of basic charge that occurs upon acetylation of lysine residues, a histone H3 construct with lysine to alanine mutations at the four acetylated positions (H3 K9, 14, 18, 23A) was compared to wild-type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(d) and (e)). This nucleosome repositioned at the same rate as the control indicating that charge neutralisation is not the sole mechanism by which acetylation affects nucleosome mobility.</p></sec><sec><title>The RSC complex preferentially repositions tetra-acetylated H3 but not H4 nucleosomes</title><p>RSC is an abundant and essential yeast chromatin remodelling complex that is closely related to SWI/SNF.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> A notable feature of the RSC complex is that it contains almost half of the known bromodomains in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome. As bromodomains within other proteins have been found to recognise specific patterns of histone acetylation,<xref rid="bib29 bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29,30</sup></xref> a distinct possibility is that histone acetylation will influence the action of the RSC complex. To test this, the ability of RSC to remodel either H3 or H4 acetylated chromatin relative to unmodified control chromatin was assayed. RSC showed a dramatic preference for H3 (K9, 14, 18, 23) tetra-acetylated chromatin compared to an unmodified control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(a)). From the initial rates of remodelling derived from the plotted data, this was calculated to be 16(&#x000b1;1.5)-fold faster than control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(d)). When the rate of H4 (K5, 8, 12, 16) tetra-acetylated nucleosomes was measured, this was found to be indistinguishable from the rate of an unmodified control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(b) and (d)).</p><p>It is also worth noting that although the rate at which the H3S28C control nucleosomes are shifted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(a) is slower than the rate at which the H4V21C nucleosomes are shifted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(b), this should not be interpreted as indicating that the S28C mutation reduces the rate at which nucleosomes are repositioned by RSC. The reason that S28C nucleosomes are moved slower is due to the preferential engagement of RSC with acetylated nucleosomes at the expense of non-acetylated nucleosomes in the reaction mixture, as they are essentially in competition with each other. Indeed, comparing the rate of acetylated nucleosomes to either wild-type or cysteine containing control nucleosomes shows the same effect (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Data, Figure 3</xref>) This illustrates the importance of only making direct comparisons between the two templates present in the same remodelling assay. In this case, our data show that H3 acetylation stimulates nucleosome slding whereas H4 acetylation does not. Thus, none of the seven bromodomains found within the RSC complex appear to interact with acetylated lysines within the H4 tail in a way that affects nucleosome sliding. This is consistent with the observation that the relative rate of remodelling of a H3 and H4 acetylated nucleosome is not faster than a nucleosome that is just acetylated on the H3 tail (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(c) and (d)).</p></sec><sec><title>H3 tetra-acetylation influences remodelling by the RSC complex by affecting <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> but not <italic>K</italic><sub>cat</sub> of ATP hydrolysis and acts largely <italic>via</italic> H3 K14 acetylation</title><p>The increased rate with which RSC repositions H3 acetylated nucleosome could be due to the modified lysine residues acting to recruit RSC or by allosterically affecting the remodelling reaction. To differentiate between these two options, the kinetic parameters of the ATP hydrolysis reaction were measured using a real-time fluorescent ATPase assay.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> The assay hinges on using a phosphate binding protein (PBP) labelled with a coumarin-based fluorescent dye, 7-diethylamino-3-((((2-maleimidyl)ethyl)amino)carbonyl)coumarin (MDCC), as a sensor for the amount of inorganic phosphate (Pi). On binding Pi, the labelled protein (MDCC-PBP) undergoes a shift in its emission wavelength coupled with a fivefold increase in fluorescence. When performed in a fluorimeter, this assay has the advantage of measuring ATP hydrolysis in real-time, from which kinetic parameters such as <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> are determined by non-linear fitting to the Michaelis&#x02013;Menton equation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(a)&#x02013;(d)). We find that RSC has approximately threefold lower <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> (tighter binding) for H3 acetylated nucleosome compared to the unmodified control, without affecting the <italic>K</italic><sub>cat</sub> of ATP hydrolysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(e)). This is consistent with preferential recruitment of RSC to H3 acetylated chromatin and the preferential binding of RSC to H3 acetylated nucleosomes (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Data, Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, RSC does not preferentially bind H4 acetylated nucleosomes, as the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for these is the same as for the unmodified control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(e)). Consistent with this, the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value of the doubly H3, H4 acetylated nucleosome is indistinguishable from that of the H3 acetylated nucleosome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(e)).</p><p>Previous work from the Cairns laboratory has suggested the tandem bromodomains of the RSC4p subunit of the RSC complex interact with acetylated H3 K14.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> To test whether the single acetylation of lysine 14 is responsible for the dramatic effect of H3 (K9,14,18,23) tetra-acetylation on RSC activity, the singly acetylated nucleosome was generated and put through the same ATPase assay described above. From <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(e) it can be seen that as for H3 tetra-acetylated nucleosomes, the <italic>K</italic><sub>cat</sub> value remains unchanged. In contrast, the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value was significantly lowered, almost to the levels of the tetra-acetylated construct, suggesting that acetylation at a single residue, K14, confers the majority of the effect observed upon tetra-acetylation of the H3 tail.</p></sec><sec><title>The H4 tail and its acetylation influence remodelling by Isw2 by affecting the <italic>K</italic><sub>cat</sub> of ATP hydrolysis</title><p>Subfamilies of Snf2 family chromatin remodelling proteins contain different motifs capable of interacting with histones raising the possibility that they may be regulated in different ways by histone modifications. One of the defining characteristics of the Iswi subfamily of remodelling enzymes is that they require a particular epitope within the H4 tail for efficient remodelling activity.<xref rid="bib33 bib34 bib35 bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33&#x02013;36</sup></xref> One of the lysine residues adjacent to this motif, H4 K16, can be acetylated, and there is evidence that this reduces the activity of ISWI containing remodelling complexes.<xref rid="bib19 bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19,37</sup></xref> When we compared the relative rate of mobilisation of H4 tetra-acetylated nucleosomes relative to an unmodified control by the yeast Isw2 enzyme, we found that the rate is approximately 1.5-fold slower (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(b) and (c)). This reduction, whilst significant, is not as severe as deletion of the H4 tail (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(a) and (c)). However, its biological importance is underlined in studies on flies, where defects in the genetic interaction between H4 K16 acetylation and ISWI result in large scale chromosomal abnormalities.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref></p><p>Applying the same kinetic analysis performed previously to RSC shows that deletion or acetylation of the H4 tail lowers the turnover rate of the hydrolysis reaction (<italic>K</italic><sub>cat</sub>) without affecting nucleosome binding (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(d)). We have confirmed this by performing gel shifts of either full length or gH4 nucleosomes with Isw2 and observe no difference in binding (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Data, Figure 6</xref>). This contrasts with the effect of histone acetylation on remodelling by the RSC complex and shows that histone modifications can affect chromatin-remodelling enzymes at different stages of the reaction cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>The yeast Chd1 enzyme requires the H4 tail for efficient chromatin remodelling</title><p>Chd1 belongs to a phylogenetic subfamily that is distinct from either of the previously studied enzymes<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and contains a chromodomain that has the potential to recognise histone modifications. To investigate the histone dependence of this enzyme, we first tested the effect of deleting individual histone tails. We found that Chd1 is unable to efficiently slide nucleosomes lacking the H4 amino terminal tail (approximately sixfold slower than control: <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>(a), compare lanes 1&#x02013;6 with 7&#x02013;12). This requirement for the H4 tail is similar to that seen with Iswi remodellers such as Isw2, although the magnitude of the effect is lower. Mutation of residues 16&#x02013;19 to alanine caused a 4.4-fold reduction in Chd1 activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>(b)). Although this effect is significant it does not fully match the effect of a H4 truncation raising the possibility that the amino acids recognised by Chd1 include residues in addition to those within the 16&#x02013;19 region.</p><p>Acetylation of residues within the H4 tail also affected Chd1's nucleosome remodelling activity. Indeed, when this was tested, there was a modest 1.4-fold reduction in the initial rate of remodelling of acetylated H4 <italic>versus</italic> unmodified nucleosomes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>(c) and (d)). This raised the question of whether, as in the case of Isw2, the H4 tail was an allosteric activator of ATP hydrolysis or whether it was required as a binding epitope to recruit Chd1 to nucleosomes. Comparing the ATP hydrolysis rates of Chd1 with full-length and gH4 nucleosomes revealed that binding (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) was unaffected (see also <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Data, Figure 6</xref>(b)) and it was again the catalytic turnover rate which decreased in the absence of the H4 tail (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>(e)).</p></sec><sec><title>H4 acetylation leads to loss of histones <italic>in trans</italic></title><p>Studies with the RSC and SWI/SNF complexes <italic>in vitro</italic> have shown that in addition to being able to redistribute nucleosomes along DNA fragments, they can transfer histone octamers from one DNA fragment to another at lower efficiency. This entails the displacement of the histone octamer from one molecule of DNA and subsequent transfer onto a separate one. The SWI/SNF complex has been implicated in the disassembly and subsequent reassembly of nucleosomes at the Pho5 promoter.<xref rid="bib38 bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38,39</sup></xref> This loss of nucleosomes at the promoter is correlated with spikes in histone acetylation levels, leading to the hypothesis that ATP-dependent remodellers may recognise this signal and promote transfer. To test whether there is a direct link between histone modification and octamer transfer, the efficiency of octamer transfer from different chromatin substrates by the RSC complex was measured.</p><p>The octamer transfer reaction involves incubating a &#x0201c;cold&#x0201d; donor nucleosome with a &#x0201c;hot&#x0201d; <sup>32</sup>P-labelled accepter DNA fragment in the presence of RSC and ATP. The reaction products were run on a native polyacrylamide gel and transfer is indicated by a shift in mobility of the &#x0201c;hot&#x0201d; accepter DNA. If the accepter DNA has a histone octamer transferred onto it, it should now have the same mobility as a control nucleosome reconstituted onto the same fragment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(a)).</p><p>This was quantified as the fraction of radiolabelled free DNA incorporated into nucleosomes, as measured by mobility on a native polyacrylamide gel (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(b) and (c)). The amount of octamer transfer catalysed increased over time and was dependent on both ATP (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(b), lanes 1&#x02013;3) and RSC (data not shown). As expected, octamer transfer from H3 acetylated nucleosomes was greater compared to unmodified nucleosomes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(b), compare lanes 1&#x02013;3 and 4&#x02013;6). This is consistent with RSC having a lower <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for H3 acetylated nucleosomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) and the preferential nucleosome sliding seen in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. Surprisingly, when we looked at H4 acetylated donor nucleosomes, these were transferred considerably more efficiently than unmodified nucleosomes. Indeed, the amount of transfer was almost as high as that of H3 acetylated nucleosomes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(c)), despite RSC not showing any increased affinity towards H4 acetylated chromatin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). A doubly H3 and H4 acetylated nucleosome was in turn transferred more efficiently than either of the single histone acetylations.

However, in this view, the role of individual histone modifications has been less clear. Here we show that acetylation of the H3 tail increases the inherent thermal mobility of nucleosomes whereas acetylation of H4 does not (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(e)). This increase in mobility does not appear to be due to charge neutralisation alone, as mutation of the relevant lysine residues to alanine did not produce the same effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(d)).

Based on the helicase domain of the catalytic subunit, chromatin remodelling complexes can be classified into a number of different subfamilies.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Here we look at examples from three distinct subfamilies of chromatin remodellers: Chd1, Isw2 and RSC. The ATPase activity of these enzyme classes is stimulated by DNA and nucleosomes. Whereas it had been noted that histone tails and modifications affected their remodelling activity, it was not clear in many cases whether this was due to altered binding of modified nucleosomes or due to altered rates of ATP hydrolysis after binding. Using a real-time ATPase assay we show that depending on the particular enzyme involved either may be the case.</p><p>Analysis of the RSC complex confirmed that the improved remodelling of acetylated nucleosomes is due to higher substrate binding affinity and not due to increased ATP turnover (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(b)). This is consistent with previous observations of bromodomain containing remodelling enzymes, such as SWI/SNF, which show improved binding to acetylated chromatin templates.<xref rid="bib12 bib56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12,56</sup></xref> Remarkably, given the large number of bromodomains, the RSC complex shows no improved binding of H4 tetra-acetylated nucleosomes but rather, specifically H3 acetylated nucleosomes. By using chromatin with defined modification patterns we show that mono-acetylation at lysine 14 results in an increase in binding almost to the level seen with H3 tetra-acetylation. Consistent with this the Rsc4p subunit of RSC interacts genetically with H3 K14 but not H3 K9.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Studies from the Workman laboratory have shown that SWI/SNF and RSC have increased affinity for nucleosomes that have been acetylated by the NuA4 HAT complex.<xref rid="bib12 bib56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12,56</sup></xref> We show here that RSC does not preferentially bind H4 K5,8,12,16 tetra-acetylated nucleosomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(b)); however, these observations can be reconciled by the fact that NuA4 shows HAT activity towards other histones besides H4, most notably H2A,<xref rid="bib57 bib58" ref-type="bibr"><sup>57,58</sup></xref> and it may be this which results in the improved binding. For this reason, it would be interesting to test the affinity of RSC for nucleosomes containing acetylated H2A or H2B. Indeed, in high-resolution microarrays, H2A K7 acetylation but not H2B K16 acetylation is typically found in the same region of genes as H3 acetylation, and both are positively correlated with transcription.<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref></p><p>In the case of Isw2, we show that acetylation of H4 reduces nucleosome remodelling by lowering the <italic>K</italic><sub>cat</sub> of ATP hydrolysis and not by inhibiting nucleosome binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(c)). Thus, the unmodified H4 tail is required as an allosteric activator of ATP hydrolysis. This is consistent with the previous observation that acetylated H4 peptides have a reduced ability to stimulate ATP hydrolysis by dISWI in comparison to unmodified peptides.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> We also find that Chd1 activity is affected by modification and alteration to the H4 tail in a similar way to the Isw2 complex (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). It is notable that in the case of both Chd1 and Isw2, the effects of tail acetylation or truncation on ATPase activity are smaller than the effects on nucleosome sliding. It is possible that there is some amplification of the effect on ATPase activity due to multiple rounds of remodelling being required for repositioning. Alternatively, alterations to the H4 tail may reduce the efficiency with which these enzymes reposition nucleosomes in addition to altering their ability to hydrolyse ATP.</p><p>Previously, the requirement for the H4 tail for efficient nucleosome remodelling had only been observed for members of the Iswi subfamily of remodelling enzymes. However, there is evidence that there may be a significant degree of overlap in the function of Chd1 and Iswi subfamilies in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.

This effect of H3 acetylation in promoting octamer transfer can be explained through improved recruitment due to the increased affinity for the modified nucleosome. Indeed, octamer transfer by the homologous SWI/SNF complex has been shown to require its bromodomains to mediate octamer transfer of SAGA acetylated nucleosomes.<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr"><sup>69</sup></xref> An unexpected finding was that H4 tetra-acetylation also had a stimulatory effect (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(b) and (c)), in stark contrast to the results seen with nucleosome repositioning <italic>in cis</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(b) and (d)). However, the additional effect of H4 acetylation was confirmed by the fact that a doubly H3 and H4 acetylated nucleosome was transferred better still than a singly H3 acetylated nucleosome. Kinetic analysis of ATPase activity clearly shows that H4 tetra-acetylated nucleosomes are not bound any better than unmodified nucleosomes and they do not alter the rate of ATP hydrolysis by RSC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(b)). Thus, the increase in octamer transfer seen with H4 acetylated nucleosomes is not due to the modification recruiting or stimulating RSC activity but rather by affecting the nucleosome in such a way as to make it easier to transfer. In agreement with this, we find that H4 acetylated nucleosomes show increased thermally induced H2A/H2B dimer loss (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Data, Figure 7</xref>), indicating that this modification can affect chromatin dynamics independently of external factors. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that acetylation reduces the thermal stability of nucleosomes and H4 tetra-acetylation in particular reduces the thermal stability of nucleosomes almost to the level of bulk acetylation.<xref rid="bib70 bib71" ref-type="bibr"><sup>70,71</sup></xref> The finding that histone acetylation improves the efficiency of histone octamer transfer by remodelling enzymes helps to explain discrepancies between previous studies of transfer efficiency.

(a) Modified histones were generated by the ligation of chemically synthesised peptide bearing a C-terminal thioester group to an N-terminally truncated histone bearing an N-terminal cysteine. In this case the peptide consisted of amino acid residues 1&#x02013;27 of the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> H3 tail in which lysine residues 9, 14, 18 and 23 were acetylated and K27 synthesised as a thioester derivative. The histone was histone H3 in which amino acid residues 1&#x02013;27 had been truncated and the new N-terminal residue mutated from serine to cysteine. The ligation reaction proceeds <italic>via</italic> an irreversible intramolecular rearrangement to produce a covalent native peptide bond without the introduction of unnatural chemical moieties. (b) Full-length acetylated histones were purified away from the reactants by two rounds of ion exchange chromatography using a step gradient. Lane 1 shows a representative reaction in which ligation had proceeded to around 40%. The top two panels show the traces from the first and second chromatography runs used to purify the ligated product from the unreacted material. The bottom panel shows SDS&#x02013;PAGE of fractions taken form the positions (i, ii, and iii) indicated on the traces. Fraction iii, consists of over 95% ligated full length histone H3. (c) Acetylated histone octamers formed nucleosomes similar to those formed by unmodified histone octamers. Interestingly, the mobility of tetra-acetylated H3 nucleosomes during native PAGE was slightly reduced compared to control nucleosomes of the wild-type sequence; compare lanes 1 and 2 or histones containing cysteine point mutations (not shown).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig><fig id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Effects of histone acetylation on intrinsic nucleosome mobility. (a) Outline of competitive remodelling assay used to accurately measure differences between nucleosomes. This setup has the advantage that the reaction times and conditions are exactly the same for two nucleosomes and avoids the possibility of observing effects due to different nucleosome reconstitution efficiencies. (b) Histone H4 tetra-acetylation does not alter the rate at which nucleosomes reposition thermally. Two pmol of H4 acetylated and H4 V21C unmodified nucleosomes assembled on 54A54 DNA were mixed and incubated at 47&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for the specified amount of time. The images represent the Cy3 (H4 V21C) and Cy5 (H4 acetylated) scans of the same gel. The amount of remodelling is plotted to the right of the gels and a hyperbolic curve fitted to the data points. From this the initial rate of repositioning is calculated and the average of three independent repeats displayed in (e). (c) Tetra-acetylation of H3 results in a twofold increase in the rate of intrinsic nucleosome mobility. Reaction conditions are as for (b). (d) The increase in nucleosome mobility by H3 acetylation is not solely due to charge neutralisation. Two pmol of H3 wild-type and H3 in which the lysine residues at position 9, 14, 18 and 23 had been substituted to alanine were assembled on 54A18 DNA were mixed and incubated at 47&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for the specified amounts of time. Substituting the lysine residues with alanine, which will reduce the basic charge of the tail, had no effect on nucleosome mobility.

(a) Octamer transfer assay: RSC is able to disrupt nucleosomes and transfer the histone octamer from unlabelled donor nucleosomes onto a separate DNA molecule, in this case a radiolabelled 147&#x000a0;bp 0W0 fragment derived from the 601 positioning sequence. This is measured by the shift in mobility of a radiolabelled DNA fragment to that of a nucleosome. (b) Efficiency of octamer transfer from different donor nucleosomes. H3 tetra-acetylated nucleosomes are transferred faster than unmodified nucleosomes consisting of wild-type H3 and H4: compare lanes 4&#x02013;6 with lanes 1&#x02013;3. Surprisingly, H4 tetra-acetylated nucleosomes are also transferred faster than control: compare lanes 7&#x02013;9 with lanes 1&#x02013;3. When both H3 and H4 are acetylated the effect is additive (compare lanes 10&#x02013;12 with 1&#x02013;3). Lane 13 shows an equivalent amount of free DNA in the absence of RSC or nucleosomes and lane 14 is a nucleosome reconstituted separately on the same DNA fragment as a mobility reference.
