On average, these mutations are associated with milder biochemical phenotypes raising the question about their pathogenic relevance. In this study, we analyzed the impact of 10 <italic>ACADM</italic> mutations identified in NBS (A27V, Y42H, Y133H, R181C, R223G, D241G, K304E, R309K, I331T and R388S) on conformation, stability and enzyme kinetics of the corresponding proteins. Partial to total rescue of aggregation by co-overexpression of GroESL indicated protein misfolding. This was confirmed by accelerated thermal unfolding in all variants, as well as decreased proteolytic stability and accelerated thermal inactivation in most variants. Catalytic function varied from high residual activity to markedly decreased activity or substrate affinity. Mutations mapping to the &#x003b2;-domain of the protein predisposed to severe destabilization. <italic>In silico</italic> structural analyses of the affected amino acid residues revealed involvement in functionally relevant networks. Taken together, our results substantiate the hypothesis of protein misfolding with loss-of-function being the common molecular basis in MCADD. Moreover, considerable structural alterations in all analyzed variants do not support the view that novel mutations found in NBS bear a lower risk of metabolic decompensation than that associated with mutations detected in clinically ascertained patients. Finally, the detailed insight into how <italic>ACADM</italic> missense mutations induce loss of MCAD function may provide guidance for risk assessment and counseling of patients, and in future may assist delineation of novel pharmacological strategies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Newborn screening (NBS) for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD; MIM #201450) by tandem-mass spectrometry has successfully been implemented in many countries worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C1">1</xref>). MCADD revealed a notably higher birth prevalence (&#x0223c;1:15000) than previously estimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C3">3</xref>) and nowadays is the disorder most frequently diagnosed in NBS, together with phenylketonuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C4">4</xref>). The disease leads to a defect in mitochondrial &#x003b2;-oxidation of fatty acids. Patients show a decreased ability to withstand catabolic stress and risk coma and death due to hypoketotic hypoglycemia during prolonged fasting or intercurrent illness. In undiagnosed patients, the disorder shows a significant morbidity and mortality. Approximately 20% of patients die during their first metabolic crisis and &#x0223c;40% of the survivors show sustained neurological impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C7">7</xref>). Once diagnosed, however, adverse effects can be prevented by avoidance of fasting during episodes of catabolic stress. Thus, MCADD is the disorder thought to most justify early detection by NBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C4">4</xref>).</p><p>In patients diagnosed after metabolic decompensation, the mutation K304E (c.985A&#x0003e;G) (<italic>ACADM</italic> gene; OMIM #607008) has been shown to account for 90% of defective alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C8">8</xref>) and therefore is considered to be a severe mutation associated with a high risk of clinical manifestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C9">9</xref>). K304E and few other missense mutations identified in symptomatic patients were previously shown to induce protein misfolding and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C17">17</xref>).</p><p>MCADD patients identified by NBS show a considerably wider genotypic heterogeneity with the mutation K304E being less prevalent. Numerous novel mutations were unraveled including a second prevalent mutation, Y42H (c.199T&#x0003e;C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C20">20</xref>). After diagnosis, patients carrying these allelic variants follow disease management plans to avoid metabolic crises. Thus, the natural course of MCADD associated with this new group of mutations is unlikely to be witnessed. On average, these patients express lower disease markers (octanoylcarnitine and related acylcarnitine ratios in blood) than observed in homo- or heterozygosity for K304E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C20">20</xref>). However, the different genotypes show a high variability of values, and it is generally accepted that the biochemical phenotype does not allow for a reliable assessment of the risk associated with the single mutations. Insights into the molecular effects of the mutations on the corresponding protein would be helpful to estimate their pathogenic relevance. Yet, experimental data on the molecular consequences of the various novel missense mutations identified in NBS is scarce and mainly refers to the mild temperature-sensitive Y42H mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C22">22</xref>). The aim of this study, therefore, was to elucidate the impact of mutations found in presymptomatic newborns on conformation, stability and catalytic function of the variant MCAD proteins.</p><p>MCAD is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD) family of flavoproteins, which catalyzes the first step of the mitochondrial &#x003b2;-oxidation of medium-chain fatty acids. The ACAD family comprises nine known members, five of which are involved in fatty acid oxidation, four in amino acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C23">23</xref>). Each subunit of the homotetrameric MCAD enzyme is composed of three structural domains of approximately equal size, namely the N-terminal &#x003b1;-domain (residues 1&#x02013;129), the &#x003b2;-domain (residues 130&#x02013;239) and the C-terminal &#x003b1;-domain (residues 240&#x02013;396). The N- and C-terminal domains predominantly consist of densely packed &#x003b1;-helices, which shape the core of the tetramer. The middle &#x003b2;-domains are exposed at the surface of the molecule and comprise two orthogonal &#x003b2;-sheets. The catalytic centers consisting of the binding sites for the substrate and the natural cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are mainly formed by the interface between the &#x003b2;-domain and the C-terminal &#x003b1;-domain. The three-dimensional (3D) structure is a tetrahedral arrangement of a dimer of dimers with an overall diameter of &#x0223c;90&#x000c5;. The interactions between the two monomers forming a dimer are extensive and involve the FAD binding site, whereas between the two dimers predominantly helix&#x02013;helix interactions are found, similar to a four-helix bundle structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C23">23</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we characterized ten MCAD variants with single amino acid substitutions spread over the protein derived from mutations previously reported from the NBS in Bavaria, Germany, including the two prevalent mutations Y42H and K304E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C3">3</xref>). We established a high-yield purification protocol for recombinant prokaryotic expression of wild-type and variant MCAD proteins using a maltose binding protein (MBP)-tag. The purified proteins were subsequently characterized with respect to oligomerization, enzyme kinetics, proteolytic stability, thermal inactivation and thermal unfolding. Impressively, all variants showed alterations of protein function, yet in heterogeneous ways. Catalytic function varied from high residual activity to markedly decreased activity and severe alteration of substrate affinity. We observed aggregation with partial rescue by co-overexpression of chaperonins, decreased proteolytic stability and accelerated thermal inactivation in most variants. Thermal unfolding was facilitated in all variants. Data on proteolytic and thermal stability revealed that conformational changes and destabilization are most pronounced in mutations mapping to the &#x003b2;-domain of the protein. These results substantiate the hypothesis of protein misfolding with loss-of-function being the common molecular basis in MCADD. The hypothesis holds true not only for the common variant K304E, but also for mutations derived from presymptomatic patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Disturbed oligomerization is partially rescued by co-overexpression of GroESL</title><p>Wild-type and ten variant forms of MCAD (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP079F1">1</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="DDP079TB1">1</xref>) were purified by affinity chromatography and subsequent size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) to analyze the oligomeric states of the expressed fusion proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP079F2">2</xref>).

This finding was most pronounced in variants Y133H and D241G with residual protein amounts of 10 and 8%, respectively. Notably, the plateau of degradation of the wild-type protein was found to be 70%, indicating that at the assay conditions (37&#x000b0;C, 120 min) 30% of the wild-type protein is unfolded. This finding reflects the thermal sensitivity of the MCAD protein, which is additionally influenced by the protein concentrations used in the assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C21">21</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="DDP079TB3" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;3.</label><caption><p>Proteolytic stability of wild-type and variant MCAD proteins</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Missense mutation</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> (min)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SEM</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic>-value</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Plateau (%)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SEM</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic>-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">WT</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">70.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A27V</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">34.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ns</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ns</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Y42H</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">41.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ns</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ns</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Y133H</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.05</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.01</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R181C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ns</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">33.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.01</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">D241G</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ns</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.01</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">K304E</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ns</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ns</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R309K</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.05</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">47.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.01</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R388S</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.30</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ns</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ns</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Stability of wild-type (WT) and variant MCAD proteins against limited proteolysis by proteinase K.

To gain further insights into how these mutations exert their deleterious effects on the protein, we used a 3D structural model of the porcine MCAD tetramer to investigate, whether the amino acid residues affected are involved in networks of side-chain interactions with functional and conformational impact.</p><p>Residue Y133 maps to the &#x003b2;-sheet domain (residues 130&#x02013;239) and is an essential part of the active site (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP079F5">5</xref>A). It directly interacts with the cofactor FAD via hydrogen bond formation. Its aromatic side-chain points towards the hydrophobic core of the deep binding cavity for the fatty acid portion of the substrate establishing hydrophobic interactions with the residues L103, V135, F177, A248 and F252 which line the cavity. To poise the C<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> bond of the fatty acid for dehydrogenation, it is sandwiched between the <italic>re</italic>-face of the isoalloxazine moiety of FAD and the catalytic base E376. A replacement of the large, hydrophobic tyrosine by the smaller, positively charged histidine is supposed to distort the hydrophobic packing of the binding cavity and by this to lead to a conformational rearrangement of the active site pocket. As a result, the correct 3D arrangement of FAD, the C<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> bond of the substrate and the catalytic base E376 will be impaired leading to the marked disturbance in enzyme function. Moreover, A248 and F252 are located within the &#x003b1;-helix G. Interactions between &#x003b1;-helices G and H in one subunit of the dimer and &#x003b1;-helices I and K in the opposite unit of the adjacent dimer are known to promote MCAD tetramer assembly from dimers. Hence, conformational alteration of the substrate binding cavity with impairment of the helix&#x02013;helix interactions due to the Y133H substitution might explain the observed distortion of the oligomeric state.</p><fig id="DDP079F5" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;5.</label><caption><p>Functional and conformational involvement of amino acid residues affected by <italic>MCAD</italic> mutations in networks of side-chain interactions.

Hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions are shown as golden dotted lines. The cofactor FAD and the substrate analog 3-thiaoctanoyl-CoA are shown in yellow and in purple, respectively. (<bold>A</bold>) Residue Y133 is located at the beginning of the &#x003b2;-domain of the protein (subunit A, blue). It is part of the active site crevice by binding the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, together with T136 and T168. The aromatic side chain of Y133 establishes hydrophobic interactions with A100, L103, P107, V135, F177, A248, F252 and V259. These residues shape the hydrophobic core of the deep binding cavity for the fatty acid portion of the substrate. The precise three-dimensional arrangement of FAD, the C<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> bond of the substrate and the catalytic base E376 is the basis for enzyme function. Moreover, the structural integrity of the hydrophobic core of this cavity is crucial for the assembly of tetramers from dimers by four-helix bundle interactions between &#x003b1;-helices G and H in one subunit (subunit A, blue) and &#x003b1; helices I and K in the opposite unit of the adjacent dimer (subunit D, red). (<bold>B</bold>) The guanidinium side-chain of R181 adopts a central position in the extended loop structure (residues 182&#x02013;193) at the surface of the protein that connects &#x003b2;-strands 4 and 5 (subunit A, blue). R181 networks with loop residues D183, D185, K187 and A188 via hydrogen bonds, and this contributes to the correct spatial conformation of the loop. The neighboring S182 interacts with T195 in &#x003b2;-strand 5, which establishes interactions to the loop (residues 239&#x02013;244) interconnecting the &#x003b2;-domain with the C-terminal &#x003b1;-domain. The following &#x003b1;-helix G is part of both the hydrophobic core of the active site and the four-helix bundle between &#x003b1;-helices G and H in one subunit (subunit A, blue) and &#x003b1;-helices I and K in the opposite unit of the adjacent dimer (subunit D, red) assembling the tetramer. The active site is represented by the cofactor FAD interacting with Y133, T136 and T168, the C<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> bond of the substrate, and the catalytic base E376. (<bold>C</bold>) Residue R388 is located in the C-terminal &#x003b1;-helix K and is part of an interface between two subunits forming the dimer (subunit A, blue; subunit B, yellow). The interface defines a funnel-shaped crevice, the entrance to the active site. Subunit A (blue) lines the crevice with &#x003b1;-helix K and the loops between &#x003b2;-strands 4 and 5 (containing R181) and &#x003b1;-helices H and I. The adjacent subunit B (yellow) contributes to the interface via the loop between &#x003b1;-helices G and H. R388 joins a network of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions comprising residues E389, R324, N325, D253 and S191, which bind the CoA moiety of the substrate to the entrance of the active site (subunit A, blue). R281 and T283 in the adjacent subunit (subunit B, yellow) interact with the pyrophosphate and the adenine ring of the cofactor FAD.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ddp07905"/></fig><p>R181 is located at the beginning of an extended loop structure (residues 181&#x02013;193) at the surface of the protein that connects &#x003b2;-sheets 4 and 5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP079F5">5</xref>B). The loop contributes to the crevice shaping the entrance to the active site and, due to its strong interactions with the beginning of the C-terminal &#x003b1;-domain, plays a pivotal role for MCAD tetramerization. R181 networks with D183, D185, K187 and A188 to poise the loop in its proper structural conformation. It is well conceivable that the severe structural distortion of the protein with reduced stability and impaired tetramer assembly shown for R181C is due to a disruption of this network caused by the replacement of arginine by a small, polar, uncharged amino acid.</p><p>R388 maps to the end of the C-terminal &#x003b1;-domain (residues 240&#x02013;396) and is part of an interface of two subunits that define a funnel-shaped crevice, the entrance to the active site mentioned above (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP079F5">5</xref>C). It is shaped by &#x003b1;-helix K and the loops among &#x003b2;-sheets 4 and 5, &#x003b1;-helices H and I and &#x003b1;-helices G and H of the adjacent subunit. R388 forms a hydrogen bond to the AMP portion of the CoA moiety and is part of a side-chain network comprising both hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions with the neighboring residues E389 and R324 in the loop between &#x003b1;-helices H and I. A substitution of the large, basic, positively charged arginine by serine might disrupt this network by introducing a gap in the 3D structure of the crevice. This conformational rearrangement at the entrance to the active site will hinder the accessibility of the substrate octanoyl-CoA and the interaction with the AMP portion of the CoA moiety. This is in line with our observation that R388S displays a significant decrease in substrate affinity for octanoyl-CoA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>NBS for MCADD has revealed an increasing number of missense mutations that have never been identified in clinically diagnosed patients and we have previously described eight of these mutations identified in the Bavarian NBS program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C3">3</xref>). Since clinical management protects patients diagnosed by NBS from sequels of catabolic stress, the clinical risk associated with this particular set of mutations still remained unclear. The question, whether patients carrying these mutations might be at lower or no risk of experiencing metabolic decompensation is therefore a matter of controversial debate, and concern has been raised on whether NBS creates unwarranted anxiety in parents and health-care professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C28">28</xref>). To address this issue, we analyzed the corresponding recombinant variant proteins aiming (i) to evaluate whether the mutations are genuinely pathogenic, (ii) to assess the severity of the mutation's impact and (iii) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of loss-of-function. Having applied complementary strategies, we provide several lines of experimental evidence that all novel missense mutations identified in our NBS lead to protein misfolding with severe impact on structural conformation, protein stability and to a lower extent, on enzyme kinetics. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that MCADD adds to the growing catalogue of protein misfolding disorders with loss-of-function. Moreover, the experimental data do not support the view that novel mutations found in NBS bear a lower risk of metabolic decompensation than that associated with mutations detected in clinically ascertained patients, but this remains a possibility.</p><p>Two variants showed a complete loss of protein function due to aggregation (I331T) and degradation (R223G), respectively. Most remaining variants necessitated co-overexpression of GroESL for tetramer assembly. Only R388S formed into apparently normal tetramers without co-overexpression of chaperonins. The findings of increased propensity of variant MCAD proteins to form aggregates in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and partial rescue by increasing the amount of available chaperonins was regarded as a first evidence for misfolding. Although co-overexpression of GroESL can assist to overcome protein misfolding in terms of aggregation and by this promote the formation of correctly assembled oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C29">29</xref>), it does not correct for the mutation induced structural defects of the variant protein. These defects were then analyzed in detail in this study.</p><p>All purified tetrameric MCAD variants revealed alterations of structural conformation, yet of various degrees. Interestingly, all variants showed thermal instability. Thermal unfolding was accelerated with a shift of the transition midpoint (wild-type, 52.6&#x000b0;C) by &#x0003e;4&#x000b0;C in most variants and down to 40&#x000b0;C in variant R181C. Thermal inactivation experiments revealed a 50% loss-of-function at temperatures &#x0003c;40&#x000b0;C (wild-type 44.5&#x000b0;C) in all variants except for K304E and R388S. This observation is of particular interest, since in a considerable share of patients with MCADD metabolic decompensation occurs during intercurrent illness with fever. These findings are in line with the previous data on thermal stability of other variant MCAD proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C22">22</xref>). Moreover, we observed that thermal instability was most pronounced in variants mapping to the &#x003b2;-sheet domain of the protein (Y133H, R181C) or to the loop interconnecting this domain and the C-terminal &#x003b1;-helix domain (D241G).</p><p>Additional evidence for protein instability arose from our data on limited proteolysis. Most variants showed an increased susceptibility against proteolytic attack indicating disturbed folding kinetics (i.e. shift of the folding equilibrium towards the unfolded state) and local unfolding. Mild alterations were observed in variants derived from mutations located in the tightly packed C-terminal &#x003b1;-domain. Again, the variants mapping to the &#x003b2;-sheet domain and its subsequent loop disclosed the most pronounced alterations consistent with severe conformational changes.</p><p>In two variants located in the &#x003b2;-sheet domain (Y133H and R181C), severe alterations of protein conformation were evident even without thermal or proteolytic stress. Elevated ground state ANS fluorescence revealed an increase in hydrophobicity and thus a shift to the non-native state of these proteins. In Y133H, the induced conformational changes led to a severe destabilization and almost complete loss-of-function with a residual catalytic activity of 3.5%. The affected amino acid residue Y133 is part of the active site in two respects. Together with T136 and T168, it anchors the co-factor FAD to the protein via hydrogen bonds. In addition, the aromatic side chain of Y133 contributes to the hydrophobic core lining the binding cavity for the fatty acid. Previous studies characterizing the molecular phenotype of T168A (c.577A&#x0003e;G), a mutation that has been identified in a clinically diagnosed patient, are in line with our observations revealing misfolding, markedly decreased thermal stability and catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C18">18</xref>). In contrast, R181C showed a residual catalytic activity comparable to wild-type despite its severe conformational alterations. Our data are consistent with the notion that the major molecular basis for the pathogenesis of this variant <italic>in vivo</italic> may be protein instability under physiological stress pointing to a high risk of metabolic decompensation during times of illness, especially associated with fever. As previously reported, a patient homozygous for this mutation showed remarkably mild biochemical alterations in NBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C3">3</xref>), although a mutation affecting the same amino acid residue (R181L; c.617G&#x0003e;T) was identified in two symptomatic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C30">30</xref>). Our experimental data emphasize that mild biochemical alterations in NBS do not allow implying a low risk for decompensation.</p><p>Mutations located in the N-terminal &#x003b1;-domain showed moderate effects on tetramer assembly and thermal stability together with decreased (A27V) or normal catalytic activity (Y42H). Consistent with our findings, mutations located in this region have previously been described as mild folding variants with normal activity (M124I; c.447G&#x0003e;A), medium range activity (R28C; c.157C&#x0003e;T) or moderate thermal instability (Y42H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C21">21</xref>). However, &#x003b1;-helices A, C and D of this domain form the recognition site of the electron transfer flavoprotein, which is the natural electron acceptor of the MCAD protein and responsible for the electron transfer to the respiratory chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C31">31</xref>). Whether structural changes in this domain result in an alteration of electron transfer rates remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In contrast, mutations located in the C-terminal &#x003b1;-domain (K304E, R309K, I331T) often affect helix&#x02013;helix interactions crucial for tetramer assembly leading to aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C23">23</xref>). However, when aggregation was overcome by co-overexpression of chaperonins, these variants showed considerable residual activities. Interestingly, R388S, also located in the C-terminal &#x003b1;-domain, was the only variant that did not require co-overexpression of GroESL for tetramer formation and its proteolytic and thermal stabilities were only moderately affected. In this variant, misfolding resulted in a marked decrease of substrate affinity. Similar effects on <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> have been shown for artificial variants of the homologous arginine residue R387 of the ACAD isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C32">32</xref>) and have been predicted from crystal structure analysis for the ACAD glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C33">33</xref>). Our data substantiate the essential role of this highly conserved arginine residue for binding of the substrate in ACADs.</p><p>The observations obtained from analyzing variants harboring amino acid substitutions in different regions of the protein show that mutations in the &#x003b2;-sheet domain and the adjacent loop (interconnecting the &#x003b2;-domain and the C-terminal &#x003b1;-domain) are particularly instable and prone to severe conformational distortion. This is in line with the previous work describing severely impaired biogenesis and stability for two other variants located in the &#x003b2;-domain, T168A and G170R (c.583G&#x0003e;A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C15">15</xref>). Misfolding observed in these variants has been attributed to the loss of FAD anchoring, which has been reported to be crucial for folding and oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C34">34</xref>). However, the compiled data including our variants spread over the &#x003b2;-domain indicate that not only reduced FAD binding, but also the structural and functional characteristics of the &#x003b2;-domain itself account for the protein destabilization observed.</p><p>In conclusion, all mutations analyzed in this study showed significant alterations of the molecular phenotype ranging from mild to severe. Six of the mutations (Y133H, R181C, R223G, D241G, I331T and R388S) identified in presymptomatic newborns revealed even more pronounced perturbances than the variant K304E, which is generally accepted to be associated with a severe molecular and clinical phenotype. It has to be noted, however, that patients homozygous for K304E may experience a healthy life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C2">2</xref>) and our findings of a severe molecular phenotype do not unequivocally prove a severe clinical phenotype. Standard diagnostic procedures such as the determination of blood acylcarnitine concentrations do not allow for a meaningful prediction of the clinical course. Hence, compiled knowledge gained by documentation of the clinical and biochemical course of specific genotypes in combination with detailed molecular characterization of the respective variants at the protein level will improve genotype&#x02013;phenotype correlation. This may assist counseling and risk assessment of MCADD patients identified in NBS programs. In this context, it has also to be taken into account that most patients revealing mutations other than the predominant K304E are compound heterozygous. Moreover, gene&#x02013;gene interactions and gene&#x02013;environment interactions such as cellular and environmental conditions or stressors may also modify the natural course of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C35">35</xref>).</p><p>A molecular scenario similar to that now identified for MCADD was recently described for the phenylalanine hydroxylase protein, the enzyme deficient in phenylketonuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C36">36</xref>). In this disease, experimental evidence is now available that the well proven efficacy of tetrahydrobiopterin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C38">38</xref>) is based on a pharmacological chaperone effect. For MCAD, we and others showed that increasing the amount of available molecular chaperones (GroESL) prevents MCAD aggregation and leads to higher amounts of functional protein. The persisting loss-of-function is then predominantly promoted by instability against thermal or proteolytic stress. Early degradation could thus be overcome using pharmacological chaperones, conceivably in combination with proteostasis regulators as recently shown for lysosomal storage diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C39">39</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the detailed insight into how <italic>ACADM</italic> missense mutations induce conformational alteration and protein destabilization resulting in loss of enzyme function presented here may in future provide the basis to delineate novel pharmacological strategies for the potentially fatal MCADD disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Subjects and mutations</title><p>In the previous study, we described the spectrum of sequence variations occurring in newborns with MCADD detected by NBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP079C3">3</xref>).
