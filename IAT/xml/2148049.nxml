A KO of this gene along with a high fat diet in a mice model has been associated with the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The aims of this study were to measure and compare the <italic>MGAT4A </italic>mRNA levels in white blood cells (WBC) from T2D subjects and healthy subjects (T2NB), and to measure the half-life of the <italic>MGAT4A </italic>mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We studied a sample of 73 individuals, 40 T2D subjects and 33 T2NB subjects. Anthropometrical and biochemical profiles were registered. The <italic>MGAT4A </italic>mRNA levels in WBC and the transcript half-life in Jurkat T cells were determined by Real-Time PCR. A blood differential cell counting was made for each individual. Cell counting showed T2D subjects exhibited an increased number of WBC compared to T2NB subjects (<italic>P </italic>= 0.0001). Biochemical parameters such as fasting glucose (<italic>P </italic>= 0.0001), and triglycerides (<italic>P </italic>= 0.002) were statistically significant.

This gene is located in the chromosome 2 (2q12), and the 8382 bases mRNA encoding the isozyme A (NCBI, NM_012214) contains 15 introns, 16 exons and encodes a protein of 535-aminoacids (NCBI, NP_036346). The <italic>MGAT4A </italic>gene is well conserved as demonstrate the 96% identity on the primary aminoacid sequence shared between the <italic>MGAT4A </italic>and the bovine GnT-IV glycosilases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Transcripts of 9.7, 7.6, 5.1, 3.8, and 2.4 kb have been detected by Northern-blot in several human tissues and human derived cell lines; and the relative expression levels of these transcripts were similar among the different tissues and cell lines tested, with higher expression in spleen, thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes, lymph node, prostate, pancreas, and small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the case of the cell lines tested, the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 and the lymphoblastic leukemia cell line MOLT-4 showed the highest expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The human glycosylase IV is a type II membrane protein, similar to other known Golgi glycosyltransferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. <italic>MGAT4A </italic>has three known isoforms and may play a role regulating the availability of serum glycoproteins, oncogenesis, and cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Oligosaccharide antigens are commonly used as tumor markers and many studies have shown these antigens can modulate tumor cell adhesion, motility, and invasiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Recently the <italic>MGAT4A </italic>was identified as a genetic marker for pancreatic cancer in addition to its known role in choriocarcinoma development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is remarkable since reports of defects in protein glycosylation are becoming increasingly associated with a range of human diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown that high counts of peripheral white blood cells (WBC) are associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Concomitant to this increment, polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells can be activated by advanced glycation end products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and cytokines in a state of hyperglycemia, typical features of T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. On the other hand lymphocytes have acquired significance like cell model to study the expression of several biomarkers, since they offer a convenient alternative to invasive methods of diagnosis aimed to measure the expression of several important T2D associated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The important role of <italic>MGAT4A </italic>function in the development of T2D was shown in studies using engineered mice lacking <italic>MgaT4a</italic>. These mice were phenotypically hyperglycemic, hypoinsulinemic and had impaired glucose tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The role of <italic>MgaT4a </italic>on controlling the traffic of GLUT2 in pancreatic &#x003b2; cells was described in these mice, linking a high fat diet with the development of experimental diabetes in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>As has been mentioned before, alterations in the expression of this gene have been implicated in the development of several human diseases such as choriocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], showing that defective function of this gene is of pathological consequence for the organism. We hypothesized <italic>MGAT4A </italic>gene expression might be affected in individuals suffering of T2D. With this purpose we determined the level of MGAT4A expression in white cells of peripheral blood of well characterized T2D patients and healthy subjects, and measure the half-life of the transcript in a model lymphocyte T cell line.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>T2D phenotype biochemical tests and WBC counts</title><p>The clinical and biochemical profile of the subjects under study are summarized in the Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. T2D subjects have an average of seven years of evolution, and the average age of the selected group of subjects in both categories are comparable, guaranteeing the healthy condition of controls. In the T2D group, the biochemical values for glucose, HDL and LDL parameters are in concordance with the phenotype of the disease. The BMI for both groups indicates overweight, what is a common feature in nowadays Mexico City's inhabitants. The diastolic and systolic blood pressures in both groups show absence of hypertension and none of the participants had cardiovascular complications at the time of the study. Neither group of subjects received anti-hypertensive drugs to control the blood pressure.

Our results shows that <italic>MGAT4A </italic>gene expression in WBC from T2D patients exhibited higher levels of transcripts concentration compared to the healthy subjects (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This result is remarkable since in the mice model, the <italic>MGAT4A </italic>transcripts levels have been reported low, while the animals are phenotipically hyperglycemic, hypoinsulinemic and had impaired glucose tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. One explanation to this result is we measured the transcripts in WBC and not in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells being this difference due to differential tissue specific gene expression. However a more interesting plausible explanation is the higher level of <italic>MGAT4A </italic>gene expression exhibited by the T2D subjects, is a consequence of a low pro-inflammatory state derived of chronic hyperglycaemia, a common condition in T2D patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Interestingly the WBC count was higher in the T2D subjects compared to the healthy individuals, suggesting that the increase in <italic>MGAT4A </italic>transcripts levels and WBC count are related with the metabolic disorder observed in T2D patients. In the development of T2D it is emerging the knowledge of the existence of many genes that are down or up-regulated during the development of the disease as is demonstrated in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>MGAT4A </italic>transcript exhibits a half-life of 2.04 h, measured by Real-Time PCR in the human Jurkat T cell line used like model in this work (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>); this half-life classifies this mRNA in the so called protein modification group of transcripts, with an average half-life of &#x0003c;5 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Thus we propose that an increase in MGAT4A transcripts level and augmented WBC number in the bloodstream contribute to a pro-inflammatory state and other metabolic alterations observed in T2D patients. This explanation is based on the observation that high levels of glucose and triglycerides contributes to high stress environment for the WBC, mainly lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This stress could trigger the activation of this type of cells, increasing even more the WBC count and the <italic>MGAT4A </italic>transcript level, but only in subjects with a particular T2D genetic background. We hypothesize this condition does not occurs in healthy people prior to the onset of any clinical manifestation of the disease or prior to the hyperinsulinemia present in obese individuals or T2D patients with recent diagnosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We report a high expression of MGAT4A mRNA in WBC of T2D patients; and we consider that glycosylase IVA involved in WBC proliferation and activation associated with the pro-inflammatory condition found in most cases of T2D patients, is one of the several gene products with an important role in the pathogenesis events triggering diabetes. We also show white blood cells provide a sample useful to measure the expression of these genes, which permits to acquire data to infer about the pro-inflammatory condition of the individuals in relation with diabetes. We also found that the <italic>MGAT4A </italic>mRNA belongs to the protein modification group of transcripts, with an average half-life of less than 5 h.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects Profile</title><p>A population-based register of individuals belonging to low and medium economic ranks living in Mexico City were selected from a T2D cohort.

The transcript concentration was the average of triplicate determinations and was expressed as a normalized value to the &#x003b2;-actin mRNA levels for each individual.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of mRNA half-life</title><p>Detection of a 323 bp <italic>MGAT4A </italic>and a 587 bp &#x003b2;-actin RT-PCR products in the same cells were used to estimate mRNA half-lives in Jurkat T cell line. The cell cultures were treated with 1 &#x003bc;M Actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to inhibit the transcription. Twenty four hours before treatment the cells were transferred from the 75 mL tissue bottle to 10 cm culture dishes in aliquots of 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells. Under these conditions we performed three independent experiments where cells were collected every 2 h and total RNA was isolated as described before.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The anthropometric and biochemical measurements are expressed as means &#x000b1; SD, whereas gene expression measurements are expressed as means &#x000b1; SE. The analysis of the data were made by ANOVA and tested for differences between groups using the Kruskal-Wallis analysis. <italic>P </italic>&#x02264; values 0.05 were considered to be significant. Statistical operations were performed using the Stat View v4.57 (SAS Institute Inc., USA) and Prism 4 v4.02 (GraphPad Software, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ELO performed all the experiments of the study. MC was responsible for the patients' clinical data base, Genomic DNA database, data analysis and manuscript preparation. JGM was responsible of the general experimental design, data analysis and manuscript preparation. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was financed by the Programa de Apoyos a la Vinculaci&#x000f3;n del Cinvestav con el Sector Salud 2006, and FOFOI-IMSS.
