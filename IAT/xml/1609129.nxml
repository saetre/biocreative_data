A measurement of the individual and additive impacts of each of these processes on systemic tolerance is often lacking. In this report we have used adoptive transfer strategies to tease out the unique contribution of T cell intrinsic receptor calibration (adaptation) in the maintenance of tolerance to a systemic self-antigen. Adoptively transferred na&#x000ef;ve T cells stably calibrated their responsiveness to a persistent self-antigen in both lymphopenic and T cell&#x02013;replete hosts. In the former, this state was not accompanied by deletion or suppression, allowing us to examine the unique contribution of adaptation to systemic tolerance. Surprisingly, adapting T cells could chronically help antigen-expressing B cells, leading to polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and pathology, in the form of mild arthritis. The helper activity mediated by CD40L and cytokines was evident even if the B cells were introduced after extended adaptation of the T cells. In contrast, in the T cell&#x02013;replete host, neither arthritis nor autoantibodies were induced. The containment of systemic pathology required host T cell&#x02013;mediated extrinsic regulatory mechanisms to synergize with the cell intrinsic adaptation process.

The ability of this expanded lymphocyte pool to effectively combat the pathogen also relies on the extent of effector functions that it acquires and maintains. Differentiated helper T cells produce cytokines and cell surface ligands that regulate the subsequent generation of cytotoxic and humoral responses. This differentiation process is often correlated with proliferative expansion, but there is evidence to suggest that the two processes can be independently regulated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Subsequent to clearance of the pathogen, most members of these expanded populations of antigen-specific lymphocytes are eliminated and the few that survive often typically demonstrate better responsiveness.</p><p>In cases where a T cell response is initiated against a chronic nonclearable pathogen or a persistent self-antigen, the immune system evokes many regulatory mechanisms aimed at containing the potentially damaging chronic T cell activity. One such mechanism has been called adaptive tolerance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. This process is a T cell&#x02013;intrinsic downregulation of responsiveness, likely mediated by the recruitment of negative feedback in signaling pathways downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR). The consequent hyporesponsiveness of the T cell is proportional to the strength of the ambient antigen presentation and is reversible upon removal from the antigen-bearing host &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Such a dynamic state is broadly consistent with the tunable activation threshold model originally proposed by Grossmann and Paul &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d; and may allow for the persistence of autoreactive T cells that are potentially useful against foreign antigens &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. We have earlier shown that this antigen adaptation primarily aims to restrict the turnover of T cells in vivo to a minimal basal level, despite the persistence of antigen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. The T cells that enter the hyporesponsive state, however, have undergone significant differentiation and can produce effector cytokines at levels higher than na&#x000ef;ve T cells (albeit lower than memory T cells) after an in vitro restimulation. This raises the possibility that antigen-adapted T cells may continue to chronically display effector functions against the persistent antigen despite the restriction of their proliferative ability.</p><p>The downregulation of the proliferative potential of helper T cells, while maintaining their ability to mediate effector functions, has been reported in the case of T cells surviving an acute antigen exposure in the absence of adjuvant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. In this model, the tolerizing antigen does not persist and therefore the effector potential of the T cells is unlikely to be stimulated to induce pathology. It is therefore not clear if continued persistence of antigen would result in the elimination of the T helper cell's effector function as well. Furthermore, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that undergo adaptation to chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection or a self-antigen downregulate both their proliferative and effector functionalities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. In this case, the ability to produce interleukin (IL)-2 was often downregulated rapidly, while various effector functions required extended stimulation through chronic viral exposure &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells experiencing chronic antigen in a transgenic model, however, retained the ability to mediate cytolytic activity in vivo despite anergy induction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. In the early phases of a chronic LCMV infection, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells specific for the virus were able to help antigen-expressing (infected) B cells polyclonally, leading to serum hypergammaglobulinemia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. This antibody production correlates with the acute viremia and suggests that after several weeks of chronic viral infection, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells lose the ability to help B cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Nonetheless, the fluctuations in the antigen load due to viral replication, clearance and tissue redistribution also makes such models less suited to examination of the in vivo functionality of stably antigen-adapted T cells.</p><p>We have previously described a model system for adaptive tolerance that uses transgenic mice constitutively expressing the antigen pigeon cytochrome C (PCC), driven by the MHC class I promoter and an Ig enhancer, in a variety of cellular compartments, including B cells and dendritic cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Antigen-specific na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells adoptively transferred into such mice crossed onto a CD3&#x0025b;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> background, adapt to the persistent antigen over the period of a week. In the absence of other competing T cells, these CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells persist for extended periods of time in the adaptively tolerant state and show no evidence of having acquired a T-reg phenotype &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. This system, therefore, allows us to examine the consequence of antigen adaptation on the T cell's ability to mediate effector functions in response to the ambient stimulation, for example, by helping B cells that express and present the cytochrome C antigen.</p><p>In this report, we demonstrate that the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell expansion to the persistent self-antigen results in a polyclonal antibody response by the resident B cells. The antibodies are directed against a variety of self-antigens classically implicated in autoimmune disorders. The mice eventually develop a mild form of chronic arthritis. Interestingly, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that were first stably adapted to the antigen in the absence of B cells still retained the ability to help B cells and to cause autoimmune disease. In contrast, in the presence of an endogenous repertoire of T cells, the ability of the autoreactive T cell to induce pathology was severely compromised. This tolerance was correlated with a failure of the transferred transgenic T cells to complete effector differentiation and survive in the T cell&#x02013;replete host. Overall, these data demonstrate that at least two distinct mechanisms&#x02014;one cell intrinsic and the other in trans&#x02014;must cooperate to ensure complete peripheral tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Adaptation Controls Autoreactivity Independent of Suppression</title><p>The exposure of na&#x000ef;ve helper T cells to chronic peripheral antigenic stimulation leads to a reversible state of anergy known as adaptive tolerance.

After a robust initial expansion, the transferred T cells downregulate their ability to make cytokines to an in vitro restimulation and fail to clonally expand well upon retransfer into a fresh mPCC,CD3&#x0025b;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> host &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Proliferative impairment in peripheral T cells after autoantigen encounter has often been attributed to the induction of a regulatory phenotype in T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Since the host mice in our experiments do not have any endogenous T cells, by design (CD3&#x0025b;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>), we examined if the adaptively tolerant 5C.C7 T cells acquired a regulatory function in the host. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, we could not detect <italic>foxp3</italic> expression in the transferred cells at any time that we tested (days 4, 11, 22, and 28, of which day 11 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, bottom row). Regulatory activity may still act through a <italic>foxp3</italic> independent fashion, but would be expected to either impair the proliferation or differentiation of a new T cell response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. We tested this by adoptively transferring fresh Ly5.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> na&#x000ef;ve 5C.C7 T cells into mPCC,CD3&#x0025b;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that already harbored Ly5.2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> 5C.C7 T cells in an adaptively tolerant state. The resident population was unable to impair the first 3 d of expansion of the fresh na&#x000ef;ve cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, days 1&#x02013;3). After this time, the new cohort did not expand significantly and could be recovered at similar numbers to that in a lymphopenic host (solid squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Finally, in order to examine if the differentiation of the second cohort was impaired by the presence of adaptively tolerant 5C.C7 T cells, we purified the expanded second cohort (Ly5.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, 5C.C7) by FACS sorting. The sorted cells were assayed for their ability to produce interferon (IFN)&#x003b3; after in vitro restimulation. Ly5.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> 5C.C7 T cells that expanded in the presence of adapted Ly5.2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> 5C.C7 T cells (solid triangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) or in an empty mPCC,CD3&#x0025b;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> host (open squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) had differentiated similarly as evidenced by effector cytokine production in vitro. These data suggest by multiple criteria, that adaptive tolerance in this model, is a cellular phenomenon distinct from suppression. It is also independent of clonal deletion, since the adaptively tolerant T cells are not eliminated in the mPCC,CD3&#x0025b;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> host for the life of the animal&#x02014;solid squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g001">Figure 1</xref>B. Therefore, our model system allows for a direct evaluation of the impact of antigen adaptation on systemic immunological tolerance, unlike many other models in which multiple paradigms cannot be resolved sufficiently.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Adaptation Alone Is Insufficient to Generate Systemic Tolerance</title><p>The mPCC,CD3&#x0025b;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that harbor the tolerant PCC-reactive 5C.C7 T cells do not display any obvious signs of acute graft versus host disease such as weight loss, lethargy, paralysis, or lethality. Interestingly, however, we began to observe swelling of the hindlimbs and forelimbs of a few mice, almost 2 mo after the adoptive transfer. These phenotypes were observed only in the PCC transgenic recipients and not in control CD3&#x0025b;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, despite a weak &#x0201c;homeostatic&#x0201d; expansion of the 5C.C7 T cells, reported earlier &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. To further characterize this phenotype, we examined the animals by x-ray imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g002">2</xref>B) and Immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g002">Figure 2</xref>C&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g002">2</xref>E). Radiographs of the forelimb of an adoptive transfer recipient at day 86 showed bone loss with significant distortion of the phalanges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, right) relative to a control mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, left). The hindlimb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) also showed increased bone density especially around the carpal joints. Hindlimbs of mPCC,CD3&#x0025b;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that were infused with autoreactive T cells 14 d earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g002">Figure 2</xref>D) or 60 d earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g002">Figure 2</xref>E) were stained by HEMATOXYLIN AND EOSIN after decalcification and sectioning. The sections show the increased swelling at 60 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g002">Figure 2</xref>E) compared to both the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g002">Figure 2</xref>C) and the 14-d time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). The legs were extended maximally before being processed for sections and the lack of extension in the day 60 leg is also evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g002">Figure 2</xref>E. Furthermore, mild mononuclear cell infiltrates in the tibiotarsal regions were evident in magnifications of the day 60 sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g002">Figure 2</xref>E, bottom). These findings suggested that an arthritic process was developing in the 5C.C7 transfer recipients, despite the induction of adaptive tolerance in these T cells. This was surprising since the B10.A strain is not related to genotypes that are conventionally associated with the ability to develop arthritis, even after collagen immunization &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Although the severity of the pathology did not approach that of some arthritic models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; or significantly hamper feeding or movement of the mice, we developed a scoring system to quantitate this swelling (described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Subtle alterations in joints or digits were visible in a few mice as early as 24 d after transfer and progressively increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). Although not completely penetrant, up to 80&#x00025; of the transfer recipients developed disease scores over 5 in less than 2 mo.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Polyclonal Activation of B Cells Drives an Autoreactive Response during Adaptive Tolerance Induction</title><p>T cell&#x02013;initiated autoimmune syndromes in mouse models often require B-cell&#x02013;mediated antibody production or antigen presentation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. We examined whether this was the case in our model system, by assaying serum antibody levels in PCC transgenic mice at various days after the transfer of 5C.C7 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The total amount of IgM in the serum had increased to approximately 5-fold by 21 d of 5C.C7 T cell transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 comparing normal serum values at day 0 with day 21 after T cell transfer). This increased level was maintained stably up to 200 d after the initial transfer. A similar pattern was observed for total amounts of IgG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), IgG2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), IgG2b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g003">Figure 3</xref>D), IgG3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g003">Figure 3</xref>E), and IgE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). All increases were statistically significant over the levels detected in control mice (on day 21, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0024 for IgG1, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 for IgG2a, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 for IgG2b, and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.01 for IgG3). The increase in these isotypes, however, was more dramatic, because little or no production was detected prior to the T cell infusion &#x0005b;open circles in (A)&#x02013;(E), &#x0002a; indicates samples with undetectable levels&#x0005d;. The increase was also antigen specific since we did not see a comparable increase in Ig levels after the transfer of 5C.C7 T cells to B10.A,CD3&#x0025b;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that did not express PCC (unpublished data). The global increase in the amounts of all of these isotypes shows that there is no bias toward any &#x0201c;class&#x0201d; of immune response. This is also consistent with our earlier report of a global suppression of cytokine production in the adaptively tolerant T cells, without skewing toward any particular subset or class of response. The levels of IgA, however, were distinct from those of all the other isotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g003">Figure 3</xref>G). There was no increase in the fecal levels of IgA (triangles) after T cell transfer, and there was a reproducible decrease in the basal IgA levels detected in the serum (solid circles). Consistent with increased antibody production in these mice, we could also detect an increased amount of circulating antigen-antibody complexes as measured by a complement (C1q) binding ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g003">Figure 3</xref>H).</p><p>We also examined the reactivity of antibodies generated in this system against a panel of mouse antigens. Antibodies could be detected against double-strand DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g003">Figure 3</xref>I) as well as ribosomal antigen extracts (unpublished data). The levels of anti-DNA antibodies in the serum of mice 56 d after 5C.C7 transfer were significantly enhanced over control mice in all three isotypes tested: IgM (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.01), IgG2a (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02), and IgG2b (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02). Sera from transfer recipients were tested on Western blots for reactivity against purified antigens. Although the private reactivities varied between individual mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040340-t001">Table 1</xref>), most animals produced detectable antibodies against multiple antigens, including histones, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), fibrinogen, and collagen. Occasionally, antibodies could also be detected against PCC, consistent with the idea that B cells in this transgenic are not completely tolerant of PCC, in the presence of T cell help &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>This broad spectrum of anticellular antibodies was also evident in immunofluorescence assays on test sections of healthy murine kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g003">Figure 3</xref>J&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g003">3</xref>N).

The blocking antibody treatments were continued every other day and the serum antibody titers measured 14 d after B-cell transfer.

The decrease in IgG1 was less pronounced but did show a 3- to 5-fold decrease. In a separate experiment, CD40L blockade was carried out for only a short period, from the time of B-cell transfer to 6 d after. Twenty-two days following the last treatment (28 d after B-cell transfer), IgG2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g005">Figure 5</xref>G) and IgG2b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g005">Figure 5</xref>H) levels were still reduced in the treated groups, even though B cells were still detected in the hosts.

However, this expansion lasted only for 3 d and resulted in just a 5-fold increase in cell number. This was a consequence of a failure to sustain cell divisions, as evidenced by the carboxy fluorescein succinimidyl ester profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Furthermore, the expanded T cells underwent a slow deletion process in the T cell&#x02013;replete host, starting at day 4 and resulting subsequently in a approximately 3.5&#x00025; per day loss of the expanded cells.

Over five separate experiments, 5C.C7 T cells in a T cell&#x02013;replete host showed an 85 &#x000b1; 3.5&#x00025; decrease in IL-2 production relative to na&#x000ef;ve 5C.C7 T cells, while in the lymphopenic host, this was 91 &#x000b1; 7&#x00025;. The CD3 proximal signaling machinery of the cells in either host was also tested by monitoring calcium influx in response to cross-linking with anti-CD3 ex vivo. The fluxes elicited by T cells from a T cell&#x02013;replete host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g007">Figure 7</xref>C, red trace) were equally dampened in comparison to the fluxes from those in a T cell&#x02013;deficient host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g007">Figure 7</xref>C, blue trace).

The relative significance of each of these processes to systemic tolerance and their synergism in vivo has been difficult to dissect, despite the existence of many model systems. It is formally possible that all of these mechanisms are in fact inseparable elements of a unified tolerance process. For example, the facts that regulatory cells display evidence of anergy and that anergic cells have been shown to regulate could be interpreted as evidence of similar biochemical machinery operating in both conditions. The conditions of assay or the quantitative gradation of the biochemical process may reveal anergy, regulation, or both. Therefore, it is critical to begin to separately quiz the roles of individual processes in peripheral tolerance and to decipher the network of interactions between these processes in vivo. This report represents a comprehensive examination of the role of in vivo anergy (adaptive tolerance) in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance. The adoptive transfer strategy we have used mimics the stimulation of a na&#x000ef;ve T cell with a peripheral self-antigen or a chronic pathogen, albeit a systemic one. In most model systems, these responses are influenced by various noncell autonomous factors such as regulatory T cells, Th2 or Th3 cells, NK T cells, &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells, etc. The absence of these other endogenous T cells in the recipient we have used (CD3&#x0025b;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> host) limits the regulatory mechanisms available to those intrinsic to the responding T cell population. We also eliminated the induction of trans-regulatory phenotypes within the population we have introduced, as has been found in other models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, our data clearly demonstrate that while tuning effectively constrains clonal expansion and quantitatively buffers cytokine synthesis, it is by itself unable to prevent the differentiation and survival of autoreactive T cells, two parameters that could very well be linked &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. These parameters must be constrained by other non&#x02013;cell-intrinsic regulators, so as to completely eliminate pathology.</p><p>The conclusions of this study are supported by earlier arguments that anergic T cells can help B cells generate a Th1 (IgG2a) class of response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Those data, however, were consistent with the &#x0201c;overcoming&#x0201d; of anergy by a stronger antigenic challenge. In contrast, the helper activity in our model is continual and does not require an antigenic challenge exceeding the level of ambient presentation. Furthermore, the differentiation in this system does not skew the responses toward any particular class of antibody production. Antibodies typically associated with Th1 (IgG2a) as well as Th2 (IgG1 and IgE) helper function were all upregulated. The increased Ig levels did not just reflect specific antibody production against the cognate antigen (PCC, which was absent in most mice) but was of diffuse polyclonal reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This is not surprising, since the expression of PCC under the control of the MHC-I promoter and Ig enhancer should result in antigen expression in all of the B cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

This should allow all B cells in this model system to express PCC peptide&#x02013;MHC complexes and thus interact with the 5C.C7 T cells independent of the B cell's own receptor specificity. This in turn would generate an efficient mechanism for providing T cell help to any B cell whose Ig receptors also engaged their cognate antigen, including abundant self-antigens that might normally rely on the absence of T cell help to prevent autoantibody generation. In fact, among the antibodies generated in our system, some were reactive against DNA, histones, and GPI molecules implicated in B-cell&#x02013;mediated autoimmune disorders like arthritis or lupus in other mouse model systems &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although the simplest interpretation of these data would be that T cell&#x02013;dependent antibody production is the etiologic agent in the disease process, we have not excluded the possibility that the presence of B cells in the system merely enhanced a pathologic T cell response in this model.

Interestingly, the arthritic pathology in this case was delayed by over a month and even then significantly reduced compared to that in the CD3&#x0025b;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g002">Figures 2</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g004">4</xref>I). Again, although it is arguable that the delay in pathology represents a consequence of anergy induction, we cannot rule out the possibility that this was due to the 4-fold lower number of anergic T cells or the absence of continued B-cell generation in the same host resulting in a reduced &#x0201c;repertoire&#x0201d; of B cells. The ability of the B cells to receive help is still very surprising, given our earlier report that dendritic cells isolated from this antigen transgenic mouse present higher levels of antigen than resting B cells in an in vitro T cell proliferation assay &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. One might have predicted that a quantitative adaptation to the level of antigen presentation by dendritic cells should have abrogated the T cell's ability to productively sense any antigen on B cells. Or observations therefore argue against quantitative receptor calibration being sufficient as a tolerance mechanism, at least for a high-affinity receptor&#x02013;ligand pair in the periphery.</p><p>The ability of a broad repertoire of B cells to present antigen makes our system comparable to models of persistent viral infection, like the LCMV model. Interestingly, such infections also induce a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia that is strictly dependent on viral antigen-specific T cell help &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Virus-specific helper T cells during chronic infections also enter an anergic state within 2 wk and, in seeming progression of the adaptation, subsequently lose the ability to prime de novo B-cell responses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. This difference from our results might stem from intrinsic differences in the model systems. These include the generation of antibody escape variants due to viral replication, the presence of virus derived TLR ligands, and the possibility that constant fluxes in antigen dose may recruit mechanisms other than tuning to regulate immunopathology &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b040">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, the use of mice with an intact repertoire of T cells in the LCMV infections allows for non&#x02013;cell-autonomous regulatory mechanisms to be superimposed on the adaptive tolerance process (as we discussed earlier). Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that even during persistent viral infections, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are required for effective control of the virus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. In cases where chronic viral infections have been shown to abrogate effector functions in CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, the viremia is still constrained progressively and the virus distribution localized to restricted tissues, arguing that biological activity in the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells is being maintained despite the persistent infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. These experiments, however, need to be reexamined in the absence of thymic output and trans-regulatory cells, using adoptive transfer systems similar to the one we have used.</p><p>The restoration of an intact polyclonal T cell compartment in our experimental model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g007">7</xref>) was sufficient to constrain the autoimmune pathology that we observed. This allowed us to investigate the cellular paradigm that needs to superimpose on adaptive tolerance, in order to achieve &#x0201c;complete&#x0201d; tolerance. Interestingly, although adaptive tolerance (decreased TCR signaling and IL-2 production) was induced to equal extents without regard to the presence of other T cells, the subsequent elimination of autoreactive T cells only happens in the presence of other endogenous T cells. These data demonstrate that while anergy is chosen as a primary, cell-intrinsic fate, following tolerogenic antigen encounter in the periphery, the subsequent &#x0201c;deletion&#x0201d; is unlikely to be cell autonomous. The nature of the T-T interaction that results in the slow decay of the anergic T cell population is under investigation. Preliminary experiments using anti-CD25 and anti&#x02013;IL-2 treatment to deplete CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the T cell&#x02013;replete host suggest that such cells are unlikely to be sufficient to mediate this process. Alternatively, we favor a trophic competition process similar to the one that has been described for B cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. The process is likely to be more than a mere competition for &#x0201c;space,&#x0201d; since preliminary experiments suggest that simply filling up the animal with a second TCR transgenic CD4&#x0002b; population is insufficient to eliminate the adapted 5C.C7 T cell. However, the recent demonstration that clonal competition between T cells can affect proliferation and survival in vivo may be relevant to the control of autoimmune pathology in this regard &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. A similar paradigm may also operate in the case of CD8&#x0002b; T cells that are rendered tolerant to self-antigen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Unlike thymic negative selection or activation-induced cell death, the &#x0201c;deletional&#x0201d; component of peripheral T cell tolerance seems to be a relatively slow process. While the reduction of T cell numbers as a result of it is indeed quite striking, it still does not prevent the persistence of a large number of autoreactive T cells in the animal for up to 2 mo. Thus, even in the T cell&#x02013;replete host, the adaptive tolerance component must play a critical role in constraining the renewed recruitment and expansion of the high affinity autoreactive T cells. In addition, the inability of these CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to fully turn on autoreactive B cells likely stems from the profound blockade in the differentiation of these cells in the T cell&#x02013;replete host. T cell differentiation to acquire effector functions have previously been correlated with the extent of cell division &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. The limited initial expansion of the T cells could therefore lead to poor expression of effector molecules (including IL-4, IFN&#x003b3;, IL-21, and CD40L) and handicap the ability of adapted T cells to help B cells. Such an impairment of effector differentiation (and migration) of pathogenic T cells can also be achieved by the action of trans-regulatory T cells as observed in other model systems &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Multiple theories have debated the merit of singular mechanisms that maintain peripheral tolerance (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;). Models of T cell tuning have argued that a quantitative dampening of the T cell's sensitivity to ambient antigen should be sufficient to prevent pathology &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. The maintenance of such cellular tuning requires that the cell be constantly aware of the persistence of antigen. The prevention of pathology, on the other hand, requires the cell to avoid effector responses despite the constant interaction of the receptor with a strong endogenous agonist. The success of tuning as a tolerance mechanism therefore depends on the ability of the T cell to walk this biochemical tightrope efficiently. Our data would argue that over time, in the absence of additional mechanisms of peripheral tolerance, enough helper activity is able to break through, so as to mediate visible systemic pathology. It is quite likely that this inadequacy is not unique to the mechanism of adaptive tolerance, because it has been argued that other mechanisms of immune regulation, e.g., T-regs, also cannot control autoimmunity in isolation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;. Nonetheless, quantitative dampening of TCR responsiveness (and the kinetic delay in the onset of pathology that it might afford &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040340-g004">Figure 4</xref>F&#x0005d;) could in fact be quite critical in vivo, allowing additional regulatory processes to effectively collaborate and enforce complete peripheral tolerance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040340-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice and cells.</title><p>Mice used in this study were obtained through the NIAID contract at Taconic Farms (Germantown, New York, United States), an AAALAC accredited facility.
