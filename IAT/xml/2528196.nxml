One is to prevent recombinational repair through its recruitment by sumoylated Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), evidenced in postreplication-repair deficient cells, and a second one is to eliminate potentially lethal intermediates formed by recombination proteins. Both actions are believed to involve the capacity of Srs2 to displace Rad51 upon translocation on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), though a role of its helicase activity may be important to remove some toxic recombination structures. Here, we described two new mutants, <italic>srs2R1</italic> and <italic>srs2R3</italic>, that have lost the ability to hinder recombinational repair in postreplication-repair mutants, but are still able to remove toxic recombination structures. Although the mutants present very similar phenotypes, the mutated proteins are differently affected in their biochemical activities. Srs2R1 has lost its capacity to interact with sumoylated PCNA while the biochemical activities of Srs2R3 are attenuated (ATPase, helicase, DNA binding and ability to displace Rad51 from ssDNA). In addition, crossover (CO) frequencies are increased in both mutants. The different roles of Srs2, in relation to its eventual recruitment by sumoylated PCNA, are discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA helicases are present in all kingdoms and perform an extraordinary variety of functions in cells. They play important roles in DNA metabolic processes such as replication, repair, recombination and transcription. Their DNA unwinding and translocase activities begin to be well characterized at the biochemical and structural levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). However, much remains to be understood about their roles <italic>in vivo</italic>. Since all organisms express multiple DNA helicases, a high degree of functional specialization should exist. This is particularly true for the control of homologous recombination (HR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, at least six different helicases, Sgs1, Srs2, Mph1, Mer3, Pif1 and Rrm3 are positively or negatively involved in HR, increasing or decreasing recombination rates. They all perform specific functions that cannot be executed by another one. When and how these helicases act remains unclear. Partial answers to these questions have been recently obtained for Srs2.</p><p>Srs2 belongs to the SF1 helicase family and is structurally and functionally related to the bacterial UvrD helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Mutants of <italic>SRS2</italic> were first described as partial suppressors of the radiation sensitivity of <italic>rad6</italic> and <italic>rad18</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), defective in postreplicative DNA repair (PRR). They were later isolated as hyper-recombination mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and as suppressors of the methyl methane-sulfonate (MMS) sensitivity of <italic>rad18</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In <italic>RAD18</italic> background, the single <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutants are sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), a phenotype dependent on <italic>RAD51, RAD52, RAD55</italic> or <italic>RAD57</italic> genes [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and our unpublished data] that are all involved in the formation/stabilization of presynaptic Rad51 nucleofilaments. This epistasis of <italic>rad51</italic> over <italic>srs2</italic>, together with data showing that Srs2 prevents recombinational repair in cells containing leaky alleles of <italic>RAD51</italic> or <italic>RAD52</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10">7&#x02013;10</xref>), led to the proposal that Srs2 eliminates toxic recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) rather than preventing their formation. This hypothesis was later supported by the ability of Srs2 to dismantle Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments formed <italic>in vitro</italic> on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) through its translocase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In the absence of any treatment, toxic recombination intermediates are also formed in double mutants involving <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; and mutations affecting recombination and/or replication such as <italic>rad54</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394;. The synthetic lethality or sickness of the double mutants is suppressed by a third mutation in <italic>RAD51, RAD52, RAD55</italic> or <italic>RAD57</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>)). Recently, it was proposed that not only the translocase but also the helicase activity of Srs2 may reverse nonproductive recombination intermediates resulting from strand invasion of the homologous duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>While the deletion of <italic>SRS2</italic> sensitizes wild-type cells to UV, it increases the resistance of the highly UV sensitive <italic>rad6</italic> and <italic>rad18</italic> mutants. In these PRR-deficient contexts, it has been demonstrated that the high sensitivities of <italic>rad6</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rad18</italic>&#x00394; cells is related to the prevention of recombinational repair by Srs2 which is recruited by a sumoylated form of PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Indeed, deletion of the Small Ubiquitin-related Modifier (SUMO)-specific ligase gene <italic>SIZ1</italic>, which is responsible for the sumoylation of PCNA on the K164 lysine or PCNA mutations that prevent its sumoylation suppress DNA damage sensitivities of <italic>rad18</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>rad6</italic>&#x00394; cells, as does the deletion of <italic>SRS2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>).</p><p>Srs2 was also shown to be involved in crossover (CO) control and proposed to unwind the invading strand of recombination intermediates, allowing conversion but preventing formation of COs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). This role of Srs2 would involve the helicase activity, and appears to be dependent on PCNA sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>These genetic data show that Srs2 plays different roles. One is to eliminate toxic recombination intermediates. Importantly, in wild-type cells, a <italic>SIZ1</italic> deletion has no significant effect on repair, mutagenesis or recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), suggesting that elimination of toxic intermediates does not depend on PCNA sumoylation. Another role of Srs2 is to prevent recombinational repair. This has been evidenced only in PRR-deficient contexts, and the extrapolation of this activity to wild-type cells remains questionable in view of the absence of effects of the single <italic>siz1</italic> mutation.</p><p>In a hope to obtain mutations that separate the functions, we screened for new Srs2 mutations suppressing the MMS sensitivity of <italic>rad18</italic> cells. We describe here two of them which confer UV resistance to <italic>rad18</italic> cells but are not by themselves UV or MMS sensitive. However, they do have an effect on the incidence of reciprocal recombination associated to gene conversion events. The biochemical study of the purified mutant proteins indicates that the mutations affect differently the activities of Srs2, although their biological effects are very similar.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and genetic analysis</title><p>Except for CO experiments, the strain used in this study are isogenic derivatives of either FF1852 (<italic>MAT</italic>a <italic>leu2-3,112 trp1-289 ura3-52 ade5</italic>) or of FF18733 (<italic>MAT</italic>a <italic>leu2-3,112 trp1-289 ura3-52 his7-2 lys1-1</italic>).

The wild-type <italic>SRS2</italic> and the mutants <italic>srs2R1</italic> and <italic>srs2R3</italic> are tagged by HA. We found no effect of the HA tag on the resistance to genotoxic agents, indicating that the Srs2 proteins are functional. The &#x02018;CY2715&#x02019; wild-type HA-<italic>SRS2</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) was a gift of Dr Foiani.

For this, <italic>srs2R1</italic> and <italic>srs2R3</italic> were cloned into the <italic>URA3</italic> pRS406 vector. The linearized plasmids were integrated into the HA-<italic>SRS2</italic> strain, and pop-out events were selected on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5FOA), a drug that allows only the growth of Ura<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The presence of the <italic>srs2R1</italic> or <italic>srs2R3</italic> mutation was tested by the suppression of <italic>rad18</italic>&#x00394; MMS sensitivity in meiotic analysis of diploids obtained by crossing the strains with <italic>rad18</italic>&#x00394; haploids. It was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The strains were crossed with the <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> haploid bearing the ectopic recombination system (D498-1C) to isolate from the meiotic progeny the wild-type strain &#x02018;D508-10C&#x02019; of genotype <italic>MATa arg 4</italic>-<italic>Bg URA3::arg</italic><italic>4</italic>- <italic>RV::ura3-1 ade2-1 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 can1-100 HA3SRS2::srs2</italic>.

Genetic analyses were performed according to published procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of CO frequencies</title><p>This analysis was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Briefly, CO frequencies associated to gene conversion events were determined in haploid cells carrying two <italic>arg4</italic> alleles mutated at different sites and located on different chromosomes. One allele is at its endogenous location on chromosome VIII, and the other one is located on chromosome V, between a wild-type and a mutated allele of <italic>URA3</italic> in direct orientations. When gene conversion occurs without CO, the two <italic>URA3</italic> and <italic>ura3-1</italic> genes remain in the parental direct repeat configuration in which loss of <italic>URA3</italic> is a frequent event. A CO associated to a conversion of an <italic>arg4</italic> allele generates a reciprocal translocation and a separation of the <italic>URA3</italic> and <italic>ura3-1</italic> alleles on each of the translocated chromosomes. In this situation, loss of the <italic>URA3</italic> information is much less frequent. Spontaneous and independent Arg<sup>+</sup> convertants are selected on medium lacking arginine and patched on the same medium. To determine the relative frequencies of <italic>URA3</italic> losses, the plates are replicated on a medium containing 5-FOA, a drug that allows only the growth of Ura<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Patches that give rise to numerous Ura<sup>&#x02212;</sup> papillae derive from a conversion without CO and patches with no or a very few Ura<sup>&#x02212;</sup> papillae reveal a CO event. This was verified by molecular analyses on a sample of convertants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>UV treatment</title><p>Stationary phase (<italic>RAD18</italic> background) or exponentially growing (<italic>rad18</italic>&#x00394; context) cells were washed in sterile water and resuspended at appropriate dilutions. UV irradiation (254 nm) was applied after plating on YPD and survival was determined after 3 days of incubation at 30&#x000b0;C. For spot assays, exponentially growing cells were resuspended in water at 3.10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml and 7 &#x000b5;l of 10-fold serial dilutions were spotted onto plates lacking leucine to select for cells that retained the plasmid. The control and UV-irradiated plates were incubated as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmids and proteins</title><p>In order to clone the mutant genes into baculoviruses, we first constructed the p14HB-srs2R1 and p14HB-srs2R3 plasmids by the gap repair method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The centromeric replicative p14HB plasmid contains the whole wild-type <italic>SRS2</italic> coding sequence and, upstream of the ORF, a <italic>BamHI</italic> site which was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis in p14H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). A gap was made in the region of either the srs2R1 or srs2R3, and the gapped plasmids were introduced into the corresponding mutant cells. For <italic>srs2R1</italic>, BbvCI-gapped p14HB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) was introduced in FF1886 and the repaired plasmid was recovered. For <italic>srs2R3</italic>, the same procedure was followed using XbaI-gapped p14HB introduced into FF1888. The BamHI-EcoRI fragment of p14HB-srs2R1 or p14HB-srs2R3 was cloned into pBacPAK-His1. The recombinant baculoviruses were constructed as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France). It encodes the Srs2 proteins with 17 additional amino acid residues (MGHHHHHHVVDKLGSQM) fused to its N-terminal methionine. The wild-type fusion protein was found to complement the genotoxic sensitivity of <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; cells (data not shown). Srs2 wild-type and mutant proteins were produced and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>To overproduce Srs2 wild-type and mutant proteins in yeast, the HindIII-SphI fragment of p14HB vectors was cloned into the multicopy plasmid YEp13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).

Rad51 was first incubated for 3 min with &#x003a6;X174 ssDNA followed by addition of RPA and subsequent incubation for another 15 min in order to assemble Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments. As a function of the amount of Srs2 introduced into the reaction, a progressive loss of Rad51 filaments, coupled with a concomitant formation of RPA-ssDNA complexes, was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). At 120 nM Srs2 or Srs2R1, almost all the observed DNA molecules were covered by RPA while, at the same concentration, &#x0003c;5% of the Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments were destabilized by Srs2R3. 400 nM of Srs2 were required to obtain disruption of all Rad51 filaments. Because disassembly of the presynaptic filament requires the translocase activity of Srs2 on ssDNA, a function that requires ATP hydrolysis, the weak capacity of Srs2R3 protein to remove Rad51 from ssDNA may result from two failing activities: a reduced ability to bind ssDNA and/or a weak ATPase activity. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Srs2R3 disrupts the Rad51 presynaptic filament less efficiently than Srs2 and Srs2R1.

One possible explanation for this result is that a residual interaction (although not detected in our experiments) between the overproduced Srs2R1 proteins and K164-sumoylated PCNA allows enough helicase recruitment to prevent recombinational repair. A second explanation is that overproduction of Srs2 prevents recombinational repair by a recruitment through unmodified PCNA or directly through its interaction with Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In order to differentiate between these possibilities, <italic>srs2R1</italic> was overexpressed in the <italic>pol30-K127/164R</italic> mutant unable to be sumoylated on lysine 127 or sumoylated or ubiquitinated on lysine 164.

Similar results are obtained when wild-type <italic>SRS2</italic> or <italic>srs2</italic>R3 were overexpressed. Altogether, these data indicate that, at least in a context where PCNA cannot be ubiquitinated, the recruitment of Srs2 to prevent recombinational repair is strictly dependent upon its interaction with sumoylated PCNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Srs2R1 and Srs2R3 mutants show increased CO frequencies</title><p>The absence of Srs2 was shown to enhance both DSB-induced and spontaneous CO frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The proposed interpretation is that Srs2 acts on mitotic recombination intermediates at a postsynaptic stage. It unwinds the invading and elongated strand from its template, promoting synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA), a mechanism that allows gene conversion but not associated COs. A partially unanswered question concerns the recruitment of Srs2 to the D-loop. Using a genetic system allowing to determine the frequency of COs associated to a selectable conversion event involving ectopic heteroalleles (see Materials and methods section), we previously showed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) that CO frequencies rise from 11% in wild-type cells to 50% in both the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutant and in the <italic>pol30-K127/164R</italic> mutant that can neither be sumoylated nor ubiquitinated at the lysine 164 of PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). This result strongly suggested that SUMO-modified PCNA recruits Srs2 into the D-loop. However, because the double PCNA mutant is also deficient in PRR, the high incidence of COs observed in this strain is possibly also due to the PRR deficiency, and not only to the lack of Srs2 recruitment by PCNA. To address this question, we used the <italic>srs2</italic>R1 mutation, which prevents the interaction of the helicase with PCNA. We introduced at their native locus a HA-tagged version of <italic>SRS2</italic> or of <italic>srs2R1</italic> into the strain used by Robert <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The percentage of COs associated with spontaneous gene conversion events was found to be increased 1.8-fold in <italic>srs2R1</italic> as compared with <italic>SRS2</italic> cells (25 and 14%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). This result shows that the interaction between SUMO-modified PCNA and Srs2 is indeed involved in CO control. However, the level of COs measured in <italic>srs2R1</italic> (25%) is half that in <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; or in the double PCNA mutants (50%). It suggests that Srs2 controls CO both in a PCNA-dependent and independent fashion. We cannot formally exclude that a possible residual interaction between PCNA and Srs2R1 could account for this result. The same experiment was carried out with <italic>srs2R3</italic>. Interestingly, this mutant leads to a 2.3-fold increase in COs over the wild-type level (33 and 14%, respectively). The percentage is still lower than that observed in <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutants. The effect of this mutation likely results from the decreased helicase activity of Srs2R3, and thus from less efficient repair through the SDSA pathway. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>CO bias observed in <italic>srs2</italic> mutants.

In the highly sensitive <italic>rad6</italic> or <italic>rad18</italic> haploid mutants, deficient for PRR, <italic>srs2</italic> suppresses the sensitivity of a subpopulation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), while in PRR-proficient cells, it sensitizes a subpopulation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). It is now understood that these effects reflect two roles of Srs2. One is the elimination of potentially toxic structures formed by recombination proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), and a second role is the prevention of recombinational repair through its recruitment by sumoylated PCNA, evidenced only in PRR-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The ability of Srs2 to disrupt <italic>in vitro</italic> Rad51 nucleofilaments on ssDNA would be sufficient to account for the elimination of both the toxic and the recombination intermediates. It is likely that toxic structures are also formed after UV treatment of <italic>rad18 srs2</italic> cells, but this cannot be directly tested because <italic>rad51</italic>, as well as other mutants affected in the formation of Rad51 nucleofilaments, has a synergistic effect with <italic>rad18</italic> on UV survival, regardless of the status of Srs2.</p><p>In this study we describe two new <italic>srs2</italic> mutants that have acquired the ability to perform recombinational repair in a <italic>rad18</italic> context, but have retained the ability to reverse toxic structures in a <italic>RAD18</italic> context. The biochemical activities of the two mutant proteins are differently affected. The only known defect of Srs2R1 is the loss of interaction with sumoylated PCNA. This explains its suppressive effect on the UV sensitivity of <italic>rad18</italic> cells. The mutation is located in the C-terminal domain of the protein, known to interact with sumoylated PCNA, and deletions in this domain were reported to suppress the sensitivity of PRR mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Differently, Srs2R3 interacts as efficiently as the wild-type protein with sumoylated PCNA and its cellular amount in the cells is not decreased. However, the ATPase and helicase activities of the protein, as well as its ability to disrupt Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments, are decreased. We suggest that the inability of Srs2R3 to prevent recombinational repair in <italic>rad18</italic> cells may be related to the size of the Rad51 presynaptic filament that must be removed. Indeed, EM analyses revealed that UV lesions, if not repaired, induce uncoupling of nascent strands synthesis at replication forks leading to up to 3 kb long ssDNA regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In <italic>rad18</italic> cells, only recombination could save the cells, but Srs2 counteracts this repair. Because of its weak translocase activity, Srs2R3 would be unable to fully destroy the Rad51 nucleofilaments, allowing recombinational repair to occur. This interpretation fits with our data showing that overexpression of Srs2R3 in <italic>rad18</italic>&#x00394; <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; cells largely sensitizes the cells. It fits also with the semi dominance of <italic>srs2</italic> mutants in <italic>rad18</italic> homozygous diploids: the cells are more sensitive with two copies of <italic>SRS2</italic> than with a single one, indicating a gene dosage effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><sec><title>Removal of toxic recombination structures by Srs2 does not require an interaction with sumoylated PCNA</title><p>Contrarily to <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; cells, the two mutants <italic>srs2R1</italic> and <italic>srs2R3</italic> are not UV sensitive. This indicates that the two mutated proteins have retained the ability to reverse toxic recombination structures. The Srs2R3 protein is therefore in sufficient amount to perform this activity. It suggests that in PRR proficient cells, these structures are limited in size and/or number. The only deficient activity that we observed for Srs2R1 is its binding to sumoylated PCNA. This interaction is therefore not required to remove the dead-end structures. In agreement with this conclusion, the single <italic>siz1</italic> mutant, deficient in sumoylation of the lysine 164 of PCNA, shows no UV sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). We asked if the potentially toxic intermediates formed in the <italic>rad54</italic> or <italic>sgs1</italic> mutants, and revealed by their Rad51-dependent synthetic lethality with <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;, depends on PCNA sumoylation. The <italic>srs2R1</italic> mutation has no effect on the growth of <italic>rad54</italic> or <italic>sgs1</italic> cells. Thus, the toxic structures formed in these mutants, as those formed after UV treatment, are reversed by Srs2 independently of an interaction with sumoylated PCNA. In these cases, the recruitment of Srs2 could be mediated through its interaction with Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Control of COs involves the helicase activity of Srs2 and is partially dependent of its interaction with sumoylated PCNA</title><p>It has been proposed that Srs2 prevents COs by promoting SDSA, a recombination pathway non-associated with COs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). This would imply the unwinding activity of Srs2 in order to displace the elongated invading strand from the D-loop. We recently showed that Srs2 has the biochemical activities that are required to perform SDSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). However, <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for an implication of the helicase function of Srs2 in this process is missing. We hypothesized that the <italic>srs2R3</italic> mutation which decreases the helicase activity of Srs2 would increase the percentage of CO associated to conversion events. We indeed found that in this mutant CO frequency is increased from 14% in wild-type cells to 33%, while it reaches 50% in the absence of Srs2.</p><p>The approximate correlation between the level of COs and that of the helicase activity supports the idea that Srs2 controls the level of COs through its helicase activity. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the increased CO frequency observed in <italic>srs2R3</italic> cells relates to its decreased DNA binding ability and translocase activity. An <italic>srs2</italic> mutant affected specifically in its unwinding activity would be required to answer this question.</p><p>The Srs2R1 mutation increases the frequency of COs associated with conversions from 14% in wild-type cells to 25%. This indicates that the interaction with sumoylated PCNA is involved in CO control. However, since the percentage of COs in <italic>srs2R1</italic> mutant is half that in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> cells, it suggests that the enrollment of the Srs2 helicase to disrupt D-loops is only partially dependent on sumoylated PCNA.</p><p>It is important to note that the effect on CO incidence of <italic>srs2R1</italic> and of <italic>srs2R3</italic> is the only phenotype of these mutants in a <italic>RAD18</italic> context. In both cases, it is likely due to a decreased efficiency in the processing of recombination intermediates into the SDSA pathway. This would be related to a limited Srs2 helicase activity, for different reasons in each of the mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>What is the role of PCNA sumoylation?</title><p>The absence of genetic effects of the single <italic>siz1</italic> or <italic>srs2R1</italic> mutation raises the question of the role of PCNA sumoylation at K164 in wild-type cells. Our favorite model is the following one. Since PCNA is sumoylated even in the absence of any treatment during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and since the same lysine is the ubiquitin target of Rad18/Rad6, it is reasonable to believe that the sumoylated PCNA drives replication and avoids unintended mutation and recombination events to take place. On one hand, sumoylation of PCNA on the lysine 164 would protect against unnecessary ubiquitination and, consequently, hinder the error-prone and error-free Rad18-dependent pathways from acting. Notably, it would prevent a recruitment of an error prone polymerase that could introduce untargeted mutations. On the other hand, the sumoylated PCNA would recruit Srs2 that counteracts recombinational repair.</p><p>When the replicative polymerase encounters a blocking lesion, a single-stranded region upstream of the synthesis block is formed, due to the uncoupling of the two nascent strands synthesis upon fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Desumoylation of PCNA through a specific isopeptidase would occur, or new unmodified PCNA monomers would replace the sumoylated PCNA trimers. The absence of sumoylated PCNA opens two nonexclusive possibilities: ubiquitination of PCNA and formation of a Rad51 nucleoprotein filament on the ssDNA region. Fork restoration could then be mediated through the Rad18 pathways or by recombination. It is important to note that the choice of one or the other pathway is likely not determined by the ubiquitination state of PCNA: it is known that recombinational repair plays an important role in cells unable to ubiquitinate PCNA (e.g. <italic>rad18</italic> or more evidently <italic>rad18 srs2</italic> mutants) and in cells where PCNA is presumably ubiquitinated (e.g. <italic>rev3</italic> or <italic>rad5</italic> cells). Therefore, a possibility is that both PCNA ubiquitination and formation of a Rad51 nucleoprotein filament occur concomitantly. If fork restoration occurs by translesion synthesis, the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament might be eliminated upon progression of the polymerase.</p><p>In this scheme where PCNA is ubiquitinated upon replication arrest, the single <italic>siz1</italic> mutation is not expected to have any effects on survival to genotoxic treatments, nor on induced mutation or recombination frequencies. The only <italic>siz1</italic> effects that may be predicted in otherwise wild-type cells is an increase of untargeted mutations or recombination events, due to inadvertent switch of polymerases or/and Rad51 binding. However, these effects could be too small to overcome the other sources of spontaneous mutation or recombination and to be easily detectable.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to Marco Foiani and Martine Heude for providing strains and antibodies.
