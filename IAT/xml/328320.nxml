We report here the complete nucleotide sequence of the mouse cyr61 gene, which contains four short introns. The transcription start site was mapped by S1 nuclease and primer extension analyses. A 2 kb 5' flanking DNA fragment functions as a serum-inducible promoter. This DNA fragment contains a poly(CA) sequence that can adopt the Z DNA form. In addition, it contains a sequence that resembles the serum response element (SRE) originally identified in the c-fos promoter. We show that deletion of the cry61 SRE-like sequence abrogates serum inducibility. Furthermore, this SRE-like sequence is sufficient to confer serum and growth factor inducibility when linked to a basal promoter, and binds the 67 kD serum response factor in vitro. We conclude that the cyr61 SRE functions as a serum response element and may account for the coordinate activation of cyr61 and c-fos.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0085-a" xlink:role="3264"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0086-a" xlink:role="3265"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0087-a" xlink:role="3266"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3261"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3262"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3263"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3264"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3265"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3266"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3267"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
