The importance of this link to confer strong and functional cell&#x02013;cell adhesion is illustrated by tumor cells that have lost a functional &#x003b1;E-catenin protein, a change that is associated with the loss of cell&#x02013;cell aggregation and the gain of invasive capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c6">6</xref>). Re-introduction of exogenous functional &#x003b1;-catenin results in the restoration of cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and the inhibition of the invasive capacity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c9">9</xref>). Besides its role as an invasion-suppressor molecule, &#x003b1;-catenin has a tumor-growth suppressive capacity. This was recently demonstrated by a conditional knock-out of &#x003b1;E-catenin in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c10">10</xref>). Ablation of &#x003b1;E-catenin expression in the skin results in a sustained activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway leading to hyperproliferation of the epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c10">10</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a new member of the &#x003b1;-catenin family was identified and termed &#x003b1;T-catenin. This novel &#x003b1;-catenin shows very high sequence homology to both &#x003b1;E- and &#x003b1;N-catenins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c11">11</xref>). &#x003b1;T-catenin expression is restricted to certain tissues. It was first discovered in testis, but also found in cardiac and skeletal muscle and in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c11">11</xref>). The distinct expression pattern of &#x003b1;T-catenin contrasts with the ubiquitous expression of the closely related &#x003b1;E-catenin. In some cell types &#x003b1;E- and &#x003b1;T-catenin are co-expressed, as is found at the intercalated discs of cardiac muscle cells, whereas in other tissues, for instance in human testis, they are differentially localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c11">11</xref>).</p><p>Not much is known so far about the function of this recently identified &#x003b1;T-catenin. It has been shown that &#x003b1;T-catenin can bind strongly to &#x003b2;-catenin in heart and testis tissues, and <italic>in vitro</italic> data show that &#x003b1;T-catenin can function as a genuine &#x003b1;-catenin by providing a link between a cadherin-mediated cell&#x02013;cell adhesion complex and the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c11">11</xref>). N-cadherin-mediated adhesion is critical for proper myofibril organization in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c12">12</xref>), and altered cadherin expression in the myocardium leads to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c13">13</xref>). DCM is a &#x02018;cytoskeletalopathy&#x02019;, as most of the DCM genes identified so far have an influence on actin cytoskeleton organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c14">14</xref>). Interestingly, the gene encoding human &#x003b1;T-catenin, <italic>CTNNA3</italic>, was mapped to chromosome 10q21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c15">15</xref>), a region that has been linked to certain cases of dominantly inherited autosomally DCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c16">16</xref>). In view of its high expression in the heart and its presumed role in anchoring the actin cytoskeleton to the cadherin-mediated cell&#x02013;cell adhesion complex, &#x003b1;T-catenin is considered as a good candidate gene for inherited or sporadic DCM. However, so far no final evidence for such causative link has been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c15">15</xref>). Besides their structural role in cell&#x02013;cell adhesion, &#x003b1;-catenins have also been implicated in signaling events. Similar to other &#x003b1;-catenins, &#x003b1;T-catenin is also able to inhibit Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c17">17</xref>). Based on this finding and on the chromosomal position of &#x003b1;T-catenin, a link between &#x003b1;T-catenin gene variation and late-onset of Alzheimer disease has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c18">18</xref>).</p><p>The close relation of &#x003b1;-catenin genes and their partly overlapping expression patterns makes understanding the transcriptional regulation of these genes of considerable interest. Moreover, due to the particular expression pattern of &#x003b1;T-catenin being restricted to a very limited number of tissues, its promoter must be very tightly regulated and is thus an interesting object to study.</p><p>Extensive study of the cardiac-specific gene regulatory network has shown that MEF2C, Nkx2.5 and GATA proteins are key transcriptional regulators in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c19">19</xref>). GATA factors are Cys<sub>4</sub> zinc finger transcription factors with GATA-4, -5 and -6 playing roles in the development and proper function of the heart [for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c20">20</xref>)]. Members of the MEF2 family of MADS-box transcription factors are expressed at high levels in all muscle cells, and MEF2C is essential for proper heart development [for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c21">21</xref>)]. Overexpressed MEF2C can initiate cardiomyogenesis in embryonic carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c22">22</xref>). In cardiomyocytes, MEF2C acts together with GATA factors to induce gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c23">23</xref>). Apart from their role in heart-specific gene regulation, certain GATA factors and MEF2C are also expressed in other tissues exhibiting &#x003b1;T-catenin expression. MEF2C is found in skeletal muscle cells, where it strongly potentiates the transcriptional activity of MyoD, and in post-mitotic neurons in the brain, whereas GATA-4 is involved in gene regulation in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c24">24</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we analyze the human &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter region both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and we determine the role of MEF2C and GATA-factors in the tissue-restricted expression of the &#x003b1;T-catenin gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning and sequencing of the human &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter</title><p>A human bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library (Genome Systems Inc.) was screened by a PCR specific for the first exon of the <italic>CTNNA3</italic> gene (5&#x02032;-TGTCATCTGCCTCTCAATTTG-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-ATGCTGCCTTTCTGTTTCTTC-3&#x02032;).

A MEF2C consensus site, several GATA-binding sites, an Nkx2.5 site and a binding site for helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix transcription factors eHAND and dHAND were identified. All these regulatory elements were within 300 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. Parts of the mouse and rat promoter regions were identified by BLAST analysis using the mouse ortholog of the human &#x003b1;T-catenin. Sequence alignments showed high sequence conservation only in the proximal &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter region. Interestingly, two GATA boxes, the MEF2C site and the HAND binding site, are conserved in the three different species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>MEF2C and GATA-4 transactivate the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter synergistically</title><p>We used co-transfection studies to assess the contribution of the above-mentioned <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements and their respective transcription factors to the activation of the &#x003b1;T-catenin gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f2">2</xref>A). Co-transfection into P19 cells of a MEF2C expression plasmid with an &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter luciferase construct activated the promoter on average 12-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f2">2</xref>B). Mutation of the MEF2C consensus site abolished this activating effect almost completely. Also GATA-4 was able to transactivate the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter after co-transfection into P19 cells, although only about 3- to 4-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f2">2</xref>C). Only mutagenesis of the GATA box2 element could destroy this activation effect. Remarkably, the mutation of this GATA box2 site also diminished the effect of MEF2C on the promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f2">2</xref>B, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c5">5</xref>). Indeed, mutation of both the MEF2C site and the GATA box2 element is needed to completely destroy the activating effect of MEF2C on the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f2">2</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f6">6</xref>).</p><p>Co-transfection of GATA-4 and low amounts of MEF2C with the promoter constructs led to the synergistic activation of the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter, pointing to cooperation between MEF2C and GATA-4 in activating the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f3">3</xref>).</p><p>Heterodimers of eHAND or dHAND and E47 transcription factors could also transactivate the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter in a co-transfection promoter reporter assay, while the Nkx2.5 transcription factor had no effect on the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>GATA box2 is required for &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter activity in HL-1 cardiac muscle cells</title><p>The &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter was tested for tissue-specific activity by the transfection of a reporter construct in cell lines of a different origin and its activity was compared with the SV40 promoter activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f4">4</xref>A). HL-1 is a mouse cardiac-muscle cell line that can be repeatedly passaged in culture without losing its cardiac-specific phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c26">26</xref>). Using RT&#x02013;PCR and western-blot analysis with an &#x003b1;T-catenin-specific polyclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c11">11</xref>), we found that HL-1 cells express &#x003b1;T-catenin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f4">4</xref>B), while all other cell lines tested did not express &#x003b1;T-catenin. Hence, HL-1 cells should have all the necessary transcription factors to confer expression of the &#x003b1;T-catenin gene. Indeed, the activity of the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter in these cells was demonstrated by transient transfection with &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter luciferase constructs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f4">4</xref>A). In contrast, the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter showed no activity after transfection in the mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line P19, in the PC3 prostate carcinoma cell line or in the MCF7&#x0002f;AZ epithelial cell line, pointing to a requirement for tissue-specific regulatory factors. To determine whether the MEF2C site and the GATA boxes are actually required for &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter activity in HL-1 cells, we mutated the respective core binding sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f4">4</xref>C). Mutation of the GATA box2 element reduced the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter activity in HL-1 cells to background levels. Mutation of the MEF2C site, however, had no effect on the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter activity, although HL-1 cells do express the MEF2C transcription factor (data not shown). These results show that the GATA box2 element is absolutely required for the expression of &#x003b1;T-catenin in cultured cardiac muscle cells.</p></sec><sec><title>The GATA-4 and GATA-6 transcription factors specifically bind the GATA box2 in HL-1 cells</title><p>We examined whether the GATA box2 sequence is indeed bound by GATA proteins in cardiac muscle cells. Semiquantitative RT&#x02013;PCR expression analysis of HL-1 cells for all the six known GATA factors revealed that GATA factor 4 is most prominently expressed, whereas GATA-3, GATA-5 and GATA-6 are weakly to moderately expressed (data not shown). No expression of GATA-1 or GATA-2 was detected. In an EMSA using wild-type and mutant probes encompassing the GATA box2 element (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh727tb1">1</xref>), the labeled GATA box2 probe formed a sequence-specific DNA&#x02013;protein complex when incubated with nuclear extracts from HL-1 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f5">5</xref>A). The formation of this complex was prevented by addition of a 100-fold excess of the unlabeled probe whereas the competition was far less extensive when using excess cold mutated GATA-box2 oligonucleotide or excess of a probe containing the MEF2C site. To determine if GATA-4 was involved in the shifted complex, we performed a supershift analysis with a GATA-4-specific antibody. As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f5">5</xref>B, addition of this antibody to the binding reaction resulted in a weak supershifted band. To further confirm binding of GATA-4 to the GATA box2 site, a DNA precipitation assay was performed. A biotinylated wild-type GATA box2 oligonucleotide was able to extract GATA-4 from HL-1 nuclear extracts, which was not possible with the mutated oligonucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f5">5</xref>C). Moreover, ChIP analysis revealed that a proximal &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter region containing the GATA-box2 is bound <italic>in vivo</italic> by transcription factors GATA-4 and GATA-6 but not by GATA-3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f5">5</xref>D). No binding could be detected to a distal &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter region.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> binding assays were also performed to test binding of MEF2C to the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter, but here we could not detect any specific shifted complexes (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Transgenic mice show tissue-specific activity of the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter</title><p>To test tissue specificity of the cloned &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter region <italic>in vivo</italic>, we constructed transgenic mice in which the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter drives the expression of the LacZ reporter gene. Six founder lines were identified by PCR and Southern-blot hybridization. No rearrangements of the transgene were detected. Expression of the transgene was detected initially by soaking dissected tissues in solutions containing the &#x003b2;-galactosidase substrate X-gal. Blue staining was clearly detected in the brain, with prominent staining in the cerebellum, and testis, and also in discrete areas of the heart and skeletal muscle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f6">6</xref>). In some transgenic lines the transgene was not present in the germline, while other lines did not show any expression of the transgene.</p><p>Transgenic line &#x00023;10 showed high expression levels of the transgene and was further analyzed in detail. The tissue specificity of the reporter gene determined by a &#x003b2;-galactosidase enzyme activity assay is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f7">7</xref>. High to moderate levels of enzyme activity were detected only in brain, heart, skeletal muscle and testis. In all other tissues tested, no activity could be detected above the background. This tissue specificity is fully concordant with that found for &#x003b1;T-catenin expression by RT&#x02013;PCR analysis of mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c11">11</xref>). To test this further, transgene expression and &#x003b1;T-catenin expression were analyzed at the cellular level, by X-gal staining and immunohistochemistry on cryosections.</p><p>X-gal staining on 10 &#x003bc;m cryosections of testis showed that &#x003b2;-galactosidase localizes to peritubular myoid cells and to the Sertoli cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f8">8</xref>B). In the Sertoli cells, the &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining was seen to be perinuclear, resulting in a dotted staining pattern on the outside of the testis tubule. The small blue deposits seen more centrally in the tubule represent staining in the cytoplasm of the Sertoli cells. Localization of the endogenous &#x003b1;T-catenin was visualized by incubation with an &#x003b1;T-catenin-specific antibody. In contrast to previous findings where &#x003b1;T-catenin was only found localized to the peritubular myoid cells of the human testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c11">11</xref>), in mouse we also found &#x003b1;T-catenin expression inside the tubule, apparently on Sertoli-cell&#x02013;germ-cell contacts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f8">8</xref>C).</p><p>In the brain, &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining mainly localized to the cell bodies of neurons in the granular cell layer of the cerebellum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f8">8</xref>E). In this cerebellum, &#x003b1;T-catenin localized in the molecular layer, adjacent to the granular layer, probably in the axons of the neurons whose cell bodies are housed in the granular layer of the cerebellum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh727f8">8</xref>F).</p><p>In heart and skeletal muscle, myocytes expressed &#x003b2;-galactosidase, but only in a variegated pattern reflecting that the transgene was expressed in some but not all cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To understand the mechanism of tissue-specific expression of the &#x003b1;T-catenin gene in testis, brain, heart and skeletal muscle, we cloned the 5&#x02032; flanking promoter region of the human gene <italic>CTNNA3</italic>. Sequence alignments of the human, rat and mouse promoter regions show very high sequence conservation of the first 300 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. Within these short 5&#x02032; flanking sequences, a number of conserved regulatory elements were identified, including binding sites for GATA factors, MEF2C and E47&#x0002f;HAND. These binding sites are conserved in both sequence and mutual spacing. We demonstrated that these transcription factors readily transactivate the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter in a specific manner, as mutation of the core binding site interfered with the transactivating potential of the respective transcription factors.</p><p>Further, we showed that GATA-4 is directly involved in regulating &#x003b1;T-catenin expression in cardiac muscle cells. The GATA-4 transcription factor specifically binds the GATA box2 sequence in the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter as demonstrated by EMSA and DNA precipitations. Furthermore, ChIP analysis showed the <italic>in vivo</italic> binding of GATA-4 only to a proximal &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter region that contains the GATA box2 sequence, while no binding was observed to a distal promoter region. This GATA box2 sequence is critical for cardiac expression of the &#x003b1;T-catenin gene, as mutation of this GATA box2 sequence completely abolished &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter activity in transfected cardiac HL-1 cells. All these data together show that GATA-4 is an essential factor in regulating &#x003b1;T-catenin expression. GATA-4 is a member of the GATA family of zinc finger transcription factors and shows high expression in both the atrium and the ventricle throughout development [for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c20">20</xref>)]. This GATA-4 transcription factor is known to regulate the expression of a number of cardiac-specific genes, among them cardiac troponin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c32">32</xref>), corin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c33">33</xref>), atrial natriuretic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c34">34</xref>), cardiac sarcolemmal Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;Ca<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> exhanger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c35">35</xref>) and B-type natriuretic peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c36">36</xref>). Interestingly, GATA-4 also emerged as a transcriptional activator of the N-cadherin gene in cardiac muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c37">37</xref>). It thus appears that one of the roles of GATA-4 in cardiac morphogenesis is the establishment of a functional cadherin&#x0002f;catenin complex in cardiomyocytes.</p><p>Expression analysis of other GATA factors in HL-1 cells revealed that in addition to GATA-4 there is also expression of GATA-3, GATA-5 and GATA-6 in this cardiac muscle cell line. We assessed in particular the activating role of GATA-4 on the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter as this is the GATA factor expressed most prominently in HL-1 cells. But other GATA factors could have similar effects, as they all seem to recognize the same target sequence. Indeed, we showed in HL-1 cells that in addition to GATA-4, GATA-6 also binds the endogenous &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter, whereas GATA-3 does not. GATA-6 is known to colocalize with GATA-4 in the nucleus of cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c32">32</xref>) and hence can together with GATA-4 play a role in activation of transcription from the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter in cardiac muscle cells. Cooperation of GATA-4 and GATA-6 transcription factors in controlling tissue-specific transcription has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c38">38</xref>).</p><p>The MEF2C transcription factor was able to transactivate the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter in co-transfection studies. Involvement of this factor in regulating cardiac expression of &#x003b1;T-catenin expression is less clear. Mutation of the MEF2C site had no effect on &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter activity in cardiac HL-1 cells. However, it has been described that MEF2C can exert its effect via GATA boxes as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c23">23</xref>). This is also clear from our co-transfection studies in P19 cells: mutation of the MEF2C site only partially abolished MEF2C transactivation and mutation of the GATA box2 site was also necessary to completely destroy the activating effect of MEF2C on the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter. On the other hand, we have been unable to detect MEF2C in a complex bound to the GATA box2 sequence by DNA precipitations or EMSA supershift analysis (data not shown). So far, we have no evidence for a direct role for MEF2C in cardiac expression of &#x003b1;T-catenin, but we certainly cannot exclude it.</p><p>Another major finding of this study is that the cloned &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter region can direct tissue-specific expression of a reporter gene both <italic>in vitro</italic>, and <italic>in vivo</italic> in transgenic mice. In the transgenic mice the &#x003b2;-galactosidase transgene showed expression in heart, testis, brain and skeletal muscle, which exactly concurs with endogenous &#x003b1;T-catenin expression. Apparently most information required to direct spatial &#x003b1;T-catenin gene activation is comprised within the cloned promoter sequence. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that GATA-4 is involved in activating the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter in cardiac muscle cells, but this transcription factor is also a key regulator of gonadal gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c24">24</xref>). In testis GATA-4 is expressed in the Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c39">39</xref>) and here it transactivates a number of testis-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c24">24</xref>). Our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies with transgenic mice showed &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter activity in Sertoli cells, strongly suggesting that GATA-4 is also involved in regulating testis-specific expression of &#x003b1;T-catenin. &#x003b1;T-catenin expression in Sertoli cells was also somewhat less restricted than in previous findings, where &#x003b1;T-catenin was only detected in the peritubular myoid cells of human testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c11">11</xref>). This difference in localization may be due to species differences between man and mouse. Nonetheless, we successfully used the human &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter for mouse transgenesis as the human and mouse promoters show very high sequence identity and conservation of the regulatory elements.</p><p>The &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter is also highly active in the brain <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is consistent with endogenous &#x003b1;T-catenin protein expression. The factors involved in regulating brain-specific expression of &#x003b1;T-catenin could not be studied <italic>in vitro</italic>, as we found no <italic>in vitro</italic> system for culturing neurally derived cells expressing &#x003b1;T-catenin. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data showed that MEF2C can transactivate the &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter. Apart from its expression in the heart, the MEF2C transcription factor also shows high expression in postmitotic neurons in different regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c40">40</xref>), and is therefore a good candidate for regulating brain-specific &#x003b1;T-catenin expression. Future experiments will aim at verifying this.</p><p>In heart and skeletal muscle we could detect only a variegated expression of the <italic>LacZ</italic> transgene. Variegated expression is frequently observed in transgenic mice and reflects transgene silencing in a fraction of cells [for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c41">41</xref>)]. The mechanism is poorly understood, but it is believed to involve epigenetic modification of the transgene due to chromosomal position effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh727c42">42</xref>). A remarkable finding is that the position effect variegation in our transgenics was only evident in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, while in brain and testis transgene expression was apparently not influenced by its chromosomal position. The 2917 bp &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter region used for transgenesis may lack an insulator element or locus control region that mitigates variegating position effects in heart and skeletal muscle. Altogether, our studies show that transgene expression driven by the 2917 bp &#x003b1;T-catenin promoter sequence occurs exclusively in the heart, testis, brain and skeletal muscle.</p><p>In conclusion, we report on the cloning of the promoter region of the &#x003b1;T-catenin gene and show that it is responsible for the observed tissue-restricted expression of this &#x003b1;-catenin. We demonstrate a functional role for the GATA-4 transcription factor and a possible role for MEF2C in this tissue-restricted expression of &#x003b1;T-catenin.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh727f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Alignment of the 5&#x02032; flanking sequences of the human, mouse and rat &#x003b1;T-catenin genes.
