It consists of a 20S core particle (CP), containing &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits arranged into a barrel-shaped complex that bears the proteolytic activity and a 19S regulatory particle (RP) made up of two subcomplexes: the base and the lid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hanna and Finley, 2007</xref>). However, the 26S holoenzyme is not the sole proteasome form and subcomplexes can be found associated with other regulatory partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Schmidt et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The proteasome 26S degrades polyubiquitylated substrates in an ATP-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hanna and Finley, 2007</xref>). It can also degrade specific nonubiquitylated target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Orlowski and Wilk, 2003</xref>). In budding yeast, the majority of long-lived proteins are not degraded by the proteasome, whereas short-lived protein degradation is strongly affected by proteasome inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lee and Goldberg, 1996</xref>). Many of the short-lived targets of the proteasome are proteins involved in cell cycle progression. Consequently, a functional proteasome is crucial for cell proliferation. Accordingly, in budding yeast, all but four proteasome subunits are encoded by essential genes. Besides, proteolysis is not the sole function of proteasome subcomplexes, and it has been established that the 19S RP plays an important role in transcription regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ferdous et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Collins and Tansey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sulahian et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In exponentially growing yeast cells, 80% of the 26S proteasome is localized inside the nucleus throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Russell et al., 1999</xref>). In <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, the nuclear envelope protein Cut8 is required for the retention of the proteasome 26S inside the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tatebe and Yanagida, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Takeda and Yanagida, 2005</xref>). It is widely accepted that precursors of both the 20S and 19S particles are translocated independently into the nucleus via the karyopherin &#x003b1;&#x003b2; pathway, where they are subsequently maturated and assembled into active 26S holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lehmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fehlker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Heinemeyer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wendler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Isono et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Li et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, little is known about the proteasome in nonproliferating cells. It has been shown that the proteasome proteolytic activity decreases upon cells' entry into stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bajorek et al., 2003</xref>). This effect, apparently, does not correlate with a decrease of proteasome subunit abundance (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711154/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711154/DC1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bajorek et al., 2003</xref>) but rather with a disassembly of 19S RP from the 26S holoenzyme. Upon exit from quiescence, cells rapidly reassemble 26S proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bajorek et al., 2003</xref>). Although the expression of a constitutively active mutant form of the 20S CP decreases long-term cell survival, the cellular role of the proteasome and the fate of disassembled subcomplexes in quiescent cells remain obscure.</p><p>In this paper, we show that upon <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> entry into quiescence, there is a massive cytoplasmic relocalization of proteasome subunits into new structures that we have named proteasome storage granules (PSGs). This phenomenon is rapidly and fully reversed upon cell reentry into the proliferation cycle. Importantly, nuclear relocalization upon exit from quiescence occurs even in the absence of de novo protein synthesis, implying that PSGs are storage structures. Both PSG formation and nuclear relocalization were observed in the evolutionary distant yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic>, demonstrating the strong conservation and the broad significance of this phenomenon.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Proteasome relocalization upon entry into quiescence</title><p>We first followed the localization of Pre6p, an &#x003b1; 20S CP subunit, in living yeast cells. When fused to GFP at its C terminus, Pre6p can properly be incorporated into active 26S proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Enenkel et al., 1998</xref>) and, accordingly, a strain expressing Pre6p-GFP as a sole source of Pre6p did not show any growth defect (unpublished data). As previously shown by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Enenkel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lehmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Isono et al., 2007</xref>), Pre6p-GFP was localized in the nucleus of actively proliferating cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>, green bars [B]). This was verified in a strain coexpressing the 20S CP subunit Pup1p fused to RFP together with either the nuclear pore complex protein Nup2p fused to GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, left) or the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein Pho88p fused to GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>, left). Of note, the proteasome was clearly excluded from the nucleolus. Surprisingly, upon glucose exhaustion, Pre6p-GFP relocalized to the nuclear periphery (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>, blue bars [B]). The colocalization with Nup2p-GFP and Pho88p-GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>, respectively, middle left) attested that the proteasome indeed relocalized very close to or at the nuclear membrane. It should be noted that chemical fixation or cell wall stresses caused a similar relocalization of Pre6p-GFP from the nucleus to the nuclear periphery in exponentially growing cells (unpublished data). This observation could explain contradictions in earlier reports regarding proteasome localization in actively dividing yeast cells, which was either described as nucleoplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">McDonald and Byers, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Russell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wendler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Isono et al., 2007</xref>) or associated with the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Enenkel et al., 1998</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Proteasome relocalization upon entry into quiescence.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) Cells expressing Pre6p-GFP were grown in YPDA medium at 30&#x000b0;C.

Indeed, most of the Pre6p-GFP fluorescence was detected as bright dots that could either be localized close to the nuclear periphery and immobile (minor population; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>, yellow bars [B]; and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D and E</xref>, colocalization experiments) or freely mobile within the cytoplasm (majority of the cells; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>, red bars [B]). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, one or two bright dots of variable size were observed per cell. In addition, a faint Pre6p-GFP signal could be detected at the nuclear periphery in most of the cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C&#x02013;E</xref>). The typical relocalization into cytoplasmic dot was observed for nine other 20S CP subunits and eleven 19S RP subunits (Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711154/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711154/DC1</ext-link>). Importantly, proteasome cytoplasmic dots could also be detected by electron microscopy in wild-type quiescent cells using antibodies against 20S CP subunits and gold particle&#x02013;labeled secondary antibodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). The cytoplasmic clusters of gold particles were not associated with specific organelles or any detectable membrane. From those experiments, we conclude that in quiescent cells, all the proteasome subunits that we have tested massively localize into cytoplasmic dots. We named these structures PSGs.</p></sec><sec><title>19S and 20S subunits relocalize simultaneously into PSGs</title><p>Although all tested proteasome subunits relocalized as cytoplasmic dots in yeast quiescent cells, we asked whether subunits from the various subcomplexes colocalize within the same dots. Data shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> clearly established that subunits of the 20S CP and 19S RP colocalized within the same PSG in cells grown 4 d. Furthermore, upon culture aging, whatever the stage of growth, Scl1p-GFP (20S CP, &#x003b1; subunit) was always colocalized with Pup1p-RFP (20S CP, &#x003b2; subunit; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The same observations were made for Sem1p-GFP (19S RP, lid) and Pup1p-RFP (20S CP, &#x003b2; subunit; unpublished data). Consequently, different proteasome subunits simultaneously relocalized into PSGs upon cell entry into quiescence.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>19S and 20S proteasome subunits colocalization.</bold> (A) Colocalization of 19S RP and 20S CP proteasome subunits in quiescent yeast cells.

Thus, our results imply that differential localization of the proteasome subunits cannot account for the reported reduction of proteasome activity in quiescent cell extracts. In addition, it was established that mature 20S CP subcomplexes remained assembled throughout stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bajorek et al., 2003</xref>); therefore, it is likely that PSGs contain assembled 20S CPs that have relocalized after maturation inside the nucleus. Native gel electrophoresis confirmed that after 4 d, the 20S CP remained assembled. However, in our hands, assembled 26S was still detectable in quiescent cells (Fig. S2. available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711154/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711154/DC1</ext-link>). This discrepancy with Bajorek et al. (2003) remains to be clarified. Besides, whether 20S CPs in PSGs are associated with 19S RP subunits and/or other partners waits for the purification of intact PSGs. All our attempts to address the proteolytic activity of the proteasome embedded into PSGs in living quiescent cells have failed. Therefore, whether the proteasome subunits in PSGs are assembled into active complexes remains an open question.</p></sec><sec><title>PSGs do not colocalize with other quiescent cell structures</title><p>In our growth conditions, entry into quiescence is a consequence of glucose exhaustion, yet PSG formation could also be observed in cells grown on respiratory carbon sources (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) and, as such, do not constitute a specific response to glucose deprivation. Instead, our data indicate that PSGs are structures typical of nonproliferating cells. Of note, PSGs were also observed in quiescent diploid cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Recently, we have described actin structures that appear in yeast quiescent cells: the actin bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sagot et al., 2006</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, PSGs and actin bodies did not colocalize in quiescent cells. Similarly, the formation of P-bodies, a structure containing RNA and RNA-modifying proteins, is also triggered upon entry into quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>, Dcp2p-GFP, a specific marker of P-bodies, did not colocalize with PSGs. Thus, actin bodies, P-bodies, and PSGs are distinct cytoplasmic structures.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>PSGs, actin bodies, and P-bodies are distinct structures.</bold> (A) PSGs, as revealed by Pre6p-GFP fluorescence, were observed in cells grown for 4 d in different carbon sources containing rich media and in diploid cells grown in YPDA.

PSGs and actin bodies appear with similar kinetics, suggesting that the formation of these structures could possibly rely on interconnected signaling cascades. Importantly, the discovery of PSGs strongly supports the idea of a massive reorganization of cellular structures upon entry into quiescence.</p></sec><sec><title>PSGs: rapidly available proteasome reserves?</title><p>In contrast to actin bodies, we observed that PSGs were highly mobile within the cytoplasm. This is in agreement with the fact that the cytoplasmic clusters of gold particles detected by electron microscopy were not associated with specific organelles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). We measured PSG mobility and observed that the speed of a PSG decreased with the age of the quiescent cells. Indeed, in cells expressing Scl1p-GFP, the mean speed decreased from 83 &#x000b1; 58 nms<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 1,199 displacements) after 3 d to 18 &#x000b1; 16 nms<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> after 7 d of growth (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 840 displacements; Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711154/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711154/DC1</ext-link>). Similar results were obtained for Pup1p-RFP (unpublished data). In parallel, we measured the evolution of PSG fluorescence intensity. The mean fluorescence intensity of Scl1p-GFP increased by approximately twofold between days 3 and 7 of culture (Fig. S3 B; similar results were obtained for Pup1p-RFP [unpublished data]). These data strongly suggest that there is a time-dependent accumulation of proteasome subunits within PSGs.</p><p>All our previous data point at PSGs as proteasome storage structures. If this is the case, proteasome subunits embedded into PSGs should be mobilized upon cell exit from quiescence. Wild-type cells expressing Pre6p-GFP were grown for 4 d in YPD medium and then either transferred into water or refed with new YPD medium. Although no change in Pre6p-GFP localization was detected when cells were transferred to water (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>), a very fast and drastic relocalization of Pre6p-GFP was observed upon cell refeeding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Indeed, within &#x0003c;15 min after transfer of the cells to new YPD medium, all the Pre6p-GFP fluorescence was detected within the cell nuclei (first at the nuclear periphery and then into the nucleus). Importantly, the mobilization of Pre6p-GFP upon cell exit from quiescence could occur in the absence of de novo protein synthesis because cycloheximide did not prevent the relocalization of Pre6p-GFP to the nucleus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). The same results were obtained with Scl1p-GFP, Rpt6-GFP, and Rpn11-GFP (unpublished data). Therefore, PSGs contain available proteasome subunits that can be rapidly mobilized and, as such, could be defined as proteasome cytoplasmic reserves.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>PSGs are rapidly mobilized upon exit from quiescence.</bold> Cells expressing Pre6p-GFP were grown for 4 d in YPD medium at 30&#x000b0;C, washed, and either resuspended in water (A) or new YPD medium (B) or preincubated for 1 h in old YPD medium containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml cycloheximide and then released into new YPD medium containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml cycloheximide (C).

It could be that upon exit from quiescence, cells need to rapidly and massively degrade proteins such as those damaged during quiescence. Proteasome subunits, like actin, are abundant proteins (&#x0223c;1% of the total yeast proteins; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Russell et al., 1999</xref>) and both are stored in structures that are rapidly mobilized upon exit from quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sagot et al., 2006</xref>; this work). If proteasome subunits were degraded in quiescent cells, replenishing the pool of proteasome subunits upon exit from quiescence might cause a delay for cell reentry into the proliferation cycle and as such would reduce fitness. Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility that in quiescent cells, the proteasome subunits embedded into PSGs have other activities that are or are not related to protein degradation.

Furthermore, upon exit from quiescence, Pad1-GFP rapidly relocalized from this cytoplasmic structure to the nuclear periphery (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>) and, later, to the nucleus (not depicted). As this relocalization could occur in the absence of de novo protein synthesis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>), we can conclude that in quiescent <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells, just as in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the proteasome accumulates as a cytoplasmic reserve that can rapidly be mobilized upon cell reentry into the proliferation cycle.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>S. pombe</italic> cells display PSG.</bold><italic>S. pombe</italic> expressing Pad1-GFP (Rpn11 homologue) were grown for 4 d in YPDA medium at 30&#x000b0;C, washed, and resuspended either in water (A) or new YPDA medium (B) or preincubated for 1 h in old YPDA medium containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml cycloheximide and then released into new YPDA medium containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml cycloheximide (C).

However, it is interesting to note that in some degenerative disorders, the proteasome is relocalized into intracytoplasmic inclusions. Furthermore, upon proteasome inhibition or upon proteasome target overexpression, a perinuclear aggregate accumulates at the vicinity of the centrosome. This structure, named aggresome, contains proteasome subunits and ubiquitylated proteins (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kopito, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wojcik and DeMartino, 2003</xref>). In contrast, yeast PSGs do not colocalize with spindle pole body (the yeast equivalent of mammalian centrosome; Fig. S3 C). Whether cytoplasmic structures containing proteasome could form in mammalian cells under nonpathological conditions remains an open question. In yeasts, PSGs formation is triggered by the entry into quiescence. Because yeast quiescence share many features with G0 mammalian cells, it would be of great interest to find out whether PSG-like structures are conserved from yeasts to mammals.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p>All the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are isogenic to BY4742, BY4741, or BY4743 (available from Euroscarf). <italic>S. pombe</italic> strain expressing Pad1-GFP from the endogenous locus is a gift from J.P Javerzat (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut de Biochimie et G&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;tique Cellulaires, Universit&#x000e9; Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, UMR5095 Bordeaux, France; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wilkinson et al., 1998</xref>).
