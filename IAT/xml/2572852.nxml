The fact that HSV was present in elderly subjects with AD suggests that the virus could be a co-factor of the disease. We investigated the risk of developing AD in anti-HSV immunoglobulin G (IgG) positive subjects (indicator of a lifelong infection to HSV) and IgM-positive subjects (indicator of primary infection or reactivation of the virus) in a longitudinal population-based cohort of elderly subjects living in the community.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Cox proportional hazard models were used to study the risk of developing AD according to the presence or not of anti-HSV IgG and IgM antibodies, assessed in the sera of 512 elderly initially free of dementia followed for 14 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During the follow-up, 77 incident AD cases were diagnosed. Controlled for age, gender, educational level and Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) status, IgM-positive subjects showed a significant higher risk of developing AD (HR&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2.55; 95&#x00025; CI &#x0005b;1.38&#x02013;4.72&#x0005d;), although no significant increased risk was observed in IgG-positive subjects (HR&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.67; 95&#x00025;CI &#x0005b;0.75&#x02013;3.73&#x0005d;). No modification effect with APOE4 status was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Reactivation of HSV seropositivity is highly correlated with incident AD.

This virus persists latently in the peripheral nervous system, and periodically reactivates with production of active virus. Herpes Simplex Encephalopathy (HSE) is a rare but very severe acute infection of the central nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Whitley1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Although it has a very different course from Alzheimer's disease (AD), it leads to the occurrence of bilateral hippocampal-inner temporal lesions resulting in profound verbal memory loss, characteristic of AD. On the basis of this hippocampal and temporal tropism of the virus, HSV was proposed as a candidate environmental risk factor for AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Pyles1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Some studies found that HSV has been detected in the brain of many AD patients, both by direct detection of virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Itzhaki1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and by the detection of intrathecal antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Wozniack1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as the virus was also frequently detected in normal brains of aged individuals, it is unlikely that HSV infection is the only cause of the disease, but it may participate in the pathogenic process.</p><p>The fact that the frequency of HSV DNA-positive subjects was not different between AD and control subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Itzhaki1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and that intrathecal IgG antibodies were detected in a similar proportion of patients with AD and elderly controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Wozniack1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> indicates that chronic HSV infection alone is not univocally associated with AD. It has been suggested, however, that the risk of developing AD in subjects positive for HSV DNA presence in the brain who carried apolipoprotein E &#x003b5;4 allele (APOE-&#x003b5;4) was several fold that of individuals possessing only one or neither of these factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Itzhaki2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this finding remains controversial as it has not been confirmed by another study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Beffert1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Few studies have investigated the seroprevalence of anti-HSV antibodies in AD. Renvoize et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Renvoize1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> found no statistically significant difference in serum antibody titres to HSV in a sample of 33 AD patients and 28 controls. Ounanian et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Ounanian1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> in a sample of 19 AD patients and 21 controls, showed increased titres of antibodies to HSV in the control group but the proportion of HSV-positive subjects was not different between AD and control groups. These studies were performed on small samples of individuals and with IgG antibodies only, which characterise past infections. IgM antibodies, which characterise primary infections or reactivations, have not been investigated. Our objective is to assess the risk of developing AD according to the baseline anti-HSV-1 or HSV-2 immunoglobulin status (IgG and IgM) over a 14-year period of follow-up in a large prospective population-based study of elderly subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was part of the PAQUID (Personnes Agees QUID) research programme, a prospective cohort study of normal and pathological cerebral aging, composed of a randomly selected sample of non-institutionalised individuals aged 65 years and over living in the south west of France. The methodology of this study has already been extensively described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Letenneur1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The survey started in 1988, following 3777 subjects who were interviewed at home by trained psychologists one, three, five, eight, 10, 13 and 15 years after the baseline visit. Subjects who agreed to participate in the study gave their written informed consent; the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Bordeaux. At each visit, cognitive performances were evaluated using a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests including the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Folstein1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. After the psychometric evaluation, the psychologists systematically completed an evaluation of the DSMIII-R criteria for dementia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-APA1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and subjects who met these criteria were subsequently seen by a senior neurologist who confirmed the diagnosis of dementia. Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-McKhann1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>At the first year visit in 1989, a subsample of 591 volunteers agreed to have a blood sample. Serum samples were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent analysis. The samples were analysed in 2007 to assess seropositivity to HSV. The detection of IgM and IgG antibodies to HSV was performed following the manufacturer's recommendations (Enzygnost Anti HSV/IgM and IgG, Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany) from 10 &#x000b5;l of serum for each parameter. The Enzygnost Anti-HSV/IgG (and Anti-HSV/IgM) is an ELISA for the quantitative determination of human IgG (respectively IgM) antibodies to HSV in serum. Subjects were considered positive for an optical density greater or equal to 0.1. IgG titres were expressed in international units per millilitre (IU/ml). Twenty eight subjects already demented at the time of blood collection were not included in the present analysis; in addition, 51 subjects who died or refused to participate to the follow-up after the blood sampling were also excluded. A total of 512 were then included in the present study. Subjects had only one blood sampling and no lumbar puncture was performed during the follow-up.</p><p>Statistical analysis: Cumulative incidence rates of AD were estimated. The cumulative incidence rates which measure the proportion of individuals who develop the disease during a specified period of time were obtained by the Kaplan-Meier method. The hazard ratios (HR) of AD and 95&#x00025; confidence intervals (95&#x00025; CI) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model. The association between IgG and IgM status and the onset of AD was controlled for age at inclusion, gender, educational level (primary school with diploma vs no schooling or primary school without diploma) and APOE-&#x003b5;4 allele. To further investigate the evolution of the cognitive performance over time, the annual rate of change in MMSE score was modelled by a linear mixed model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Laird1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The adjusted model included terms for IgG or IgM status, age at baseline, gender, education level, APOE-&#x003b5;4, time (time in years since the baseline visit, i.e. the blood sampling) and interaction terms between time and each covariate. The parameters for time interactions represent the estimated effect of the covariate on the annual rate of change since baseline. As the distribution of MMSE scores was not normal, we analyzed the square root of the number of errors, as proposed by Jacqmin-Gadda et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-JacqminGadda1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, these authors stated that, after transformation, graphical examination of residuals indicated that the hypotheses of normality and homoscedasticity were acceptable. Therefore, we chose to apply the same transformation to our data. All statistical analyses were done using SAS, version 9.1 (SAS institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Among the 512 non-demented subjects at inclusion, 99 developed a dementia (including 77 AD) over 8.2 years (SD&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4.4) of follow-up on average. The main characteristics of the subjects are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003637-t001">table 1</xref>. As expected, subjects with incident dementia were older at inclusion. Incident AD cases were more frequently women and APOE-&#x003b5;4 bearers. At baseline, 424 subjects (82.8&#x00025;) were IgG-positive and 43 (8.4&#x00025;) were IgM-positive. Only 86 (16.8&#x00025;) subjects were negative for both IgG and IgM. Among the 43 IgM-positive subjects, only 2 were IgG-negative. Therefore, it is likely that most of the IgM-positive subjects showed recent reactivation of the virus. Unfortunately, no information was available about clinical manifestations of the infection to confirm this hypothesis.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0003637-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003637.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Main characteristics of the sample according to dementia status.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0003637-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0003637.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0003637-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non demented</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Incident Alzheimer's disease</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Other incident dementia</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of subjects</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">413</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">77</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age at inclusion. mean (sd)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.8 (5.8)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75.8 (6.0)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">74.4 (5.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age at diagnosis or censorship. mean (sd)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">82.8 (5.7)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">85.8 (6.0)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">85.4 (6.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female gender (&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High educational level (&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">76.5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">77.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">APOE &#x003b5;4 allele (&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anti-HSV IgG positive (&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">81.1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">89.6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">90.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anti-HSV IgM positive (&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>PAQUID study, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;512.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>During the follow-up, 69 (16.3&#x00025;) of the 424 IgG-positive subjects, and 8 (9.1&#x00025;) of the 88 IgG negative subjects developed AD.

This higher risk of dementia seems specific of AD, since the HR for other dementias was not significant, but the corresponding sample was small. In contrast, subjects with positive detection of anti-HSV IgG antibodies in the sera were not at higher risk of AD than IgG-negative subjects. This last result is in accordance with previous case-control clinical series <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Renvoize1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Ounanian1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. These results were confirmed when analysing the evolution of cognitive performance measured by the MMSE. This analysis did not rely only on a small sample of demented subjects and confirmed the greater cognitive decline of IgM positive subjects. Strandberg et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Strandberg1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> analysed cognitive decline in 383 elderly cardiovascular subjects according to viral burden (3 herpesviradae : HSV1, HSV2, Cytomegalovirus (CMV)) and bacterial burden (<italic>C pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>M Pneumoniae</italic>) and showed a greater cognitive decline with viral burden in a stepwise manner. The HR of developing cognitive decline was 1.8 in subjects with 2 seropositivities and 2.3 in subjects with 3 seropositivities compared to subjects with 0 or 1 seropositivity. Aiello et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Aiello1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> showed a higher rate of cognitive decline over a 4 year period in subjects with the highest CMV antibody levels and no association between cognitive decline and HSV antibody levels. In this study, HSV-1 IgG antibodies were assessed and, as in the other studies examining IgG antibodies, it is likely that the titre remained unaltered between and during periods of recrudescence.</p><p>In this study, the sub-type of HSV virus (HSV-1 or HSV-2) was not determined. Since HSV-1 is more prevalent than HSV-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Malkin1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, it is most likely that subjects were infected with HSV-1 virus. In addition, HSE caused by HSV-2 is very rare in adults. Further research is needed to analyse the impact of each virus type on the risk of AD.</p><p>Contrary to the findings of Itzhaki et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Itzhaki2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> in the comparison of brains of AD patients and controls, we did not find any interaction between APOE status and IgM-positive status on risk of AD. These negative results could be related to a lack of statistical power of our study since only 12 subjects were APOE4 bearers and IgM-positive. In our sample, we did not diagnose any case of herpes encephalitis that involves acute infection of the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Chauduri1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> whereas AD shows a progressive cognitive evolution.</p><p>Since IgM antibodies are present in the blood for a limited time period (the IgM response tends to decline within about one to two months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Knipe1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, but in HSE, IgM persisted at a range from 56 days to 328 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Forsgren1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>), IgM positive status indicated that HSV reactivation was recent. In addition, a high prevalence of positive IgM results among patients with established HSV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Morrow1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> has been observed. As antibodies detection was performed only once in our study, we do not have any information of possible later reactivation of the virus. However, we may hypothesise that we had identified subjects involved in a chronic infection to regularly reactivating HSV, as that was well known for other HSV manifestations like cold sores. As no clinical information was collected about the occurrence of cold sores, we do not have any data to support this hypothesis.</p><p>Several interpretations could explain these findings. HSV1, which causes the rare and very severe herpes encephalitis, could possibly also produce a milder and chronic brain disease which selectively damages the very same brain areas that are affected in AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Itzhaki1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, multiple HSV reactivations would lead to a progressive injury in parts of the brain that may favour the clinical expression of AD. The dynamics of the incidence of AD according to IgM status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003637-g001">figure 1</xref>) showed an increase more than 7 years after blood sampling. These reactivations do not seem to lead to instantaneous cognitive impairment, but rather may weaken cerebral tissue, leading several years later to AD. This might also explain the absence of association in IgG positive subjects since they were not involved in persistent infection. Other authors have proposed that HSV reactivations could enhance the aggregation of the beta-amyloid protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Kammerman1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Another possibility is a cross-reaction between HSV antibodies and beta-amyloid peptide. Indeed, a significant region of homology between the beta-amyloid protein found in AD and HSV-1 glycoprotein B (gB) has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Pyles1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically, gB residues 22&#x02013;44 (gB22&#x02013;44) share high similarity to the beta-amyloid carboxyl putative neurotoxic, nucleation and assembly domains. To be IgM positive would then be a marker of the ongoing process of AD pathology.</p><p>Another hypothesis is the influence of inflammation due to HSV infection on Alzheimer's disease. In several models of chronic neurodegenerative conditions, a pro-inflammatory response is observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Perry1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> but it is kept under tight control, probably by appropriate anti-inflammatory mediators. The disruption of this anti-inflammatory microglial state has deleterious consequences for the progression of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Boche1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Thackray1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In a triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, repeated challenges with lipopolysaccharide were shown to exacerbate central nervous system inflammation and to cause increased tau phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003637-Kitazawa1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. As AD pathology begins many years before the dementia stage, recurrent reactivation of HSV might act as a potent stimulus to the brain microglia, increasing the level of cytokines and initiating a positive feedback cycle that gives rise to an increasing accumulation of pathological changes.</p><p>If one of both interpretations were true, the prevention of AD by treating or preventing HSV reactivations could be actions to be tested.</p><p>An important consequence of our results lies in the fact that subjects with reactivation of HSV are easily detectable through a simple serum analysis which, if repeated over time, could be the basis of primary or secondary prevention strategies towards AD.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
