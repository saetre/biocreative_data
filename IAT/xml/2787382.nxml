Five P2X-like proteins (dP2XA&#x02013;E) are present in this organism. However, their roles in purinergic signaling are unclear, because dP2XA proved to have an intracellular localization on the contractile vacuole where it is thought to be required for osmoregulation. To determine functional properties of the remaining four dP2X-like proteins and to assess their cellular roles, we recorded membrane currents from expressed cloned receptors and generated a quintuple knock-out <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> strain devoid of dP2X receptors. ATP evoked inward currents at dP2XB and dP2XE receptors but not at dP2XC or dP2XD. &#x003b2;,&#x003b3;-Imido-ATP was more potent than ATP at dP2XB but a weak partial agonist at dP2XE.

However, quintuple <italic>p2xA/B/C/D/E</italic> null cells were still capable of regulating cell volume in water demonstrating that, contrary to previous findings, dP2X receptors are not required for osmoregulation.

Receptors that mediate responses to extracellular purines include both ligand gated ion channels (P2X receptors) and G-protein-coupled receptors (P2Y, adenosine and cAMP receptors). ATP is the exclusive endogenous ligand at mammalian P2X receptors, which consist of seven distinct subtypes (P2X<sub>1&#x02013;7</sub>) that assemble at the cell surface as homo- or hetero-trimeric channels and play key roles in a wide range of physiological processes such as neurotransmission, platelet aggregation, smooth muscle contraction, and immune cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Definitive molecular and functional evidence for P2X receptors has also been obtained in several lower organisms, including species of trematode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), amoeba (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), green algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), choanoflagellate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), and tardigrade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), making it clear that the emergence of P2X receptors was an early event in eukaryotic evolution. What is less clear however is whether the physiological roles of these lower organism P2X receptors are analogous to the cell surface function of vertebrate P2X receptors.</p><p>The amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> has recently emerged as a potential model system for fundamental aspects of purinergic signaling due to the simplicity and genetic tractability of this organism, with the availability of powerful functional screens, and also due to the absence of P2X-like proteins in the genomes of other key model organisms such as yeast, <named-content content-type="project">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content>, and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Sequencing of the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) revealed the presence of five genes with weak homology to vertebrate P2X receptors (named <italic>p2xA</italic>, <italic>p2xB</italic>, <italic>p2xC</italic>, <italic>p2xD</italic>, and <italic>p2xE</italic> in Dictybase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>)). Of these five genes <italic>p2xA</italic> shows the most homology to vertebrate P2X receptors and was shown to encode an ATP-gated ion channel when exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Interestingly, rather than being located on the plasma membrane analogous to vertebrate P2X receptors, the native dP2XA protein was found to be localized to the intracellular membranes of the contractile vacuole where it is thought to be required for osmoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), thus highlighting the possibility of potential novel intracellular roles for vertebrate P2X receptors.</p><p>In addition to the intracellular signaling mediated by dP2XA, <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> also possesses a purinergic signaling system for extracellular nucleotides more analogous to that found in vertebrate cells. Using an apoaequorin-expressing strain we have previously demonstrated that both extracellular ATP and ADP evoke a robust and rapid increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The characteristics of this purinergic response are indicative of the involvement of an ionotropic P2X rather than a metabotropic P2Y-like receptor, because it is dependent on extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and is unaffected by ablation of either the G-protein subunit gene <italic>G</italic>&#x003b2; or the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor gene <italic>iplA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). However, there are notable differences compared with Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses via vertebrate P2X receptors, including equal sensitivity to both ATP and ADP and lack of effect of the common P2 receptor antagonists PPADS<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> and suramin. The exclusive involvement of either the <italic>p2xA</italic> or <italic>p2xE</italic> genes in the extracellular purinergic response was ruled out by ablation of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), leaving, <italic>p2xB</italic>, <italic>p2xC</italic>, and <italic>p2xD</italic> as the most likely candidate receptors.</p><p>In this study we aimed to determine whether the other four members of the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> P2X receptor family also correspond to ATP-gated ion channels and to assess the roles of dP2X receptors in purinergic signaling by generating a quintuple knock-out strain with all five <italic>p2x</italic> genes ablated. We show that dP2XB and dP2XE do correspond to ATP-gated channels but could not obtain functional currents for dP2XC or dP2XD receptors. Apart from a decrease in magnitude, the extracellular purinergic response remained unaffected in quintuple <italic>p2x</italic> knock-out <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, demonstrating that the cell surface ATP/ADP receptor is not a P2X channel. Indeed all five dP2X proteins proved to be intracellular, localized to the contractile vacuole membrane with the ligand binding domain facing the lumen. When exposed to distilled water, quintuple <italic>p2x</italic> null cells displayed a slight delay in their osmoregulatory response but, in marked contrast to previous studies with <italic>p2xA</italic> null cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), were still capable of regulating their cell volume demonstrating a minor and nonessential role for dP2X receptors in osmoregulation. Calcium responses to both calmidazolium and ATP, however, were reduced in quintuple <italic>p2x</italic> null cells suggesting that dP2X receptors play a role in intracellular calcium signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Cloning of Dictyostelium P2X Receptors</title><p>Oligonucleotide primers (pairs 1&#x02013;5, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) designed to amplify the coding regions of the five predicted <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> P2X receptor genes (DDB0238349, DDB0238356, DDB0238363, DDB0238366, and DDB0238352 for <italic>p2xA&#x02013;E</italic>, respectively) were utilized for reverse transcription-PCR on cDNA prepared from Ax2 <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>.

Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were made from dP2X-expressing <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes at room temperature using an Axoclamp 900A amplifier with a Digidata 1440A data acquisition system and pClamp 10 acquisition software (Molecular Devices). For construction of concentration response data, the extracellular recording solution (ND98K<sup>+</sup>) consisted of 98 m<sc>m</sc> KCl, 1.8 m<sc>m</sc> BaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 m<sc>m</sc> MES, pH 6.2. Membrane currents were recorded at a holding potential of &#x02212;70 mV. ATP (Mg<sup>2+</sup> salt, Sigma) was applied from a nearby U-tube perfusion system, whereas antagonists (PPADS and suramin (Sigma)), CuCl<sub>2</sub>, and ivermectin (Sigma) were bath perfused as well as being present at the appropriate concentration in the U-tube application of ATP. For dP2XE reproducible currents were obtained with a 5-min recovery period between sequential applications of agonist allowing concentration response data to be obtained sequentially in individual cells. Marked current rundown, however, occurred with dP2XA and dP2XB, which was highly dependent on the previous history of ATP applications. This prevented construction of concentration response data in the same cells, and, to overcome this, a single application of agonist was made to 10&#x02013;15 oocytes from the same batch for each concentration of agonist, and a mean peak response was taken. Non-injected and water-injected oocytes tested from at least five batches of oocytes gave no detectable currents in response to ATP or ADP application (tested at 3 m<sc>m</sc>). Concentration response data were fitted using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (San Diego, CA).</p><p>For permeability ratio studies the external recording solution consisted of: either NaCl, KCl, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, or choline chloride at 98 m<sc>m</sc>, 1.8 m<sc>m</sc> BaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 m<sc>m</sc> MES (pH 6.2). Reversal potentials (<italic>V</italic><sub>rev</sub>) for currents in different test cation solutions were obtained using a dual ramp protocol, which stepped from a holding potential of &#x02212;70 mV to +70 mV for 0.2 s followed by a ramp down to &#x02212;100 mV over 1.6 s and a ramp up to +70 mV over 1.6 s before a step back to &#x02212;70 mV. This voltage protocol was first applied in the absence of ATP to control for endogenous voltage-activated currents, and then in the presence of ATP (3 m<sc>m</sc>) the two traces were superimposed. The reversal potential was taken as the points where the current traces crossed on the ramps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>).

Here we show that dP2XB and dP2XE also represent ATP-gated ion channels and further characterize the permeation properties of dP2XA. No nucleotide-evoked currents, however, could be recorded from dP2XC- or dP2XD-expressing oocytes tested under a range of extracellular recording solutions and pH. The typical extracellular recording solution for the study of P2X ion channel function in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes is ND96 (pH 7.5) with 1.8 m<sc>m</sc> BaCl<sub>2</sub> replacing the 1.8 m<sc>m</sc> CaCl<sub>2</sub> to prevent activation of endogenous calcium-activated chloride channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In initial experiments using this solution with dP2XB- or dP2XE-expressing oocytes we obtained no or very small (&#x0003c;50 nA) currents upon ATP application (tested up to 3 m<sc>m</sc>). Substitution of BaCl<sub>2</sub> with CaCl<sub>2</sub> or omission of MgCl<sub>2</sub> in ND96 had no effect on these very small current amplitudes. ND96 with a more acid pH (pH 6.2) produced slightly larger currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>), but these were still small (160 &#x000b1; 45 nA for dP2XB and 696 &#x000b1; 211 nA for dP2XE) in comparison to other non-vertebrate P2X channels expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Surprisingly, when Na<sup>+</sup> was replaced with either NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> in the extracellular recording solution current amplitudes became much larger (&#x0223c;3&#x02013;6 &#x003bc;A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) suggesting that dP2XB and dP2XE channels either have low Na<sup>+</sup> permeability or that Na<sup>+</sup> in some way inhibited the efficacy of ATP to activate the channel. Similar to dP2XB and dP2XE, currents through the dP2XA channel were also significantly larger (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) when Na<sup>+</sup> was replaced with K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), however Na<sup>+</sup> inhibition in dP2XA was less pronounced than in dP2XB or dP2XE. All chemicals were of analytical grade (SigmaUltra) nevertheless, to confirm that Na<sup>+</sup> inhibition was not due to trace contamination of metal ions, &#x0201c;trace select&#x0201d; NaCl (Fluka 38979) was also used for dP2XB-expressing oocytes, and the Na<sup>+</sup> inhibition remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). In the absence of Na<sup>+</sup> ions, pH also affected current amplitudes with acidic pH (6.2) producing significantly larger current amplitudes than neutral or slightly alkaline pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>).

The agonist binding domain could potentially face the cytoplasm or the vacuole lumen. To determine membrane orientation a STREP tag II was introduced into the predicted inter-transmembrane domain of dP2XA-eGFP so as to provide a dual-tagged construct with different immuno-detectable epitopes on either side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>). The cellular distribution of this dual-tagged construct was comparable to that of dP2XA-eGFP, and importantly expression on vacuolar membranes was not disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic>). Intact intracellular organelles were exposed to proteinase K to digest exposed protein domains while keeping those domains present within the organelle protected from protease activity. Western blot analyses of the products of protease treatment using anti-STREP or anti-GFP antibodies demonstrated that proteinase K was able to fully digest the C-terminal region of the receptor containing the eGFP tag while the inter-transmembrane loop encompassing the STREP tag remained protected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>D</italic>). Prior treatment of vacuoles with Triton X-100 resulted in proteinase K digestion of both epitope tags, because disruption of the vacuole membrane will allow proteinase K accessibility to both the cytoplasmic and lumen sides of the vacuole. The orientation indicated by these results puts the predicted agonist binding site within the lumen of the vacuole and the N and C termini within the cytoplasm. In addition to a STREP-tagged digestion product corresponding in size to the full inter-transmembrane region (&#x0223c;30 kDa), a smaller product of &#x0223c;20 kDa containing the STREP tag was also observed. This smaller band often represented the major of the two digestion products and occasionally, when a higher proteinase K:protein ratio was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>D</italic>, <italic>gel 3</italic>), was the only digestion product detected. The presence of this smaller &#x0223c;20-kDa band suggests that part of the inter-transmembrane region is exposed to the enzyme in the extra-organelle environment, possibly via a re-entrant loop. Similar to dP2XA, protease protection assays on dP2XB-eGFP, dP2XC-eGFP, dP2XD-eGFP, and dP2XE-eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>E</italic>), demonstrated that the C-terminal domains of these constructs were also exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the vacuole membrane revealing an equivalent membrane orientation for all five dP2X proteins. In addition to GFP-tagged dP2X proteins, the anti-GFP antibody in some cases also recognized a smaller protein of &#x0223c;30 kDa in undigested samples. The intensity of this band varied between samples, and its identity was not clear. The presence of this band, however, did not interfere with the interpretation of the proteinase K protection results.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Orientation of dP2X proteins in contractile vacuole membranes.</bold><italic>A</italic>, schematic of the dual-tagged dP2XA construct.

Similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), the presence of 10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> copper prevented both wild-type and mutant cells from undergoing an osmoregulatory decrease in cell volume, and cells remained swollen after 60-min exposure to water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>B</italic>).</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8.</label><caption><p><bold>dP2X receptors are not essential for osmoregulation.</bold><italic>A</italic>, differential interference contrast images of wild-type (<italic>top panel</italic>) and quintuple <italic>p2x</italic> null (<italic>bottom panel</italic>) cells in HL5 media and distilled water at 10 and 60 min.

Given the low sequence similarity with vertebrate P2X receptors (between 8.5 and 18.8% amino acid identity with human P2X<sub>1&#x02013;7</sub> receptors), it is remarkable that, similar to dP2XA, these two <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> P2X channels are still exclusively selective for ATP over other nucleotides. Whether the agonist binding site in the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> P2X receptors is analogous to their vertebrate counterparts is uncertain. The recently solved crystal structure for zebrafish P2X<sub>4</sub> is in the agonist-unbound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), and the definitive localization of the ATP binding site therefore remains unknown. ATP binding in vertebrate P2X receptors is known to occur between adjacent subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and is thought to involve lysine residues that coordinate phosphate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), an NFR motif that binds adenine/ribose and an FT motif also involved in agonist action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Similarities in ATP binding for dP2XA and vertebrate P2X receptors have been demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis where Lys<sup>67</sup> (equivalent to human P2X<sub>1</sub> Lys<sup>70</sup>) and Lys<sup>289</sup> (equivalent to human P2X<sub>1</sub> Lys<sup>309</sup>) both disrupted ATP evoked currents when mutated to alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However dP2XB lacks the first of these lysine residues and dP2XE lacks both lysines. It is therefore surprising that dP2XB and dP2XE are still gated by ATP given that the equivalent lysine residues in vertebrates are thought to coordinate binding of ATP phosphate moieties, suggesting that other regions of the receptor must also be important in agonist recognition.</p><p>An unusual property of the dP2X receptors, particularly dP2XB, is the inhibition of current amplitude by Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). The small currents in the presence of high Na<sup>+</sup> were not a result of low Na<sup>+</sup> permeability, because <italic>P</italic><sub>K<sup>+</sup></sub>/<italic>P</italic><sub>Na<sup>+</sup></sub> was shown to be &#x0223c;1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). It is therefore likely that Na<sup>+</sup> exerts some form of allosteric modulation on dP2X channel function possibly by affecting the mean open time by a mechanism similar to that proposed for human P2X<sub>7</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Permeability to chloride is also an unusual feature for P2X receptors, however, this is not unique, because chicken and human P2X<sub>5</sub> receptors have also been shown to pass chloride (<italic>P</italic><sub>Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup></sub>/<italic>P</italic><sub>Na<sup>+</sup></sub> = 0.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Interestingly, the dP2X receptors differed in their permeability to chloride with dP2XA and dP2XB being permeable but dP2XE not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The relative permeability of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> to Na<sup>+</sup> was estimated to be &#x0223c;2 for dP2XB and &#x0223c;1 for dP2XA. Although these values can only be taken as a rough estimate, because the actual intracellular concentrations of ions in the batches of oocytes used was not determined, the data clearly demonstrate that dP2XB is more permeable to Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> than dP2XA. The relevance of this Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> permeability is unclear, because the ionic composition of the contractile vacuole remains largely undetermined, although a vacuolar protein pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase PAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), and the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> transporter AmtB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) have all been localized to the contractile vacuole membrane. In respect to the latter, the relatively high permeability of the dP2X proteins to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>) may have physiological significance.</p><p>The lack of functional currents in dP2XC or dP2XD could possibly be due to inappropriate post-translational processing of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> proteins in <italic>Xenopus</italic> or gating of these channels by non-nucleotide ligands. Alternatively, dP2XC and dP2XD may require co-expression with other dP2X family members to form heteromeric channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) or require the presence of one or more accessory proteins. Co-expression of dP2XC together with dP2XD in oocytes did not produce ATP/ADP-evoked currents, and co-expression of either channel with dP2XB resulted in a dominant negative phenotype with loss of ATP-gated currents (data not shown). Whether this dominant negative effect represents a physiological mechanism by which dP2XC/D can regulate the activity of the other dP2X proteins remains to be determined.</p><p>Colocalization of RFP tagged dP2XB&#x02013;E with eGFP-tagged vatM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) on the membranes of the contractile vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>), demonstrated that, similar to dP2XA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), dP2XB, -C, -D, and -E receptors are also localized to this intracellular organelle. The low potency of ATP at dP2XA, -B, and -E receptors, ranging from EC<sub>50</sub> &#x0223c;100 to 500 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), is perhaps a reflection of this intracellular localization, because the concentration of ATP will typically be much higher within the cell than in the extracellular environment. Key to understanding the functional roles of dP2X receptors in contractile vacuole function is determining the membrane orientation, because this will provide information on both the potential origin of agonist activating the receptor and the regulatory/modulatory influences that the different domains of the receptor are exposed to. By using a protease protection assay on tagged receptors we demonstrated that the transmembrane loop region containing the agonist binding site lies within the lumen of the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). The source of ATP within the vacuole to activate these receptors, however, is currently unknown. One speculative possibility is that ATP containing vesicles within the cytoplasm could fuse with the vacuole membrane to release ATP into the lumen in a manner analogous to the exocytosis of ATP in vertebrate astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Such a mechanism would likely be regulated by calcium and could possibly involve the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> SNARE protein Vamp7B, which has recently been shown to be present on the contractile vacuole membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Alternatively, analogous to plasma membrane pannexin 1 function in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), the vacuole membrane may contain channels capable of passing ATP from the cytoplasm to the vacuole lumen. It is also feasible, as has been recently demonstrated in phagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), that active transport of ADP could occur across the vacuole membrane with subsequent conversion to ATP within the lumen.</p><p>The finding that all five members of the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> P2X family have an intracellular localization was unexpected, because these receptors were the most likely candidates for the cell surface receptor mediating the P2X-like calcium response evoked by extracellular ATP/ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Consistent with an intracellular rather than cell surface function for the entire dP2X receptor family, responses to extracellular ATP/ADP remained largely unaffected in the quintuple <italic>p2x</italic> knock-out strain with overlapping concentration response curves and time course of response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). A decrease in the magnitude of the extracellular purinergic response was observed in <italic>p2x</italic> null strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>D</italic>). However, it is unlikely that this decrease is a direct result of loss of dP2X channel activity at the cell surface, because the magnitude of the calcium response evoked by the calmodulin inhibitor calmidazolium was also decreased in the absence of dP2X receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>F</italic>). A more likely explanation for the reduction in magnitude of both ATP/ADP and calmidazolium responses in <italic>p2x</italic> null strains is that dP2X receptors are involved in facilitating intracellular calcium signaling. The contractile vacuole is primarily an osmoregulatory organelle, however, recent studies have also suggested that it additionally acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> store involved in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that dP2X receptors act as the calcium release channels from this store. Hence, although dP2X proteins do not represent the cell surface receptors directly activated by extracellular ATP/ADP, they may play a role in subsequent downstream signaling events by facilitating release of calcium from intracellular stores.</p><p>The generation of a quintuple <italic>p2x</italic> null strain also allowed us to directly assess the importance of dP2X receptors in osmoregulation. Previous studies on <italic>p2xA</italic> null <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> reported that these cells were incapable of regulating their cell volume in water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). It was therefore unexpected that the five single <italic>p2x</italic> null strains generated in this study showed no obvious osmoregulatory defects (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.045674/DC1">supplemental Fig. S2</ext-link>). Even the complete absence of all five dP2X proteins in the quintuple <italic>p2x</italic> null strain did not prevent cells from undergoing an osmoregulatory decrease in cell volume after initially swelling in water. These cells, however, did show a delay of &#x0223c;15 min compared with wild type in the onset of a regulatory decrease in volume, but the rate of the subsequent decrease in volume was very similar to that of the wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). This is in marked contrast to the behavior of the <italic>p2xA</italic> null cells described by Fountain and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), which showed no regulatory decrease in volume and a &#x0223c;50% increase in size after 60 min in water. Similar to this previous study we also found copper to inhibit the osmoregulatory response in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). We confirm that copper inhibits dP2XA channel function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). However, the effects of copper on osmoregulation cannot be by inhibition of dP2XA as had been previously claimed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), because copper also inhibits the quintuple <italic>p2x</italic> null strain, which is devoid of P2X receptors. Our results call into question the importance of dP2X receptor function in osmoregulation. The fact that quintuple <italic>p2x</italic> null cells are able to undergo an osmoregulatory response demonstrates that these receptors are not required. However, the slight delay in the onset of the osmoregulatory response indicates that they may play a minor role.</p><p>This study has further highlighted the usefulness of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> as a model system for purinergic signaling. In addition to elucidation of the novel intracellular roles played by intracellular P2X receptors and structure function studies comparing weakly related archetypal dP2X receptors with their vertebrate counterparts, future studies in this model organism may also yield some surprises, because even in the complete absence of dP2X receptors, a robust purinergic calcium response to extracellular ATP/ADP persists. This, together with the fact that extracellular purinergic signaling is also unaffected in <italic>iplA</italic> and <italic>G</italic>&#x003b2; null cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), which would be contrary to the involvement of a metabotropic P2Y receptor, suggests that a novel type of purinergic receptor or signaling mechanism exists in this organism.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (Project Grant WT081601MA).</p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material" id="FN2"><label><inline-graphic xlink:href="sbox.jpg"/></label><p>The on-line version of this article (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org">http://www.jbc.org</ext-link>) contains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.045674/DC1">supplemental Figs.
