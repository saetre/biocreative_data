The protein product of the sequenced gene contains 703 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 77,444. The fus gene shows the nonrandom pattern of codon usage typical of ribosomal proteins and other proteins synthesized at a high level. We have identified several potential promoter sequences within the gene. One of these sequences may correspond to the secondary promoter for expression of the downstream tufA gene (encoding elongation factor Tu) whose activity has been described previously (1,2). A comparison of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of elongation factors G and Tu reveals a limited but significant homology between the two proteins within the 150 amino acid residues at their amino-terminal ends.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00322-0413.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2181"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00322-0414.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2182"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00322-0415.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2183"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00322-0416.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2184"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00322-0417.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2185"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00322-0418.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2186"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00322-0419.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2187"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00322-0420.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2188"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00322-0421.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2189"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00322-0422.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2190"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00322-0423.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2191"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00322-0424.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2192"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
