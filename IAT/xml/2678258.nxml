We here demonstrate that uPAR is upregulated on murine and human leukocytes upon exposure to <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> both in vitro as well as in vivo. Notably, <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>-inoculated C57BL/6 uPAR knock-out mice harbored significantly higher <italic>Borrelia</italic> numbers compared to WT controls. This was associated with impaired phagocytotic capacity of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> by uPAR knock-out leukocytes in vitro. <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> numbers in vivo, and phagocytotic capacity in vitro, were unaltered in uPA, tPA (low fibrinolytic activity) and PAI-1 (high fibrinolytic activity) knock-out mice compared to WT controls. Strikingly, in uPAR knock-out mice partially backcrossed to a <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> susceptible C3H/HeN background, higher <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> numbers were associated with more severe carditis and increased local TLR2 and IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA expression. In conclusion, in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infection, uPAR is required for phagocytosis and adequate eradication of the spirochete from the heart by a mechanism that is independent of binding of uPAR to uPA or its role in the fibrinolytic system.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Lyme borreliosis is caused by the spirochete <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> and is transmitted through ticks. Since its discovery approximately 30 years ago it has become the most important vector-borne disease in the Western world. The pathogenesis of this complex zoonosis is still not entirely understood. We here demonstrate that the urokinase receptor (uPAR) is upregulated in mice and humans upon exposure to <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, we describe the function of uPAR in the immune response against the spirochete; using uPAR knock-out mice, we show that uPAR plays an important role in phagocytosis of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> by leukocytes both in vitro as well as in vivo. In addition, we show that the mechanism by which uPAR is involved in the phagocytosis of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> is independent of ligation to its natural ligand uPA or uPAR's role in fibrinolysis. Our study contributes to the understanding of the pathogenesis of Lyme borreliosis and might contribute to the development of innovative novel treatment strategies for Lyme borreliosis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lyme borreliosis, an emerging tick-borne disease in both the New and Old world, is caused by spirochetes belonging to the <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> sensu lato group and is predominantly transmitted by <italic>Ixodes</italic> ticks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Burgdorfer1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since uPAR has been shown to be of importance in the migration of leukocytes, we also investigated whether there was impaired migration of leukocytes in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>-infected uPAR knock-out mice. We intradermally inoculated C57BL/6 WT and uPAR knock-out mice with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> or controls and harvested skin at 0, 6 or 32 hours post infection. We did not observe influx of immune cells at t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0 (data not shown). By H&#x00026;E, Ly6G and F4/80 stainings on sagittal skin sections we did observe an evident influx of immune cells and inflammation at t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6 hours, however there were no differences between WT and uPAR knock-out mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). As has been shown by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Xu1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, the predominant cells at this early time point were granulocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). Importantly, these data show that the phenotype in uPAR knock-out mice is not explained by impaired influx of immune cells at the site of inoculation allowing for more dissemination of the spirochete. By contrast, later in the course of infection, at t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;32 hours, we observed a more pronounced influx of macrophages in uPAR knock-out mice compared to WT controls, which probably is explained by the increased <italic>Borrelia</italic> burden in uPAR knock-out mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). In conclusion, higher <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> numbers in C57BL/6 uPAR knock-out mice compared to WT mice could be explained by a decreased phagocytotic capacity of uPAR deficient leukocytes observed in vitro, but not by impaired migration of uPAR deficient leukocytes.</p><fig id="ppat-1000447-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000447.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>The urokinase receptor (uPAR) is involved in clearance of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>.</title><p>(A) Urokinase receptor knock-out C57BL/6 mice display higher systemic <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> numbers.

By multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), we detected significantly increased levels of interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, IL-1 Receptor Associated Kinase (IRAK)-3, and toll-like receptor (TLR)2 mRNA in hearts from uPAR knock-out mice compared to WT littermate controls two weeks post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g005"><bold>Figure 5H</bold></xref>), consistent with the observed higher <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> numbers and more severe cardiac inflammation in uPAR knock-out mice. Since, uPAR has also been shown to enhance migration of leukocytes towards the site of infection for some, but not all bacteria, in these mice we performed in vitro migration assays with WT and uPAR deficient macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000447.s005"><bold>Figure S5A</bold></xref>).

We here demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that uPAR plays an important role in the antibacterial innate immune response against <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. We show that uPAR expression is upregulated in response to <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> on human and murine leukocytes both in vitro, as well in vivo. Importantly, we describe the role of uPAR in the immune response against <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. By using C57BL/6 WT and uPAR knock-out mice we show that uPAR plays an important role in phagocytosis of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> - a prerequisite for the eradication of the spirochete - by leukocytes. Moreover, experiments with C57BL/6 uPA, tPA and PAI-1 knock-out mice show that the mechanism by which uPAR is involved in the phagocytosis of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> is independent of ligation to uPA or uPAR's role in fibrinolysis. Finally, we show that, in mice relatively susceptible to <italic>Borrelia</italic> infection - mice on a mixed C57BL/6 and C3H/HeN background - uPAR deficiency also impaired phagocytotic capacity in vitro, which was associated with higher <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> numbers, more local inflammation and more severe carditis, compared to WT littermate control animals, further underscoring the in vivo relevance of our findings. Together these data demonstrate an important role for uPAR in the innate immune response against, and the clearance of, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis.</p><p>Earlier studies documented that membrane bound uPAR and uPAR mRNA are upregulated in human peripheral blood-derived monocytes and the human monocyte-like cell line U937 upon exposure to viable and heat-killed <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Coleman2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Coleman3">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. We here show that viable <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> induces upregulation uPAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000447.s001"><bold>Figure S1</bold></xref>), not only on murine and human monocytes, but also on macrophages and granulocytes in vitro. Notably, uPAR expression in response to <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> in vivo has never been investigated. We here show that in skin from Lyme borreliosis patients with erythema migrans uPAR mRNA expression is significantly increased and could be readily detected by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Increased levels of uPAR are likely to be caused by influx of leukocytes to the site of the tick-bite. Indeed, in preliminary experiments in which we inoculated human skin ex vivo with viable <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> - a model in which there is no influx of leukocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-deJong1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> - we did not observe an increase in uPAR expression as determined by uPAR immunostaining on snap frozen sagittal skin sections (data not shown). Erythema migrans lesions are characterized by perivascular infiltrates in the dermis composed primarily of lymphocytes and macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Mullegger1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. We do not know which infiltrating cell type is responsible for the elevated uPAR levels, but based on our in vitro data we speculate that the macrophage is the most likely candidate. Indeed, macrophages from intraperitoneally <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>-inoculated WT C57BL/6 mice did upregulate uPAR expression, further indicating that <italic>Borrelia</italic>-phagocyte interaction in vivo results in induction of uPAR expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000447.s001"><bold>Figure S1</bold></xref>). Upregulation of uPAR appeared not to be specific for <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> since, in our in vitro experiments, other bacteria, i.e. <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic>, also induce upregulation of uPAR to a similar extent (data not shown).</p><p>To investigate the role of uPAR in the immune response against <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> and the course of murine Lyme borreliosis we inoculated C57BL/6 WT and uPAR knock-out mice with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. We demonstrate by quantitative PCR and culture that mice lacking uPAR display significantly increased <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> numbers in all tissue examined, indicative of a more disseminated infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>), although also in these mice there appeared to be clearance of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, as suggested by lower numbers 4 weeks compared to 2 weeks post infection. The increased <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> burden in uPAR deficient mice was underscored by a more abundant, putatively reactive, IgG response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). The role of uPAR in leukocyte adhesion and migration, leading to recruitment of these cells to the site of infection, has been the topic of investigations for many years. Several in vivo studies show that migration of uPAR deficient leukocytes is impaired in response to, for example, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Gyetko4">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Rijneveld1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. In other studies, e.g. in <italic>E. coli</italic>-induced peritonitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Renckens1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and pyelonephritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Roelofs1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> uPAR deficiency did not affect leukocyte recruitment, indicating that the role of uPAR in migration of leukocytes is dependent on the pathogen, the site of infection and the disease model. Interestingly, in the mouse model for Lyme borreliosis uPAR is not crucially involved in migration of leukocytes to <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infected tissues, as indicated in our in vivo migration experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). Strikingly, the fact that we observed more macrophages 32 hours after injection with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> in uPAR knock-out skin compared to WT controls, but no differences in H&#x00026;E staining, suggests that the quality of the inflammatory infiltrate is affected rather than the quantity; presumably due to higher <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> numbers in the uPAR knock-out mice. Interestingly, recently it was shown that uPAR also facilitates phagocytosis of the gram-negative bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic> by neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Gyetko3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Roelofs1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. We here show, by fluorescent microscopic assays, and FACS-based phagocytosis assays, that both uPAR deficient granulocytes and macrophages are significantly less capable of phagocytosing viable spirochetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000447.s002"><bold>Figure S2</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000447.s003"><bold>S3</bold></xref>). Importantly, uPAR deficiency did not affect binding of the spirochete to the surface of leukocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). In addition, in an in vitro killing assay uPAR appeared not to be involved in killing of the spirochete following phagocytosis (data not shown), indicating that uPAR is involved strictly in the process of internalization of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> by leukocytes. Others have previously shown that phagocytosis of spirochetes by immune cells can be crucial for adequate cytokine induction and leukocyte activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Cruz1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Shin1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. We did not observe defects in pro-inflammatory cytokine production in uPAR deficient leukocytes when stimulated in vitro with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. In contrast to the studies described above our results describe more subtle differences in phagocytotic capacity between WT and uPAR deficient leukocytes; we demonstrate diminished, but not absent, phagocytosis in uPAR deficient macrophages compared to WT controls.</p><p>The role of uPAR in phagocytosis of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> appeared to be independent of uPA and uPAR's role in the fibrinolytic system, since in our phagocytosis assays uPA, tPA and PAI-1 knock-out mice all displayed normal phagocytotic capacity of the spirochete compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000447-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). In addition, in vivo experiments clearly show that when these mice were inoculated with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> and sacrificed two weeks post infection, normal <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> numbers were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000447-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). There are numerous in vitro studies reporting that <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> interacts with the fibrinolytic system (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Bergmann1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>). Extrapolating these data to the in vivo situation, this interaction, mainly through binding to host derived plasminogen, was thought to enable the spirochete to penetrate tissues, the blood-brain barrier and migrate through the extracellular matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Klempner1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Fuchs1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Hu1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, for the spirochetal causative agent of relapsing fever, using plasminogen knock-out mice, it has been clearly shown that plasminogen is required for dissemination of the spirochete to the heart and brain in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Gebbia1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. To our knowledge, for <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> however, there is only one previously published study that describes the effect of diminished fibrinolytic activity on the course of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infection in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Coleman1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, in which plasminogen deficient mice were used, plasminogen was shown to be important for dissemination of the spirochete within the feeding tick. Strikingly, despite a short-lived spirochetemia, there were no differences in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> numbers in any of the tissues examined in plasminogen knock-out compared to WT mice at several time points post infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Coleman1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In line with these data, our results demonstrate that the fibrinolytic system per se does not affect the course of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infection. Strikingly, we here show that one of the key players in the fibrinolytic system, uPAR, independently of ligation to uPA or its presumptive role in fibrinolysis, is importantly involved in the course of experimental murine Lyme borreliosis.</p><p>The fact that we show that the requirement of uPAR in phagocytosis of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> is independent of uPA or uPAR's role in the fibrinolytic system suggests that the requirement of uPAR in internalization of <italic>Borrelia</italic> is dependent on interaction of uPAR with other cell surface molecules. Indeed, uPAR has been shown to facilitate various leukocyte functions, among which adhesion, migration and phagocytosis through interaction with &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-integrins and other cell surface molecules, but also vitronectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Mondino1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Blasi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This implies a role for uPAR as a signaling receptor. However, because uPAR is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linked receptor and lacks a cytosolic domain it needs to form functional transmembrane units with other molecules, such as multiple &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-integrins, G-protein-coupled receptors, and caveolin in order to induce intracellular signaling events leading to cytoskeleton rearrangements and consequent cell movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Mondino1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Blasi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Since both uPAR and <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> share many molecules with which they can interact, for example &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-integrins and vitronectin, it will be challenging to identify the surface molecule with which uPAR associates to facilitate phagocytosis of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>.</p><p>When we infected uPAR knock-out mice on a mixed C57BL/6 and C3H/HeN background with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> these mice exhibited higher <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> numbers in cardiac tissue two weeks post infection compared to WT littermate controls, which was also associated with decreased phagocytosis of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. Strikingly, in these mice we observed a significantly increased influx of leukocytes, predominantly macrophages, at the atrioventricular junction and at the aortic root compared to WT littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g005">Figure 5</xref>), further indicating that uPAR is not required for migration of leukocytes in response to <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, which was also underscored by the in vitro migration assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000447.s005"><bold>Figure S5</bold></xref>). Furthermore, our data indicate that, although the underlying mechanisms appeared to be the same, the consequences of uPAR deficiency for the course of murine Lyme borreliosis are dependent on the genetic background of the host. Others have shown that C57BL/6 and C3H/HeN mice harbor similar <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> numbers after infection, but the severity of symptoms was more pronounced in C3H/HeN mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Ma1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating that the extent of the immune response that is mounted against the spirochete is dependent on the genetic background of the host. Indeed, we have demonstrated that uPAR deficiency in <italic>Borrelia</italic> resistant C57BL/6 mice leads to higher <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> loads, but to comparable, albeit longer-lived active carditis compared to WT controls. By contrast, uPAR deficient mice on a more susceptible mixed C57BL/6&#x000d7;C3H/HeN background also exhibited higher <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> numbers, but more pronounced influx of leukocytes and more severe carditis. Local cytokines and chemokines induced by <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> are thought to mediate Lyme carditis. A cytokine that has been implicated to be of paramount importance for local inflammation and migration of leukocytes is IL-1&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Auron1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000447-Miller1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since, uPAR deficient leukocytes are as capable as WT leukocytes in producing pro-inflammatory cytokines upon exposure to <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g002">Figure 2</xref>), this could explain the increased inflammation and tissue damage observed in these mice compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, we postulate that in WT mice, upon <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infection, leukocytes upregulate uPAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000447-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000447.s001">Figure S1</xref>), which facilitates phagocytosis of the spirochete, reducing the number of disseminating spirochetes and thereby limiting the extent and severity of inflammation of distant sites, such as the heart. In conclusion, we here show that uPAR is importantly involved in the host defense against <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> in vivo by a mechanism that is independent of binding of uPAR to uPA or its role in the fibrinolytic system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice, spirochetes and infection</title><p>Specific pathogen-free wildtype C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley Inc.

Sham inoculated mice did not develop carditis (data not shown). Pictures depict representative sections. (C and D) Peak carditis in C57BL/6 uPA, tPA and PAI-1 knock-out mice is comparable to peak carditis in WT C57BL/6 mice infected with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. Carditis was scored as described above. Six to eight mice per group were used and bars represent the mean&#x000b1;SEM. A <italic>p</italic>-value&#x0003c;0,05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p>(1.19 MB JPG)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="ppat.1000447.s005" mimetype="image/jpeg" xlink:href="ppat.1000447.s005.jpg" position="float"><label>Figure S5</label><caption><p>Migration and arthritis in WT and uPAR knock-out mice on a <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> susceptible genetic background. (A, B and C) Urokinase receptor deficient macrophages from mice on the mixed genetic background can migrate to cardiogenic stimuli just as well as macrophages from WT littermate controls. Migration of CellTracker Green labeled WT or uPAR deficient macrophages towards several chemotactic stimuli was investigated in vitro (A). As chemotactic stimuli we used <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> or activated complement factor 5 (C5a) (B) and supernatant from the cardiomyoblastic rodent cell line H9c2 stimulated with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> or control medium for 16 hours prior to experimentation (C). All conditions were tested in duplo, in serum free DMEM medium without the addition of antibiotics, and migration was corrected for the no-attractant control. Graphs represent the mean of three independent experiments&#x000b1;SEM. The fluorescent signal in the lower chamber (indicative of migration) was measured in real time every two minutes (cycli). (D and E) Only edema, no arthritis in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infected uPAR knock-out mice (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7) and <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infected WT littermate controls (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8). Ankle swelling was measured using a microcaliper during the course of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infection (D). In this particular experiment mice were monitored for three weeks. Post mortem, but before decalcification, radiological examination of the right hindlimb was performed (E). No differences between sham inoculated and <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infected animals were observed.
