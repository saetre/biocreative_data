The destruction of articular cartilage is a typical pathological characteristic of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. and is believed to be largely mediated by proteases belonging to the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family of enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The MMPs can be classified into at least five main groups, including the collagenases (MMP-1, -8, and -13), the gelatinases (MMP-2 and -9), the stromelysins (MMP-3, -10, and -11), the matrilysins (MMP-7 and -26), and the membrane-bound-type MMPs (MMP-14, -15, -16, -17, -24, and -25). Among the MMPs, two collagenases, namely MMP-1 and MMP-13, are considered key players in the pathogenesis of OA because they have the unique ability to cleave most components of cartilage matrix, including collagen and aggrecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The expression levels of MMP-1 and MMP-13 are upregulated in arthritic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1&#x003b2;, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, and IL-17, which are also upregulated in OA tissues, are known to induce strongly the production of both MMPs in articular chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Inhibition of MMP has been considered a therapeutic strategy in arthritis, but most clinical trials have yielded disappointing results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, identification of factors and pathways that modulate MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression in chondrocytes is critical to our understanding the pathogenesis of OA and may lead to the development of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of the disease.</p><p>Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are a family of enzymes that incorporate molecular oxygen at specific positions into unsaturated fatty acids. In human tissues, three major LOXs have been characterized and named according to the carbon position of arachidonic acid oxygenation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]: 5-LOX, 12-LOX, and 15-LOX. Two different human 15-LOXs have been identified that differ in tissue distribution and substrate preferences. 15-LOX-1 is expressed in reticulocytes, eosinophils, skin, and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. 15-LOX-2 has been detected in prostate, lung, skin, and cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. 15-LOX-1 preferentially converts linoeic acid to 13(S)-hydroxy octadecadienoic acid (HODE), whereas 15-LOX-2 essentially converts arachidonic acid to 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have documented that 15-LOXs and their metabolites exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. For instance, 15-HETE and 13-HODE were shown to inhibit the production of leukotriene-B<sub>4 </sub>and reactive oxygen species by stimulated neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and the production of IL-8 by colonic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, 15-LOX metabolites suppress the production of TNF-&#x003b1;, a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and mediate the effects of the T-helper-2 cytokine IL-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The 15-LOX metabolites 15-HETE and 13-HODE are also ligands for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. PPAR&#x003b3; is a unique member of the ligand-dependent nuclear receptor family that has been implicated in the modulation of critical aspects of development and homeostasis. We and others have shown that PPAR&#x003b3; activation inhibits the expression of a number of genes involved in the pathogenesis of OA, including IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, MMP-1, MMP-13, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and is protective in animal models of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The expression of 15-LOXs and the roles played by their metabolites have been characterized in various tissues and cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, little is known regarding the expression and function of 15-LOXs in human cartilage. This study was undertaken to investigate the expression of 15-LOXs in human articular OA chondrocytes and to define the effect of their metabolites 15-HETE and 13-HODE on IL-1&#x003b2;-induced MMP-1 and MMP-13 production. We provide evidence that both 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 are expressed in human OA chondrocytes. We also demonstrate that 13-HODE and 15-HETE suppressed IL-1&#x003b2;-induced MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression and type II collagen cleavage. These data suggest that 15-LOXs may play a role in preventing the cartilage destruction observed in OA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Recombinant human IL-1&#x003b2; was obtained from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA, USA), and recombinant human TNF-&#x003b1; and recombinant human IL-17 from R&#x00026;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). GW9662, 13(S)-HODE, 15(S)-HETE, anti-15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 antibodies were from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Cycloheximide was from Sigma-Aldrich Canada (Oakville, Ontario, Canada), and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), penicillin and streptomycin, fetal calf serum (FCS), and TRIzol<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>reagent were from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). All other chemicals were purchased from either Sigma-Aldrich Canada or Bio-Rad (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada).</p></sec><sec><title>Specimen selection and chondrocyte culture</title><p>Human OA cartilage samples from femoral condyles and tibial plateaus were obtained from OA patients undergoing total knee replacement (n = 23; mean &#x000b1; standard deviation [SD] age 68 &#x000b1; 13 years). All OA patients were diagnosed in accordance with the criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology Diagnostic Subcommittee for OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. At the time of surgery, the patients had symptomatic disease requiring medical treatment in the form of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors. Patients who had received intra-articular injections of steroids were excluded. The Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Notre-Dame Hospital approved the study protocol and the use of human articular tissues.</p><p>Chondrocytes were released from cartilage by sequential enzymatic digestion, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In brief, this consisted of 2 mg/ml pronase for 1 hour followed by 1 mg/ml collagenase (type IV; Sigma-Aldrich) for 6 hours at 37&#x000b0;C in DMEM and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin). The digested tissue was briefly centrifuged and the pellet was washed. The isolated chondrocytes were seeded at high density in tissue culture flasks and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS.</p><p>Confluent chondrocytes were detached by trypsinization, seeded at 3.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells per well in 12-well culture plates (Costar, Corning, NY, USA) or at 7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells per well in six-well culture plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, and cultivated at 37&#x000b0;C for 48 hours. Cells were washed and incubated for an additional 24 hours in DMEM containing 0.5% FCS, before stimulation with either IL-1&#x003b2; alone or in combination with 13-HODE or 15-HETE. 13-HODE and 15-HETE, supplied in ethanol at 1 mg/ml, were air-dried and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10 mg/ml. Control cells were treated with the highest concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide (0.14%) as vehicle control. In another set of experiments, chondrocytes were pretreated for 30 minutes with vehicle, cycloheximide, or GW9662 before stimulation. The levels of MMP proteins released in supernatants were determined 24 hours after stimulation, whereas MMP mRNA levels were determined at 8 hours. Only first passaged chondrocytes were used.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and PCR analyses</title><p>Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>reagent (Invitrogen), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. To remove contaminating DNA, isolated RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). The RNA was quantitated using the RiboGreen RNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until use. One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Fermentas, Burlington, Ontario, Canada), as detailed in the manufacturer's guidelines. One-fifth of the reverse transcriptase reaction was analyzed by traditional PCR or real-time quantitative PCR. The following primers were used: 15-LOX-1, sense 5'-TTGGTTATTTCAGCCCCCATC-3' and antisense 5'-TGTGTTCACTGGGTGCAGAGA-3'; 15-LOX-2, sense 5'-GCATCCACTGATTGGACCTT-3' and antisense 5'-GCTGGCCTTGAACTTCTGAC-3'; MMP-1, sense 5'-CTGAAAGTGACTGGGAAACC-3' and antisense 5'-AGAGTTGTCCCGATGATCTC-3'; MMP-13, sense 5'-CTT AGA GGT GAC TGG CAA AC-3' and antisense 5'-GCC CAT CAA ATG GGT AGA AG-3'; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), sense 5'-CAGAACATCATCCCTGCCTCT-3' and antisense 5'-GCTTGACAAAGTGGTCGTTGAG-3'.</p><p>Quantitative PCR analysis was performed in a total volume of 50 &#x003bc;l containing template DNA, 200 nmol/l of sense and antisense primers, 25 &#x003bc;l of SYBR<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Green master mix (QIAGEN, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG; 0.5 units; Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI, USA). After incubation at 50&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes (UNG reaction) and at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes (UNG inactivation and activation of the AmpliTaq Gold enzyme), the mixtures were subjected to 40 amplification cycles (15 seconds at 95&#x000b0;C for denaturation and 1 minute for annealing and extension at 60&#x000b0;C). Incorporation of SYBR<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Green dye into PCR products was monitored in real time using a GeneAmp 5700 Sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), allowing determination of the threshold cycle (C<sub>T</sub>) at which exponential amplification of PCR products begins. After PCR, dissociation curves were generated with one peak indicating the specificity of the amplification. A threshold cycle (C<sub>T </sub>value) was obtained from each amplification curve using the software provided by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems).</p><p>Relative mRNA expression in chondrocytes was determined using the &#x00394;&#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>method, as detailed in the manufacturer's guidelines (Applied Biosystems). A &#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>value was first calculated by subtracting the C<sub>T </sub>value for the housekeeping gene GAPDH from the C<sub>T </sub>value for each sample. A &#x00394;&#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>value was then calculated by subtracting the &#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>value of the control (unstimulated cells) from the &#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>value of each treatment. Fold changes compared with the control were then determined by raising 2 to the power of -&#x00394;&#x00394;C<sub>T</sub>. Each PCR reaction generated only the expected specific amplicon, as shown by the melting temperature profiles of the final product and by gel electrophoresis of test PCR reactions. Each PCR was performed in triplicate on two separate occasions for each independent experiment. In conventional PCR, the mixtures were incubated at 95&#x000b0;C for 1 minute followed by 35 cycles each at 94&#x000b0;C/30 seconds and 60&#x000b0;C/1 minute, with a final elongation step at 60&#x000b0;C/8 minutes. Controls for reverse transcription and PCR amplifications were included. PCR product (10 &#x003bc;l/50 &#x003bc;l) reactions were separated on a 1.8% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Chondrocytes were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmol/l Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mmol/l NaCl, 2 mmol/l EDTA, 1 mmol/l PMSF, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1% NP-40, 1 mmol/l Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, and 1 mmol/l NaF). Lysates were sonicated on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 minutes. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Twenty micrograms of total cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking in 20 mmol/l Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mmol/l NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (weight/volume) nonfat dry milk, blots were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with the primary antibody and washed with a Tris buffer (Tris-buffered saline [pH 7.5], with 0.1% Tween 20). The blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce), washed again, incubated with SuperSignal Ultra Chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce), and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Ltd, Rochester, NY, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Cartilage specimens were processed for immunohistochemistry, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin.

The specimens were then pre-incubated with chondroitinase ABC (0.25 U/ml in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS; pH 8.0]) for 60 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C, followed by a 30-minute incubation with Triton X-100 (0.3%) at room temperature. Slides were then washed in PBS followed by 2% hydrogen peroxide/methanol for 15 minutes. They were further incubated for 60 minutes with 2% normal serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and overlaid with primary antibody for 18 hours at 4&#x000b0;C in a humidified chamber. Each slide was washed three times in PBS (pH 7.4) and stained using the avidin-biotin complex method (Vectastain ABC kit; Vector Laboratories). The color was developed with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories) containing hydrogen peroxide. The slides were counterstained with eosin. The specificity of staining was evaluated by substituting the primary antibody with nonimmune IgG (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) at the same concentration as the primary antibody. The evaluation of positive-staining chondrocytes was performed using our previously published method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For each specimen, six microscopic fields were examined under 40&#x000d7; magnification. The total number of chondrocytes and the number of chondrocytes staining positive were evaluated, and the results were expressed as the percentage of chondrocytes staining positive (cell score).</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmids and transient transfection</title><p>The PPRE-luciferase construct containing three PPAR-responsive elements (PPREs) cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter (PPRE-Tk-luciferase) was generously provided by Dr CK Glass (University of California, San Diego, CA, USA). &#x003b2;-Galactosidase reporter vector under the control of SV40 promoter (pSV40-&#x003b2;-galactosidase) was from Promega (Madison, WI, USA).

Taken together, these findings strongly suggest a chondroprotective role for 15-LOXs by negatively regulating the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-13.</p><p>In addition to their chondroprotective properties observed in this study, 15-LOX metabolites were shown to exhibit potent anti-inflammatory effects. For instance, 15-HETE inhibits polymorphonuclear neutrophil degranulation and superoxide production elicited by N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalaline, platelet-activating factor and leukotriene B<sub>4 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

On the other hand, 13-HODE attenuates the production of reactive oxygen species in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], the production of IL-8 in colonic epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and the ability of dendritic cells to activate interferon-&#x003b3; secretion by T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Moreover, 13-HODE and 15-HETE were shown to mediate the suppressive effect of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 on inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and IL-2 production in T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition to 13-HODE and 15-HETE formation, 15-LOXs are involved in the generation of the potent anti-inflammatory molecules lipoxins, resolvings, and protectins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Thus, 15-LOXs can dampen inflammation through production of distinct classes of anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution lipid mediators.</p><p>The protective effect of 15-LOXs is further supported by results from studies using transgenic animals. Over-expression of 15-LOX in rabbits reduced inflammation and tissue damage in atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and peritonitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In rats, over-expression of 15-LOX suppressed renal inflammation and preserved organ function in experimental glomerulonephritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. These data, together with our findings that 15-LOX metabolites block MMP production, suggest that these lipids may have protective effects in OA <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further studies using cartilage-specific 15-LOX-null mice will be required to elucidate the role of 15-LOXs in cartilage integrity and the pathogenesis of OA.</p><p>Several factors are known to modulate 15-LOX expression. For instance, IL-4 and IL-13, increase the expression of 15-LOX-1 and -2 in a number of cell types, including monocytes/macrophages, T lymphocytes and several cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Moreover, chromatin modifications that play pivotal roles in the regulation of gene expression were reported to modulate 15-LOX expression. Histone acetylation appears to upregulate 15-LOX expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] whereas DNA methylation downregulates 15-LOX expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Whether these factors and conditions contribute to the modulation of 15-LOX expression in chondrocytes is among our ongoing research projects.</p><p>13-HODE and 15-HETE are potent endogenous activators and ligands for PPAR&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Using a PPRE reporter plasmid in transient transfection experiments, we confirmed the capability of the above 15-LOX products to activate PPAR&#x003b3; in human chondrocytes. We also showed that pretreatment with an irreversible pharmacological PPAR&#x003b3; antagonist GW9662 overcame the inhibitory effect of 13-HODE and 15-HETE on IL-1&#x003b2;-induced MMP release. These results are consistent with previous findings showing that PPAR&#x003b3; activation suppresses MMP production in several cell types, including chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and synovial fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that 13-HODE and 15-HETE suppress IL-1&#x003b2;-induced MMP-1 and MMP-13 by chondrocytes through activation of PPAR&#x003b3;. The expression of MMP-1 and MMP-13 are essentially regulated by the transcription factors activator protein (AP)-1 and nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B), and analysis of the 5'-flanking regions of these genes has demonstrated the presence of numerous putative binding sites for AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. On the other hand, previous studies showed that activation of PPAR&#x003b3; suppresses the transcriptional activity of AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that activation of PPAR&#x003b3; by 13-HODE and 15-HETE reduces transcriptional activity of AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B, leading to diminished production of MMP-1 and MMP-13 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Another possible mechanism through which 13-HODE and 15-HETE may downregulate MMP expression could involve the promotion of mRNA decay. Indeed, 15-LOX metabolites were reported to downmodulate lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-&#x003b1; expression by enhancing mRNA decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Alternatively, 15-LOX products could prevent IL-1&#x003b2;-induced MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression by interfering with key signalling pathways. In this context, 15-LOX metabolites were shown to inhibit protein kinase C activity and translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], and protein kinase C was shown to contribute to MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the suppressive effect of 15-LOX metabolites on MMP-1/MMP-13 expression.

These data suggest that 15-LOXs and their metabolites may have therapeutic promise in OA by preventing the production of cartilage-degrading enzymes.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AP: activator protein; C<sub>T</sub>: threshold cycle; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FCS: fetal calf serum; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HETE: hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid; HODE: hydroxy octadecadienoic acid; IL: interleukin; LOX: lipoxygenase; MMP: matrix metalloproteinase; NF-&#x003ba;B: nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B; OA: osteoarthritis; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; PPAR: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PPRE: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-responsive element; SD: standard deviation; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; UNG: uracil-N-glycosylase.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>NC conceived the study, designed and carried out cell and real-time reverse transcription PCR experiments and some immunohistochemistry experiments.
