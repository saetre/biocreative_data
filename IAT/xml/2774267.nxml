Here we report that hypothalamic expression of CREB-binding protein (CBP) and CBP-binding partner Special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB-1) is highly correlated with lifespan across five strains of mice, and expression of these genes decreases with age and diabetes in mice. Furthermore, in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>cbp-1</italic> is induced by bacterial dilution DR (bDR) and the <italic>daf-2</italic> mutation, and <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi specifically in adults completely blocks lifespan extension by three distinct protocols of DR, partially blocks lifespan extension by the <italic>daf-2</italic> mutation but not of cold, and blocks delay of other age-related pathologies by bDR. Inhibiting the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of SATB-1 and CBP-binding partners <italic>daf-16</italic> and <italic>hsf-1</italic> also attenuates lifespan extension by bDR, but not other protocols of DR. In a transgenic A&#x003b2;42 model of Alzheimer's disease, <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi prevents protective effects of bDR and accelerates A&#x003b2;42-related pathology. Furthermore, consistent with the function of CBP as a histone acetyltransferase, drugs that enhance histone acetylation increase lifespan and reduce A&#x003b2;42-related pathology, protective effects completely blocked by <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi. Other factors implicated in lifespan extension are also CBP-binding partners, suggesting that CBP constitutes a common factor in the modulation of lifespan and disease burden by DR and the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The simple manipulation of dietary restriction (DR) (reduction of caloric intake by about 30&#x00025; in rodents) produces robust increases in lifespan and slows the development of almost all age-related diseases, including cancer and neurological diseases. This relationship between dietary restriction and longevity is observed in most models in which the effect of DR has been tested. Thus, understanding how DR produces its protective mechanisms would have potentially profound implications for the treatment of age-related diseases, including possibly the development of a &#x0201c;magic bullet&#x0201d; for these diseases. In the present study we have discovered that DR induces a transcription factor, CBP, and additional factors that work with CBP to control the expression of other genes involved in determination of lifespan. When we blocked the DR-mediated increase in CBP and associated factors, we blocked all the protective effects of DR on lifespan extension, on the slowed rate of aging, and on protection against pathology in a model of Alzheimer's disease. Further, in mice expression of CBP and a CBP-interacting factor positively predicted lifespan, and expression of both factors decreased with age and in diabetes. Finally, pharmacological manipulations that mimicked enhanced CBP activity increased lifespan and reduced pathology in a model of Alzheimer's disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Elucidation of mechanisms mediating lifespan extension and reduction of disease burden, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, by DR is a major goal of aging research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Mobbs1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Several lines of evidence strongly support that <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi specifically acts by reversing effects of DR on the process of aging. First, it should be noted that <italic>cbp-1</italic>, <italic>daf-16</italic> and <italic>hsf-1</italic> RNAi, and <italic>pha-4</italic> hypomorphism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Panowski1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> reduce lifespan in standard conditions to the same extent, and it is accepted that these latter genes influence lifespan by influencing the process of aging, not by increasing general sickness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Panowski1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Hsu1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. As with <italic>pha-4</italic>, <italic>daf-16</italic>, and <italic>hsf-1</italic> RNAi, the effect of <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi to increase mortality in standard conditions is completely age-dependent, occurring only after midlife, and entails a doubling of the age-dependent acceleration of mortality rate without influencing initial mortality rate, inconsistent with age-independent general sickness. Furthermore, the effect of <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi on lifespan is highly context-dependent, reducing lifespan maximally in the context of DR (any of three protocols), partially in long-lived <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant worms, minimally in standard conditions, and not at all in <italic>daf-16</italic> mutant worms. Conversely, <italic>daf-16</italic> RNAi, which reduces lifespan in standard conditions to the same extent as does <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi, reduces lifespan maximally in long-lived <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant worms and only partly reduces lifespan in the context of DR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Lakowski1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Panowski1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus the same logic that supports the conclusion that <italic>daf-16</italic> and <italic>hsf-1</italic> mediate lifespan extension by the <italic>daf-2</italic> mutation, and that <italic>pha-4</italic> mediates lifespan extension by bDR, would also appear to support the conclusion that <italic>cbp-1</italic> also mediates lifespan extension by bDR. Furthermore, <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi specifically blocks effects of bDR on parameters thought to reflect processes of aging, age-dependent acceleration of mortality rate, resistance to oxidative stress, and specific profile of metabolic and anti-oxidant gene expression. Similarly, <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi accelerates the onset of autofluorescence without reducing total activity, feeding activity, or egg-laying rate, thus meeting criteria previously described for processes specifically impinging on aging rather than general sickness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Samuelson1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, <italic>cbp-1</italic> has been implicated in a genome-wide RNAi screen as one of 41 genes potentially mediating life extension through the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway by influencing the process of aging, not general sickness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Samuelson1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Of particular interest, bDR delays and <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi accelerates the onset of proteotoxicity, just as the <italic>daf-2</italic> mutation and DR delay, and inhibition of <italic>daf-16</italic> and <italic>hsf-1</italic> accelerates, the same toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Steinkraus1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Hsu1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, these data strongly support that <italic>cbp-1</italic> mediates lifespan extension and reduction of age-related pathology by DR.</p><p>Mechanisms linking <italic>cbp-1</italic> expression to increased lifespan and reduced age-related pathology are therefore of great interest. It is suggestive that all genes implicated in the present screens are either CBP or CBP-binding co-activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Nasrin1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Wen1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, transgenic overexpression of <italic>cbp-1</italic> did not significantly increase lifespan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000245.s006">Figure S6</xref>), suggesting that effects of CBP on lifespan requires increased expression of other factors. Uniquely among factors implicated in mediating lifespan extension by DR, RHEB-1 is not known to interact with CBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Honjoh1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. However, RHEB-1 mediates lifespan extension by intermittent fasting-induced longevity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Honjoh1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, which, in contrast to other protocols of DR (including those examined in the present studies), increases lifespan by reducing initial mortality rate, not by reducing age-related acceleration of mortality rate (Yen and Mobbs, unpublished data), a characteristic of lifespan regulation through chemosensory rather than caloric mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Yen2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore hypothesize that CBP-interacting transcriptional complexes (whose composition may depend on DR protocol) mediate protective effects of reduced caloric intake, whereas other mechanisms mediate lifespan extension by chemosensory mechanisms.</p><p>How CBP-interacting transcriptional complexes would act to increase lifespan and reduce age-related pathologies remains to be fully elucidated. An important role for the protective effects of CBP HAT activity is implicated by the observation that HDAC inhibitors, which effectively amplify HAT activity, increase lifespan, an effect completely dependent on <italic>cbp-1</italic> (enhanced by bDR, which increases CBP activity, and completely blocked by <italic>cpb-1</italic> RNAi). Since HAT activity, by increasing histone acetylation, presumably enhances transcriptional flexibility, decreased <italic>cbp</italic> expression with age may contribute to age-related loss of adaptive capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Mobbs6">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, in particular in learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Mouravlev1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, HDAC inhibitors increase lifespan less than does dietary restriction, suggesting that increased HAT activity only partly accounts for the mechanisms by which <italic>cbp</italic> induction by DR increases lifespan. Since <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi also blocks effects of bDR on expression of genes regulating metabolic pathways, we hypothesize that the protective effect of CBP is mediated through these metabolic effects, particularly through a shift from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Mobbs3">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Kwon1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> (SOD isoforms do not appear to play a role in lifespan extension with at least some protocols of DR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000245-Yen3">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>).

Green fluorescence intensity of each worm was measured using software image-J. For movement studies, adult worms that only moved head or tail but failed to move the body upon prodding were considered as immobile and the number of immobile worms was counted daily. The ability to swim in water was quantified as the number of full movement back and forth within 30 s. To assess egg laying, two worms were placed onto a seeded NGM plate and were transferred daily to fresh plates. The number of eggs left on the plate was counted daily. Ten plates were used for each experiment group.</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Analysis of lifespan began with an estimation of the survival curve using the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimate of the survivorship function.

After the non-linear regression determined the values for G, the extra sum-of-squares <italic>F</italic>-test was used to assess significant effects on G values. The analysis was completed using Prism 4 software. For survival studies, statistical significance was determined using Log-rank test. For paraquat studies, paralysis assays, and q-PCR, statistical significance was determined using <italic>t</italic>-tests. For mouse gene expression studies, linear regression was used to determine the correlation between mRNA levels and average lifespan across the five strains of mice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1000245.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Bacterial dilution extended lifespan in </bold><bold><italic>C. elegans</italic></bold><bold>.</bold><italic>E. coli</italic> was prepared at 5&#x0002a;1&#x00030;&#x00302;7, 1&#x00030;&#x00302;8, 2&#x0002a;1&#x00030;&#x00302;8, 5&#x0002a;1&#x00030;&#x00302;8, 1&#x00030;&#x00302;9, 2&#x0002a;1&#x00030;&#x00302;9, 5&#x0002a;1&#x00030;&#x00302;9, and 1&#x00030;&#x00302;10 cells/ml and average lifespan of the <italic>rrf3</italic> worms was measured.</p><p>(2.58 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1000245.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1000245.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>cbp-1</italic></bold><bold> RNAi does not affect the p-pumping rate in N2 worms.</bold> Data are quantified as the number of pharyngeal pumping within 15 s and presented as mean &#x000b1; SEM (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6&#x02013;10/group).</p><p>(2.77 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1000245.s002.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1000245.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p><bold><italic>cbp-1</italic></bold><bold> RNAi does not affect egg laying in N2 worms.</bold> Data are quantified as the number of eggs per day per two worms and presented as mean &#x000b1; SEM (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10/group).</p><p>(2.67 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1000245.s003.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1000245.s004"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><p><bold><italic>cbp-1</italic></bold><bold> RNAi produces DiI staining defect.</bold><italic>rrf3</italic> worms were grown at optimum bacterial concentration and fed with either control bacteria (L4440) or bacteria expressing <italic>cbp-1</italic> dsRNA for 7 d.
