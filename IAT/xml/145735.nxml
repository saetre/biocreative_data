Here, we demonstrate that an integral component of the 20S U5 snRNP is an RNA-dependent ATPase. The ATPase activity of 20S U5 and 25S [U4/U6.U5] snRNPs purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation is strongly stimulated by homopolymeric RNA but not ssDNA. Purified 12S Ul and U2 snRNPs do not exhibit ATPase activity. Moreover, the U5-associated NTPase specifically hydrolyzes ATP and dATP. The additional purification of 20S U5 snRNPs by Mono Q chromatography does not affect the efficiency of ATP hydrolysis. Both U5 and tri-snRNPs bind ATP stoichiometrically in an RNA-independent manner. A candidate ATPase was identified by UV-irradiation of purified snRNPs with radiolabeled ATP. In the presence of homopolymeric RNA, the 200 kDa U5-specific protein is the major crosslinked protein, even in Mono Q-purified U5 snRNPs. The correlation between RNA-dependent ATPase activity in the U5 snRNP and the RNA-dependent onset of this crosslink strongly suggests that the 200 kDa protein is an RNA-dependent ATPase. Furthermore, both the formation of the crosslink and ATPase activity appear with a similar substrate specificity for ATP.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
