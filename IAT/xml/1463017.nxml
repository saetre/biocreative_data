Here we describe the effect of DNA repair molecule Rad18, a component of the post-replication repair pathway, on viral infection. Contrary to our expectations, cells lacking Rad18 were consistently more permissive to viral transduction as compared to Rad18<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> controls. Remarkably, such susceptibility was integration independent, since retroviruses devoid of integration activity also showed enhancement of the initial steps of infection. Moreover, the elevated sensitivity of the Rad18<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells was also observed with adenovirus. These data indicate that Rad18 suppresses viral infection in a non-specific fashion, probably by targeting incoming DNA. Furthermore, considering data published recently, it appears that the interactions between DNA repair components with incoming viruses, often result in inhibition of the infection rather than cooperation toward its establishment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Various cellular factors are thought to interact with invading retroviruses, either assisting the viral proteins or functioning as protecting factors against them.

They also find that such suppressive activity is not restricted only to retroviruses but also concerns adenovirus infection.

This result is seemingly at odds with that observed with the Rad18<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs in which the absence of Rad18 increased the accumulation of viral cDNA. However overexpression of Rad18 likely results in the titration of other components of Rad18-containing complexes, including those that influence retroviral cDNA metabolism. The saturation of these degradation complexes may preclude their contact with the incoming viral DNA and thereby result in the observed increased reverse transcription product accumulation. Nonetheless, both under- or overexpression of Rad18 affect both reverse transcription and infection, and those findings suggest that Rad18 modulates either the reverse transcription reaction or the stability of the reverse transcription product.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Increased Adenovirus Infection in Rad18-Negative Cells</title><p>Because the effect of Rad18 on retroviral infection seemed to involve viral cDNA accumulation, we next asked whether this was due to an effect on reverse transcription or, alternatively, on the degradation of its product.

As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020040-g004">Figure 4</xref>, Rad18<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells are 4- to 5-fold more sensitive to adenovirus infection than Rad18<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> controls (<italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003d; 0.02 and 0.019, respectively). Since adenoviruses replicate independently of reverse transcription and integration, this finding suggests that the Rad18 effect on both adeno- and retro-virus infections is the consequence of a response to the presence of foreign DNA rather than the inhibition of reverse transcription.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Prompted by the interaction of the HIV-1 integrase with DNA repair molecule Rad18 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020040-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, we set out to study the effect of Rad18 on retroviral infection.</p><p>Surprisingly, cells that lack Rad18 were consistently more susceptible to viral infection than their Rad18<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> controls. Moreover, Rad18-negative cells were not only more sensitive to HIV-1, but also to MLV and adenovirus. Notably, the increase of infection efficiency of the Rad18<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells is integration independent, as the effect also occurs using HIV-1 lacking functional integrase. The absence of strong specificity suggests that the apparent anti-viral activity of Rad18 targets a common component in the early phases of infection of all three types of viruses, probably double-stranded DNA. This notion is consistent with the finding that the abundance of viral cDNA product was higher in the Rad18<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. The observation that differences in the accumulation of cDNA become evident after the eighth hour post-infection suggests that Rad18 inhibitory effect may be detectable only when the reverse transcription product has crossed the nuclear envelope and can therefore come in contact with this nuclear protein. Furthermore, this could also explain some of the earlier phenotypes observed in the original RAD18<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> embryonic stem cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020040-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. In these cells, a substantial increase in the number of stable transfectants was observed, an outcome that could reflect an altered fate of the incoming DNA</p><p>The fact that a DNA repair protein such as Rad18 suppresses retroviral infection instead of aiding its establishment is only partially counterintuitive. Indeed, studies in yeast have reported that a number of molecules involved in DNA repair and genome stability have an inhibitory effect on retrotransposition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020040-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020040-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, studies in mammalian cells suggest a protective role for DNA repair molecules against viruses. Rad52, a constituent of the HR system important in the repair of double-strand breaks, has recently been reported to suppress HIV-1 infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020040-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, as have nucleotide excision repair helicases XPB and XPD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020040-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020040-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; is thought to involve a rapid degradation of reverse transcribed viral cDNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020040-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;, and this is proposed to be the result of the sequential activity of enzymes such as UNG2 and APE1, both components of the base excision repair DNA repair pathway. Finally, formation of retroviral DNA circles, promoted by components of the non-homologous end joining for the two&#x02013;long terminal repeat (2LTR) circles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020040-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, and the HR Mre11 for the one&#x02013;long terminal repeat (1LTR) circles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020040-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, could be considered the result of an anti-viral activity by these two DNA repair pathways, rather than merely infection byproducts.</p><p>In principle, one might therefore consider DNA repair molecules as components of a broader intrinsic immunity to viruses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020040-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Within the preintegration phase of retroviral infection, for example, several steps are potential targets for intracellular immunity. The APOBEC3G system targets the nascent retroviral cDNA; Rad52, XPB, XPD, and Rad18 may target the linear cDNA, potentially mediating its degradation; and finally, non-homologous end joining and Mre11 induce the circularization of the remaining viral genome, preventing it from being a substrate for integration. Many of the mechanisms involved are still unclear, but the emerging picture is that the maintenance of genome integrity by DNA repair systems has significant consequences for viral parasitism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and cell lines.</title><p>Rad18<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Rad18<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> MEFs established from Rad18<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> knockout and Rad18<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice were described earlier &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020040-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

Infections were carried out overnight and, in the case of the retroviruses, in the presence of 8 &#x003bc;g/ml of polybrene. About 44 h after infection, cells were trypsinized, fixed with PBS 3&#x00025; formaldehyde (Tousimis, Rockville, Maryland, United States), and analyzed for EGFP expression by flow cytometry using FACScalibour instrument (Becton Dickinson, Palo Alto, California, United States); 20,000 events were acquired per sample.</p><p>For transfection/infection experiments, Hela cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Rad18-IRES-HcRed or IRES-HcRed only, as control, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were infected with serial dilutions of HIV-1&#x02013;derived EGFP reporter virus. After 48 h, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and infection was determined as the percentage of HcRed-positive cells expressing the viral-derived EGFP reporter molecule.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Quantitative PCR.</title><p>Rad18<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Rad18<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> MEFs were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 40,000 cells/well. The following day, cells were infected with VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 integration-deficient reporter virus previously treated with 150 units/ml of DNase I (Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States) for 30 min at 37 &#x000b0;C. Infections were carried out for 4 h in the presence of 8 &#x003bc;g/ml of polybrene, then cells were rinsed with PBS and fed with complete medium. Cells were harvested at time points 4-, 8-, 12-, and 24-h post-infection, pelleted, and frozen at &#x02212;70 &#x000b0;C. In the case of the transfection/infection experiments, Rad18-IRES-HcRed and IRES-HcRed control transfected cells were infected with DNase I&#x02013;treated VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 integration-deficient reporter virus. Twelve and twenty hours post-infection, HcRed-positive cells were sorted with MoFlo cell sorter (Cytomation, Fort Collins, Colorado, United States), pelleted, and frozen at &#x02212;70 &#x000b0;C. Total genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Blood kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States) and eluted in 100-&#x003bc;l final volume; 2 &#x003bc;l of each sample were used in order to perform QPCR. Primers used for the detection of late reverse transcription products were the following: primer 1002 91&#x02013;119 TCTCTGGCTAACTAGGGAAC and 950 339&#x02013;320 GCCGCCCCTCGCCTCTTG. Reporter fluorophore for the labeling of double-stranded DNA product was SYBR green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon, United States) and reactions and acquisitions were performed using ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States) and 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Normalization was accomplished by measuring the DNA concentration of each sample using PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Reagent (Molecular Probes) following manufacturers instructions. Data are presented as number of late reverse transcription molecules per nanogram of total genomic DNA.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting
