Here, we characterize the role of KLF14, as a TGF&#x003b2;-inducible, non-Smad protein that silences the TGF&#x003b2; receptor II (<italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic>) promoter. Together with endocytosis, transcriptional silencing is a critical mechanism for down-regulating TGF&#x003b2; receptors at the cell surface. However, the mechanisms underlying transcriptional repression of these receptors remain poorly understood. KLF14 has been chosen from a comprehensive screen of 24 members of the Sp/KLF family due to its TGF&#x003b2; inducibility, its ability to regulate the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter, and the fact that this protein had yet to be functionally characterized. We find that KLF14 represses the TGF&#x003b2;RII, a function that is augmented by TGF&#x003b2; treatment. Mapping of the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter, in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, electromobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, have identified distinct GC-rich sequences used by KLF14 to regulate this promoter. Mechanistically, KLF14 represses the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter via a co-repressor complex containing mSin3A and HDAC2. Furthermore, the TGF&#x003b2; pathway activation leads to recruitment of a KLF14-mSin3A-HDAC2 repressor complex to the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter, as well as the remodeling of chromatin to increase histone marks that associate with transcriptional silencing. Thus, these results describe a novel negative-feedback mechanism by which TGF&#x003b2;RII activation at the cell surface induces the expression of KLF14 to ultimately silence the TGF&#x003b2;RII and further expand the network of non-Smad transcription factors that participate in the TGF&#x003b2; pathway.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>We dedicate this manuscript to the memory of Kazimierz Truty and to all the other patients who have succumbed to pancreatic cancer.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>DK 52913</grant-num>.

Consequently, alterations in these pathways lead to severe malformations and diseases, including cancer. TGF&#x003b2; is the best characterized pathway within this family of cytokines. Recent studies reveal, for instance, the existence of two types of membrane-to-nucleus TGF&#x003b2; signaling mechanisms, namely the Smad-dependent and non-Smad protein-mediated cascades, although evidence of cross-talk between these two cascades is also emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Therefore, even though our understanding of the complexity underlying TGF&#x003b2; signaling continues to grow, classification into these two types of mechanisms has helped to organize the nascent theoretical framework for advancing this field of research by the integration of new findings into easily understandable paradigms.</p><p>The canonical Smad-mediated TGF&#x003b2; pathway is activated by binding of TGF&#x003b2;1, -2, and/or -3 cytokines to the TGF&#x003b2;RII, which then dimerizes with and activates the TGF&#x003b2; receptor I through serine phosphorylation of the regulatory GS-domain. The Type I receptor, in turn, phosphorylates receptor-bound Smad (Smad2/3) at the C-terminal S<italic>X</italic>S motif, releasing them from retention in the cytoplasm and allowing their translocation into the nucleus. Smad4 acts as a common partner of activated Smads to help execute their function. In this manner, TGF&#x003b2; signaling is transduced through the cytoplasm into the nucleus to form complexes with distinct transcriptional regulators for specific gene promoters.</p><p>The role of non-Smad protein-mediated pathways in the regulation of TGF&#x003b2; signaling is also an active line of investigation. For instance, the Sp/KLF family of proteins is emerging as important non-Smad protein-mediated pathway cascades and, under certain circumstances, a cross-talk regulator with Smads to achieve distinct cellular functions. Sp1 is the founding member this expanding group of Sp/KLF proteins. The structure of these proteins is defined by the presence of three highly conserved and homologous C-terminal Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub> zinc finger domains, which are responsible for DNA binding, and a variable N-terminal domain, which is responsible for transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). However, the identification and characterization of this family of proteins has revealed that many bind to GC-rich target sequences similar, if not identical to, the &#x0201c;Sp1 sites&#x0201d; through which they can either activate or repress gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Therefore, the discovery of repressors within this Sp/KLF family of transcriptional regulators has challenged the early paradigm that Sp1 activates all GC-rich sites. As a result, these Sp/KLF transcriptional repressors provide a novel mechanism for silencing a large number of genes that are already known to be activated by Sp1, particularly in response to TGF&#x003b2;.</p><p><italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> has been previously shown to be activated by Sp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). However, since these elegant studies were done, 24 Sp/KLF transcription factors have been discovered with some members acting as activators while others as repressors via the same type of GC-rich <italic>cis</italic> regulatory sequences used by Sp1. Thus, some Sp/KLF transcription factors are excellent candidates that may play a role in silencing of <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic>. Indeed, fortunately, in the current study, we describe, for the first time, the functional characterization of KLF14 as a novel non-Smad regulatory protein of the TGF&#x003b2; pathway. Our results outline a novel, biochemically significant role for KLF14 in the silencing of the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> via Sp/KLF sites. This pathway provides a well characterized example of how Sp/KLF proteins are emerging as important non-Smad proteins that can directly regulate TGF&#x003b2; signaling by regulating the expression of key molecules from this pathway.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Cell Culture</italic>&#x02014;Tissue culture reagents were purchased from commercial sources (Invitrogen).

Interestingly, although the activation of TGF&#x003b2;RII promoter, in particular by Sp1, has received precise attention, how this receptor is repressed remains poorly understood. Consequently, the major goal of the current study has been to characterize the role of a specific family of non-Smad proteins (Sp/KLF transcription factors), which may functionally explain the down-regulation <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> through GC-rich Sp1-like sequences. Our studies began with examination of the transcriptional activity of the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> gene promoter in PANC1 epithelial cells, a widely used model for studying TGF&#x003b2; signaling. We have performed an initial series of reporter assays using full-length <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> and the previously described, TGF&#x003b2;-sensitive, 263-bp core promoter, which is located 5&#x02032; of the transcriptional start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Treatment of PANC1 cells with exogenous TGF&#x003b2;1 leads to a marked reduction in activity of the full-length <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> reporter when compared with untreated control cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). This silencing effect is recapitulated in the 263-bp <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> core promoter, suggesting that both the previously described activation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) and the negative transcriptional regulatory mechanism characterized further here (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), are operational at this core promoter level. Using bioinformatics analyses (TRANSFAC Public), we have identified five putative Sp/KLF binding sites within this TGF&#x003b2;-sensitive, 263-bp core promoter region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Four of these sites (<italic>#1&#x02013;4</italic>) have been previously identified, although an additional site (<italic>#5</italic>) has not been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). Some of these previously identified sites have been shown to be activated by Sp1. However, whether novel Sp/KLF silencer proteins can also bind to this sequence to reverse the activation by Sp1 remained unknown. Therefore, this analysis has led us to the hypothesis that a yet undefined Sp/KLF repressor protein plays a role in the silencing of this promoter.</p><p><italic>Novel TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>-inducible Non-Smad, Sp/KLF Proteins Are Identified as Candidate Regulators of the Type II TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>-receptor</italic>&#x02014; To test our hypothesis, we have developed a four-tier screening approach. This approach includes first, testing which of the 24 known Sp/KLF proteins are expressed in TGF&#x003b2;-sensitive epithelial cells and, thus, can be considered initial candidates to target the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter. Our experimental cell model, PANC1, a human epithelial cell line, is an optimal model for our studies, because they have adequate expression of <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> mRNA and display growth inhibition to exogenous TGF&#x003b2;1 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). In addition, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>, each of the 24 known <italic>Sp/KLF</italic> transcription factors are consistently expressed in these cells, which made it ideal for performing a comprehensive screen. Second, we determine whether any <italic>Sp/KLF</italic> genes are TGF&#x003b2;-inducible with a kinetic that is consistent with playing a role in the down-regulation of the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic>. Third, by utilizing transfection studies combined with reporter assays, we test the potential of distinct members of this family to repress <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter activity and then, by electromobility shift assays, determine which sites on the promoter are utilized by our candidate KLF protein. Finally, we examine whether the repressor that is isolated according to these criteria binds to the endogenous <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> gene and can remodel chromatin on this target, suggesting the bona fide target status of the candidate KLF protein. Thus, by applying this comprehensive screening, our study has been robust in evaluating the KLF protein family in the TGF&#x003b2; response and regulation of the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic>.</p><p>The genomic axiom that functionally related genes follow a similar pattern of expression suggested that, hypothetically, the protein that represses the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> may be expressed in a similar manner after TGF&#x003b2; treatment, in particular, during the repression response to this cytokine. Consequently, we have evaluated which, if any, of these <italic>Sp/KLF</italic> members are inducible by TGF&#x003b2;1 treatment. Thus, using RNA from PANC1 cells either untreated or treated with TGF&#x003b2;1, we have performed RT-PCR at various time points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). As a positive control for TGF&#x003b2;-mediated transcriptional induction, we monitor the expression of <italic>p21</italic>, a known TGF&#x003b2;-inducible gene within the pathway. Of the 24 known <italic>Sp/KLF</italic> transcription factors, we have identified 7 that were markedly induced with exogenous TGF&#x003b2;1 treatment, suggesting that these could be potential candidate transcriptional repressors of the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). These results are not only consistent with our previous work, which identified <italic>KLF11</italic> as a TGF&#x003b2;-inducible gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), but, more importantly, it characterizes previously unidentified <italic>KLF</italic> targets for this cascade, namely <italic>KLF4, -5, -7, -9, -14</italic>, and <italic>-15</italic>. Thus, based upon their expression patterns, these seven genes are good candidates to further investigate their regulation of the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><italic>A</italic>, eight pancreatic cancer cell lines were screened by RT-PCR for expression of 24 members of the <italic>Sp/KLF</italic> family of transcription factors.

Out of these, five candidates induced a marked decrease in <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter activity, namely KLF4, -7, -11, -14, and -15 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). KLF5 did not affect <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter activity above control levels, whereas KLF9 appeared to slightly activate this promoter, therefore these two proteins were not continued in subsequent experiments due to our objective of identifying <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> repressors. To confirm whether this observed repression of <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter regulation is consistent with TGF&#x003b2; pathway activation, these five proteins were further tested in PANC1 cells treated with exogenous TGF&#x003b2;1 treatment. Interestingly, upon treatment, these KLF proteins were capable of further repressing <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter activity, with the largest repression achieved by KLF14 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). These data also indicate that a second TGF&#x003b2;-dependent mechanism, directly (signal-induced KLF expression or post-translational modifications) or indirectly (induction of another transcription factor), cooperates with KLF proteins to additionally repress this gene. Upon increasing concentrations of <italic>KLF14</italic> cDNA in transfection studies, we found a concentration-dependent repression of the core TGF&#x003b2;RII promoter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). Together, these results strongly identify KLF14 as a good candidate to be a regulator of <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter activity and expression.</p><p><italic>KLF14, a Novel Non-Smad Protein, Regulates the Type II TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>-receptor</italic>&#x02014;The gene encoding KLF14 has been previously identified by our group and named <italic>BTEB5</italic> due to its sequence similarities to members of this subfamily of KLF silencing proteins.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7">5</xref> Although, recently, genetic studies have reported the genomic structure, intronless nature, and potential imprinted status of this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>), a functional characterization of this protein at the cellular and biochemical level has never been performed. Because our data indicate that KLF14 appears to be a potent regulator of the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> in promoter assays combined with this existing gap in knowledge on this KLF family member and its targets, the choice to further investigate the role of this particular KLF in TGF&#x003b2;RII regulation would significantly expand the current knowledge on the functional properties of members of this family.</p><p>Noteworthy, we have validated these <italic>in vitro</italic> reporter results <italic>in vivo</italic> by assessing whether this protein has a regulatory effect on endogenous TGF&#x003b2;RII levels in PANC1 cells. Initial correlative experiments demonstrate that the levels of <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> mRNA levels decrease at a time in which the amount of KLF14 increases (repression phase of the bimodal expression pattern of <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> in response to TGF&#x003b2;), raising the possibility that <italic>KLF14</italic> is induced to subsequently down-regulate the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). To mechanistically support this correlation, we have performed RT-PCR on cells overexpressing KLF14 to determine TGF&#x003b2;RII levels in comparison to mock transfected cells in the presence or absence of exogenous TGF&#x003b2;1 stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). KLF14 overexpression alone is sufficient to decrease TGF&#x003b2;RII mRNA, interestingly to the same extent as TGF&#x003b2;1 stimulation alone. Furthermore, subsequent TGF&#x003b2;1 treatment in cells transfected with <italic>KLF14</italic> leads to further down-regulation of TGF&#x003b2;RII transcripts. Because <italic>KLF14</italic> is a TGF&#x003b2;-inducible gene, the further decrease in <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> mRNA levels observed upon TGF&#x003b2;1 treatment likely results from the induction of endogenous <italic>Sp/KLF</italic> transcription factors by this cytokine. These results suggest that TGF&#x003b2; down-regulates <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> transcripts through <italic>KLF14</italic> expression with subsequent negative regulation of promoter activity. Next, we have tested whether the effect of KLF14 on <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> expression interfered with TGF&#x003b2;-induced signals that target downstream genes, such as <italic>p21</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>).

These results suggest that KLF14 interferes with the activation of downstream TGF&#x003b2;signaling effects, at least in part, by its ability to repress the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic>.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><italic>A, TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> and <italic>KLF14</italic> transcript levels were analyzed by determination of density, and relative transcript levels were represented by the ratio <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> cDNA/<italic>GAPDH</italic> cDNA and <italic>KLF14</italic> cDNA/<italic>GAPDH</italic> cDNA.

In this experiment, radiolabeled oligonucleotides for each of the 5 Sp1 sites have been created as well as mutants for each site containing either 2- or 4-nucleotide substitutions (mut#1 or mut#2, respectively) within the GC-rich binding sequence. Sp1-consensus oligonucleotides and respective mutants have been used as internal binding controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref><italic>, lanes 1&#x02013;3</italic>). The interaction between a recombinant KLF14 zinc finger DNA-binding domain and four of the Sp/KLF site probes (<italic>#1&#x02013;3</italic> and <italic>5</italic>) is specific as indicated by the fact that an excess of unlabeled probe competes with the radiolabeled probes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref><italic>, lanes 7</italic> and <italic>8</italic>). Furthermore, we were able to abolish this binding by using antibodies against the recombinant KLF protein (anti-GST antibody), thus confirming specificity of the complex (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref><italic>, lane 9</italic>). Further specificity is evidenced by the impaired ability of recombinant KLF14 protein to bind to mutated Sp/KLF probes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref><italic>, lanes 5</italic> and <italic>6</italic>). Visible but reduced binding is noted with the 2-bp mutant probes (mut#1, <italic>lane 5</italic>) for sites #1&#x02013;3, however a significant loss of binding was observed with the 4-bp mutant probes (mut#2, <italic>lane 6</italic>) at all sites. Moreover, through addition of recombinant Sp1 protein to the reaction, an increase in the concentration of Sp1 diminished the binding of KLF14, demonstrating that KLF14 and Sp1 compete for these GC-rich binding sites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref><italic>, lanes 10</italic> and <italic>11</italic>), complementing the competition results we observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Only a weak complex was visualized with site #4, indicating that this site was less specific for KLF14 binding than the other four sites.</p><p>To functionally complement these studies, we have performed <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> reporter assays with both wild-type and mutant promoter-luciferase constructs. Site-directed mutagenesis has been utilized to create a 2-nucleotide substitution in each of the 5 GC-rich Sp/KLF sites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>). These assays resulted in a marked loss of the repression observed with the wild-type <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter upon KLF14 overexpression with mutation in Sp/KLF sites #1, 2, 3, and 5, particularly with a significant gain of transcriptional activity upon mutating site #1. These findings demonstrate that these four are operational to silence the transcriptional activity of the TGF&#x003b2;RII promoter by KLF14. Furthermore, we did not observe a significant loss of repression with mutation of site #4 with KLF14 overexpression, which supports our finding of negligible binding of KLF14 to this specific Sp/KLF site (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). All together, KLF14 appears to bind and act on four of the GC-rich sites of the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter to repress its transcriptional activity, and this occurs through a mechanism that includes, at least in part, competition with Sp1.</p><p><italic>Repression of the TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII Gene by KLF14 Occurs via Mechanisms Involving Chromatin-modifying Enzymes</italic>&#x02014;Careful examination of KLF14 sequence reveals a 26-amino acid domain that is highly similar to repression domains of KLF9 (BTEB1), KLF13 (BTEB3), and KLF16 (BTEB4) proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>), which we have previously shown to repress transcription by recruiting Sin3a via its paired amphipathic helix 2 domain, as well as HDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). Interestingly, other studies have found that HDAC inhibition leads to transcriptional activation of the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter in various cancer cell lines, raising the possibility that a repressor of this type may be operational to achieve this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). Thus, we have tested whether KLF14 does indeed interact with Sin3a and HDAC by immunoprecipitating full-length FLAG-tagged KLF14 from PANC1 cells. The presence of Sin3a and HDAC complexed to KLF14 is detected by Western-blot analysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). Thus, these results indicate that KLF14 interacts with Sin3a and HDAC in mammalian cells, implying that these proteins are part of a repressor complex. Subsequently, we have investigated whether this repressor complex occupies the endogenous <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> via ChIP assays. First, we find that KLF14 indeed binds to the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). Moreover, congruent with our data using promoter assays (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>), treatment with TGF&#x003b2;1 increases the amount of KLF14 bound to the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter. In addition, the treatment with TGF&#x003b2;1 coincides with the appearance of Sin3a on the same region of the promoter as KLF14, further implicating this repressor complex in the mechanism of KLF14 repression of the TGF&#x003b2;RII promoter (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref>). To gain insight into the type of chromatin remodeling that accompanies KLF14 and Sin3a occupation, we also have performed ChIP using antibodies to various histone marks. Interestingly, we find that, under native conditions, acetylated histones H3 and H4 are present on the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter; however, upon TGF&#x003b2;1 treatment, these fall to negligible levels, indicating a change from a transcriptionally &#x0201c;active,&#x0201d; acetylated state to a relatively &#x0201c;inactive,&#x0201d; non-acetylated state (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref>). Moreover, we observe that, although methylated K20 H4, a mark of repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>), is not present under native conditions, it occupies the promoter upon TGF&#x003b2;1 treatment along with Sin3a (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref>). These types of experiments are in agreement with the &#x0201c;histone code hypothesis&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>), revealing that the state of chromatin in the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter appears to switch from &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;repressed&#x0201d; upon KLF14 occupation after treatment with TGF&#x003b2;1, all consistent with the idea that KLF14 binds to the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter to cause repression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). Therefore, both competition with Sp1 and direct repression via the N-terminal domain, are likely to behave as a dual mechanism of repression that would make it more difficult to reverse than if one of them was operational. This redundancy would ensure that the promoter remains silent even under circumstances that inactivate either of the single mechanisms (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><italic>A</italic>, alignment displaying the 26-amino acid Sin3-interacting domain of KLF14 similar to other KLF repressors, KLF9, KLF13, and KLF16. <italic>B</italic>, HDAC2 and mSin3a form a complex with KLF14 <italic>in vivo</italic>.

For instance, the data reported here represent the first functional characterization of the KLF14 protein, outline a novel pathway for the silencing of the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter, provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which these phenomena are achieved, and report additional TGF&#x003b2;-inducible, KLF proteins that are good candidates to regulate this promoter. These findings are of significant relevance to the areas of KLF proteins, TGF&#x003b2; signaling, the maintenance of cell homeostasis, and their potential contribution to disease states.</p><p>TGF&#x003b2;1 ligand itself may play a role in regulating signaling by down-regulating the cell surface receptor and thus abrogating downstream messages. Others have also shown that the TGF&#x003b2; receptors are under autoregulation control by ligand stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). It has been previously shown that treatment with TGF&#x003b2;1 leads to down-regulation of TGF&#x003b2;RII levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Derynck and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>) have previously described a process in osteoblastic differentiation in which at first there is a marked up-regulation of TGF&#x003b2;1 and sensitivity followed by marked down-regulation of receptors and insensitivity to TGF&#x003b2;1. Furthermore, recent <italic>in vitro</italic> studies on the biosynthesis of the receptors indicate that the half-life of TGF&#x003b2;RII is &#x0223c;60 min and is further reduced to 45 min in the presence of exogenous TGF&#x003b2;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). Therefore, understanding how this down-regulation of the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter occurs is of primary biological importance for better understanding TGF&#x003b2; signaling.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Model of KLF14-mediated TGF&#x003b2;RII silencing.</bold> Activation of the TGF&#x003b2;RII would occur via TGF&#x003b2;1 ligand initiating an up-regulation of the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter by Sp1. In our model, activation of the TGF&#x003b2; pathway also causes an induction of <italic>KLF14</italic> expression (<italic>A</italic>), which would, in turn, bind to the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter through its GC-rich sites (<italic>B</italic>), competing away Sp1 (<italic>C</italic>), recruiting the Sin3a/HDAC complex (<italic>D</italic>), and remodeling chromatin from a transcriptionally &#x0201c;active,&#x0201d; acetylated state to an &#x0201c;inactive&#x0201d; state with silencing methyl marks (<italic>E</italic>). Thus, KLF14 mediates a negative feedback loop to down-regulate the type II TGF&#x003b2; receptor upon TGF&#x003b2; stimulation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0110966890007"></graphic></fig></p><p>In this regard, the current study reports several novel observations of significant biochemical relevance for extending our knowledge of TGF&#x003b2; signaling regulation by non-Smad proteins. For instance, this study represents the first functional characterization of KLF14 as a novel TGF&#x003b2;-inducible repressor protein that mediates silencing of the TGF&#x003b2;RII, and the mechanisms by which this phenomenon occurs, in particular the role of corepressors and chromatin modifications on the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter. Previous promoter studies have primarily focused on the role of Sp1 in the activation of this promoter. However, recent studies have uncovered a paradoxical behavior for this promoter, namely that histone deacetylase inhibitors are needed to activate this promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). These data point to the existence of a repressive state of this promoter, which is less likely to be regulated by Sp1 but rather by Sp/KLF repressors of the type previously described by our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). However, in the current study, rather than looking for a candidate gene within the family of KLF repressors, we have performed an unbiased screening for the TGF&#x003b2; inducibility of each of the 24 KLF transcription factors and find that <italic>KLF14</italic> is up-regulated upon TGF&#x003b2; treatment and also can efficiently repress the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic>. Interestingly, we demonstrate that there is a strong inverse correlation between expression patterns in a temporal manner of TGF&#x003b2;RII mRNA and KLF14 mRNA in human pancreatic cancer cells. Expression of exogenous KLF14 decreases the level of transcription from the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter, implying a repressive role for KLF14 in <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> expression.</p><p>Further analysis reveals the mechanism by which this protein works, indicating that KLF14 is a member of the Sin3-dependent KLF repressors. This is important in light of there being two types of repressors in this family as recently reviewed by us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>), the Sin3a-dependent proteins, which include KLF9, -10, -11, -16, and now -14, and the CtBP-dependent proteins, such as KLF3 and -8. This knowledge can now be very useful for performing rapid screening of the proteins that may be acting as repressors of particular genes, besides the traditional HDAC inhibitor experiments. This screening, we propose, can utilize siRNA to either target CtBP or Sin3a. An abolition of the silencing activity would then rapidly focus the investigations on a reduced number of candidates belonging to each of these groups. In addition to the recruitment of a KLF14-mSin3A-HDAC2 repressor complex to the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter, we observed a concurrent remodeling of chromatin, which involves loss of transcriptionally &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; acetylated histone marks and an increase in histone marks that associate with transcriptional silencing. Finally, we defined binding sites involved in KLF14-mediated repression of the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter, namely sites -143/138 (#1), -101/-95 (#2), -59/52 (#3) and -11/-5 (#5), which are consistent with previously reported Sp1 sites, and these same sites, when mutated, lose the repressive effect of KLF14.</p><p>Overall, however, the major relevance of this study is the fact that it contributes to organize our thoughts on how TGF&#x003b2; signaling is regulated. It has recently been appropriately proposed to classify these mechanisms by whether they are directly mediated by Smads (the best studied to date) or those less understood events regulated by non-Smad proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). In fact, our laboratory has previously described a role for KLF repressors, namely KLF10 (TIEG1) and KLF11 (TIEG2), as non-Smad effectors of the TGF&#x003b2; response in cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). Now, due to the findings reported in the current study, we can propose a model wherein TGF&#x003b2; cytokines activate and repress the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic> promoter using the very same GC-rich sites utilized by this family of proteins. Activation would occur in an initial phase via Sp1, whereas inhibition would follow activation and require the action of KLF14, competition of Sp1, recruitment of Sin3a, HDAC, and distinct chromatin modifications on the promoter (see model in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Therefore, KLF14 becomes another important non-Smad protein, in which at least one of its functions is to silence the <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;<italic>RII</italic>. This novel transcriptional pathway thus becomes an important step for modulating the activity of TGF&#x003b2; signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M807791200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M807791200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Zavadil, J., and Bottinger, E.
