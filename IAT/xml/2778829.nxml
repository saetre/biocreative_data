The importance of HRI in regulating hemoglobin synthesis in erythroid cells makes it an attractive molecular target in need of further characterization.

Introduction</title><p>Heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) is an eIF2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> kinase, which belongs to the eIF2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> kinase subfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] that includes the double-stranded RNA-dependent eIF2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> kinase (PKR), the general control of nitrogen metabolism kinase (GCN2), and them endoplasmic reticulum resident kinase, PKR-related kinase (PERK), which is identical to the enzyme pancreatic eIF2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> kinase (PEK) that is highly expressed in pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Sequence comparison between HRI and other eIF2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> kinases reveals that the eIF2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> kinases share some degree of homology in their kinase catalytic domains. However, between the N- and C-lobes HRI has a distinct kinase insert that contains a heme binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Kinase activity of HRI is modulated by binding of heme to the heme-binding domains located at its kinase insert and the amino terminus. As an eIF2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> kinase, HRI specifically phosphorylates eIF2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> at residue Serine 51 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], blocking GTP exchange required for the recycling of eIF2, and thus inhibits protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Because HRI is predominantly expressed in erythroid cells, HRI exerts its kinase activity to regulate the synthesis of hemoglobin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. </p><p>Phenotypic changes in HRI knockout mice show that HRI is nonessential, but plays an important regulatory role by dictating hemoglobin synthesis in erythroid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Notably, in the absence of HRI kinase activity, reticulocytes obtained from <italic>HRI</italic>-deficient mice had a higher rate of protein synthesis. The importance of HRI in the pathophysiology of heme-deficiency disorders such as anemia of iron deficiency, protoporphyria, and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-thalassemia has been recently shown in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. </p><p>Interestingly, HRI does not exist in yeast, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It is postulated that HRI has evolved during the development of the circulation to meet the increasing demand for oxygen in larger organisms. Alignment of the amino acids of HRI from human, mouse, rat, and rabbit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] reveals that HRI is conserved throughout evolution among these mammals with approximately 77% identity and 83% homology. Because of the importance of HRI in regulating hemoglobin synthesis in mammals, we sought to evaluate the feasibility of using the canine as a model for studying the homeostasis of erythropoiesis. The canine HRI was cloned, expressed by in vitro transcription and translation in wheat germ lysate and also in baculovirus protein expression system and then compared to the murine and human HRI proteins by its functional activity and inhibition by a kinase inhibitor. Additionally, the function of HRI on protein synthesis was evaluated in canine blood with the kinase inhibitor, quercetin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2.

The pFastBac transfer vector, in which the canine HRI cDNA was inserted, was transformed into DH10Bac competent cells containing bacmid DNA and a helper plasmid.

The canine HRI protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by Western blotting using a mouse anti-histidine primary antibody at 1:1000 (Clontech, Mountain View, Calif, USA) and a secondary anti-mouse HRP conjugated antibody at 1:10,000 (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Ill, USA) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence using the Amersham Enhanced Chemiluminescence Plus Western blotting detection system (GE Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.7"><title>2.7.

AlphaScreen donor and acceptor beads were then added to the reaction mix according to the manufacturer's protocol (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, Mass, USA).

Results</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec3.1"><title>3.1. Cloning and Sequence Comparison of Canine HRI cDNA with other mammalian HRI</title><p>To decide which canine tissues to use for cloning canine HRI cDNA, we performed RT-PCR for HRI using human liver, kidney, lymph node or spleen (Clontech, Mountain View, Calif, USA). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>, HRI was detected in liver, lymph node, and spleen, but not detected in the kidney. Because previous reports demonstrated that HRI is predominantly expressed in erythroid-derived cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], we presume that the presence of peripheral blood in the tissues allowed for the detection of HRI. Based on the tissue expression results of the human HRI we decided to clone the canine HRI from canine spleen.</p><p>To clone canine HRI cDNA, we prepared total RNA from canine spleen followed by first strand cDNA synthesis using oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA was used in RT-PCR with cloning primers designed based on the canine genomic sequence corresponding to the human HRI sequence. A PCR fragment of the expected 1925 bp was amplified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>). The resulting fragment was sequenced and confirmed to be the canine HRI (GenBank Accession Number FJ911905), showing 86% identity in nucleotide sequence to the human, 82% identity to the mouse and 81% identity to the rat HRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>). At the amino acid level the canine protein shows 83% identity to the human HRI sequence (NM_014413) and 81% to the mouse (NM_013557) and rat HRI (NM_013223) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(d)</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(e)</xref>, the canine sequence shows only 1 amino acid difference in the ATP-binding site compared to the human sequence. The high conservation in the residues involved in ATP binding between the human, canine and rodent proteins is consistent with the functional importance of HRI and its conservation throughout evolution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. Expression of Canine HRI Protein by TNT</title><p>To express canine HRI protein, the canine HRI cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA4 vector for expression by TNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>). After the pcDNA4-HRI was restriction enzyme digested with NotI, the linearized DNA was incubated with wheat germ lysate and [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine to produce the radiolabeled canine HRI protein by TNT. The resulting translated products were analyzed on a 4&#x02013;20% Tris-glycine gel followed by autoradiography. We found that the canine HRI protein yield was very low using standard TNT reaction conditions (data not shown). When 0.5 mM hemin was included in the TNT reaction mix, the yield of the canine protein was increased by ~5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The enhanced production of HRI by heme strongly suggests a functional form of canine HRI is expressed from the cloned canine HRI cDNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec3.3"><title>3.3. Expression of Canine HRI Proteins by Baculovirus Expression System</title><p>Since the majority of canine HRI protein produced by TNT was found to be misfolded and/or aggregated and exhibited very low kinase activity, we decided to express the canine HRI using an insect expression system. The canine HRI cDNA was inserted into the pFastBac vector and transformed into DH10Bac cells. After confirming that the canine HRI bacmid DNA contains the canine HRI cDNA insert by restriction digestion analysis, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>), the bacmid DNA was transfected into Sf9 cells to produce recombinant canine HRI baculovirus. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>, 48 hours postinfection of Sf9 cells with canine HRI baculovirus, a band of the expected molecular weight of 72 kD corresponding to the canine HRI, was isolated, following expression and purification by His6 affinity chromatography. Since this 72 kD protein bound to nickel affinity matrix and was specifically recognized by antibodies against either histidine (6xHis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>) or HRI (data not shown) epitopes, we concluded that this was the canine HRI. Similar to the expression of canine HRI protein by TNT, we found that canine HRI baculovirus infection resulted in low expression of the HRI protein if hemin was not included in the cell culture medium. When hemin at 0.5 mM was included, canine HRI protein expression in the baculovirus expression system was substantially increased. The human, mouse, rat, and canine proteins were expressed using the baculovirus expression system and used in comparison studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec3.4"><title>3.4. Kinase Activity of the Canine HRI Protein</title><p>To determine if the purified canine HRI protein is enzymatically active, we performed a kinase activity assay by measuring the ability of the kinase to phosphorylate a peptide substrate. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the canine HRI protein was able to effectively phosphorylate the peptide substrate. To investigate whether the high degree of homology in the ATP-binding site of canine, human, and rodent HRI results in similar binding of an ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor, we used a known human HRI kinase inhibitor, quercetin ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and our published data). Quercetin, reported to be an ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], was tested at various concentrations from 0.01 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M to 100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M against canine, human, and mouse HRI shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. We found that similar to human and mouse HRI, canine HRI kinase was inhibited with IC<sub>50</sub> values equal to ~1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M by quercetin, demonstrating that among mammalian HRI, ATP-binding and catalysis are conserved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec3.5"><title>3.5. Role of HRI in De Novo Protein Synthesis</title><p>To determine the effect of HRI inhibition by quercetin on protein synthesis, we treated canine blood with either 1 or 10 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M quercetin for 4 hours in the presence of [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Quercetin, at a concentration of 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M, did not change total de novo synthesis in canine blood. However, treatment of canine blood with 10 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M quercetin caused a significant increase in de novo protein synthesis compared to the vehicle control. Because HRI is specifically expressed in erythroid cells and ~95% of de novo protein synthesis in late erythroblasts and reticulocytes is globin protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the newly synthesized [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine labeled protein measured is most likely due to de novo hemoglobin synthesis in erythroid cells. Therefore, we conclude that inhibition of HRI by the HRI kinase inhibitor is able to increase hemoglobin synthesis in canine reticulocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Hemoglobin synthesis in erythroid cells is tightly regulated by heme, because heme binds to HRI and modulates its kinase activity. It has been reported that the enzymatically functional form of HRI is dimeric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and remains soluble devoid of aggregation. Maintaining the dimeric form of HRI in order to prevent its aggregation makes HRI a difficult protein to express in large quantities in vitro. We found that HRI is largely misfolded when expressed by in vitro TNT, however, the expression of soluble HRI protein can be improved by supplementing the reaction with heme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the HRI protein expression conditions used in this study, heme primarily plays a critical role by inactivating newly synthesized HRI by binding to the kinase insert domain. Consequently, heme addition increased protein production. In addition, heme addition appears to improve the yield of soluble protein by preventing newly translated HRI protein from aggregation. It is conceivable that HRI incorporates a heme moiety into the N-terminus of the protein cotranslationally to allow for the proper folding and assembly of the protein. To improve the protein yield of the human, mouse, rat, and canine HRI proteins, we supplemented insect cell culture medium with hemin during HRI protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). </p><p>A comparison of the mammalian HRI nucleotide and amino acid sequences reveals a high degree of conservation in the residues involved in ATP-binding (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(c)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(d)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(e)</xref>). Specifically, the comparison shows there is only one amino acid residue difference between the human and canine proteins and only two residues between the mouse and canine proteins. Additionally, the residues involved in heme-binding, either in the N-terminal regulatory domain or in the kinase insert domain, are completely conserved between the mammalian proteins, implying that the development and homeostatic regulation of circulatory systems among mammals is subject to the same evolutionary pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(d)</xref>). As expected from the high degree of sequence homology, we have found that the mammalian HRI proteins show similar ATP affinity with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> of ~1-2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M (data not shown). The high degree of homology in the catalytic domain is also reflected by the similar potency determined between the mammalian proteins in the ability of quercetin to inhibit HRI kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). </p><p>Normal adult hemoglobin consists of two <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>- and two <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-globin subunits and its proper assembly is essential for oxygen transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The majority (&#x0003e;90%) of actively translating mRNA in reticulocytes is globin mRNA, and 95% of protein made in reticulocytes is globin protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Translation of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>- and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-globin is tightly controlled by eIF2 and downregulated by HRI. By enhancing translation of globin by an HRI inhibitor in reticulocytes, the hemoglobin content of red blood cells is expected to increase causing an increase in the body's oxygen-carrying capacity. In this study, we show that inhibition of HRI by quercetin is able to increase de novo protein translation in canine reticulocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and also in mouse and rat reticulocytes (data not shown). Since HRI is predominantly expressed in erythroid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and since mature red blood cells do not have the ability to synthesize protein, we used the [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine incorporation in canine blood as an indirect measure of hemoglobin synthesis in erythroid cells. Our finding that HRI inhibition increases hemoglobin synthesis leads us to propose that antagonism of HRI may be of potential therapeutic importance for the treatment of iron-deficient blood disorders. </p><p>This study also shows that the canine HRI is conserved not only in the primary sequence of the gene but also functionally in its role on the regulation of protein synthesis. Together with the advantage of an ample supply of blood and similar physiology between canine and human, canine appears to be a good model species for further elucidation of the role of HRI protein in its contribution to iron-deficient anemias and perhaps other hematologic diseases such as <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-thalassemia.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>eIF:</term><def><p>Eukaryotic initiation factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRI:</term><def><p>Heme-regulated inhibitor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ATP:</term><def><p>Adenosine tri-phosphate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNT:</term><def><p>Transcription and translation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Quercetin:</term><def><p>3,3&#x02032;,4&#x02032;,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TCA:</term><def><p>Trichloroacetic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>bp:</term><def><p>Base pair.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors would like to thank Marcela Alomia for help in performing some of the kinase assays.
