AlkB as well as the human AlkB homologues, hABH2 and hABH3, were all able to demethylate 3-meT in a DNA oligonucleotide containing a single 3-meT residue. Also, 1-meG lesions introduced by chemical methylation of tRNA were efficiently removed by AlkB. Unlike 1-meA and 3-meC, nucleosides or bases corresponding to 1-meG or 3-meT did not stimulate the uncoupled, AlkB-mediated decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate.

Such agents introduce a number of premutagenic and cytotoxic lesions in DNA and are often highly carcinogenic in mammals. To counteract the deleterious effects of the lesions, most organisms possess several mechanisms for repairing alkylation damage in DNA. In the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the adaptive response to alkylation damage regulates the expression of several alkylation repair proteins through the Ada regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c2">2</xref>), and three different mechanisms for repairing alkylation damage have been described. First, AlkA and Tag are alkylbase glycosylases which excise purines alkylated in the 3- or 7-position, such as 3-methyladenine and 7-methylguanine (7-meG) from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c4">4</xref>). Second, the alkyltransferases Ada and Ogt directly reverse the damage at O-alkylated bases, such as O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine, by an irreversible reaction where the methyl group is transferred to a cysteine residue of the transferase, which is then consumed in the reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c5">5</xref>). Third, the AlkB protein was recently found to be an oxidative demethylase which directly reverses 1-methyladenine (1-meA) and 3-methylcytosine (3-meC) lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c7">7</xref>).</p><p>AlkB belongs to the superfamily of 2-oxoglutarate- and iron(II)-dependent oxygenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c8">8</xref>). These enzymes perform various oxidation reactions, where molecular oxygen is the oxidizing agent, and ferrous iron and 2-oxoglutarate are required as a cofactor and co-substrate, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c9">9</xref>). AlkB catalyses the oxidation of the harmful methyl group in 1-meA or 3-meC to a hydroxymethyl moiety, which is spontaneously released as formaldehyde, thereby regenerating the normal base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c7">7</xref>). The co-substrate 2-oxoglutarate is decarboxylated, yielding succinate and CO<sub>2</sub>. It was recently shown that 1-ethyladenine lesions in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c10">10</xref>), as well as 5&#x02032; phosphorylated 1-methyldeoxyadenosine mono- and triphos-phates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c11">11</xref>), can also be dealkylated by AlkB, albeit at reduced efficiency compared with 1-meA present in DNA. AlkB catalyses the decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate to succinate and CO<sub>2</sub> at a significant rate even in the absence of a DNA substrate (&#x02018;uncoupled reaction&#x02019;), and the addition of methylated DNA substrate causes stoichiometric increase in 2-oxoglutarate turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c7">7</xref>). Also, it was demonstrated that 2-oxoglutarate turnover was stimulated by some nucleosides and bases containing AlkB relevant lesions, but these compounds were not demethylated by AlkB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c12">12</xref>). Thus, it appears that the proper geometry for optimal AlkB action is only acquired in the context of a DNA oligomer.</p><p>All three mechanisms for repairing alkylated DNA in <italic>E.coli</italic> are also present in human cells, and sequence homology searches indicate that a number of AlkB homologues exist in the human proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c13">13</xref>). However, only two of these, denoted hABH2 and hABH3, have been reported to share the ability of <italic>E.coli</italic> AlkB to demethylate 1-meA and 3-meC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c14">14</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>E.coli</italic> AlkB and hABH3 are also able to efficiently remove 1-meA and 3-meC lesions from RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c14">14</xref>), and, in the case of tRNA and mRNA, such repair is also associated with the recovery of RNA function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c15">15</xref>).</p><p>The lesions 1-methylguanine (1-meG) and 3-methylthymine (3-meT) are structural analogues of 1-meA and 3-meC, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f1">1</xref>). 1-meA and 3-meC are methylated at N-atoms that are involved in Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairing of the corresponding normal bases, and this is also the case for 1-meG and 3-meT. Although less prevalent than 1-meA and 3-meC, both 3-meT and 1-meG have been reported to be introduced upon treatment of DNA or RNA with alkylating agents, both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c20">20</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c22">22</xref>).

To test whether AlkB proteins can repair 3-meT lesions in DNA, we studied their ability to rescue a 3-meT-induced replication block. We performed T7 DNA polymerase mediated extension of a <sup>32</sup>P-end-labelled 15mer primer on a 24mer oligonucleotide template containing a single 3-meT residue in position 19 from the 3&#x02032; end (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f2">2</xref>A). Primer extension yielded exclusively an 18mer extension product (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f2">2</xref>B, lane 1), indicating that the T7 DNA polymerase is not able to incorporate a nucleoside opposite the 3-meT residue. Extension on an otherwise identical template, where the 3-meT residue had been replaced by thymine, yielded a mixture of 24 and 25 nt products (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f2">2</xref>D, lane 1). (The 25mer product results from the ability of T7 DNA polymerase to add an additional residue after completing template-directed synthesis). However, when the 3-meT containing template had been incubated with human or bacterial AlkB proteins as well as the cofactors Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and 2-oxoglutarate prior to primer extension, a partial rescue of the primer extension block was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f2">2</xref>B), i.e. an additional 25mer primer extension product was observed. However, even at the highest enzyme concentrations, we were not able to observe complete repair, as indicated by the presence of the 18mer extension product. Further increasing the enzyme concentrations did not increase the repair efficiency but rather caused adverse effects, such as substrate degradation and&#x0002f;or inhibition of primer extension (data not shown). Normalized for the amounts of enzyme used, the relative repair efficiency of the three enzymes can be summarized as follows: AlkB &#x02248; hABH2 &#x0003e; hABH3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f2">2</xref>C). In contrast, when we previously introduced 1-meA and 3-meC residues by [<sup>3</sup>H]MNU treatment of the corresponding 3-meT-free oligonucleotide, the relative repair efficiencies were AlkB &#x0003e; hABH2 &#x02248; hABH3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c23">23</xref>). To more directly compare the activity of these enzymes on 1-meA and 3-meC with that observed for 3-meT, the 3-meT-free oligonucleotide was treated with DMS to introduce 1-meA and 3-meC lesions, and similar primer extension experiments were performed. Clearly, the DMS treatment inhibited the primer extension, leading to a substantial reduction in the amount of the 24mer&#x0002f;25mer extension products (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f2">2</xref>D). The pattern of observed stop sites corresponded reasonably well to the positions of A and C bases in the template, indicating that the extension block is caused by the introduction of 1-meA and 3-meC. As observed with the 3-meT containing oligonucleotide, incubation of the DMS-treated oligonucleotide with AlkB, hABH2 or hABH3 partially or completely reversed the primer extension block, thus demonstrating repair (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f2">2</xref>E). The relative repair efficiencies of these three enzymes were similar to those previously obtained when using the [<sup>3</sup>H]MNU-treated substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c23">23</xref>), i.e. AlkB &#x0003e; hABH2 &#x02248; hABH3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f2">2</xref>F), but somewhat different from that obtained when using the 3-meT containing oligonucleotide (AlkB &#x02248; hABH2 &#x0003e; hABH3). In summary, these experiments indicate that 3-meT lesions can be reversed by AlkB, hABH2 and hABH3, but that the relative activity of the enzymes on this lesion is different from that observed with 1-meA and 3-meC.</p></sec><sec><title>Reversal of 3-meT measured by HPLC analysis</title><p>We considered it highly likely that the observed AlkB-mediated release of a 3-meT-induced replication block was caused by an actual oxidative demethylation of 3-meT to thymine. However, it could not be formally excluded that the result of the oxidative action of the human and bacterial AlkB proteins on 3-meT is not thymine, but rather another product which allows bypass by T7 DNA polymerase. To study this, the 3-meT containing oligonucleotide was digested to nucleosides by enzymatic hydrolysis with nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase, and the resulting nucleosides analysed by reverse-phase HPLC. Five peaks were detected in the chromatogram; four major peaks corresponding to the unmodified nucleosides adenosine, cytidine, guanosine and thymidine, and a minor peak corresponding to the single 3-mdT residue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f3">3</xref>A). However, when the oligonucleotide was treated with hABH2 prior to HPLC analysis of its constituent nucleosides, the peak corresponding to 3-mdT was barely visible, while the thymidine peak increased slightly, indicating reversal of the 3-meT lesion to the normal base thymine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f3">3</xref>B). In accordance with the results of the primer extension experiments, the highest degree of repair was observed in the case of hABH2, and we were only able to see partial reversal of the 3-meT lesion with AlkB or hABH3 (data not shown). Our HPLC analysis confirms the major finding from the primer extension experiments, i.e. that 3-meT is a substrate for AlkB, and also demonstrates that the lesion is repaired by demethylation.</p></sec><sec><title>AlkB-mediated repair of 1-meG lesions</title><p>When previously studying the ability of AlkB to repair RNA, we used [<sup>3</sup>H]MNU-treated RNA oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c23">23</xref>) and [<sup>14</sup>C]MeI-treated tRNA as substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c15">15</xref>), and AlkB repaired these two substrates at similar efficiencies. Here, we have analysed the contents of methylated bases in these substrates by subjecting the constituent nucleosides to HPLC analysis, and some important differences were noticed. In the case of the [<sup>3</sup>H]MNU-treated oligonucleotide substrate, the major lesions introduced were 1-meA, 3-meC and 7-meG, and, as expected, AlkB-mediated removal was only observed in the case of 1-meA and 3-meC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f4">4</xref>A). However, when the nucleosides from the [<sup>14</sup>C]MeI-treated tRNA were analysed by HPLC, two additional peaks were observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f4">4</xref>B). One of these peaks coeluted with a nucleoside standard corresponding to 1-meG and was removed by the AlkB treatment. We have not established the identity of the second peak, which was not affected by the AlkB treatment. Our data indicate that 1-meG is a major lesion introduced by MeI treatment of tRNA, and that this lesion is efficiently removed by AlkB treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>1-meG and 3-meT do not stimulate AlkB-mediated decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate</title><p>Many members of the superfamily of iron- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases are able to catalyse the decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate to succinate at a low rate even in the absence of their primary substrate (&#x02018;uncoupled reaction&#x02019;), and this is also the case for AlkB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c7">7</xref>). Moreover, the uncoupled AlkB reaction can be stimulated by various nucleosides and bases representing the AlkB relevant lesions, i.e. the nucleosides 1-methyladenosine, 1-methyl-2&#x02032;-deoxyadenosine, 3-methylcytidine, 3-methyl-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine and the free base 1-meA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c12">12</xref>). Therefore, we also tested the ability of 1-meG and 3-meT, as well as corresponding nucleosides, to stimulate the uncoupled AlkB reaction. However, while 1-methyladenosine, as previously reported, caused a substantial increase in the decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate, no such effect was observed with 1-meG, 3-meT, 3-methyl-2&#x02032;-deoxythymidine or 1-methylguanosine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f5">5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results presented here further extend the substrate specificity of the AlkB proteins, by demonstrating that also 1-meG lesions in RNA and 3-meT lesions in DNA are efficiently demethylated by AlkB. Thus, it now appears likely that all N1-methylated purine bases and N3-methylated pyrimidine bases in nucleic acids (shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f1">1</xref>) are AlkB substrates (it has not yet been tested whether 3-methyluracil is demethylated by AlkB).</p><p>3-meT has previously been shown to block DNA polymerases when present in the DNA template or in the incoming deoxynucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c25">25</xref>), and may therefore be a cause of both genomic instability and mutation. The introduction of 3-meT in DNA upon exposure to methylating agents is quite inefficient, compared with the level of 1-meA and 3-meC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c26">26</xref>). However, numerous studies have reported the introduction of 3-meT in DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c27">27</xref>), and also <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c21">21</xref>), so it appears likely that this lesion poses a threat to genomic integrity in living cells. Compared with the 1-meA and 3-meC containing substrate (obtained by DMS treatment), the 3-meT-containing substrate was a poorer substrate for AlkB and hABH3 (hABH2 was approximately equally efficient on both substrates). Thus, although the frequency of introduction of 3-meT lesions is quite low, this lesion may be as deleterious as the more frequent 1-meA and 3-meC lesions, due to its inefficient repair.</p><p>Here, we have shown that [<sup>14</sup>C]MeI treatment of tRNA introduces 1-meG lesions, and that these lesions are repaired by AlkB. Previous studies have shown that 1-meG is the major methylation product obtained by MeI treatment of guanosine under basic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c28">28</xref>), and that other methylating agents can induce 1-meG in RNA and DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c18">18</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c22">22</xref>). We also attempted to introduce 1-meG residues in DNA by treatment of a G-rich oligonucleotide with [<sup>14</sup>C]MeI, but were unsuccessful (P. &#x000d8;. Falnes and R. F. Johansen, unpublished data). In our previous studies, we have titrated the amounts of AlkB and hABH3 required to demethylate the [<sup>14</sup>C]MeI-treated tRNA substrate used in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f4">4</xref>B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c15">15</xref>), and we have also performed similar titrations for the [<sup>3</sup>H]methylated RNA oligonucleotide used in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f4">4</xref>A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c23">23</xref>). Several conclusions can be drawn by combining our previous data with those presented here. When treating the [<sup>14</sup>C]methylated tRNA substrate with hABH3, the maximal extent of demethylation corresponded to the plateau level obtained with <italic>E.coli</italic> AlkB (Figure 5 in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c15">15</xref>), indicating that 1-meG is also a substrate for hABH3. Furthermore, the titration curve of the activity of AlkB on the [<sup>14</sup>C]methylated tRNA substrate containing the AlkB substrates 1-meG, 1-meA and 3-meC was not biphasic (Figure 5 in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c15">15</xref>), and very similar to that obtained when using the 1-meA and 3-meC containing [<sup>3</sup>H]methylated RNA oligonucleotide (Figure 4A in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c23">23</xref>). This may suggest that 1-meG, 1-meA and 3-meC in RNA are demethylated at similar efficiencies by AlkB. Kroger and Singer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c29">29</xref>) studied the transcription of homopolymeric DNA templates and found that the introduction of 1-meG lesions completely abrogated transcription, while 1-meA or 3-meC only decreased its rate. These data demonstrate that methylation of guanosine in the N1-position severely compromises the ability of DNA to act as template for RNA polymerases, and suggest to us that 1-meG may also block DNA replication and mRNA translation, as is the case for 1-meA and 3-meC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c15">15</xref>).</p><p>Similarly to 1-meA and 3-meC, 1-meG exists as a naturally occurring modified base in tRNA. The presence of 1-meG residues in some tRNAs is important for maintaining the proper reading frame in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c30">30</xref>), and bacterial mutants deficient in incorporating 1-meG in tRNA display decreased growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c31">31</xref>). Thus, the ability of AlkB to demethylate 1-meG appears counterproductive in this context, and it will be interesting to study whether naturally occurring bases in tRNA are protected from AlkB-mediated demethylation, or whether a low level of such demethylation is actually tolerated.</p><p>A recent article reported that the bases and nucleosides corresponding to the lesions 1-meA and 3-meC strongly stimulated the AlkB-mediated uncoupled decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate to succinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c12">12</xref>). Here, we have measured the effect of 1-meG and 3-meT on this reaction but were not able to detect any stimulation. These data indicate that the interaction of the neutral bases 1-meG and 3-meT with the AlkB active site may be weaker than in the case of 1-meA and 3-meC, which are positively charged at physiological pH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f1">1</xref>). This is also supported by the observation that AlkB was more efficient at relieving a replication block at the DMS-treated substrate (containing 1-mA and 3-meC), than at the 3-meT-containing oligo (c.f. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh964f2">2</xref>C and F). Mechanistic insight on several enzymes that bind methylated bases in DNA and RNA has been obtained by studying the 3D structure of the protein in complex with a free methylated base or nucleoside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c33">33</xref>). This approach may also be useful in the case of AlkB, particularly, since bases and nucleosides corresponding to 1-meA and 3-meC apparently can interact with the AlkB active site, but are not AlkB substrates. However, 1-meG and 3-meT may not be equally useful for this purpose; their inability to stimulate the uncoupled, AlkB-mediated decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate may suggest that their interaction with the AlkB active site is weaker than in the case of 1-meA and 3-meC.</p><p>Since the initial discovery that 1-meA and 3-meC in DNA are demethylated by AlkB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c7">7</xref>), the number of known AlkB substrates has increased considerably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c11">11</xref>). Similarly, the family of putative human AlkB homologues has grown. For many years, only one such homologue was known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c34">34</xref>), but recent searches in protein databases have identified eight putative human AlkB proteins, denoted hABH1&#x02013;hABH8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c14">14</xref>). Of these, an enzymatic activity has only been demonstrated in the case of hABH2 and hABH3, which, like <italic>E.coli</italic> AlkB, are able to demethylate 1-meA and 3-meC lesions in nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c14">14</xref>). A wide range of roles can be imagined for the remaining proteins, such as repair of other lesions in nucleic acids or reversal of nucleic acid or protein methylations that regulate gene activity. These unsolved questions represent important challenges for future research.</p><p><italic>Note</italic>: After these data were obtained, two studies have reported AlkB-mediated repair of 3-meT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c36">36</xref>) and 1-meG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh964c35">35</xref>) lesions, using experimental strategies rather different from those used here.
