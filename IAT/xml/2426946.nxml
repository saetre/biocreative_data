Actin regulatory proteins participate in invadopodia formation, whereas matrix degradation requires metalloproteinases (MMPs) targeted to invadopodia. In this study, we show that the vesicle-tethering exocyst complex is required for matrix proteolysis and invasion of breast carcinoma cells. We demonstrate that the exocyst subunits Sec3 and Sec8 interact with the polarity protein IQGAP1 and that this interaction is triggered by active Cdc42 and RhoA, which are essential for matrix degradation. Interaction between IQGAP1 and the exocyst is necessary for invadopodia activity because enhancement of matrix degradation induced by the expression of IQGAP1 is lost upon deletion of the exocyst-binding site. We further show that the exocyst and IQGAP1 are required for the accumulation of cell surface membrane type 1 MMP at invadopodia. Based on these results, we propose that invadopodia function in tumor cells relies on the coordination of cytoskeletal assembly and exocytosis downstream of Rho guanosine triphosphatases.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>M.

One major route of invasion requires tumor cells to proteolytically cleave ECM and basement membrane components via a mechanism that is initiated by the formation of integrin-based cell/matrix contacts and involves matrix-degrading proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friedl and Wolf, 2003</xref>). Metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly membrane-type (MT) MMPs, including MT1-MMP, are essential for pericellular proteolysis and tumor cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deryugina and Quigley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Itoh and Seiki, 2006</xref>).</p><p>When analyzed on reconstituted ECM thin substrates, matrix degradation by invasive cells occurs at discrete sites corresponding to small (micrometer range) cellular protrusions at the ventral cell surface called invadopodia. Based on a substantial amount of work, invadopodia are currently viewed as dynamic extensions of the plasma membrane, where signaling components and cellular machineries involved in actin-driven membrane protrusion and exocytosis are thought to cooperate for delivering and concentrating integrins, active MMPs (MT1-MMP and MMP2), and other components at sites of contact with the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen and Wang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mueller et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hashimoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McNiven et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tague et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamaguchi et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artym et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hotary et al., 2006</xref>). Invadopodia are thus thought to mimic the contact sites that form between tumor cells and the basement membrane during cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friedl and Wolf, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buccione et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, it is essential to understand how these structures can assemble into functional proteolytic invasive units.</p><p>With the overall aim of identifying the machinery controlling invadopodia biogenesis and function, we found that the exocyst complex is a key component of invadopodial proteolysis and invasion of human breast adenocarcinoma cells. The exocyst complex, which consists of eight subunits, namely, Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84, mediates the tethering of post-Golgi and endocytic recycling vesicles for targeted insertion at sites of active plasma membrane growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Folsch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prigent et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsu et al., 2004</xref>). Genetic and cell biology studies in budding yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and mammals have shown that the exocyst complex is necessary for cellular functions that require polarized exocytosis to dynamic regions of the plasma membrane, such as budding in yeast, cell&#x02013;cell adhesion, neurite and filopodia extension, and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">TerBush et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grindstaff et al., 1998</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sugihara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rosse et al., 2006</xref>). The current view is that the exocyst complex selects vesicles eligible for docking by recognizing molecular codes such as GTPases of the Rab subfamily on the incoming vesicles and assembles in a vesicle-tethering complex at specialized regions of the plasma membrane that are delineated by small GTPases belonging to the Rho family and to the Ral and ADP-ribosylation factor subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Munson and Novick, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we identify new exocyst complex partners and/or regulators that play a role in tumor cell invasion. We show that the Sec8 and Sec3 subunits interact with the cell polarization landmark IQGAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noritake et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown and Sacks, 2006</xref>) and that this interaction is controlled by the Rho GTPases Cdc42 and RhoA. We also provide an indication that this association is involved in matrix degradation in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells. Overall, our study identifies novel components of the exocytic machinery acting downstream of Cdc42/RhoA GTPases that are essential for the formation and activity of invadopodia in breast tumor cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The exocyst complex is required for breast tumor cell invasion</title><p>MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells are known to degrade the matrix at invadopodia through a mechanism dependent on MMP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sabeh et al., 2004</xref>).

As we did not detect the expression of IQGAP2 in MDA-MB-231 cells (unpublished data), our further analyses focused on IQGAP1.</p><p>The two-hybrid interactions defined a conserved region of the C-terminal end of IQGAP1 and IQGAP2 (57% identity) as the putative binding site for the exocyst subunits (Fig. S1, a and b). Thus, we performed in vitro GST pull-down assays from lysates of HeLa cells transfected with HA-tagged Sec3, Sec8, Exo70, or Exo84 exocyst complex subunit. The C-terminal end of IQGAP1 (position 1,361&#x02013;1,657, IQGAP1-CTer1; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>) and a subregion (position 1,361&#x02013;1,563, Cter2) comprising a predicted coiled-coil domain fused to GST specifically recovered all four exocyst subunits (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 b</xref>). In contrast, the coiled-coil domain (position 1,491&#x02013;1,538, Cter4) was not sufficient for binding on its own, nor was the far-most C-terminal fragment (1,563&#x02013;1,657, CTer3). Interaction of the exocyst subunits with the coiled-coil&#x02013;containing region of IQGAP1 was specific, as no such interaction could be detected between Sec8 and the predicted coiled-coil domain of the JSAP1/JIP3 scaffolding protein (Fig. S2 a, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709076/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709076/DC1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kelkar et al., 2000</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Sec3 and Sec8 exocyst complex subunits interact with a C-terminal region of IQGAP1.</bold> (a) Schematic representation of the C-terminal fragments of human IQGAP1 used.

Combined knockdown of Sec3 and Sec8 with specific siRNAs, although affecting the expression level of HA-Exo70 to some extent (43% reduction as compared with mock-treated cells; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 c</xref>, top; compare lane 1 with lane 4), led to a strong reduction of HA-Exo70 binding to the IQGAP1 CTer2 fragment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 c</xref>, top; compare lane 6 with lane 12). In addition, single Sec3 or Sec8 knockdown also resulted in decreased binding of Exo70 to GST-IQGAP1/CTer2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 c</xref>, compare lanes 6, 8, and 10). Furthermore, we observed that when the exocyst subunits were in vitro translated in reticulocyte lysates, only Sec3 and Sec8 but not Exo70 or Exo84 bound the IQGAP1 CTer1 and CTer2 constructs (Fig. S2 c). All together, these findings suggest a direct, possibly cooperative binding of Sec3 and Sec8 to the C-terminal region of IQGAP1. On the contrary, association of the other exocyst subunits, including Exo70 and Exo84, might be indirect, requiring Sec3/Sec8 bound to IQGAP1.</p><p>To map the IQGAP1-binding region of Sec3 and Sec8 subunits, several fragments of these proteins were translated in vitro and tested for binding to the GST-CTer2 construct of IQGAP1 (see Fig. S2 d for a schematic representation of the Sec3/Sec8 fragments used). This analysis identified predicted coiled-coil domains present at the N terminus of Sec3 and Sec8 as the IQGAP1-binding region (Fig. S2 e). Confirming previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matern et al., 2001</xref>), our two-hybrid screens also documented reciprocal interactions of Sec3 and Sec8 through their predicted N-terminal coiled-coil domains (unpublished data). Collectively, these results indicate that Sec3, Sec8, and IQGAP1 can associate through coiled-coil domains present in all three proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>A GTP-Cdc42/RhoA-triggered association of Sec3/Sec8 with IQGAP1</title><p>Then, we investigated the interaction between the exocyst complex and IQGAP1 in vivo. First, we analyzed the association of endogenous IQGAP1 with the exocyst complex in MDA-MB-231 cells. Low levels of IQGAP1&#x02013;Sec8 complexes were reproducibly detected in reciprocal coimmunoprecipitations from MDA-MB-231 cell lysates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 a</xref>), which is indicative of an association of IQGAP1 with the exocyst complex in these cells. To examine the regulation of the IQGAP1&#x02013;exocyst complex in further detail, epitope-tagged proteins were transfected into HEK293 cells, wherein transfection efficiency was high and protein association was better monitored. We first verified that HA-tagged Sec8 and Sec3 were functional and interacted with endogenous Sec6 and Sec10 subunits by coimmunoprecipitation analysis (unpublished data). Because IQGAP1 is a known effector of Cdc42 and Rac1 small GTPases, HEK293 cells were transfected with constructs encoding wild-type (WT) IQGAP1 (tagged with GFP), Sec8-HA, and either constitutively active (Q to L substitution at position 61 or 63) or dominant inhibitory (T to N substitution at position 17 or 19) mutant forms of myc-tagged Cdc42, Rac1, or RhoA, and the interaction of IQGAP1 with Sec8 and Rho GTPases was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibodies. As previously shown, WT IQGAP1 interacted specifically with the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 and Rac1 but not RhoA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 b</xref>, bottom; compare lanes 1, 3 and 5, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noritake et al., 2005</xref>). On analyzing the presence of Sec8-HA in the immunoprecipitates, we made the observation that active Cdc42 and RhoA but not Rac1 promoted the association of IQGAP1 with Sec8 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 b</xref>, top; compare lanes 1, 5, and 3). Similarly, active Cdc42 induced the association of IQGAP1 with Sec3-HA (Fig. S3 a, lane 7; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709076/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709076/DC1</ext-link>).

However, the binding of mutant IQGAP1-T to Sec8 was observed upon coexpression of the active form of Cdc42 or RhoA, whereas Rac1 was unable to promote this interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 b</xref>, top; lanes 7 and 11).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>In vivo interaction of IQGAP1 with Sec8 and Sec3 is regulated by Cdc42 and RhoA.</bold> (a) Endogenous association of IQGAP1 with Sec8 in MD-MB-231 cells. 2 mg lysates of MDA-MB-231 cells was immunoprecipitated with control, anti-Sec8, or anti-IQGAP1 IgGs, and bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. 1% of total lysate was loaded as a control (input).

HA-tagged Sec8 was transiently coexpressed with GFP-tagged wild-type (WT) or mutant IQGAP1-T1050AX2 (IQGAP1-T) in HEK293 cells together with myc-tagged Cdc42, Rac1, or RhoA GTPases either in their GTP-bound form (L [Cdc42-Q61L], Rac1-Q61L, or RhoA-Q63L) or GDP-bound form (N [Cdc42-T17N], Rac1-T17N, or RhoA-T19N). IQGAP1-T harbors mutations in the GRD domain that abolish binding to GTP-Cdc42/Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fukata et al., 2002</xref>). Approximately 1 mg of cellular extract was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies and analyzed by anti-HA (top), anti-GFP (middle), or anti-myc (bottom) immunoblotting as indicated (lanes 1&#x02013;12). Control IPs with irrelevant IgGs are shown in Fig. S3 b. Protein expression levels in 10 &#x003bc;g of total cell extracts are shown in the right panel (input, lanes 13&#x02013;24). Of note, mycRhoA-T19N was consistently expressed to a lower extent as compared with mycRhoA-Q63L. The open arrowhead indicates the position of IgG light chain, and closed arrowheads point to myc-tagged Rho GTPases. (c) Cdc42 and RhoA activities are required for IQGAP1&#x02013;Sec8 complex formation in MDA-MB-231 cells. The same amount of cell lysates prepared from MDA-MB-231 cells either mock treated (lanes 1 and 2), depleted for 72 h with combined siRNAs for Cdc42 and RhoA (lanes 3 and 4), or serum starved for 48 h (lanes 5 and 6) were immunoprecipitated with control IgGs or anti-Sec8 antibodies, and bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. A fraction (1%) of the lysates was analyzed as a control (input, lanes 7&#x02013;9). (d) Sec3 and Sec8 form a complex with and dependent on GTP-bound Cdc42. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged Sec3, V5-tagged Sec8, and myc-tagged Cdc42-Q61L (L) or -T17N (N) as indicated, and &#x0223c;1 mg of cellular extracts was immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibodies (lanes 1&#x02013;6). Bound proteins were analyzed by anti-HA, anti-V5, and anti-myc immunoblotting as indicated. Protein expression levels in 10 &#x003bc;g of total cell extracts are shown in the right panel (input, lanes 7&#x02013;12).

Serum starvation of MDA-MB-231, a treatment known to cause a reduction of active Cdc42 and RhoA levels in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ren and Schwartz, 2000</xref>), led to an &#x0223c;80% reduction (&#x000b1;22%; from two independent experiments) of the steady-state association of IQGAP1 with Sec8 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 c</xref>, compare lane 2 with lane 6). In addition, reduced expression of Cdc42 and RhoA upon siRNA treatment also reduced the amount of IQGAP1 coimmunoprecipitated with Sec8 (43 &#x000b1; 16% reduction as compared with mock; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 c</xref>, compare lane 2 with lane 4).</p><p>Based on the aforementioned results, we conclude that although GTP-bound Cdc42 and RhoA can promote the association of IQGAP1 with the Sec8/Sec3 subunits of the exocyst complex in vivo, direct binding of these Rho GTPases to IQGAP1 is not required for this effect. Thus, we tested the possibility that active Cdc42/RhoA might interact with the exocyst subunits and, thus, facilitate their association with IQGAP1. When HEK293 cells were transfected with active or inactive Cdc42 together with Sec3-HA and Sec8-V5, active myc-Cdc42 was coimmunoprecipitated with both Sec3 and Sec8, and these interactions were detected only on coexpression of the two exocyst subunits (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 d</xref>, top and middle; lane 5). A complex of active RhoA with Sec3/Sec8 was also detected, although to a lower extent (Fig. S3 d). The interaction of GTP-bound Cdc42 and RhoA with the exocyst subunits is probably transient in nature and can be detected only upon direct immunoprecipitation of the myc-tagged Rho GTPases when both Sec3 and Sec8 subunits are overexpressed (compare situations documented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, b and d</xref>). Collectively, our results suggest that upon activation (i.e., GTP binding), Cdc42 and RhoA interact with the Sec3/Sec8 subunits of the exocyst complex in a mechanism that promotes the interaction of Sec3/Sec8 and the remaining subunits of the complex with IQGAP1.</p><p>Finally, we analyzed the contribution of Cdc42 and RhoA to matrix degradation of MDA cells. Knockdown of Cdc42 or RhoA in both MDA-MB-231 cells led to a drastic reduction of matrix degradation comparable with MT1-MMP depletion, whereas overall expression levels of MT1-MMP were not affected by knocking down Cdc42 or RhoA (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709076/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709076/DC1</ext-link>). Of note, simultaneous depletion of both Cdc42 and RhoA with combined siRNA treatment led to a further decrease of degradation (unpublished data). All together, these results indicate that signaling pathways downstream of Cdc42 and RhoA are essential and probably act nonredundantly in the mechanism of invadopodial matrix degradation of MDA-MB-231 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>IQGAP1 and the exocyst complex are required for MT1-MMP accumulation at invadopodia</title><p>We first examined the distribution of Sec8 and IQGAP1 in MDA-MB-231 cells plated on fluorescent gelatin. Endogenous IQGAP1 was enriched at invadopodia of MDA-MB-231 cells together with filamentous actin (F-actin; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 a</xref>). We could not analyze the distribution of the endogenous Sec8 (or Sec3) subunit in MDA-MB-231 cells because of the lack of good immunological reagents capable of detecting these proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy. Therefore, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with epitope-tagged Sec8 (V5 tagged) to facilitate detection. Besides a diffuse staining caused by accumulation in the cytosol, Sec8-V5 was also detected at invadopodia, where it colocalized with F-actin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 b</xref>). In addition, using MDA-MB-231 cells expressing an active mutant form of c-Src (Y527F), which triggers the appearance of larger, more stable invadopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artym et al., 2006</xref>), we observed colocalization of endogenous IQGAP1 and Sec8-V5 at foci of degraded matrix (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 c</xref>). Collectively, these data show that IQGAP1 and a component of the exocyst complex colocalize at invadopodia of MDA-MB-231 cells.

Depletion of IQGAP1 with two independent siRNAs to &#x0223c;30% of control levels in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 b</xref>) resulted in a significant reduction of matrix degradation comparable with the effect of Sec8 depletion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 c</xref>), whereas overall levels of MT1-MMP in the different cell populations were similar (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 b</xref>). The contribution of IQGAP1 and exocyst to the function of invadopodia was assessed by scoring the number of proteolytically active invadopodia positive for cell surface MT1-MMP in Sec8 or IQGAP1-depleted cells in comparison with mock-treated cells. Depletion of Sec8 or IQGAP1 led to a significant reduction of cell surface MT1-MMP&#x02013;positive invadopodia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 d</xref>), demonstrating that the function of the exocyst complex and IQGAP1 is required for cell surface accumulation of MT1-MMP at invadopodia for invadopodia formation and activity.</p></sec><sec><title>The exocyst-binding domain of IQGAP1 is required for the mechanism of invadopodial proteolysis</title><p>To connect IQGAP1 and exocyst complex function at invadopodia, we made use of the IQGAP1-T1052AX2 (IQGAP1-T) protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 a</xref>). This mutant form of IQGAP1, which is defective for binding to GTP-Cdc42/Rac1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 b</xref>), has been shown to promote the extension of multiple lamellipodial structures in fibroblastic cell lines and, thus, is thought to represent a constitutively active form of IQGAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fukata et al., 2002</xref>). When expressed in MDA-MT1ch cells, IQGAP1-T induced a striking 6.7-fold (&#x000b1;1) increase of matrix degradation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 b</xref>). Overexpression of WT IQGAP1 had a less stimulatory effect (&#x000d7;2.9 &#x000b1; 0.4-fold). Distribution of the IQGAP1-WT and -T constructs was examined in MDA-MT1ch cells with respect to invadopodia localization. Like the endogenous proteins, both constructs were detected at the cell edge, where they colocalized with F-actin in cortical bundles and at the ventral cell surface within invadopodia, coinciding with dark spots of degraded gelatin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 c</xref>). Importantly, deletion of the entire C-terminal region of IQGAP1-T (&#x00394;CC &#x0002b; RGC [RasGAP C terminus]) or only the region of IQGAP1-T encompassing the Sec3/Sec8 binding domain (&#x00394;CC) completely abolished the stimulatory effect of the activated mutant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, a and b</xref>). Noticeably, the distribution of IQGAP1-T&#x00394;CC appeared more diffuse, with no clear enrichment in ventral puncta (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 c</xref>). In addition, we observed that IQGAP1-T deleted of its far-most C-terminal region (&#x00394;RGC) also lost the capacity to stimulate matrix degradation, as it failed to promote lamellipodia formation in the initial study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fukata et al., 2002</xref> (see Discussion below). Of note, when expressed together with Sec8-HA and activated Cdc42 in HEK293 cells, IQGAP1-T&#x00394;CC could still be coimmunoprecipitated together with Sec8. We believe that this interaction likely represents the oligomerization of IQGAP1-T&#x00394;CC with endogenous IQGAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukata et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ren et al., 2005</xref>), providing a bridge to the exocyst complex. At this stage, the relevance of IQGAP1 oligomerization to the mechanism of matrix degradation at invadopodia is not known. In any case, our data demonstrate that a constitutively active form of IQGAP1 has the capacity to stimulate invadopodia-mediated proteolysis of the matrix and that this activity requires the integrity of the C-terminal region of IQGAP1, including the exocyst complex&#x02013;binding site.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Stimulation of invadopodial proteolysis by a constitutively active IQGAP1 mutant requires the Sec3/Sec8-binding domain.</bold> (a) Schematic representation of IQGAP1, IQGAP1-T1050AX2 (IQGAP1-T) mutant, and its C-terminal deletion mutants.

Various studies also identified endocytosis and recycling as a mechanism for controlling the activity of MT1-MMP during matrix degradation and invasion of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uekita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zucker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Remacle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lafleur et al., 2006</xref>). Based on our findings that IQGAP1 and the exocyst complex, probably acting in a complex at invadopodia, are required for MT1-MMP accumulation at invadopodia, for invadopodial degradation of the matrix, and for invasion of breast carcinoma cells, we propose the model depicted in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. In this scenario, the interaction of Sec3/Sec8 with IQGAP1 under the control of Cdc42/RhoA would provide a mechanism for targeting the exocyst complex to IQGAP1-enriched invadopodia of tumor cells. After targeting and/or assembly at invadopodia, the exocyst would facilitate tethering and polarized exocytosis of transport vesicles, resulting in delivery and accumulation of MT1-MMP at invadopodia. Noticeably, we observed a reduction of ventral puncta of F-actin and cortactin in cells depleted for Sec8 or IQGAP1 (unpublished data). However, whether this steady-state reduction reflects a general inhibition of invadopodia formation or the formation of more short-lived structures in the absence of IQGAP1 or the exocyst complex is unknown. In any case, our data support the view that the local activation of Cdc42 and RhoA at contact sites between tumor cells and the matrix would be required to interface proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization with proteins involved in exocytosis to assemble an active structure competent for matrix proteolysis and remodeling.</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for Rho-GTPase signaling control of invadopodial formation and function.</bold> In response to the interaction of tumor cells with their 3D matrix environment, Rho-GTPases are activated locally, triggering actin assembly through activation of the Arp2/3 complex and leading to invadopodia protrusion within the ECM. IQGAP1, which is downstream of Cdc42 and RhoA, plays a central role in invadopodia function through the coordination of actin assembly with the exocytic machinery via the vesicle-docking exocyst complex and possibly through microtubule plus end anchoring (see Discussion for details).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1810985f07"></graphic></fig><p>In addition, we found not only invadopodial proteolytic activity but also the mechanism of invadopodia formation to be critically dependent on expression of MT1-MMP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1 b</xref> and S5). These observations are in agreement with recent studies showing that knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of MT1-MMP inhibits matrix degradation and invadopodia formation in carcinoma cells, including MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artym et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 2007</xref>). All together, these findings support the idea that MT1-MMP is not only the main proteolytic activity of invadopodia, but it also represents one prominent component of the building foundation of this structure.</p><p>Our study attributes a novel function to IQGAP1 as a key component of invadopodia. IQGAP1 localizes at lamellipodia of migratory cells, where it links microtubule plus ends to the actin cytoskeleton and, thereby, appears as a key regulator of cell polarity during migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noritake et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown and Sacks, 2006</xref>). In addition, recent studies showing that IQGAP1 is overexpressed at invasive fronts of metastatic human colorectal carcinomas and enhances tumorigenesis of human breast epithelial cells all support an essential role for IQGAP1 in invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nabeshima et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mataraza et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jadeski et al., 2008</xref>). Our finding that IQGAP1 is enriched at invadopodia and that loss of its expression leads to a reduction of invadopodia function in matrix degradation provides a mechanism for IQGAP1's role in the dissemination of invasive carcinoma cells. IQGAP1 is a scaffolding protein involved in multiple interactions with various cellular machineries. Besides its capacity to interact with the exocyst complex revealed by this study and, thus, the possibility to contribute to the delivery of invadopodial components, another function for IQGAP1 during invadopodia formation could be the stimulation of actin assembly by activation of a Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein&#x02013;Arp2/3 complex pathway known to control actin-driven invadopodial extension (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamaguchi et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Clainche et al., 2007</xref>). Another aspect of IQGAP1 activity at invadopodia may reside in its ability to capture microtubule plus ends via the formation of tripartite complexes with activated Cdc42 and microtubule-associated proteins CLIP-170 and adenomatous polyposis coli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fukata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watanabe et al., 2004</xref>). Microtubules and microtubule motors are important for the formation and dynamics of invadopodia-like structures of monocyte-derived cells called podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kopp et al., 2006</xref>). Whether invadopodia formation and/or activity similarly involves the microtubule network is presently unknown. Our observation that stimulation of invadopodial activity by constitutively active IQGAP1-T requires the CLIP170/adenomatous polyposis coli C-terminal binding domain of IQGAP1 suggests that this may indeed be the case and will require further investigation.</p><p>The interaction of IQGAP1 with Sec3/Sec8 that we document here, although it is promoted by GTP-Cdc42/RhoA, does not require direct binding of the GTPases to the GRD domain (Ras GTPase-activating protein&#x02013;related domain) of IQGAP1. One possibility, which is supported by our coimmunoprecipitation data, is that activated Cdc42/RhoA binds to the Sec3/Sec8 subunits of the exocyst complex, leading to their interaction with IQGAP1. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, GTP-bound Cdc42p and Rho1p interact directly with the N-terminal domain of Sec3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). However, mammalian Sec3 has only weak homologies with yeast Sec3p within the Rho-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matern et al., 2001</xref>). It should also be noticed that the counterpart of IQGAP1 in yeast, called Iqg1p (or Cyk1p), binds to and is required for the localization of Sec3p to the site of polarized growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osman et al., 2002</xref>). So far, our attempts to pull down purified recombinant N-terminal fragments of Sec3 or Sec8 with immobilized GTP-Cdc42 failed (unpublished data). Whether the binding site of GTP-Cdc42/RhoA on the mammalian exocyst complex is provided by the Sec3 or Sec8 subunit solely or by the Sec3/Sec8 interface or even a more complex interface consisting of Sec3/Sec8 in association with other exocyst subunits will require further study.</p><p>Our data indicate that the activity of both Cdc42 and RhoA is required for promoting the association between IQGAP1 and the exocyst complex and that these two Rho GTPases are involved in separate nonredundant functions during the mechanism of invadopodial proteolysis of the matrix.

The picture that is thus emerging collectively from these previous studies and our work connecting Cdc42/RhoA with the vesicle-tethering machinery implies that the role of Cdc42/RhoA at invadopodia is not restricted to actin assembly but rather involves the coordination of cytoskeleton remodeling with vesicle docking/exocytosis for the generation of protrusions and for invasiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructions</title><p>To obtain expression vectors coding for human Sec3, Sec8, Exo70, and Exo84 C-terminally tagged with V5 or HA tag, ORFs were amplified by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen).

In brief, matrigel invasion inserts (top chambers) were rehydrated for 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C in culture medium.

Cells that had not migrated were thoroughly removed from the upper surface of the insert membrane with a cotton swab. Inserts were then washed with PBS, and cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Bio-Rad Laboratories), 200 mM MES (MP Biomedicals), pH 6.0, for 10 min. Inserts were washed twice with water and allowed to air dry. Membranes were then scanned with a scanner (Perfection 3200 Photo; Epson) at maximal resolution (6,400 dpi) and analyzed with multidimensional image analysis segmentation software to count the number of cells present on the membranes. This software uses wavelet decomposition to detect cells based on their homogeneous morphology on the scanned images, even when the background is not homogeneous. To allow better cell separation in aggregates, a watershed operator is applied in the wavelet maps. To obtain the invasion index, the number of cells that had migrated through the matrigel was divided by the number of cells that had migrated in the control inserts without matrigel. The invasion index of mock-treated cells was set as 100%.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 presents a summary of yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down interactions of IQGAP with the exocyst complex subunits.
