However, few studies have explored these mechanisms in primary cultured cells expressing endogenous levels of receptors. Accordingly, here we utilized the &#x003b2;-arrestin biased agonist for the angiotensin type 1A receptor, SII-angiotensin (SII), and RNA interference techniques to investigate angiotensin II (ANG)-activated &#x003b2;-arrestin-mediated mitogenic signaling pathways in rat vascular smooth muscle cells. Both ANG and SII induced DNA synthesis via the ERK activation cascade. Even though SII cannot induce calcium influx (G protein activation) after receptor stimulation, it does cause ERK activation, although less robustly than ANG. Activation by both ligands is diminished by depletion of &#x003b2;-arrestin2 by small interfering RNA, although the effect is more complete with SII. ERK activation at early time points but not later time points is strongly inhibited by those protein kinase C inhibitors that can block protein kinase C&#x003b6;. Moreover, ANG- and SII-mediated ERK activation require transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor via metalloprotease 2/9 and Src kinase. &#x003b2;-Arrestin2 facilitates ANG and SII stimulation of Src-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr-845 on the EGFR, a known site for Src phosphorylation. These studies delineate a convergent mechanism by which G protein-dependent and &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent pathways can independently mediate ERK-dependent transactivation of the EGFR in vascular smooth muscle cells thus controlling cellular proliferative responses.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grants <grant-num>HL 16037</grant-num> and <grant-num>HL 70631</grant-num> (to R.

The various functions of these receptors are mediated and modulated by three families of proteins, which share the property that they interact virtually universally with the receptors in a strictly stimulus-dependent way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). These three families of proteins are the heterotrimeric G proteins, the G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), and the &#x003b2;-arrestins. Activation of the receptors stimulates classical G protein-dependent signaling, often involving regulation of levels of second messengers such as cAMP and diacyglycerol. However, as has been known for many years, interaction of activated receptors with GRKs leading to their phosphorylation, and subsequent interaction with &#x003b2;-arrestins leads to desensitization of G protein signaling.</p><p>In recent years, however, it has become increasingly clear that the &#x003b2;-arrestin-GRK system is in fact bifunctional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). Thus, even as it desensitizes G protein signaling by the receptors, it also serves as a signal transduction system in its own right, activating a growing list of signaling pathways. These positive signaling functions are often mediated by the ability of &#x003b2;-arrestin to serve as an adaptor or scaffold molecule, bringing elements of diverse signaling pathways into proximity with one another and the receptors and thereby facilitating their activation. This new paradigm for understanding the previously unrecognized signaling properties of the &#x003b2;-arrestin-GRK system has been explored in a wide variety of transfected cultured cell systems.</p><p>However, to date, relatively little investigation of these novel signaling pathways has been carried out in primary cell culture systems expressing endogenous levels of 7TM receptors. In seeking such a system in which to characterize and compare &#x003b2;-arrestin and G protein-mediated signaling pathways from a typical 7TM receptor, our attention was drawn to cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Several features of rat VSMCs suggest this to be a relevant system for these purposes. Rat VSMCs express a variety of physiologically important 7TM receptors including the angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). This receptor has been the focus of extensive study in transfected cell systems with respect to its &#x003b2;-arrestin-mediated signaling to a variety of pathways, most particularly extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Moreover, the AT1R mediates the physiologically important effects of angiotensin II (ANG) on vascular tone as well as on proliferation and chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Pathophysiologically, ANG stimulation of this receptor has been implicated in VSMC proliferation and chemotaxis, which are thought to play an important role in such important disease processes as atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Moreover, a ligand has been characterized [Sar<sup>1</sup>,Ile<sup>4</sup>,Ile<sup>8</sup>](SII)-angiotensin (SII), a triply mutated angiotensin octapeptide that, in transfected cell systems, acts as a specific agonist for &#x003b2;-arrestin-mediated signaling, although not activating G protein-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>).</p><p>Accordingly, in the studies described here, we set out to investigate the characteristics of activation of ERK in rat VSMCs that might be mediated through G protein as well as &#x003b2;-arrestin signaling. The results not only demonstrate the importance of &#x003b2;-arrestin-mediated signaling in ERK-mediated proliferative responses of these cells, but also shed new light on the molecular mechanisms and interrelationships between the &#x003b2;-arrestin and classical G protein-mediated activation of these pathways.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Materials</italic>&#x02014;[Sar<sup>1</sup>,Ile<sup>4</sup>,Ile<sup>8</sup>]-Angiotensin II was synthesized in the Cleveland Clinic core synthesis facility.

To understand the functions of &#x003b2;-arrestins in endogenously expressed AT1R-mediated mitogenic pathways, we utilized a triply mutated angiotensin octapeptide (SII) that acts as a specific agonist for &#x003b2;-arrestin-mediated signaling while not activating G protein-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). To validate the utility of SII as an activator of only &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways in primary cultured rat VSMCs (as is the case with receptor-transfected HEK 293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>)), calcium influx in response to ANG and SII was measured. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>, VSMCs treated with ANG display robust calcium mobilization, whereas cells treated with SII shows no calcium mobilization, implying that SII cannot activate G-protein pathways in these cells. The ANG response is completely blocked in the presence of an angiotensin receptor type 1 blocker (AT1RB, Valsartan) but not by an angiotensin receptor type 2 blocker (AT2RB, PD 123319) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p><p>It is well known that ERK activation plays an important role in cell proliferation. To investigate the contribution of &#x003b2;-arrestin-mediated ERK activation to VSMC proliferation, we studied ANG- and SII-mediated DNA synthesis in VSMCs as an indicator of cell proliferation. VSMCs were pretreated or not with a pharmacological inhibitor (PD98059) of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) followed by stimulation with 100 n<sc>m</sc> ANG, 10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> SII, or 10 ng/ml EGF. Although SII cannot activate classical G-protein-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), it significantly increased DNA synthesis (thymidine incorporation) to a level similar to that provoked by ANG or EGF stimulation in VSMCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Pretreatment with PD98059 ablated virtually all activation over basal levels (<italic>n</italic> = 5; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), indicating that ERK activation regulates DNA synthesis in VSMCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). These data indicate that a G-protein-independent ERK activation mechanism that can be stimulated by SII can mediate AT1R-regulated DNA synthesis in rat VSMCs.</p><p>In transfected HEK 293 cells it has been demonstrated that SII elicits AT1R signaling to ERK activation without activating the G<sub>q</sub> protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> demonstrates the inability of SII to activate calcium fluxes, a classic G<sub>q</sub> response in VSMCs, whereas retaining the ability to induce DNA synthesis, which requires ERK activation.

Both ANG- and SII-stimulated ERK activation is completely sensitive to AT1RB pretreatment in VSMCs (data not shown).

Active phospholipase C generates inositol triphosphate and diacyglycerol, which increase intracellular calcium influx and PKC, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). We have previously found that in HEK 293 cells AT1R-mediated G protein-dependent ERK activation requires PKC activity. This process is rapid (peak &#x0003c; 2 min) and quite transient (&#x0223c;2 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Therefore, we assessed the role of PKC in mediating ANG-stimulated ERK activation in VSMCs by using PKC inhibitors. We tested several PKC inhibitors including GFX (bisindolylmaleimide I), Ro-31-8425, G&#x000f6;6976, and G&#x000f6;6983, which inhibit the activities of various combinations of conventional (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, or &#x003b3;), novel (&#x003b4;, &#x003b5;, or &#x003bc;), and atypical (&#x003b6;, &#x003b9;) isoforms of PKC in a concentration-dependent way. There was no significant inhibition of ERK activation by either 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> G&#x000f6;6976, a selective inhibitor of PKC &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003c7; (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>), or by 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> Ro-31-8425 (data not shown), a selective inhibitor of PKC &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003c7;, and &#x003b5;. ANG-mediated ERK activation was also not inhibited by either 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> G&#x000f6;6983 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>) or 5 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> GFX (data not shown), which at the concentrations tested only inhibit the activities of PKC isoforms &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b4;, and/or &#x003c7;. In contrast, pretreatment with PKC inhibitors (15 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> GFX and 10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> G&#x000f6;6983) resulted in dramatic decreases (&#x0223c;75%) in ERK activation at early time points (1 and 2 min) after ANG stimulation, but little inhibition was observed at longer time points (10 and 20 min) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The general PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced ERK activation and this was abolished by all of the PKC inhibitors used in VSMCs (data not shown). The kinetic pattern of ERK activation in the presence of the PKC inhibitors GFX and G&#x000f6;6983 in VSMCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) is similar to that observed previously for ANG-stimulated, &#x003b2;-arrestin2-dependent ERK activation in HEK 293 cells expressing AT1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Only early activity (<italic>i.e.</italic> prior to 5&#x02013;10 min of stimulation) was inhibited. Thus, the temporal patterns of G protein-dependent (PKC dependent) and &#x003b2;-arrestin2-dependent ERK activation through endogenous AT1Rs in VSMCs are distinct from each other. The majority of early activity (&#x02264;2 min) is elicited via the G protein-dependent pathway (PKC inhibitor sensitive), whereas late activity (&#x0003e;5 min) is predominantly mediated by the &#x003b2;-arrestin2-dependent pathway.</p><p><italic>PKC</italic>&#x003b6; <italic>Mediates G-protein-dependent ERK Activation Upon Stimulation with ANG</italic>&#x02014;Three isoforms of PKC, &#x003b1;, &#x003b4;, and &#x003b6;, have been shown to be expressed in VSMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>).

Furthermore, blockade of PKC&#x003b1; and &#x003b4; appears not to inhibit this ERK activation. Thus, we next examined the role of PKC&#x003b6; in ERK activation in VSMCs utilizing the RNAi technique. Transfection with PKC&#x003b6;-specific siRNA reduces the expression of PKC&#x003b6; by 70% in VSMCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>).

To further validate the role of PKC&#x003b6; in &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent (or G protein-dependent) pathways, we also stimulated VSMCs transfected with PKC&#x003b6; siRNA with SII.

However, it is not clear whether EGFR transactivation is required for &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent ERK activation in VSMCs. To answer this question, we examined ERK activation after ANG and SII stimulation in the presence of various pharmacological inhibitors of components thought to be involved in the EGFR transactivation pathway. First we tested the requirement for EGFR kinase activity in ANG-induced ERK activation. In the presence of AG1478, an EGFR-specific kinase inhibitor, ANG-induced ERK activation is dramatically inhibited at all tested time points (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>).

Here we investigated the novel roles of &#x003b2;-arrestins in 7TM receptor-mediated signaling in VSMCs. Classically, &#x003b2;-arrestins terminate signals emanating from agonist-bound 7TM receptors by physically interfering with receptor coupling to its cognate G protein (desensitization), and also removing receptors from the cell surface through initiating interaction with several elements of the clathrin-coated pit endocytic machinery (internalization).

Here, we studied ANG-stimulated ERK activation in a physiologically relevant cell type, rat VSMCs, and compared the results to those observed previously in HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with AT1R. Whereas, the overall patterns were similar, several notable differences were observed. AT1R-mediated ERK activation in VSMCs is more transient than that in AT1R-transfected HEK 293 cells. In the latter, ANG-stimulated ERK activation reached maximal levels rapidly, remained stable for up to 10 min, and decreased very slowly (over 1 h) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). On the other hand, ANG- and SII-induced ERK activation in VSMCs peaks at 5 min and is quite transient, decreasing to background levels by 30 min. This may be due to the very low levels of endogenously expressed AT1R in VSMCs (&#x0223c;15 fmol/mg). By utilizing &#x003b2;-arrestin RNAi and PKC inhibitors, two pathways for ERK activation by the AT1R expressed in HEK 293 cells have been distinguished previously; rapid and transient G protein-dependent activation, which is sensitive to PKC inhibitors <italic>versus</italic> slow and prolonged &#x003b2;-arrestin2-dependent activation, which is sensitive to &#x003b2;-arrestin2 RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). In VSMCs, pretreatment with PKC inhibitors also specifically inhibits early activation of ERK (1&#x02013;2 min) but not that at later time points, indicating that early activation of ERK requires G-protein-mediated second messenger production. Furthermore, depletion of &#x003b2;-arrestin2, but not of &#x003b2;-arrestin1, using RNAi leads to inhibition of ANG-mediated ERK activation at later time points in VSMCs. However, ERK activation at later time points in VSMCs was not completely abolished as was previously observed in AT1R-transfected HEK 293 cells, possibly due to incomplete depletion of &#x003b2;-arrestin2 (&#x0223c;70%) in primary cultured VSMCs.</p><p>Functions of &#x003b2;-arrestins as signal transducers have been demonstrated for many different 7TM receptors including angiotensin II type 1A (AT<sub>1A</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>), neurokinin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>), proteinase-activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>), vasopressin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>), CXCR4 chemokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>), and parathyroid hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>) receptors, as well as for other types of receptors including the insulin-like growth factor 1-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>), ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>), nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>), and transforming grow factor &#x003b2; receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). In the case of 7TM receptor-mediated ERK activation, the later phase of &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent ERK activation is sometimes blocked by depletion of either &#x003b2;-arrestin, by depletion of &#x003b2;-arrestin2, but not &#x003b2;-arrestin1, or vice versa depending on receptor and cell type. For example, both &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and -2 are required for &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent ERK activation mediated by &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>) and parathyroid hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>) receptors. On the other hand, &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and -2 show reciprocal functions in AT1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) and V2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>) receptor-mediated ERK activation; &#x003b2;-arrestin1 acts as a physiological &#x0201c;dominant-negative&#x0201d; of &#x003b2;-arrestin2-mediated ERK activation by these receptors. In the present study, ANG-mediated ERK activation in &#x003b2;-arrestin1 siRNA-transfected VSMCs was not enhanced compared with that from control siRNA-transfected cells except at the 2-min time point, and SII-mediated ERK activation was not changed in &#x003b2;-arrestin1 siRNA-transfected cells. Thus the role of &#x003b2;-arrestin1, if any, in modulating &#x003b2;-arrestin2-mediated ERK activation stimulated via the AT1R in VSMCs is not clear.</p><p>AT1R is a typical G<sub>q</sub>-coupled 7TM receptor that initiates generation of inositol triphosphate and diacyglycerol second messengers by activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. These second messengers in turn trigger mobilization of intracellular calcium and activation of PKC, which has been known to play important roles in AT1R-mediated ERK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). In VSMCs, PKC&#x003b4; has been known to be activated upon ANG stimulation leading to AKT activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>) and PKC&#x003b6; has been suggested to play a major role in AT1R-mediated ERK/Elk-1 activation via the Ras/MEK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). We showed that inhibition of PKC&#x003b6; activity using chemical inhibitors or by depletion of its expression by RNAi inhibited G protein-dependent (early time point) AT1R-mediated ERK activation in VSMCs.</p><p>Numerous 7TM receptors have been known to utilize EGFR transactivation mechanisms to activate ERK in various cell types. Moreover, it has been observed that AT1R-mediated ERK activation requires EGFR kinase activity in several cell types including C9 hepatocytes and COS-7 cells transfected with the AT1R as well as in VSMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>). It has been shown that G protein activation plays a role in AT1R-mediated EGFR transactivation through an heparin binding-EGF shedding mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). Here we found that the &#x003b2;-arrestin-biased analogue SII-ANG induced ERK activation and subsequent DNA synthesis also require EGFR kinase activity in VSMCs. Moreover, SII-mediated ERK activation was also inhibited in the presence of an matrix metalloprotease inhibitor, which is known to block heparin binding-EGF shedding in VSMCs, suggesting that &#x003b2;-arrestin2 as well as G proteins can mediate an heparin binding-EGF shedding mechanism in VSMCs. We also found that stimulation with either ANG or SII induced EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr-845 by Src kinase, which is known to activate EGFR. It has been shown that activation of many 7TM receptors recruits activated c-Src to the receptor complex in a &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). It thus appears that multiple signaling mechanisms can mediate AT1R and EGFR cross-talk in VSMCs. It will be of interest to determine whether distinct physiological outcomes of AT1R-mediated EGFR transactivation are associated with these different signaling mechanisms.</p><p>Several physiologic consequences of &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent signaling have been discovered in recent years. For example, &#x003b2;-arrestin-mediated signal transduction via the AT1R results in positive inotropic and lusitropic effects in isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). &#x003b2;-Arrestin-dependent ERK signaling regulates mRNA translation and protein synthesis via Mnk1, a protein that both physically interacts with and is activated by &#x003b2;-arrestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-Adrenergic receptors have been shown to mediate &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent transactivation of the EGFR thus promoting activation of the cardioprotective pathway in the heart that counteracts the effects of catecholamine toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>). In addition, atherosclerosis and restenosis in an animal model are aggravated by &#x003b2;-arrestin2 through mechanisms involving VSMC proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate the physiological and pathological importance of &#x003b2;-arrestins as transducers regulating mitogenic signals through 7TM receptors.</p><p>In summary, our findings indicate that for the ATIR in VSMCs G protein-dependent second messenger-mediated and &#x003b2;-arrestin2-dependent signaling pathways converge on transactivation of the EGFR and subsequent ERK activation. Each pathway contributes to ANG-mediated regulation of cardiovascular function. These results underscore the complexity and multiplicity of signaling mechanisms available to 7TM receptors and add to the growing recognition of the importance of &#x003b2;-arrestins as signal transducers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Donna Addison and Elizabeth Hall for excellent secretarial assistance and Drs.
