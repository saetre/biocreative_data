The functions and activities of the human enzyme (hPif1) are unclear, but here we describe its DNA binding and DNA remodeling activities. We demonstrate that hPif1 specifically recognizes and unwinds DNA structures resembling putative stalled replication forks. Notably, the enzyme requires both arms of the replication fork-like structure to initiate efficient unwinding of the putative leading replication strand of such substrates. This DNA structure-specific mode of initiation of unwinding is intrinsic to the conserved core helicase domain (hPifHD) that also possesses a strand annealing activity as has been demonstrated for the RecQ family of helicases. The result of hPif1 helicase action at stalled DNA replication forks would generate free 3&#x02032; ends and ssDNA that could potentially be used to assist replication restart in conjunction with its strand annealing activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Helicases are motor proteins that unwind duplex nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Processive helicases initiate unwinding at origins of replication and are responsible for providing the single-stranded template for DNA replication. However, under conditions of stress when replication forks stall or collapse at sites remote from origins of replication specialized helicases are required to re-start replication. These processes are best understood in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), but homologues of prokaryotic DNA repair helicases are also known in eukaryotic cells. This is exemplified by the RecQ family of helicases that unwind DNA in the 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and are involved in homologous recombination, the re-start of stalled replication forks and the implementation or transduction of signals that enforce an S-phase checkpoint. Several hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes resulting from mutations of RecQ genes are known demonstrating the importance of this helicase family in the maintenance of genetic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>The Pif1 protein has also been identified as a helicase required for genome stability. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Pif1 (<italic>S.c.</italic>Pif1) was first recognised as a non-essential nuclear gene required for the repair of mitochondrial DNA after UV or chemical damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), and for mitochondrial genome maintenance at elevated temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). <italic>S.c.</italic>Pif1 was later re-identified as a gene with a function in telomere length maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and a <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> gene with a function in genomic DNA repair, revealed by the sensitivity of mutants to DNA-alkylating agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Pif proteins are non-processive 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; helicases and member of helicase superfamily 1 [SF1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>)]. <italic>S.c.</italic>Pif-1 acts as an inhibitor of telomere addition in the telomere maintenance process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Other studies implicate <italic>S.c.</italic>Pif1 in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and Okazaki fragment processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), where it functions in conjunction with the Dna2 helicase/nuclease. Baker&#x02019;s yeast also has a second Pif-like gene, RRM3 [40% identical and 60% similar; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>)]. The role of Rrm3 appears to be to promote replication processes by displacing DNA bound proteins or resolving DNA secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> encodes only one Pif protein that is essential for completion of chromosomal DNA replication and hence viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Pif1 is conserved in eukaryotes and also shares significant homology with the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> helicase RecD, principally in the seven core SF1 helicase motifs. RecBCD is a bipolar helicase/nuclease complex that is required for Okazaki fragment processing and recombination-mediated rescue of stalled replication forks, suggesting this as another possible replication function of eukaryotic Pif1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Little is known about the replication pathways in which the human enzyme (hPif1) functions. Like <italic>S.c</italic>Pif1, the hPif1 gene is not essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and there are nuclear and mitochondrial splice variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The protein associates with telomeres <italic>in vivo</italic>, inhibits telomerase <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and siRNA-mediated depletion results in cell-cycle delay at S-phase, suggesting a role in chromosome maintenance associated with DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). We have characterized the DNA binding and unwinding properties of purified recombinant hPif1 helicase domain (hPifHD) and the full-length nuclear form of the enzyme. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A details the hPifHD fragment employed and the organization of the conserved motifs. In the N-terminal 1&#x02013;200 amino acids there is only limited sequence conservation and it has been suggested recently that this domain may have strand-annealing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). We show here that the hPif helicase core domain interacts preferentially with ssDNA molecules greater than 35 bases and that ssDNA interactions promote its DNA remodeling activities that include dsDNA unwinding and also ssDNA annealing. However, hPifHD and the full-length enzyme also act on synthetic stalled DNA replication fork-like structures <italic>in vitro</italic>, where the ds- and ssDNA components of the substrate contribute to structure-specific recognition. The net result of hPif action on such substrates is to displace an oligonucleotide corresponding to the putative leading replication strand. These data suggest that hPif may act on stalled replication forks and this activity may be important for genome stability. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Purification and enzymatic activities of hPifHD.

As the length of the 5&#x02032; tail increases from 25 to 55 residues (PST25 to PST55, lanes 16&#x02013;35), the initiation of unwinding was progressively more efficient.

Substrates PST0, PST5 and PST15 that were poorly unwound all bound hPifHD, but at lower extents compared with the other substrates (lanes 1&#x02013;12). Long dsDNA sequences (60 bp) were also bound poorly by hPifHD (see below). There was a significant increase in binding to substrate PST25 (lanes 13&#x02013;16) compared with PST15 and two predominant complexes, C1 and C2, were observed. For all other substrates (PST35&#x02013;PST65, lanes 17&#x02013;32), there were also two main complexes formed and probe binding activity was similar in each case.

Complex C2 was the predominant complex to form on the substrates that were most efficiently unwound (PST55 and PST65). The binding affinity of hPifHD and the ability to form higher order complexes on the substrates therefore correlates well with the ability to initiate unwinding. Furthermore, similar binding patterns were observed in the presence of nucleotide cofactors, although the binding affinities of all substrates tested were significantly reduced (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp671/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2A</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Binding of hPifHD to ssDNA</title><p>We also tested hPifHD binding to poly T oligonucleotides of increasing length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A).

With the concentration of hPifHD fixed at 50 nM we measured ATP<italic>ase</italic> activity at different ssDNA concentrations (25, 50 and 200 nM) of four polynucleotides of different length, T8, T16, T30 and T55. ATP<italic>ase</italic> activity in the presence of oligonucleotides T8 and T16 was low compared with T30 and T55 and did not rise significantly as the ratio of DNA to protein increased. The stimulation of ATP<italic>ase</italic> activity by T55 was greater than that for T30 at each ratio of DNA to protein and each increased with the ssDNA concentration. However, the stimulation of ATP hydrolysis promoted by T30 relative to T55 increased with higher DNA to protein ratios.

First, we generated fork-like structures with two ssDNA tails, by adding a 3&#x02032; poly C-tail to the substrate PST55 (55 base 5&#x02032; T tail, 20 bp duplex), as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, for fork-like molecules with a 3&#x02032; tail as short as 10 residues the proportion of substrate unwound by hPifHD increased slightly compared with PST55 at the lowest concentration of protein tested (lanes 7, 12, 17 and 22 compared with lane 2 and graph on the right). However, as the protein concentration was increased, the 3&#x02032; tails of increasing length were increasingly inhibitory for unwinding. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Unwinding of fork substrates by hPifHD.

We designed the test substrates so that both portions of the duplex were 20 bp and the same <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>, and increased the spacing between the duplex portions of the substrate stepwise from a nick to a gap of up to 30 unpaired T residues on the bottom strand. These are therefore flap-like substrates. The oligonucleotide with the 55-base T tail was displaced from the substrate with no unpaired T residues on the bottom strand (20 bp duplex arm) to a similar extent to the substrate with a 20 C residue 3&#x02032; tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, lanes 11&#x02013;15 compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 6&#x02013;10). Surprisingly however, the unwinding products of this and all other flap substrates consisted of fork molecules without the 20 bp 5&#x02032; oligonucleotide, as well as the ssDNA oligonucleotide with the T55 ssDNA tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Increasing the spacing between the duplex portions of the molecule from a nick to 10 unpaired T residues resulted in significant stimulation of formation of the ssDNA-forked molecules (&#x0223c;6-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 11&#x02013;15 compared with 6&#x02013;10). Increasing the length of the unpaired T residues between the duplex portions of the molecule to 20 (PST55-Gap20) promoted fork formation further, but there was no further increase with 30 unpaired T residues (PST55-Gap30; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 16&#x02013;24). The graph below on the left shows fork formation as a function of unpaired T residues for reactions at 10 nM hPifHD. Quantification of the assays performed with the PST55-Gap20 substrate demonstrated that the balance of product formation was biased significantly toward formation of the ssDNA-fork [i.e. displacement of 20 base oligonucleotide; reaction 2 (R2)], rather than displacement of the 5&#x02032; T55 tailed molecule [reaction 1 (R1)], as shown in the graph on the right. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C we have summarized the actions of hPifHD on these substrates (reactions R1 and R2).</p></sec><sec><title>hPifHD possesses an intrinsic strand annealing activity</title><p>One interpretation of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B is that hPifHD can engage gapped dsDNA molecules with an ssDNA flap and unwind either of the duplex portions of such molecules as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C. Another possibility is that the enzyme first engages and unwinds the flap duplex part (R1), reengages the substrate to displace the 20 bp oligonucleotide, and then promotes re-annealing of the molecules that comprise the ssDNA-fork. To test the latter, we determined whether hPifHD had strand annealing activity using the component oligonucleotides of substrate PST55-Gap20, each end-labeled with <sup>32</sup>P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3). For the substrate PST55-Gap20 (lanes 4&#x02013;8), the products of hPifHD action included the products of reactions 1 and 2 but not the free bottom strand of the template. Displacement of the 20 base oligonucleotide from this substrate was significantly more efficient than its displacement from the substrate lacking the extended free 5&#x02032; T flap (lanes 23&#x02013;27), suggesting that generation of the ssDNA fork-like molecules predominantly occurs by direct displacement of the 20-mer from PST55-Gap20. Surprisingly, when all three component-strands of PST55-Gap20 were mixed and incubated under the same helicase reaction conditions we detected a robust strand annealing activity (lanes 9&#x02013;12). Annealing of the long oligonucleotides to generate the single-stranded fork-like molecule was more efficient compared with annealing of the 20 base oligonucleotide to its complementary strand (lanes 13&#x02013;22 and 9&#x02013;12). Strand annealing activity did not require ATP binding and hydrolysis (data not shown). The conserved hPif1 helicase domain therefore possesses an intrinsic strand annealing activity, complicating a quantitative assessment of hPifHD helicase activity on ssDNA fork and flap substrates. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Strand annealing activity of hPifHD.

The apparent proficiency with which the substrate PST55 is unwound is likely a result of the inefficiency with which the enzyme catalyses the re-annealing of short duplex (20 bp) sequences. Given this, we sought to determine the effective strand displacement activity of hPifHD on extended duplex substrates. Substrates were generated with a 55 T 5&#x02032; ssDNA tail and a variable double stranded portion increasing in 20 base increments. The method that we used to generate the mix was based on the ligation of linkers to substrate PST55, modified to include a cohesive end that was phosphorylated with [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP. The substrate mix thus generated contains a population of molecules with an increasing duplex portion for hPifHD unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 1 and 2 show the substrate boiled and analysed on a native polyacrylamide gel, with or without formamide loading buffer.

Only the partially single-stranded substrate molecules with a 20 bp duplex were effectively displaced by the enzyme. The efficiency of unwinding of the 40 bp substrate was less than 50% of that of the 20 bp species and the maximum effective length of unwinding was less than 100 bp. We also note that the intensity of very high substrate bands appeared to increase with increasing hPifHD concentration in the reactions. It is unclear how these products form but one distinct possibility is that they arise due to the strand annealing activity of the enzyme. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Action of hPifHD on substrates with an extended duplex.

As before, DNA binding was assessed using the gel-shift assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D). Minimal hPifHD binding was observed with a 60 bp duplex molecule based on the lower strand of PST0-Gap 20 (lanes 1&#x02013;4).

A probe with a 40 bp duplex and a 20 T residue 5&#x02032; tail (T20-ds40) was bound by hPifHD at the higher protein concentrations (lanes 5&#x02013;8), consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). When the 20 unpaired T residues were positioned between the two 20 bp duplex portions of the molecule (PST0-Gap20), there was a significant increase in binding affinity compared with T20-ds40: Approximately 50% of the probe was bound by a 5-fold lower concentration of hPifHD (lanes 5&#x02013;8 compared with lanes 9&#x02013;12).

Similar binding affinities were observed with other double or ssDNA tails of greater length but complexes became difficult to resolve (not shown).

Our data therefore indicate that hPif1 is a structure specific DNA helicase with specificity for synthetic DNA structures resembling putative stalled replication forks and that the initiation of unwinding activity is dependent on both arms of the fork.

Work with yeast also implicates these enzymes in the maintenance of mitochondrial and nuclear genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The non-equivalence of function in related yeast species highlights the need for careful studies in mammalian cells. This assertion is strengthened in the light of recent, although contentious, data for other replication proteins. Zheng <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) have proposed that the human DNA2 helicase/nuclease, a key enzyme in Okazaki fragment processing, is a mitochondrial enzyme while the yeast homologue has a nuclear function in DNA replication. However, more recently Duxin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) have presented evidence that human DNA2 participates in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA maintenance. The Pif1 protein is envisioned to act upon specific nucleic acid structures that form during replication and require resolution before it can be completed. These include, in yeast, long flaps that escape FEN1 cleavage on the lagging replication strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). At the biochemical level, the helicase activity of yeast Pif1 resides solely in the conserved C-terminal two-thirds of the protein [&#x0223c;400 amino acids; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>)]. Here we show that the corresponding human enzyme specifically recognizes and unwinds substrates envisioned to form when replication forks stall, implying a role for the human enzyme in processing such structures.</p><p>Using linear partially single-stranded substrates we first established that initiation of 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; helicase activity by hPifHD is dependent on an extended 5&#x02032; ssDNA tail of 55 bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Complementing this, our ssDNA binding studies demonstrate high affinity binding to a minimal ssDNA sequence of 35 residues, with increasing affinity up to 45&#x02013;50 residues. Furthermore, the binding of multiple proteins to the longest oligonucleotide tested (55 T residues) was not observed and the protein&#x02013;DNA titrations suggest a 1 : 1 stoichiometry of binding. ATP hydrolysis by hPifHD requires ssDNA and the ssDNA length dependence for hPifHD binding apparent by gel-shift analysis is also observed for the stimulation of ATP<italic>ase</italic> activity required for strand displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This ssDNA length is large in comparison with other known helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and the data also hint at an unusual mode of binding as the mobility of the protein&#x02013;DNA complex appears to increase with DNA length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). One distinct possibility is that the ssDNA wraps around hPifHD, contacting one or more extended or remote binding sites on the protein surface. hPifHD binding affinity for the partially single-stranded helicase substrates also increased progressively with ssDNA tail length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). hPifHD bound predominant as two complexes, C1 and C2, of which the higher-order species (C2) forms more readily on the substrates that are more efficiently unwound. The related SF1 and SF2 helicases generally act as monomers or dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29 B30 B31">29&#x02013;31</xref>). Although the composition of the hPifHD unwinding complex is currently uncertain, the data indicate that the cellular DNA substrates of hPif1 may recruit multiple monomers and that functional co-operativity of monomers may lead to improved helicase action, as with other SF1 helicases such as the <italic>E. coli</italic> Rep protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>Helicases are viewed to translocate along one nucleic acid strand when unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). During the productive phase of unwinding the nucleic acid contacts made by the helicase would not necessarily resemble those for the initial structure-specific recognition of a preferred substrate. Thus, although partially single-stranded test substrates may be efficiently bound and unwound by a helicase they can give an incomplete view of substrate specificity. When we tested hPifHD unwinding of ssDNA fork molecules we observed only a modest stimulation of unwinding at low protein concentrations. However, higher protein concentrations, that otherwise promoted unwinding of the linear substrate PST55, appeared inhibitory for unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Similar results were obtained when the 3&#x02032; arm of the fork was converted to duplex DNA and a variable number of T residues introduced between this duplex portion and the flap junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B): Displacement of the 5&#x02032; flap oligonucleotide (reaction 1) appeared to be inhibited in favor of displacement of the 20 base oligonucleotide (reaction 2), even when very short stretches (10 bases or less) of unpaired T residues were available on the putative loading strand. The exact mechanism of reaction 2 on these substrates is difficult to determine. Our subsequent analysis demonstrated that although direct displacement of the 20 base oligonucleotides from its complementary strand is inefficient compared with the parent flap structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;8 compared with lanes 23&#x02013;27), a concerted mechanism of displacement coupled with the strand annealing activity of hPifHD could prevail. Several SF1 and SF2 helicases have been shown also to have ssDNA strand annealing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32 B33 B34">32&#x02013;34</xref>). We were surprised to observe this annealing activity since Gu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) recently reported that N-terminal sequences outside the core hPif1 helicase domain alone have strand-annealing activity. In the case of human RecQ5&#x003b2; protein, the core helicase domain (analogous to hPifHD we have analyzed) has a strong strand annealing but not strand displacement activity in the absence of an adjoining regulatory domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Our data demonstrate that full-length hPif1 has very similar DNA unwinding and strand-annealing (and also DNA binding) properties as those described for hPifHD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp671/DC1">Supplementary Figure 3</ext-link>), and hence the two catalytic activities appear to compete freely.</p><p>Although interpretation of the precise action of hPIf1 on ssDNA flap structures is problematic due to the strand annealing activity of the enzyme, the action of hPif1 on putative stalled replication fork structures is clearer. R2, potentially resembling leading strand reversal of such forks, is robust. This activity is significant even on substrates that contain only small regions of ssDNA on the loading strand of the fork (as little as 10 and as much as 20 unpaired T residues, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), much smaller than those required for efficient ssDNA binding and stimulation of ATP<italic>ase</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), or initiation of unwinding on simple partially single-stranded test substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Furthermore, initiation of unwinding is also dependent on structural features of the second arm of the synthetic replication fork. The dsDNA component is essential, although dsDNA itself does not bind or stimulate hPifHD ATP<italic>ase</italic> activity efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7</xref> and S2). On the basis of these data we speculate that hPif1 may recognize and process stalled DNA replication forks, reversing the leading replication strand to generate a free 3&#x02032; end and ssDNA. With hPif1 alone, this displaced DNA sequence may be small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). However, this could be extended if hPif1 unwinding were increased by a processivity factor as is the case with other SF-1 helicases such as RecD and PcrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), or may be sufficient if further processing involves the strand annealing activity of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). We also speculate that the structure specific mode of DNA recognition may restrict hPif1 activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although substrates with extended 5&#x02032; ssDNA tails are good substrates for unwinding <italic>in vitro</italic>, competition with RPA binding may prevent unwinding of such substrates <italic>in vivo.</italic> The ssDNA component of the stalled replication-fork like substrates we have tested is essential for the initiation of unwinding, but small in comparison to the described high affinity binding site size for RPA [&#x0003e;30 nt; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>)], thus such a competition for binding may favour hPif1 and this should be testable <italic>in vitro</italic> using the systems we have described. In summary, we suggest that hPif may have a role in replication control and replication fork restart mechanisms as has been described for other helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In the light of recent yeast genetics studies implicating <italic>S.c.</italic>Pif1 in processing G-quadraplex structures <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), it is also possible that hPif1 may rescue stalled forks resulting specifically from non-B form DNA structure formation. Our data will also facilitate the biochemical testing of this possibility in the human system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp671/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp671_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkp671_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkp671_2.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkp671_3.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Yorkshire Cancer Research grants (to C.M.S. and M.M.).
