Calorie restriction (CR) is the only intervention that reliably increases mouse longevity. There is considerable phenotypic overlap between long-lived mutant mice and normal mice on chronic CR. Therefore, we investigated the interactive effects of CR and targeted disruption or knock out of the growth hormone receptor (GHRKO) in mice on longevity and the insulin signaling cascade. Every other day feeding corresponds to a mild (i.e. 15&#x00025;) CR which increased median lifespan in normal mice but not in GHRKO mice corroborating our previous findings on the effects of moderate (30&#x00025;) CR on the longevity of these animals. To determine why insulin sensitivity improves in normal but not GHRKO mice in response to 30&#x00025; CR, we conducted insulin stimulation experiments after one year of CR. In normal mice, CR increased the insulin stimulated activation of the insulin signaling cascade (IR/IRS/PI3K/AKT) in liver and muscle. Livers of GHRKO mice responded to insulin by increased activation of the early steps of insulin signaling, which was dissipated by altered PI3K subunit abundance which putatively inhibited AKT activation. In the muscle of GHRKO mice, there was elevated downstream activation of the insulin signaling cascade (IRS/PI3K/AKT) in the absence of elevated IR activation. Further, we found a major reduction of inhibitory Ser phosphorylation of IRS-1 seen exclusively in GHRKO muscle which may underpin their elevated insulin sensitivity. Chronic CR failed to further modify the alterations in insulin signaling in GHRKO mice as compared to normal mice, likely explaining or contributing to the absence of CR effects on insulin sensitivity and longevity in these long-lived mice.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A vast majority of the mutations that delay aging and prolong lifespan in the mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) either directly or indirectly alter somatotropic and/or insulin signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004567-Tatar1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004567-Kenyon1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

This insertion mutation renders the GH receptor nonfunctional and causes severe GH resistance, leading to suppression of peripheral IGF-1 and insulin levels. In addition, GHRKO mice are markedly insulin-sensitive, tend to be hypoglycemic, have reduced body weight and size, reduced incidence of neoplastic disease and a pronounced increase in all lifespan parameters, including increased mortality rate doubling time (MRDT), as well as median, average and maximal lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004567-Miller1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004567-deMagalhaes1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004567-Coschigano1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, this parameter was not affected by CR in GHRKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004567-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). This finding suggests that while the enhanced amplitude of the insulin signal from the hepatic IR was maintained at the level of PI3K in normal mice on CR, GHRKO mice on either diet did not show the level of activation (as presumed by phosphorylation) that corresponded to the upstream activation of the insulin receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004567-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>An important downstream target of the insulin/PI3K signaling cascade is protein kinase B (AKT1).

GHRKO mice had comparable AKT2 total protein levels when compared to N AL mice. Acute insulin stimulation increased the levels of Ser phosphorylated AKT2 (pS474) in all groups (P&#x0003c;0.001). When compared to phenotype/treatment saline controls within groups, insulin increased the phosphorylation in N AL by 92&#x00025;, while N CR, KO AL, and KO CR groups had more than a 2 fold increase in insulin stimulated phosphorylation (N CR 2.1 fold, KO AL 2.05 fold, and KO CR 2.1 fold).</p><p>Hepatic insulin signaling cascade activation in response to insulin stimulation in normal mice on CR and in GHRKO mice on both diets is compared to N AL controls and summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004567-g002">Figure 2H</xref>. These data suggest that CR increases the levels of proteins involved in insulin signaling transduction and the activation of these proteins in response to insulin in normal mice, but has no effects in GHRKO mice. Curiously, the enhanced activation of the IR in response to insulin stimulation is not propagated downstream to the AKT proteins in GHRKO mice, whereas it is in the normal mice. In an attempt to understand this discrepancy, we explored the regulatory subunits of PI3K in normal and GHRKO mice fed AL or subjected to 30&#x00025; CR.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Determination of the PI3K regulatory subunits p85/p55/p50</title><p>To determine the relative protein abundance of the regulatory subunits of PI3K in the liver, we targeted the p85 subunit of PI3K for immunoprecipitation in liver homogenates and subsequently immunoblotted for the p85, p55 and p50 subunits of PI3K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004567-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

Similar to these findings, CR did not alter the level of these subunits in GHRKO mice, with the exception of a significant reduction in the p55 subunit compared to GHRKO AL controls (P&#x0003c;0.05). It has been shown that an alteration in a single regulatory subunit of PI3K may act to inhibit or bind up free IRS proteins and alter signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004567-Kahn1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004567-Minokoshi1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

We believe this reduction of the regulatory subunits of PI3K in GHRKO mice may underpin the dampened downstream activation (compared to activation of IR) of the PI3K/IRS, AKT1 and AKT2 proteins seen in the insulin stimulation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004567-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004567-g003">3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004567-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004567.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Liver PI3K subunit abundance in GHRKO (KO) and normal (N) mice fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> (AL) or 30&#x00025; calorie restriction (CR) for one year.</title><p>Liver protein isolates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-pan-p85.

This &#x0201c;flattening&#x0201d; of the median lifespan response in GHRKO mice on various levels of food intake shows that, in the absence of a functional GH receptor, CR does not affect longevity of male GHRKO mice. In other words, GH resistance ablates, rather than modulates, the key benefit of CR in these animals. In yeast and invertebrates the interactions between CR (or dietary restriction) and mutations that extend longevity have been explored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004567-Bishop1">&#x0005b;reviewed in 32&#x0005d;</xref>.

These findings in less complex organisms are confounded by two major complications. First, yeast and invertebrates have not evolved GH signaling pathways. This fact makes it difficult to interpret findings across species. Second, the method by which dietary restriction, or CR is delivered in yeast and invertebrates is quite different than the traditional mammalian model, further complicating interaction studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004567-Bishop1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In normal mice on CR, there is a major amplification of the insulin signaling cascade, with increases in protein concentration and/or (insulin-stimulated) activation of almost all the cellular mediators of insulin action tested in the present study (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004567-g007">Figure 7</xref>). These increases in the insulin signaling cascade in liver and muscle show that the previously documented improvements in whole-animal insulin sensitivity in response to CR reflect heightened insulin cascade action.

This convergence between normal mice exposed to long-term CR and innately insulin-sensitive GHRKO mice could explain why CR fails to further improve insulin sensitivity of GHRKO mutants or further extend their already-long lives. Another conclusion can be drawn from the differential effects of CR on the responses to an insulin challenge in the liver's insulin signaling cascade. While normal mice on CR showed improved downstream insulin action through increases in total protein and/or insulin-stimulated activation of several key elements of the insulin signaling cascade in liver, CR failed to produce corresponding changes in GHRKO mice. Additionally, both KO AL and CR groups had reduced downstream insulin-induced activation. This tissue-specific phenotypic dimorphism may have contributed to the absence of CR effects on whole-animal insulin sensitivity and lifespan in GHRKO mice.</p><p>Collectively, the present study identifies molecular steps of insulin signaling in the liver and in the muscle that are similarly affected by two conditions that extend life, CR in normal animals and deletion of the GH receptor, but are not altered by CR in GHRKO mice in which CR fails to increase insulin sensitivity and therefore longevity. This includes four parameters in liver and 8 in muscle (plus one altered by CR in the opposite directions in the two phenotypes). We suggest that these steps of insulin signaling are involved in the control of whole animal insulin sensitivity and mammalian longevity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Animals</title><p>GHRKO and normal mice were produced in the breeding colony at SIU-SOM Springfield, IL which was developed from mice kindly provided by J.
