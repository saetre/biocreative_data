Techniques allowing to control time and degree of gene silencing <italic>in vivo</italic>, however, are still lacking. Here we provide a generally applicable system for the temporal control of ubiquitous shRNA expression in mice. Depending on the dose of the inductor doxycycline, the knockdown efficiency reaches up to 90%. To demonstrate the feasibility of our tool, a mouse model of reversible insulin resistance was generated by expression of an insulin receptor (<italic>Insr</italic>)-specific shRNA. Upon induction, mice develop severe hyperglycemia within seven days. The onset and progression of the disease correlates with the concentration of doxycycline, and the phenotype returns to baseline shortly after withdrawal of the inductor. On a broad basis, this approach will enable new insights into gene function and molecular disease mechanisms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The application of Cre/<italic>loxP</italic> recombination has refined the tools for manipulating the mouse genome, allowing to determine site and timing of gene alteration in the living animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). An inherent feature of these recombinase-based approaches, however, is a non-reversible gene switch that does not allow modulating gene expression in a given cell. In addition, the derivation of conditional mouse mutants is costly and time consuming due to extensive vector construction, ES cell manipulation and breeding. The finding that stably expressed short hairpin (sh) RNAs can mediate potent gene knockdown in transgenic animals opened the opportunity to reduce time and effort for the generation of genetically modified mouse models significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). Conditional, RNAi-mediated gene knockdown in mice has been introduced by using Cre/<italic>loxP</italic> for tissue-specific control of shRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>). In contrast, temporal control of shRNA expression in transgenic animals has not been demonstrated so far.</p><p>Type 2 <italic>Diabetes mellitus</italic> is a growing problem to public health, affecting more than 5% of western populations. Progressive, late onset insulin resistance and inadequate compensation through insulin secretion from pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells leading to fasting hyperglycemia characterizes the course of the disease. Efforts of the pharmaceutical industry focus on the development of small molecules that increase the sensitivity of insulin receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Here, animal models of insulin resistance are essential tools for understanding the molecular basis of the disease. Furthermore, drug target validation and evaluation of test compounds in appropriate disease model mice support the drug discovery process. The use of current genetic mouse models of type 2 diabetes is not optimal for this purpose as they do not allow modulating the onset and the degree of systemic insulin resistance, and the genetic modifications are not reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The first aspect is particularly important for developing therapeutic interventions during the early phase of the disease, whereas the latter would allow dissecting acute effects of insulin resistance from late diabetic symptoms such as neuropathy and arteriosclerosis. As the current technologies for gene manipulation do not facilitate these aspects, we established a new approach for temporal modulation of gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In cultured cell lines, inducible expression of antisense or shRNAs has been achieved by using engineered, RNA polymerase III-dependent promoters containing operator sequences (tetO) of the <italic>E. coli</italic> tetracycline resistance operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15">12&#x02013;15</xref>). Binding of the tetracycline resistance operon repressor (tetR) to tetO blocks transcription, whereas de-repression is achievable by adding the inductor doxycycline (dox), causing release of TetR. Here we show that a codon optimized tet repressor, but not the wt coding region as employed in previous attempts, facilitates tight control of RNAi in different cell types and throughout development of transgenic mice. We found efficient, doxycycline-inducible silencing of both, a luciferase reporter and the insulin receptor gene, reaching 80&#x02013;90% repression in most tissues. By introducing single-vector-constructs into the ES cell genome via recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) and applying tetraploid blastocyst complementation we demonstrate the rapid generation of a reversible mouse model of type 2 Diabetes mellitus within 3 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Rosa targeting and exchange vectors</title><p><italic>Rosa26 Rluc vector</italic>: The Renilla luciferase gene (Promega) was inserted into the rosa26 targeting vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) 3&#x02032; of the splice acceptor site.

The activity of firefly luciferase was determined in different organs of the resulting mice. While the U6-<italic>tet</italic> promoter showed residual activity even in the absence of inductor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), regulation of H1-<italic>tet</italic> appeared tight in all organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The activity of H1-<italic>tet</italic> was undetectable before induction, but mediated a similar pattern of RNAi in the presence of doxycycline as the wild-type (constitutive) human H1 promoter in all tissues, except brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>)). In brain of doxycycline-treated animals, 50% knockdown was reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) in comparison to 80% silencing achieved by employing the constitutive H1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The limited activity of the inducible shRNA construct in brain may reflect a lower local concentration of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). A weak activity of the shRNA construct was also seen in spleen and thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and data not shown), which is in accordance with similar results using the constitutive H1 promoter in the same chromosomal context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The reason for this phenomenon is unclear. In all other tissues, induction with doxycycline resulted in efficient repression of firefly luciferase activity, ranging between 50 and 90% gene silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, white bars).</p><p>In previous experiments, we also tested the activity of U6-<italic>tet</italic> and H1-<italic>tet</italic> using the <italic>wt</italic> tetR in a similar configuration as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Here we detected a high degree background shRNA activity in the absence of doxycycline, particularly in kidney and brain (Figure S1). In other organs such as liver, muscle and heart, leakiness seemed less pronounced, indicating that limited expression of tetR might be the reason for the incomplete block of RNAi in some tissues. Comparing the expression level of wt and codon optimized tetR in transfected ES cells by western blotting supported this speculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D).</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of a reversible diabetes model</title><p>We next applied our H1-<italic>tet</italic> configuration for generating an inducible mouse model of insulin resistance and type 2 <italic>Diabetes mellitus</italic>.

Control animals expressing an unrelated shRNA against firefly luciferase showed no alteration of glucose homeostasis, even when treated with high concentrations of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). When crossed to wild-type C57BL/6 animals, INSR knockdown mice transmitted the shRNA transgene at mendelian ratios. Upon induction with 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml doxycycline, shRNA-transgenic offspring displayed the same phenotype as parental mice (data not shown), indicating that the transgenes are not silenced following germ-line transmission.</p><p>Upon removal of doxycycline from the drinking water, glucose levels declined within seven days and serum insulin returned to normal levels after 14 days, demonstrating the reversibility of the inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and B). In these animals, glucose homeostasis was fully restored as confirmed by glucose tolerance testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Accordingly, discontinuation of doxycycline treatment resulted in the reappearance of INSR protein in the liver within 21 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this work, we describe a straightforward method for the generation of drug-inducible knockdown mouse models. Several key issues for the state-of-the-art development of transgenic mice are addressed: (i) Reproducible transgene expression is warranted by the well-characterized <italic>rosa26</italic> locus. (ii) High targeting efficiency of transgene constructs into the <italic>rosa26</italic> locus is achieved by exploiting recombinase-mediated cassette exchange. (iii) Minimization of elaborated genetic modifications is allowed by a one-, rather than a multi-vector expression cassette. (iv) Tight and reversible regulation of shRNA expression is obtained by the usage of a codon-optimized tet-repressor. (v) Rapid generation of mice without further breeding is achieved by tetraploid embryo complementation. The type 2 diabetes mouse model described in this article illustrates the capability of this technology.</p><p>The model for insulin resistance presented herein, exhibits several advantages over existing ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). First of all, induction of insulin resistance allows to circumvent potential confounding developmental effects or compensatory mechanisms altering the phenotype. Moreover, the temporal control of insulin receptor knockdown can provide further insights into the impact of environmental factors prior to the onset of the disease. Second, reversibility of hyperglycemia provides a unique model to mimic the effect of an ideal pharmacological intervention. Along this line, it has so far not been established to what extent perfect control of metabolism after onset of disease is successful to prevent occurrence and/or progression of diabetic complications or lead even to reversion of them. Therefore, this model will be of central importance to gain better insights into not only diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, polyneuropathy, but also macrovascular complications such as myocardial infection and stroke. Third, the obvious doxycycline-dependent reduction of insulin repressor expression can be extended to carefully determine the critical threshold of insulin action necessary to (i) induce a compensatory increase in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell secretion and (ii) the occurrence of hyperglycemia. Thereby, these experiments will help to define the therapeutic efficiency required for reversal of clinically relevant insulin resistance. Finally, the single-allele configuration of the transgene circumvents time- and cost-consuming crossing experiments and makes it an ideal model for genetic screens for insulin resistance modulations, i.e. in a sensitized ENU-screen.</p><p>Previous examples of doxycycline-inducible shRNA expression were restricted to <italic>in vitro</italic> applications or gene knockdown in tumor cells transplanted into nude mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27">24&#x02013;27</xref>). The activity of such systems in selected cell clones are not predictive for <italic>in vivo</italic> applications in which a tight control of RNAi needs to be achieved in different cell types and throughout development. In addition, these approaches included random transgenesis or lentiviral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), each resulting in clones with unique, irreproducible shRNA expression patterns. Screening of several cell lines was required, which is laborious and time consuming. Therefore, these techniques, albeit being useful for the particular experiment presented, are not generally applicable for different biological questions.</p><p>Here, we show that a codon optimized rather than the wild-type tetR mediates tight control of the H1-tet promoter when integrated at the <italic>rosa26</italic> locus. ShRNA-mediated gene knockdown is achieved within 10 days of doxycycline treatment. The system appeared to be reversible within 14 days after withdrawal of the inductor. This is in accordance with previous observations that saturation of a system with doxycycline is an intrinsically faster process than depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The kinetics of reversible gene modulation may be further improvable by applying other tetracycline derivates with a shorter half-life <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The targeted insertion of all elements required for inducible shRNA expression into <italic>rosa26</italic> using RMCE, and the subsequent ES cell injection using tetraploid blastocysts accelerate the generation of conditional knockdown mice significantly: 2 weeks for cloning of the RMCE exchange vector, 3 weeks for generating targeted ES cell clones, 4 weeks for the generation of newborn mice. Therefore, our system facilitates a rapid performance of <italic>in vivo</italic> gene function studies, providing a generally applicable tool for reverse mouse genetics research. Moreover, it permits the investigation of the effect of gene knockdown after the onset of a chronic or acute disease. This aspect is of particular interest for pharmaceutical drug target validation, as inducible gene silencing in mouse models of human disease can provide an ideal surrogate for the treatment of patients with antagonistic drugs. Even multiple dose regimes can be tested in preclinical studies by applying several rounds of induction. Furthermore, reversible knockdown of drug targets can help to distinguish target dependent from target independent effects of drug action.</p><p>Taken together, the technology described provides a novel, rapidly applicable approach for the inducible and reversible analysis of gene function in mice, overcoming the limitations of recombinase-based conditional gene targeting.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We wish to thank Heidrun Kern, Maria da Silva, Marco Schneider (Artemis Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Cologne) and Sabine Jordan (Institute for Genetics, Cologne) for technical advice as well as Holger Kissel (Artemis Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Cologne) for critical reading of the manuscript.

Transcription of the RNA polymerase III-dependent promoter is blocked in cells expressing the tet repressor (tetR). Upon induction by doxycycline, tetR is removed from the tet-operator sequences (tetO) inserted into the promoter, allowing transcription of shFluc. ShRNA expression leads to RNAi-mediated knockdown of the target gene firefly luciferase. Renilla luciferase is used for reference to quantify firefly luciferase activity. <bold>(B)</bold> Scheme of the targeting strategy. ShRNA and reporter constructs were independently inserted into the <italic>rosa26</italic> locus by homologous recombination in ES cells. Genes encoding the <italic>Renilla</italic> (Rluc) and firefly luciferases (Fluc) along with an adenovirus splice acceptor sequence and a polyadenylation signal (pA) were placed downstream of the endogenous <italic>rosa26</italic> promoter. The Fluc-specific shRNA is expressed under the control of the U6-tet or H1-tet promoter, and terminated by five thymidines (shRNA). The <italic>loxP</italic>-sites flanking the shRNA expression cassettes were used to generate a negative control through cre-mediated recombination in ES cells. <bold>(C)</bold> Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from transfected ES cell clones containing the shRNA- (lane #1 and #2) or the reporter-constructs (lanes #3 and #4). Homologous recombination at the <italic>rosa26</italic> locus is detectable by using EcoRV-digested genomic DNA and probe 1, resulting in a 11.7&#x02009;kb band for the wt and a 2.5&#x02009;kb band for targeted allele.
