The purpose of this study was to determine molecular changes in membrane proteins in trabecular meshwork (TM) cells from POAG patients compared to those of age-matched normal controls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis profiles of membrane extracts from normal and glaucomatous TM cells were compared. The desired spots were identified after trypsin digestion and mass spectrometric analysis. Based on the results, a calcium-dependant membrane-binding protein, copine1, was further approached for a possible role in glaucomatous TM cells. The intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i) of TM cells was increased by incubating with calcium ionophore, A23187.

The cell distribution studies further showed that copine1 existed both in the membrane and cytoplasm fractions of glaucomatous TM cells but existed exclusively in cytoplasm fractions of their normal counterparts.

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of this disease, and its pathogenesis is still unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. It is widely accepted that elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), which is determined by the relative rates of inflow and outflow of aqueous humor, is a consistent risk factor associated with the development and progression of POAG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. As a major site of outflow resistance to the aqueous humor, the trabecular meshwork (TM) plays an important role in regulating IOP. Therefore, cultured TM cell models are indispensable study objects in the field of glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>].</p><p>Like those of any cell, the pathological features of TM cells are determined largely by molecular changes in protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Identification of differential proteins from TM cells of patients with POAG and those from healthy individuals in the same age range would help to understand the pathogenesis of POAG. Proteomics is an excellent way to screen for alterations in protein expression and has proved helpful in studying the pathogenesis of POAG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Characterizing membrane proteomes using large-scale, high-throughput approaches helps significantly in understanding the role of membrane proteins in physiopathology processes and drug discovery. To our knowledge, however, few TM proteome studies focus mainly on soluble protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], and membrane proteomes of TM cells are little understood at present.</p><p>In this study, we initiated a comparative proteomic survey of TM cell membrane extracts from normal and POAG individuals and verified the upregulation of copine1 in TM cell membranes of POAG patients. A growing body of evidence suggests that copine1 may mediate an array of cellular processes by conferring Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation to various signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. We elucidated further the ability of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, introduced into the cytoplasm of TM cells by applying calcium ionophore, A23187, to markedly promote the translocation of copine1 to POAG patient&#x02019;s TM cell membrane fractions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue procurement and cell culture</title><p>Normal eyes from five human donors were obtained from the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center Eye Bank within 24 h of death (due to automobile accidents). The ages of the donors ranged from 20 to 60 years. According to the records, no known eye diseases were detected in these samples used in the present study. After enucleation, all eyes were cut equatorially behind the ora serrata. The ciliary body, iris, and lens were removed, and the TM was dissected under a microscope (40X). After obtaining written informed consent, TM specimens from five POAG patients (15&#x02013;60 years old) were acquired by standard surgical trabeculectomy for therapeutic purposes less than 1 h after surgery. Prior to the surgery, clinical data was collected on each patient including age, gender, use of prostaglandin analogs, number of argon laser trabeculoplasty and other ocular surgical interventions, type and duration of glaucoma, IOP, and visual acuity. Glaucoma diagnosis was based on careful clinical eye examination including slit lamp, optical coherence topography, gonioscopy, fundus-photography, and visual field. The TM tissues from POAG (GTM) and age-matched non-diseased (NTM) individuals were used to generate independent primary cultures of TM cells as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. The samples were not pooled at any time in these experiments. Primary cultures were used at passages 4 and 5 for each experiment. Cells were grown in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM; Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 2&#x000a0;mM glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 0.1&#x000a0;mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained in a 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C humidified incubator in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Briefly, TM cells were seeded onto polylysine (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml)-coated glass chamber slides at a density of 2,000 cells per chamber. After rinsing the cultures with PBS, the cells were fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and treated for 4 min in 100&#x000a0;mM phosphate buffer, 1&#x000a0;mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.2% Triton X-100 to permeabilize the cell membranes. After quenching the endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the cells were incubated with 0.5% blocking reagent for 30 min (TSA-Direct kit, Dupont-NEN, Boston, MA) and then immunolabeled with one of the following antibodies at room temperature for 1 h: mouse monoclonal anti-fibronectin (1:200), rabbit polyclonal anti-laminin (1:200), mouse monoclonal anti-vimentin (1:200), mouse monoclonal anti-neuron specific enolase (1:200), and mouse monoclonal anti-Factor VIII (1:200). After incubation with the primary antibody, the cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated for an additional 45 min with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:300; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or anti-rabbit IgG (1:300, Vector Laboratories) where appropriate followed by avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex for 10 min. After a series of washes, the specimens were treated with 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine (DAB)/peroxidase reaction (Vector DAB substrate kit; Vector Laboratories), washed in water, treated with hematoxylin counterstain, washed again, and then dried at room temperature. The samples were then dehydrated in a graded series of alcohols and coverslipped with DPX.

The gel strips were then equilibrated twice for 15 min by gently shaking them in 8&#x000a0;ml of an equilibration solution containing 6 M urea, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, and 20% glycerol. DTT (1% w/v) was added to the first sample, and iodoacetamide (2.5% w/v) was added to the equilibration solution. SDS&#x02013;PAGE was performed using 13% polyacrylamide gels. At the least, triplicate gels were run in parallel for each sample.

After mass spectrometry (MS) acquisition, six of the strongest peptides per spot were selected automatically for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis. Data were searched using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK). The mass range was scanned from 700 Da to 3200 Da.

These results suggested that copine1 in membrane fractions of GTM cells may be relative to the pathogenesis of POAG.</p><fig id="f5" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Subcellular distribution of copine1 and its calcium-dependent association with membrane.

To address this question, we determined the redistribution of copine1 in A23187-treated TM cells. The membrane and cytoplasm fractions were then analyzed using the western blot method using the copine1 antibody. In NTM cells, copine1 was detected mainly in the cytoplasm fractions, and only a trace of protein was detected in the membrane fractions. In contrast, copine1 was present mostly in the membrane fractions and was completely absent from the cytoplasm in GTM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). These findings indicated that increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i stimulated the translocation of copine1 from the cytoplasm to the membrane in GTM cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The biological and pharmacological importance of membrane proteins makes us presume that plasma membranes of TM cells change during the development of POAG. To characterize membrane proteins of TM cells potentially associated with POAG, we compared the membrane protein profiles of glaucomatous TM cells and normal controls. One finding of this study was that a membrane-associated protein, copine1, was largely upregulated in glaucomatous TM plasma membranes. Furthermore, its conspicuous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent association with the membrane fraction was verified in glaucomatous TM cells using an in vitro fractionation procedure. Copine1 is a highly conserved membrane-binding protein found in a variety of eukaryotic organisms. Several studies have provided evidence that copine1 plays a role in growth control, exocytosis, apoptosis, gene transcription, and cytoskeletal organization and defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Although present in most major adult organs, copine1 has not previously been reported in ocular tissues. Therefore, the possibility that it plays a role in the pathogenesis of POAG has not been discussed.</p><p>Copine1 contains two Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, phospholipid-binding domains (or C2 domains) at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region, similar to those of protein kinase C and other proteins involved in the transduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. This suggests copine1 is involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated intracellular processes. The most well documented example is that copine1 regulates TNF-&#x003b1; signaling through NF-&#x003ba;B in human embryonic kidney 293 cells in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependant manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Although increased IOP in glaucoma is often associated with an influx of calcium, resulting in increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i of TM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>], we found that increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i could not increase the expression of copine1 in total cells. This indicates that upregulation of copine1 was not due to the increased level of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i in glaucomatous TM cells. However, in line with Tomsig&#x02019;s recent findings in human embryonic kidney 293, human bladder carcinoma T24, and rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells expressing human copine1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>], we found that the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> resulted in a complete redistribution of copine1 to membrane fractions in glaucomatous TM cells. These findings again demonstrate the characteristic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane translocation of copine1. Nevertheless, it is possible that the fractionation procedure of membrane and cytoplasm in TM cells, resulting in the change of actual calcium concentration, could affect the ability of copine1 to bind to phospholipids in the membrane fractions. This, in turn, may not reflect the distribution of copine1 in membrane fractions in the TM cells treated with A23187 and in the resting cells before fractionation procedure. Obviously, more work is needed to preclude this possibility, but at least some of the elements are in place. The membrane translocation of copine1 in this study at least in part explains the increased expression in plasma membranes of glaucomatous TM cells.</p><p>At the COOH-terminal region, copine1 has an &#x0201c;A domain,&#x0201d; which is similar in sequence to the von Willebrand A (VWA) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. VWA domains exist in several extracellular matrices (ECMs) and immune system components and interact with collagen proteins such as GpIb&#x003b1; and integrin &#x003b1;lib&#x003b2;3. It has been suggested that they adhere to and cause the aggregation of platelets, macrophages, and TM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. TM is composed of a complex ECM of collagen beams lined with TM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>], and perturbation of the collagen or the ECM composition in TM may lead to the elevation of IOP and development of POAG as a result of impeded aqueous humor outflow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. It is well established that copine1 may be oligomerized with target proteins in a calcium-dependent manner and thereby activate the targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that copine1 is able to recruit over 20 target proteins of which collagen is the only extracellular target identified by yeast two-hybrid screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. Thus, we guess that copine1, just like cochlin in glaucomatous TM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>], may interact with fibrillar collagens through its VWA-like domains, although copine1 has not been demonstrated to have access to the outside of cells. Increased levels of copine1 may help to dissociate collagen from other TM ECM proteins, perturb collagen fibrillar assembly, trigger collagen degradation, and result in elevated IOP. These above-mentioned findings indicate that copine1 may, in a calcium-dependent manner, be an intriguing culprit in the pathogenesis of POAG.</p><p>Another interesting finding of this study is that only a slight translocation of copine1 occurred in normal TM cells in response to the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a bulk translocation could have been expected. A possible reason for the discrepancy relates to the differences in the native expression of copine1 or protein activity between glaucomatous TM cells and normal controls. If the expression of copine1 is too low to bind the intracellular calcium, the target proteins are not transported to membranes, thereby causing a breakdown in the function of copine1. Thus, inactivated or low activation of copine1 in normal TM cells could not show a bulk response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, although this does not have to be the case.</p><p>In summary, we conclude that copine1 is upregulated in glaucomatous TM plasma membranes, and its upregulation may be explained partly by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent translocation to membrane fractions. However, the exact role copine1 plays in human glaucomatous TM cells still needs to be determined. Investigation of the role and functions of copine1 in TM cells should offer new insight into the abnormal intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling pathway in glaucomatous TM and help to clarify the molecular mechanism of POAG.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Dr. Xiangcai Ruan for helpful discussions and technical assistance.
