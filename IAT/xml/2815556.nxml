The classic manifestation of both familiar and sporadic PD is the formation of fibrillar structures of &#x003b1;S which accumulate as the main component in intraneuronal Lewy bodies. At presynaptic termini, the partitioning of &#x003b1;S between disordered cytosolic and membrane-bound states likely mediates its proposed role in regulation of reserve pools of synaptic vesicles. Previously, we reported on multiple distinct phospholipid binding modes of &#x003b1;S with slow binding kinetics. Here, we report the phospholipid binding properties of the disease variants, viewed by solution NMR in a residue-specific manner. Our results agree qualitatively with previous biophysical studies citing overall decreased lipid affinity for the A30P mutation, comparable affinity for A53T, and an increased level of binding of E46K, relative to wild-type &#x003b1;S. Additionally, our NMR results describe the distribution of lipid-bound states for &#x003b1;S: the population of the SL1 binding mode (residues 3&#x02212;25 bound as a helix) is augmented by each of the disease variants, relative to wild-type &#x003b1;S. We propose that the SL1 binding mode, which anchors the N-terminus of &#x003b1;S in the lipoprotein complex while the hydrophobic NAC region remains dynamically disordered, is prone to intermolecular interactions which progress toward disease-associated oligomers and fibrils. The elevation of the SL1 binding mode, unchecked by a proportionate population of binding modes incorporating the full N-terminal domain, may well account for the increased toxicity of the A30P, E46K, and A53T disease variants of &#x003b1;S.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>bi901723p</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>bi-2009-01723p</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="funding-statement"><label>&#x02020;</label><p>This work is funded by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health (Grant DK029047 to A.B.), and by the Leverhulme Trust and the Wellcome Trust (to C.M.D.).</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p id="sec1">In dopaminergic neurons, &#x003b1;-synuclein (&#x003b1;S)<xref rid="fn2" ref-type="fn">1</xref> partitions between a disordered cytosolic state and helical phospholipid-bound forms.

Three rare autosomal dominant missense mutations of &#x003b1;S, A30P, E46K, and A53T, have been discovered in European kindred with inherited early onset Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Wild-type &#x003b1;S is implicated in the pathology of sporadic PD, which accounts for the vast majority of cases. Whether familial or sporadic, the histological expression of PD is the formation of fibrillar structures of &#x003b1;S which accumulate as the main component in intraneuronal Lewy bodies and neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). The rate of fibril formation in wild-type &#x003b1;S is increased by the presence of dilute lipids and lipid mimetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>) but decreased in the presence of high lipid concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Among the three disease variants, aggregation kinetics also have been determined in vitro under lipid-free conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>) and in catecholaminergic cells with similar results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>), but expectations that the mutant proteins would systematically display higher aggregation propensity and faster fibrilization rates were not borne out. Instead, A30P fibrils form more slowly than wild-type fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), while the E46K and A53T mutations do result in faster fibrillization kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). Subsequent studies focused on the formation of prefibrillar &#x003b1;S oligomers, which have increasingly been hypothesized as the relevant toxic agent in PD. A number of studies in which preformed oligomers have been added to various membranes have observed vesicle leakage or pore formation, suggesting that neuron damage is the result of membrane disruption by oligomeric &#x003b1;S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). The rates of conversion among monomeric &#x003b1;S, prefibrillar oligomers, and mature fibrils in the A30P and A53T disease variants are altered from wild-type behavior in a manner that may allow a dangerous accumulation of early oligomeric species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). The extent of accumulation of E46K prefibrillar species, however, is reduced relative to that of wild-type &#x003b1;S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>).<fn id="fn2"><label>1</label><p>Abbreviations: &#x003b1;S, &#x003b1;-synuclein; BMRB, BioMagResBank; DOPC, 1,2-dioleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DOPE, 1,2-dioleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; DOPS, 1,2-dioleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phospho-<sc>l</sc>-serine; EBURP, excitation band-selective, uniform response, pure phase; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence; LUV, large unilamellar vesicle; NAC, nonamyloid component; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; PD, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease; REBURP, refocused band-selective, uniform response, pure phase; SUV, small unilamellar vesicle; TROSY, transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy; WT, wild type.</p></fn></p><p>The degree of residual &#x003b1;-helical propensity detected in the N-terminal domain of lipid-free &#x003b1;S, measured by deviations in chemical shifts from random coil values, has been used as an indicator to study structural differences between the disease variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). Partitioning of each of the constructs to a helical, bound form in the presence of lipid mimetics has also been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). Here again, the simple model that supposes that structure adopted in a membrane-bound conformation of &#x003b1;S would be protective against aggregation is not supported by the mutant &#x003b1;S data. The A30P variant does display lower helical propensity and disrupted membrane interactions; however, E46K partitions more easily to the bound state, while the A53T mutation exhibits a lower helix propensity combined with a membrane affinity comparable to that of the wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>). Clearly, a more detailed picture is needed to reconcile the fact that none of these hypothesized indicators (fibril formation rates, oligomer accumulation, residual helical conformation, or membrane affinity) satisfactorily accounts for the potency of the &#x003b1;S disease mutants.</p><p>For wild-type (WT) &#x003b1;S, we recently described distinct phospholipid binding modes that exhibit slow exchange kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>). Interestingly, evidence of slow exchange kinetics is also found in the study of interactions between fatty acids and WT &#x003b1;S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Though the bound modes are observed only indirectly because the large size and/or dynamic behavior of the lipid-bound states makes them inaccessible to solution NMR experiments, the bound segments of the protein can be resolved to the level of individual residues. Here we investigate the membrane interactions of the disease variants of &#x003b1;S in an analogous manner. The results reveal for each of the variants a redistribution of bound modes from that observed for WT &#x003b1;S. The implications lead us to propose a new mechanism by which &#x003b1;S is protected from or predisposed to the early events of aggregation.</p><!--with a head--><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><!--with a head--><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Protein Expression and Purification</title><p>Human wild-type &#x003b1;S with <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>2</sup>H isotopic enrichment was expressed and purified by anion-exchange chromatography as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>).

Therefore, extensive sequential NOE correlations observed for &#x003b1;S in the presence of lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>) were used to confirm the sequence assignments of WT &#x003b1;S in our work.

All vesicles used in our study consist of a 5:3:2 DOPE:DOPS:DOPC molar ratio, maintaining a net negative charge and lipid moieties native to the synaptic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). The size and curvature of our model SUVs approximate those of synaptic vesicles. These vesicles are added to a solution of &#x003b1;S, and their impact upon the two-dimensional NMR spectrum is monitored in a residue-specific manner (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A, shown for a small section of the two-dimensional <sup>1</sup>H&#x02212;<sup>15</sup>N correlation spectrum of E46K &#x003b1;S). The fractional attenuation of signal intensity for any given backbone amide <sup>1</sup>H&#x02212;<sup>15</sup>N cross-peak in the heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum indicates that a corresponding fraction of the &#x003b1;S population is engaged in phospholipid binding in a mode in which the amide group of this residue exhibits line widths too broad to be observed in the HSQC spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>). The retained signal intensity arises both from &#x003b1;S molecules that are fully lipid-free and from &#x003b1;S residues that are themselves free and dynamically disordered, even while an &#x0201c;upstream&#x0201d; (more N-terminal) segment of the same protein molecule is lipid-bound with its NMR signals unobservable. In both cases, the observed chemical shifts are identical to those observed for &#x003b1;S in the absence of lipids because they arise from &#x003b1;S residues in the dynamically highly disordered state.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Signal attenuation observed in the <sup>1</sup>H&#x02212;<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of &#x003b1;S corresponds to the fractional population of &#x003b1;S engaged in phospholipid binding at a particular residue location.

This result is reminiscent of the signal attenuation previously noted for aS in the presence of equimolar quantities of various fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). As observed for WT &#x003b1;S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>), each of the disease variants shows a differential degree of binding across its sequence, with the N-terminal residues (segments containing ca. the first 10, or the first 24, amino acids are distinguished in particular) partitioning most strongly into the NMR-invisible lipid-bound state. We term this first bound state, comprised of a short bound &#x003b1;-helix followed by dynamic disorder in residues &#x0223c;25&#x02212;140, SL1. A second bound state, which we term SL2, engages the full N-terminal domain, up to residue &#x0223c;100, in the &#x003b1;-helical conformation, while the 40 residues of the C-terminal tail remain flexible in solution. Akin to the wild-type scenario, each of the &#x003b1;S variants binds to SUVs with exchange kinetics that are slow on the NMR time scale, evidenced by the lack of significant broadening or shifting of any of the HSQC resonances, even while the intensities are attenuated due to lipid binding. The kinetics are investigated in detail below, but we point out here that the modes of binding are very similar to those previously described for WT &#x003b1;S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>).</p><p>To ensure that the binding modes observed for the &#x003b1;S variants are not the result of altered vesicle morphology induced by the mutant proteins, two additional experiments were conducted. In the first, we tested whether large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of the same composition as our SUVs alter the lipid binding profile of &#x003b1;S (Figure 2 of the <xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref>). For the first 100 residues, the attenuation pattern is essentially the same between the two vesicle sizes, indicating that the binding modes are insensitive to the initial vesicle diameter. In a second set of experiments, the attenuation of the signal for mixed samples of WT and A30P &#x003b1;S was monitored (Figure 3 of the <xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref>). Equimolar amounts of isotopically labeled WT and unlabeled A30P &#x003b1;S, or the reverse labeling scheme, were added to the lipid vesicles. As expected, WT and A30P &#x003b1;S compete (with A30P having a lower affinity) for lipid binding sites, affecting the degree of attenuation observed for each protein. However, the patterns of attenuation for WT and A30P &#x003b1;S remain unchanged in the presence of the other protein. While the lipid morphology may be disrupted by the presence of &#x003b1;S [as observed by cryo-electron microscopy on samples of &#x003b1;S added to the same SUVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>)], results obtained for the mixed samples indicate that alterations in lipid morphology are not responsible for the different modes of binding observed for each of the &#x003b1;S variants.</p><p>The lipid binding affinity of the first 10 N-terminal residues of A30P &#x003b1;S approaches that of the wild-type protein. A segment containing residues 11&#x02212;23 exhibits progressively increasing resonance intensity, corresponding to an increasing fraction of the disordered population, and the attenuation shows a flat profile at &#x0223c;75% intensity relative to the lipid-free state beginning from around residue 25, a point just preceding the mutation site. This indicates that for a fraction (&#x0223c;25%) of A30P &#x003b1;S residues 25&#x02212;100 are in a lipid-bound state, whereas for the remaining 75% of the protein, this part of the chain is fully disordered, in a random coil-like state. The weaker binding compared to that of WT for the majority of the N-terminal residues is expected on the basis of the decreased helix propensity of the A30P variant, as WT binds lipids in an &#x003b1;-helical mode. Proline is known to disfavor &#x003b1;-helix formation both because it has no amide proton that can engage in hydrogen bonding and because its cyclic side chain locks the &#x003c6; backbone torsion angle at approximately &#x02212;75&#x000b0;. While the overall bound population of A30P &#x003b1;S is only modestly reduced (54% bound) relative to the wild-type population (63% bound), the redistribution of bound modes is more striking: inspection of the curves for WT and A30P &#x003b1;S (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B) reveals that the ratio of SL1 to SL2 binding modes is greatly increased by the mutation.</p><p>In reality, the designation of SL1 and SL2 is a simplified classification comprising a number of different modes evident in the intensity profiles, each the result of a discrete set of contiguous, bound residues (always beginning at the N-terminus). Inspection of the A30P and E46K data series in particular shows a number of clear &#x0201c;steps&#x0201d; in the attenuation profile (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Even though such steps are not as pronounced for the WT and A53T series at low lipid concentrations, they are readily seen at higher lipid levels (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These intermediate-bound modes, terminating between residues 25 and 100, constitute distinct modes of &#x003b1;S that are differentially populated by WT &#x003b1;S and each of the disease mutants. Considering that none of the resonances shows line broadening or resonance shifting relative to lipid-free &#x003b1;S, each of these modes is separated by an energy barrier sufficiently large to give rise to the slow kinetics observed. In practice, accurate measurement of these modes is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio of the experiment and some instances of signal overlap in the HSQC spectrum, which becomes progressively more problematic for strongly attenuated resonances in the vicinity of much less attenuated signals from residues closer to the carboxy terminus. For this reason, the following analysis is focused on the simplified depiction of SL1, SL2, and their relative population ratios. The total population of bound &#x003b1;S (under any mode) corresponds to the fractional attenuation of the most N-terminal segment and is compared for WT &#x003b1;S and each of the disease variants in Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The fraction of &#x003b1;S bound as SL2 has been determined as the average fractional attenuation for residues 65&#x02212;80, where the attenuation profiles in Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B show remarkable consistency. The fraction of &#x003b1;S bound as SL1 was calculated by subtracting the SL2 fraction from the average fractional attenuation observed for residues 3&#x02212;9 (i.e., yielding the population that is bound at the N-terminus but not bound at positions 65&#x02212;80).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Effect of increased lipid concentrations on the binding of &#x003b1;S and its disease variants.

This result is readily understood from the viewpoint of electrostatics, since a negative glutamate is replaced with a positive lysine, favoring interactions with the SUV lipid mixture which carries a net negative charge. The mutation raises the net charge of the 100-residue N-terminal domain from +4 to +6. Though quantification of the simplified SL1:SL2 ratio in the E46K mutant appears to be essentially the same as for WT, the increased affinity nevertheless increases the population of SL1 by &#x0223c;25%.</p><p>Among the three disease variants, the A53T mutation has the most subtle effect upon lipid binding. The attenuation profile (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B) is only slightly offset from the WT curve, correlating to a modest elevation of the SL1 binding mode, even while the overall binding affinity (absolute fraction bound under any mode) appears similar to that of the wild type. To a lesser degree than for the A30P mutation, A53T also exhibits an increase in the ratio of SL1- to SL2-bound populations.</p><p>The results above describe the lipid-limited case, where the different bound modes are in competition for phospholipid targets. The bound populations of &#x003b1;S have also been quantified at an intermediate lipid concentration (lipid:&#x003b1;S ratio of &#x0223c;11) and under excess lipid conditions (lipid:&#x003b1;S ratio of &#x0223c;86). As before, the attenuation of the signal in the HSQC spectrum is used as a reporter of binding in a site-specific manner (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Particularly at the highest lipid concentrations, these measurements are made more difficult because the signal-to-noise ratio suffers for the highly attenuated resonances. Additionally, the intensity ratios determined for resonances of the C-terminal tail become less consistent as these peaks show small heterogeneities in their shifts under these high-lipid conditions, manifesting themselves as multiple small distinct shoulders or very proximate weaker resonances (data not shown). These chemical shift heterogeneities result in some scatter of the intensities measured for this region. Nevertheless, these attenuation patterns show the excess lipid condition to be a continuous extension of the lipid-limited case and allow us to compare trends between the &#x003b1;S variants.</p><p>At a weight by volume lipid concentration of 2.0% (lipid:protein molar ratio of 86), reliable intensities for the &#x0223c;20 N-terminal residues can no longer be detected for any of the variants. Stronger lipid partitioning of E46K &#x003b1;S persists even with the lipid limiting condition removed, as residues up to position 53 are unobserved for this variant (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). For A30P &#x003b1;S, deficient binding of residues 24&#x02212;36 persists at the intermediate lipid concentration (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A) and at the highest lipid concentration, curiously, shows a higher free fraction for this segment than residues located adjacently in the C-terminal direction. This suggests that the helix-perturbing mutation also can result in a high level of local dynamic disorder for these residues, even while the remainder of the N-terminal domain remains tightly bound. The fact that these resonances are observed and exhibit random coil-type line widths is further evidence of the &#x0201c;jointed&#x0201d; lipid binding of &#x003b1;S, which displays sharp boundaries between ordered and highly flexible residues. In spite of these observations, other binding features that differentiate the &#x003b1;S variants at low lipid concentrations are largely absent at the higher lipid concentrations investigated. In particular, no appreciable free population persists for any of the variants in excess lipids. If the factors that dispose &#x003b1;S toward disease are linked to its capacity to bind lipids, it is likely that deficits would be most acute under competitive binding conditions, as observed in Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p></sec><!--with a head--><sec id="sec3.2"><title>Kinetics of Binding Are Affected by &#x003b1;S Mutations</title><p>The altered steady state bound populations of &#x003b1;S disease variants could be due to changes in the lipid association rate, dissociation rate, or both.

Such a measurement is only possible when the free&#x02212;bound forward transition occurs on a time scale not much slower than the inverse of the intrinsic transverse relaxation rate of the random coil state and is a remarkable feature of the long-lived exchangeable states of &#x003b1;S and the slow transverse relaxation of dynamically disordered &#x003b1;S.

Comparison of the rates measured for WT, E46K, and A53T &#x003b1;S reveals minimal differences between the data series, signifying nearly identical association rates for these variants (plots not shown, but rates summarized in Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In the case of E46K &#x003b1;S, for which the equilibrium constant is increased (i.e., the bound fraction is increased), this unaltered association rate specifies that the lipid dissociation rate must be slower than that of the wild type. In contrast, the A30P mutation results in lower <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub><sup>T</sup> values relative to that of WT &#x003b1;S under identical lipid conditions (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Analogously, 3D HMQC-NOE-HMQC spectra were acquired for each of the disease variants in the presence of 0.06% lipid (lipid:protein molar ratio of &#x0223c;1.3). Because NOE experiments store magnetization along the longitudinal axis, protein molecules that associate as a bound complex and dissociate within the NOE mixing time of the experiment retain the &#x0201c;memory&#x0201d; of their bound state and display cross-peaks that report on NOE magnetization transfer that took place during that time. As found for the 40 C-terminal residues, and previously observed for WT &#x003b1;S in the absence of lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>), NOE magnetization transfer for the disordered, random coil state of &#x003b1;S is very slow, contributing minimally to cross-peaks between the amide protons. NOE cross-peaks observed for the 100 N-terminal residues in the presence of lipids therefore are dominated by the structure and dynamics in the lipid-bound state.</p><p>In comparison to lipid-bound WT &#x003b1;S, which displays numerous <italic>i</italic> to <italic>i</italic> &#x000b1; <italic>n</italic> connectivities (up to <italic>n</italic> = 6) due to extensive spin diffusion in the dark state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>), the NOE cross-peak pattern in A30P &#x003b1;S is sharply reduced. Throughout the SL2 region, cross-peak intensity ratios, relative to the diagonal peak of a given residue, are approximately 2-fold weaker than the corresponding cross-peaks of WT &#x003b1;S under the same conditions (data not shown). This result agrees well with the attenuation data of Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B which shows nearly twice the SL2 population for WT versus A30P &#x003b1;S and simply reflects the lower signal-to-noise ratio for cross-peaks arising from a reduced bound population in the mutant. However, in the N-terminal segment preceding position 30, the pattern of cross-peaks observed is additionally affected by the mutation. Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows a number of strips taken from the 3D HMQC-NOE-HMQC spectrum for residues G25&#x02212;L38 of the A30P variant. In contrast to what was previously seen for WT &#x003b1;S, in the vicinity of the mutation site, the monotonic decrease in cross-peak intensities for increasing <italic>n</italic> is not observed in all cases.

A prior NMR study of binding of &#x003b1;S and two of its mutants, A30P and A53T, to lipid vesicles of various compositions observed spectral intensities in terms of average lipid binding capacity of the protein&#x02019;s &#x0223c;100 N-terminal residues, and its 40-residue acidic C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>). When using this coarse distinction, the results presented here fully agree with the earlier conclusions that on average the lipid binding propensity of the 100 N-terminal residues is higher than for the C-terminal tail, with little impact from the disease mutations. However, when analyzing the data in the site-specific manner employed in this study, we see considerable differences. For example, we find that the 12 N-terminal residues of the A30P mutant retain high lipid binding affinity and that the N-terminal domain region following the mutation site (residues G31&#x02212;L100) binds in an &#x0201c;all-or-nothing&#x0201d; fashion, yielding a very flat attenuation pattern for this region, whereas for WT and the other disease variants, the level of attenuation decreases when moving in the C-terminal direction. The latter points to distinctly different stable binding modes, which terminate at different locations in the G31&#x02212;L100 segment. For the 40 C-terminal residues, no lipid binding is observed at low lipid:&#x003b1;S ratios, but as previously observed for WT, considerable resonance attenuation is seen at high ratios, with distinct steps at locations that coincide with the positions of proline residues (at P120 and P128). No large differences between the lipid binding characteristics of WT and the three mutants are seen at high lipid:protein ratios, however.</p><!--with a head--><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Forces Driving the Binding Kinetics of the &#x003b1;S&#x02212;Lipid Particle</title><p>The opposite effects on the kinetics of lipid binding induced by the A30P and E46K mutations shed light on the forces driving the &#x003b1;S&#x02212;lipid interaction. The lipid association rate is sensitive to the helical propensity of &#x003b1;S (which is impaired by the A30P mutation), while the dissociation rate is more sensitive to electrostatic interactions (which are promoted by the E46K mutation). Binding can be viewed as a two-step process of encounter and reaction. In the case of binding of &#x003b1;S to lipid, the overall observed rate appears to be governed by the reaction after encounter with lipids, since the A30P mutation can slow the association rate. This inhibition of <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> is likely caused by the inability of free A30P &#x003b1;S to transiently adopt an ideal &#x003b1;-helical conformation encompassing the mutation site. Formation of the &#x003b1;-helical secondary structure alone, however, is insufficient to provide the driving force for the association of the &#x003b1;S&#x02212;lipid particle since there is little free energy difference between backbone residues forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds to stabilize the &#x003b1;S helix and the same backbone residues forming hydrogen bonds to solvent molecules, resulting in the modest &#x003b1;-helical propensity observed for &#x003b1;S in free solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). Consequently, the interaction of hydrophobic side chains of the N-terminal domain of &#x003b1;S with the hydrocarbon tails of the lipids is the likely driving force of association. Lowering the population of a helical &#x0201c;transition state&#x0201d; which exposes its hydrophobic side chains in a pattern ready for lipid association will therefore slow the lipid binding rate. Once &#x003b1;S is bound to the negatively charged lipids, however, electrostatic interactions dominate the stability of the particle. The favorable changes in electrostatics in the E46K variant when bound to negatively charged lipids slow the dissociation of &#x003b1;S from the particle. Since charge&#x02212;charge attraction or repulsion is effective only over relatively short distances (the Debye length is approximately 12 &#x000c5; for aqueous samples at low salt concentrations), the dissociation rate is more likely to be impacted by electrostatics than the encounter rate between the helical state of &#x003b1;S and lipids.</p><p>The low lipid:protein stoichiometry (approximately 2:1) of the bound complex necessarily results in a highly charged bound complex. The 100 N-terminal residues of &#x003b1;S carry a net charge of +4, while 30% of the lipids in the DOPE/DOPS/DOPC SUVs are negatively charged. Although the lipid composition of the &#x003b1;S&#x02212;lipid particles is not precisely known, even if the &#x003b1;S-binding lipids were restricted to the negatively charged DOPS component, the core of the resulting particle carries a substantial positive charge. For higher-order oligomers, the particle likely cannot be sustained without substantial charge compensation. Attenuation of the C-terminal residues at higher lipid concentrations (see, e.g., Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) indicates an interaction of this tail for a fraction of the proteins in the particle and may reflect the association of the negatively charged tail (net charge of &#x02212;13) with the bound complex as a means of neutralizing the positive core. Indeed, the C-terminal residues of the E46K variant show more attenuation than those of WT or other &#x003b1;S variants under dilute lipid conditions (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). A recent study also notes an increased number of C-terminal to N-terminal contacts in the absence of lipids for the E46K mutant, as determined by solution NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>).</p></sec><!--with a head--><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Possible Mechanism for the Potency of A30P, E46K, and A53T Mutations</title><p>Under lipid-limited conditions, partitioning of the distinct phospholipid binding modes of &#x003b1;S is affected by each of the three known disease mutations. The higher, comparable, and lower total lipid affinities of E46K, A53T, and A30P &#x003b1;S variants have, to this point, been difficult to understand with respect to PD etiology. This paradox, however, appears to be largely resolved when considering the relative ratios of the different lipid-bound states of &#x003b1;S, in addition to global binding. For each of the disease variants, a redistribution of bound modes, relative to wild-type &#x003b1;S, is observed.</p><p>The absolute fraction of &#x003b1;S bound as SL1 is significantly increased by the E46K mutation, while the relative abundance of binding modes SL1 and SL2 is increased by the A30P and A53T mutations (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In the case of A30P &#x003b1;S, the SL1 binding mode even outnumbers the SL2 binding mode at low lipid concentrations, which represents an inversion from the wild-type populations. Although we are unable to directly measure the SL1 concentration in its relevant cellular environment, our data strongly suggest it to be impacted by the SL1:SL2 ratio. Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> schematically illustrates how the SL1 binding mode, which anchors the N-terminus of &#x003b1;S in the lipoprotein complex while the more hydrophobic NAC region remains disordered, is prone to intermolecular interactions which may progress toward disease-associated oligomers and fibrils. We propose that the increase in SL1 levels, associated with the perturbation of the SL1:SL2 distribution, may contribute to the increased toxicity of the A30P and A53T disease variants of &#x003b1;S, whereas for the E46K variant, it is the higher membrane affinity that increases the SL1 concentration.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Schematic depicting the proposed increased vulnerability of &#x003b1;S to self-association when engaged in the SL1 binding mode vs SL2.

Indeed, the duplication or triplication of the SNCA gene that encodes &#x003b1;S synuclein has also been correlated with genetic PD. The scheme proposed here extends this argument by highlighting the fact that lipid-limited conditions additionally promote a more aggregation-prone lipid binding mode of &#x003b1;S (SL1), while decreasing the level of conformations that may naturally work to offset aggregation propensity (SL2 or intermediate modes). Next to the increase in the relative concentration of fibril formation-prone SL1, it is important to note that the SL1 binding mode arranges the NAC region of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>) in a roughly parallel arrangement, promoting the formation of parallel &#x003b2;-sheet secondary structure observed for this region in amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>). Therefore, when the molecules are lined up in-register, the risk for aggregation is particularly increased. The E46K variant, which overpopulates this binding mode, and the A30P and A53T variants, which elevate the SL1:SL2 ratio of binding modes relative to that of WT &#x003b1;S, all exhibit increased potential for this fibril-prone condition.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank James Masse, Nick Fitzkee, Frank Delaglio, and Alex Grishaev for help with data analysis and Danny Shang-Te Hsu for valuable help in the initial phase of this study.</p></ack><notes id="notes-1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p><sup>1</sup>H&#x02212;<sup>15</sup>N chemical shift assignments for disordered WT, A30P, E46K, and A53T &#x003b1;S; strip plots corresponding to the 3D HMQC-NOE-HMQC spectrum of A53T &#x003b1;S in the presence of dilute lipids; plot comparing WT &#x003b1;S HSQC attenuation in the presence of SUVs and LUVs; plots of HSQC attenuation for mixed samples of WT and A30P &#x003b1;S; and 1D <sup>1</sup>H spectra of phospholipids incorporated into SUVs versus LUVs.
