The sequence we obtained is substantially different from previously reported partial mastodon mitochondrial DNA sequences. By comparing those partial sequences to other proboscidean sequences, we conclude that we have obtained the first sequence of mastodon DNA ever reported. Using the sequence of the mastodon, which diverged 24&#x02013;28 million years ago (mya) from the Elephantidae lineage, as an outgroup, we infer that the ancestors of African elephants diverged from the lineage leading to mammoths and Asian elephants approximately 7.6 mya and that mammoths and Asian elephants diverged approximately 6.7 mya. We also conclude that the nuclear genomes of the African savannah and forest elephants diverged approximately 4.0 mya, supporting the view that these two groups represent different species. Finally, we found the mitochondrial mutation rate of proboscideans to be roughly half of the rate in primates during at least the last 24 million years.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>We determined the complete mitochondrial genome of the mastodon <italic>(Mammut americanum),</italic> a recently extinct relative of the living elephants that diverged about 26 million years ago. We obtained the sequence from a tooth dated to 50,000&#x02013;130,000 years ago, increasing the specimen age for which such palaeogenomic analyses have been done by almost a complete glacial cycle. Using this sequence, together with mitochondrial genome sequences from two African elephants, two Asian elephants, and two woolly mammoths (all of which have been previously sequenced), we show that mammoths are more closely related to Asian than to African elephants. Moreover, we used a calibration point lying outside the Elephantidae radiation (elephants and mammoths), which enabled us to estimate accurately the time of divergence of African elephants from Asian elephants and mammoths (about 7.6 million years ago) and the time of divergence between mammoths and Asian elephants (about 6.7 million years ago). These dates are strikingly similar to the divergence time for humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, and raise the possibility that the speciation of mammoth and elephants and of humans and African great apes had a common cause. Despite the similarity in divergence times, the substitution rate within primates is more than twice as high as in proboscideans.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The first complete mitochondrial DNA genome for the mastodon extends the age range for genomic analyses by almost a complete glacial cycle and resolves the relationships among African and Asian elephants and mammoths.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Rohland N, Malaspinas AS, Pollack JL, Slatkin M, Matheus P, et al.

With the appropriate and adequate amount of data, it is possible not only to determine relationships among species, but also to date divergence events between lineages.

The power of these correlations, and arguments for particular environmental mechanisms driving evolutionary change, increases when the pattern is repeated across multiple taxa.</p><p>Sequencing complete mitochondrial genomes has become a powerful tool in the investigation of phylogenetic relationships among animal groups, principally mammals, birds, and fishes.

The evolution of Elephantidae, which includes the recently extinct mammoths, has been extensively studied in recent years using both modern and ancient sequences of mtDNA and nuclear DNA (nuDNA).

However, another study analyzing several nuDNA segments cautioned that the lack of a closely related outgroup is a problem in phylogenetic analyses of Elephantidae and argued that the relationship between mammoth and the living elephants is still unresolved &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. To date, all genetically based analyses of elephant phylogenies have used dugong <italic>(Dugong dugon)</italic> and hyrax <italic>(Procavia capensis)</italic> as outgroups.

Moreover, mastodon fossils preserved in permafrost and dating to the late Pleistocene have been recovered in eastern Beringia (Alaska and Yukon). Their young age and preservation in permafrost means Beringian mastodon are excellent candidates for ancient DNA analyses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. The good biochemical preservation of mastodon samples was appreciated early in the study of ancient DNA. In 1985, Shoshani and colleagues determined the immunological distances of albumins among mammoth, mastodon, and African and Asian elephant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We report here what is to our knowledge the first complete mitochondrial genome for mastodon. The sequence was derived from a tooth collected in northern Alaska, where Pleistocene bones are well-preserved in permafrost. Collagen from the root of the tooth was radiocarbon-dated to more than 50,000 y before present (BP), but the geological provenance suggests it is not older than 130,000 y (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). This extremely old and complete sequence is of interest in its own right, but it also can be used to help resolve existing debates concerning the phylogeny of the Elephantidae and allows us to evaluate rates of molecular evolution within the Proboscidea, because it finally provides an appropriate outgroup for such analyses. Here, we use the mastodon mtDNA sequence to resolve relationships among African elephants, Asian elephants, and mammoths and to more accurately date their divergence times.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sequence Determination and Characteristics</title><p>To determine the mastodon mtDNA genome sequence, we used 78 primer pairs, separated into two sets of 39 pairs each, on DNA extract from a mastodon molar originating from northern Alaska (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050207-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and performed quadruplicate amplifications for each primer pair. In the first round of amplification, 48 primer pairs yielded at least one positive result, and for 36 primer pairs all four attempts were positive. To obtain the remaining fragments, we used four consecutive rounds of redesigning primers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050207-sd001">Protocol S1</xref> for details). In each round, whenever possible, we used the mastodon sequences from flanking fragments as the basis for primer design. With three primer pairs, PCR controls or extraction controls yielded products of the correct size. All three cases of contamination occurred with primers for which it was not possible to design the primers in a way that they selected against the amplification of human DNA. The resulting products were cloned and sequenced and turned out to be exclusively of human origin. Two out of six clones obtained from a single amplification from mastodon extract using one of these primer pairs were also of human origin. We did not replicate part of the mastodon sequence in an independent laboratory, following the argument we have made previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, and in contrast to Cooper and Poinar &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;, who argued that this is necessary in all ancient DNA studies. None of the determined sequence fragments was identical to any known sequence either from GenBank or determined previously in our laboratory. Moreover, to ensure authenticity of each individual fragment, apart from extensive internal replication, we compared each PCR fragment individually to all published sequences from GenBank and noted the similarity to both Elephantidae and hyrax and dugong mtDNA sequences. All amplified fragments showed between 78.1&#x00025; and 98.6&#x00025; identity to Elephantidae sequences and between 45.9&#x00025; and 92.6&#x00025; identity to hyrax and dugong sequences. Moreover, for individual fragments, the average identity to Elephantidae was 6.2&#x00025; to 40&#x00025; higher than that to hyrax and dugong. These results are consistent with the phylogenetic position of the mastodon and difficult&#x02014;if not impossible&#x02014;to explain by contamination. Therefore, we conclude that our results indeed represent authentic mastodon sequences.</p><fig id="pbio-0050207-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Appearance and Location of Origin of the Mastodon Tooth (IK-99&#x02013;237) Used for Sequencing of the mtDNA Genome</title><p>The scale bar shows centimeters.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050207.g001"/></fig><p>The length of the mastodon mitochondrial genome is 16,469 bp. Thus, it is about 300&#x02013;400 bp smaller than the mitochondrial sequences of the other proboscideans published to date. This difference in length is most likely an artifact due to the failure to obtain an amplification product that covers the complete tandem repeat in the control region. The mastodon mitochondrial genome contains 13 protein coding genes, 22 <italic>tRNA</italic> genes, two <italic>rRNA</italic> genes, and the control region, as expected for a placental mammal.

Differences in the annotation were observed in the other sequences notably because of stop codons being created by polyadenylation, a phenomenon widely present in mitochondrial genomes of other vertebrates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. The early stop of <italic>ND4</italic> of the woolly mammoth sequences was not observed, and none of the proteins of the mastodon seems to be truncated. With a divergence time of at least 24 million years from any living relative, the mastodon sequence shows that the multiplex PCR approach can also be applied to taxa without sequence information from closely related species.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Comparison with Previously Published Mastodon Sequences</title><p>Partial DNA sequences that are claimed to be derived from mastodon are available from four studies. The sequences of Yang et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; (228 bp of <italic>CYTB</italic>) and Joger et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d; (294 bp of <italic>CYTB</italic>) show substantially less divergence from mammoth and elephants than our sequence. The numbers of substitutions between their mastodon sequences and the Elephantidae are comparable to differences within the Elephantidae (results not shown). In contrast, our sequence clearly differs from the elephantid sequences. The results of Yang et al. have been recently questioned &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Debruyne et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; concluded that Yang et al.'s mammoth sequence is a probable chimera of African and Asian elephant. Our study also rejects the results of Yang et al. for mastodon because the fragment of their <italic>CYTB</italic> mastodon sequence clusters closely within Elephantidae (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050207-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A), as expected by the number of substitutions. For the same reason, the partial sequence of Joger et al. also seems to be derived from an Asian/African elephant contaminant (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050207-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B). Finally, the unpublished 16S rDNA sequences obtained by Park et al. and Goldstein et al. (GenBank accession numbers AF279699 and AY028924, respectively) show 97&#x00025; and 99&#x00025; identity to primates using Blastn &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, which shows that these two sequences also were very likely derived from contamination.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Phylogenetic Results</title><p>In order to further investigate proboscidean evolution, we used the six existing whole mitochondrial genomes of Elephantidae (two African elephants, <italic>L. africana;</italic> two Asian elephants, <italic>Elephas maximus;</italic> and two woolly mammoths, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mammuthus primigenius</named-content>) together with our newly obtained <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mammut americanum</named-content> sequence. As the mastodon lineage is evolutionarily much closer to Elephantidae than to extant outgroup species such as dugong or hyrax, multiple substitutions should not represent such a pronounced problem as is the case with the latter species. A comparison of the seven proboscidean mitochondrial genomes to those from hyrax and dugong shows that the number of substitutions separating mastodon from the Elephantidae is less than half that separating either hyrax or dugong from the Elephantidae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050207-st001">Table S1</xref>). Consistent with this result, the rates of synonymous (<italic>d</italic><sub>s</sub>) and nonsynonymous (<italic>d</italic><sub>n</sub>) substitutions are much lower when using mastodon as the outgroup (<italic>d</italic><sub>s</sub> &#x0003d; 0.4; <italic>d</italic><sub>n</sub> &#x0003d; 0.05).

These bootstrap values do not vary significantly among substitution models and are not dependent on whether the data are partitioned or unpartitioned (results not shown).

Consequently, the mastodon mtDNA sequence provides better estimates of the dates of divergence within the Elephantidae.

Using nuDNA sequence data and a divergence time between African and Asian elephants of 5 mya, they estimated the divergence between the nuDNA sequences from African savannah and forest elephants to be 2.63 &#x000b1; 0.94 mya, and argued that both the deep divergence and the reciprocal monophyly between forest elephants and savannah elephants with regard to nuDNA support the distinction of the two forms as different species, a view also supported by microsatellite analyses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. However, based on extensive mtDNA analyses, both Eggert et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d; and Debruyne &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; disputed this view, as they found forest and savannah elephants being polyphyletic with respect to mtDNA sequences.

The tooth was a detrital find collected on a point bar along with numerous other large mammal bones of late Pleistocene affinity. These bones are eroded from cutbanks and deposited in large quantities on point bars along a number of rivers that drain the arctic coastal plain. The fluvial and alluvial sediments in these systems were mostly deposited during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, but contain reworked bones of Pleistocene age &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b046">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. There is a rare occurrence of sediments dating to the last interglacial period (&#x0223c;130,000&#x02013;100,000 y BP). To date, an assemblage of &#x0223c;3,000 bones has been collected, 312 of which have been radiocarbon-dated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. Most are within the radiocarbon range (&#x0003c;50,000&#x02013;40,000 y), but about 20&#x00025; have returned nonfinite dates (i.e., &#x0201c;greater than&#x0201d; ages ranging from 50,000 to 40,000 y BP). Radiocarbon analyses of a collagen extract from mastodon tooth IK-99&#x02013;237 yielded a nonfinite <sup>14</sup>C age of &#x0003e;50,000 y BP (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory number CAMS91805), which places a lower limit on its age. In terms of its maximum age, there are only two bones in the entire assemblage from a taxon <italic>(Praeovibos)</italic> that dates to the middle Pleistocene, and even those two bones were re-worked into late Pleistocene sediments. Consequently, it is conservatively estimated that nonfinite-age bones in the assemblage date to between approximately 50,000 y BP and the end of the penultimate glaciation (about 150,000 y ago). Since the mastodon is principally an inhabitant of interglacial periods in Alaska, it is most likely IK-99&#x02013;237 dates to the last interglacial period (i.e., its maximum age is probably &#x0223c;130,000 y BP), though we have no way of absolutely ruling out an age between 100,000 and 50,000 y BP. Bones in this assemblage are extremely well-preserved because they were entombed in permafrost sediments before being exposed by river erosion.

As before, we assumed gamma distributed rates among sites and TN93 as a model of substitution.</p><p>Given the difficulty of precisely estimating calibration points and hence divergence times &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;, we used a Bayesian approach and the program mcmctree to estimate the posterior means and the CIs of the divergence times. We used as a calibration point the divergence of the mastodon, estimated to be 24&#x02013;28 mya &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d; applying the lower and upper bound method. Given the unavailability of TN93, we chose HKY85, the most complex model implemented in mcmctree. The burn-in was set to 10,000, the number of samples to 100,000, and the sample frequency to five, as in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, with four independent chains for each analysis. We chose wide priors for &#x003ba;, the transition/transversion ratio, <italic>r,</italic> the substitution rate, and &#x003b1;, the parameter of the gamma distribution of rate variation among sites, to avoid too strong an influence of the priors on the posteriors. The 95&#x00025; prior intervals were set to (0.00, 111.24), (0.02, 3.69), and (0.00, 1.23) for &#x003ba;, <italic>r,</italic> and &#x003b1;, respectively. To compute the rate of substitution for primates we used the same approach for a four-taxon tree of baboon, gorilla, chimpanzee, and human. The calibration point was set to a lower and upper bound of 6&#x02013;8 mya for the chimpanzee&#x02013;human split &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d; and an upper bound of 33 mya for the baboon divergence (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050207-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d; and references therein). We used the same disperse priors as before for &#x003ba;, <italic>r,</italic> and &#x003b1; and the same options for the Markov chain Monte Carlo.</p><p>Since the use of a single model of evolution for the whole mtDNA sequence may result in errors, we partitioned the data into five subsets. We separated the first, second, and third positions of the codons, the <italic>rRNAs,</italic> and the <italic>tRNAs</italic>. The few noncoding sites were excluded to avoid overparametrization. The protein&#x02013;protein overlapping fragments were classified under the second codon position, except for the seven sites between <italic>ND5</italic> and <italic>ND6</italic> that were excluded because the two genes are on different strands. Indeed we inverted the strands according to the transcription process. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MrBayes 3.1 with a GTR model of substitution and one million iterations with unlinked partitions. We also allowed the partitions to have different rates. The divergence times using the partitions were computed using mcmctree with the options described above.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050207-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Trees Including Previously Published Mastodon Sequences</title><p>(A) NJ tree (MEGA3.1 default parameters; 10,000 replicates for the bootstrap) for the fragments of 228 bp.
