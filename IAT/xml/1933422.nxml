After compaction in the mouse embryo, the outer cells of the morula are epithelialized and become trophectoderm (TE), while the inner cells generate the pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM). The surface of the ICM adjacent to the blastocyst cavity differentiates into primitive endoderm (PrE), precursor cells of the extraembryonic endoderm (ExEn) lineage. PrE subsequently differentiates into visceral endoderm (VE) and parietal endoderm (PE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. VE forms layers of columnar epithelial cells covering the epiblast and contributes to the visceral yolk sac, while PE migrates along the surface of the inner TE, secreting extracellular matrix to form the Reichert's membrane and contributes to parietal yolk sac as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These ExEn lineage cells are important in embryonic development, as nutritive supports and as a determinant of the anterior-posterior axis.</p><p>In early mouse development, the GATA family zinc-finger transcription factors <italic>Gata6 </italic>and <italic>Gata4 </italic>are specifically expressed in ExEn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Expression of <italic>Gata6 </italic>starts at 3.5 <italic>dpc </italic>in ICM in a salt-and-pepper pattern, which is restricted to parietal endoderm at 7.0 <italic>dpc </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. <italic>Gata6 </italic>knockout mice are embryonically lethal at 5.5 &#x02013; 6.5 <italic>dpc </italic>due to defects in PrE formation and subsequent ExEn development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. <italic>Gata6</italic>-null embryonic stem (ES) cells fail to undergo VE differentiation <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and differentiation into ExEn does not occur, although <italic>Gata4</italic>-null ES cells can be induced to undergo epithelial differentiation by retinoic acid. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This suggests that <italic>Gata6 </italic>function is required for early ExEn, including PrE, as well as for the development of both VE and PE.</p><p>Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is required to maintain the pluripotency of mouse ES cells in conventional culture conditions; withdrawal of LIF causes ES cells to differentiate into PrE-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Overexpression of the POU family transcription factor <italic>Oct3/4 </italic>induced PrE-like differentiation with up-regulation of <italic>Gata4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], similar to the withdrawal of LIF, and overexpression of either <italic>Gata4 </italic>or <italic>Gata6 </italic>is sufficient to trigger the differentiation of ES cells into ExEn, which are similar to PE in morphology and gene expression pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This indicates that ES cells possess the ability to differentiate into cells of the ExEn lineage, although they merely contribute to ExEn after injection into blastocysts[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Extra-embryonic endoderm (XEN) cells derived from blastocysts continuously propagate <italic>in vitro</italic>, while maintaining their ability to contribute to ExEn lineage cells after injection into blastocysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The morphology and expression of marker genes of XEN cells is similar to that of ES-derived PE cells induced by <italic>Gata4 </italic>or <italic>Gata6</italic>, suggesting that <italic>Gata</italic>-transfected ES cells may acquire XEN-like ExEn characteristics <italic>in vitro</italic>, although this has yet been confirmed.</p><p>Here, we report that an ExEn cell lines derived from mouse ES cells by the artificial activation of GATA factors acquire XEN-like properties. We characterized these cell lines, which we have designated gExEn cells, in comparison with embryo-derived XEN cells. gExEn cells express specific marker genes for ExEn and differentiate into both PE and VE <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, their contribution <italic>in vivo </italic>is restricted to the ExEn lineage, as is that of XEN cells. Although GATA activation is continuously required for the propagation of gExEn cells during early passages, these cells can propagate without artificial activation of GATA in later passages, at which time endogenous GATA factors expression is induced and maintained. We show that GATA factors play a fundamental role in establishing and maintaining gExEn cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Continuous propagation of ExEn cells induced from ES cells by ectopic expression of <italic>Gata4 </italic>or <italic>Gata6</italic></title><p>By functional screening of transcription factors whose expression is upregulated after induction of differentiation in ES cells, we found that the GATA-family transcription factors <italic>Gata4 </italic>and <italic>Gata6 </italic>could induce differentiation toward the ExEn lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Upon ectopic expression of <italic>Gata4 </italic>or <italic>Gata6</italic>, ES cells differentiated into dispersed refractive cells that resembled PE cells and expressed PE marker genes such as <italic>Sparc </italic>(<italic>secreted acidic cysteine rich glycoprotein</italic>) and <italic>Plat </italic>(<italic>tPA; plasminogen activator, tissue</italic>), indicating that activation of <italic>Gata4 </italic>and <italic>Gata6 </italic>is sufficient for inducing PE-like ExEn differentiation in ES cells.</p><p>XEN cells derived from blastocysts were recently reported to show very similar morphology to <italic>Gata4 </italic>or <italic>Gata6 </italic>induced PE cells derived from ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. XEN cells were robust on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder layer or 70% conditioned medium (CM) from MEF for several passages. However, the ability of ExEn cells derived from ES cells to propagate following ectopic expression of <italic>Gata4 </italic>or <italic>Gata6 </italic>had not been determined. We therefore assessed the ability of <italic>Gata6 </italic>and <italic>Gata4 </italic>episomal transfectants with PE-like morphology to propagate in prolonged culture. We found, however, that these cells could be passaged fewer than three times in the culture conditions used for XEN cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Since the episomal expression system tends to become destabilized after induction of differentiation (Niwa, H., unpublished), we tested SKG612 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and EBRTc-G6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] ES cells, both of which carry integrated copies of tetracycline (Tc)-inducible <italic>Gata6 </italic>transgenes and differentiate into PE-like cells after induction of ectopic <italic>Gata6 </italic>expression following withdrawal of Tc (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). We found that, although SKG612-derived ExEn cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) could be passaged fewer than three times (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), EBRTc-G6-derived ExEn cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) propagated continuously for more than 10 passages on MEF (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), suggesting that these PE-like cells acquire XEN cell-like ability of proliferation.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Culture conditions of three PE-like cells</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>coating</bold></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>MEF</bold></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>Gelatin</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><bold>exo.Gata6</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>ON</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>OFF</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>ON</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>OFF</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center">MGZ5</td><td align="center">&#x000b1;</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td></tr><tr><td align="center">SKG612</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">&#x000b1;</td><td align="center">-</td></tr><tr><td align="center">EBRTc-G6</td><td align="center">+++</td><td align="center">&#x000b1;</td><td align="center">&#x000b1;</td><td align="center">&#x000b1;</td></tr><tr><td align="center">5G6GR</td><td align="center">+++</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">+++</td><td align="center">&#x000b1;</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>PE-like cells were derived from 5G6GR, EBRTc-G6 and SKG612 cells and grown with or without MEF, and in the presence or absence of Dex (5G6GR) or Tc (EBRTc-G6 and SKG612).

Introduction of <italic>pCAG-G4GR-IP </italic>or -<italic>G6GR-IP </italic>into EB5 ES cells resulted in the establishment of the ES cell lines, 5G6GR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>) and 5G4GR (data not shown), respectively. GFP-tagged G6GR showed that, in the absence of dexamethasone (Dex), the chimeric transgene products were kept inactive in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), whereas, in the presence of Dex, they translocated into the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>), indicating that these chimeric molecules were properly regulated. Although parental EB5 ES cells had no morphological changes by the administration of Dex (data not shown), treatment with Dex altered the morphology of these 5G6GR or 5G4GR ES cells into dispersed, refractive and satellite type, reminiscent of PE cells. These cells, designated g6ExEn (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>) and g4ExEn (data not shown) as found in episomal transfectants of <italic>Gata4 </italic>and <italic>Gata6</italic>, respectively, and were not similar to PrE induced by the withdrawal of LIF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). Thus, these results indicated that the hormone-inducible GATA factors mimic the function of native GATA factors in ES cells.</p><p>g4ExEn and g6ExEn cells each had two distinct morphologies, depending on the culture conditions on gelatinized dishes. Dispersed refractive cells were observed in <italic>Gata6 </italic>or <italic>Gata4 </italic>transfectants under low-density culture conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>), whereas an epithelial sheet-type morphology was observed under high-density conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>, squares). In the presence of Dex, these cells could be expanded on MEF for more than 10 passages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>), similar to results for EBRTc-G6-derived ExEn cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These data suggested that gExEn cells acquire an ability to proliferate similar to that of XEN cells.</p></sec><sec><title>High level of constitutive activation of GATA factors can substitute for the MEF requirement</title><p>Withdrawal of MEF was found to induce differentiation of XEN cells by reduction of <italic>Gata4 </italic>or induction of <italic>Afp </italic>(<italic>alpha-fetoprotein</italic>), a marker for VE in early embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Both SKG612 and EBRTc-G6-derived ExEn cells showed limited capacity to propagate on gelatin-coated dishes in the absence of Tc, indicating an absolute requirement for MEF, as observed in XEN cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In contrast, gExEn cells, derived from G4GR or G6GR ES cells induced by treatment with Dex, could be serially passaged on gelatinized dishes at about 1:40 dilution every 3 or 4 days (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>). The culture period reached at least 40 passages for 4 g6ExEn lines (2-2, 2-3, 11-2, 11-3), and at least 10 passages for 2 g4ExEn lines (1-1, 4-3) on gelatinized dishes with no apparent senescence or reduction in viability (data not shown), indicating that they had lost their requirement for MEF for continuous propagation.</p><p>What is the molecular basis of the requirement of MEF for XEN cells? According to the original report by Kunath et al., MEF feeder layers can be substituted by the MEF-CM, indicating that one or more soluble factors secreted by MEF is required for XEN cells. If this signal is required for the transcriptional activation of <italic>Gata6 </italic>and/or <italic>Gata4</italic>, a constitutive supply of GATA factors from the transgenes beyond the threshold level may override the MEF dependency. Since we applied different chimeric transgenes in different inducible systems for activation of GATA factors and it was suggested that <italic>Gata6 </italic>and <italic>Gata4 </italic>possess cross- and auto-activation systems, simple measurement of the amount of transcripts for these transgenes, as well as the endogenous gene, was not a suitable indicator of the net GATA activity achieved in these transgenic ES cells. To achieve this, we used two different approaches; (1) transcriptional quantification of the endogenous GATA target genes, and (2) measurement of the activity of GATA-dependent reporters. When the <italic>luciferase </italic>(<italic>luc</italic>) reporter carrying the <italic>Gata6 </italic>promoter and the first intron (<italic>pGata6-luc</italic>), where the auto-regulatory elements are found in other <italic>Gata family genes </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], was introduced in 5G6GR and 5G4GR ES cells, it was significantly activated within 24 hours in the presence of Dex in both cell lines, strongly suggesting the direct activation of this reporter by GATA6 and GATA4 ' [see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]'. We quantified endogenous <italic>Gata6 </italic>in ES cells carrying various types of inducible <italic>Gata6 </italic>transgenes and found that the expression levels of <italic>Gata6 </italic>in G6GR and G4GR cells with Dex were high, that of EBRTc-G6 with Tc was moderate, and that of SKG6 with Tc was low, but still significantly higher than that of PrE cells induced by withdrawal of LIF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K</xref>). The expression levels of <italic>Gata6 </italic>were varied in two XEN cell lines established from blastocysts (XEN2 and XEN9), but the ranges of the expression levels were comparable to those of ES-derived ExEn cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K</xref>). Similar results were obtained for <italic>Gata4 </italic>expression, suggesting the presence of its auto-and cross-regulation by GATA factors. As the additional indicator, we chose <italic>Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf)-3 </italic>because the direct regulation of its promoter by GATA4 has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We confirmed that the activation of the <italic>pFgf3-luc </italic>and <italic>pFgf3-tk-luc </italic>reporter was comparable to that of <italic>pGata6-luc </italic>at 24 hours after induction of exogenous GATA activities (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1M</xref> and ' [see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]') and found that either the activities of <italic>pFgf3-luc</italic>/<italic>pFgf3-tk-luc </italic>or the transcription levels of endogenous <italic>Fgf3 </italic>at 4 days after induction of exogenous GATA activities were consistent with the hierarchy of the <italic>Gata6 </italic>expression levels in these ExEn cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1M</xref>), indicating that the induced GATA activity is highest in 5G6GR and 5G4GR, moderate in EBRTc-G6 and lowest in SKG612. This indicates a tight relationship between the ability to self-renew in the absence of MEF and the induced activity of constitutive GATA factors independent to exogenous signal, suggesting a role for the maintenance of GATA activity at a high level in the propagation of XEN cells under feeder-free conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of ExEn marker genes in gExEn cells</title><p>To investigate the detailed characteristics of g4ExEn and g6ExEn cells, we analyzed marker gene expression in passage 10 cells by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR).

However, careful comparison of events observed <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>is required to use this model system properly. We have characterized gExEn cells generated <italic>in vitro </italic>from ES cells by the artificial activation of GATA factors and confirmed that they mimic the characteristics of XEN cells. gExEn cells can be propagated continuously on gelatinized dishes by constitutive activation of exogenous GATA activity, independent of the MEF-derived signal, and contribute to ExEn in chimeric embryos, as do XEN cells. Although the <italic>in vivo </italic>contribution of gExEn cells is limited to PE, these cells differentiate <italic>in vitro </italic>into cells morphologically and genetically similar to VE cells. In addition, we confirmed that <italic>Gata6 </italic>is important for the propagation of gExEn cells. These data clearly indicate that ectopic and continuous activation of GATA4 or GATA6 is sufficient to trigger proper differentiation of ES cells into the ExEn lineage.</p><p>Lineage specification by tissue-specific transcription factors is a key step in development. In mouse blastocysts, there are three cell lineages, ICM, TE and ExEn, with various cell lines derived from each. To date, several ExEn cell lines have been described, including the rat yolk sac carcinoma line L2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], the RE1 line from a rat blastocyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], parietal endoderm cells (PEC; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]) and XEN cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] from mouse blastocysts. Of these, XEN cells are regarded as the best model of ExEn development <italic>in vitro </italic>because of their origin and characteristics <italic>in vivo </italic>after injection into blastocysts. However, the molecular mechanisms of derivation and propagation of XEN cells have not yet been analyzed, although the functions of GATA factors in XEN cells were suggested by both gain- and loss-of-function studies <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>, showing that <italic>Gata4 </italic>and <italic>Gata6 </italic>were necessary and sufficient to commit cells to the ExEn lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>We have clearly shown here that GATA factors play a central role in the induction and maintenance of gExEn cells. Although transient induction of ectopic GATA4 or GATA6 activity is sufficient to induce differentiation of ES into gExEn cells (data not shown), inactivation of the exogenous GATA activity in the early passage period prevented their propagation and the induction of terminal differentiation. In the late passage period, gExEn cells were freed from their dependency on exogenous GATA activity, but still had a tight requirement for endogenous GATA expression. These findings indicate that gExEn cell propagation is dependent on GATA factors, and that this may also be applicable to embryo-derived XEN cells.</p><p>Although XEN cells derived from blastocysts grow robustly on MEF or in medium supplemented with 70% MEF-CM, which contains many unknown factors, we found that gExEn cell propagation is dependent only on the high level of the induced activation of GATA4 or GATA6, without any exogenous factors. In contrast, EBRTc-G6-derived ExEn cells, which showed weaker expression of endogenous <italic>Gata6 </italic>following induction of exogenous <italic>Gata6 </italic>than gExEn cells, mimic the MEF-dependency of XEN cells. Since the requirement for MEF can be satisfied by high-levels of GATA factors, the soluble factors contained in MEF-CM may activate the expression of endogenous GATA factors, as we hypothesized. To date, we have tested the activity of several candidate soluble factors to substitute the role of MEF feeders, but neither FGF3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], a soluble factor abundantly expressed in PE, nor parathyroid hormone-like peptide (Pthih/PTHrP; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]) secreted from TE, the ligand of the PTHrP receptor expressed in PE, can substitute for activation of GATA-GR fusion protein by Dex to maintain the propagation of gExEn cells under feeder-free conditions (data not shown). In contrast, as suggested for the possible involvement of the LIF signal for XEN cell maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the addition of LIF in the culture of gExEn cells enhanced their propagation (data not shown). The relationship between the activities of GATA factors and the soluble factor(s) in MEF-CM will be tested using the <italic>in vitro </italic>model system with gExEn cells and XEN cells.</p><p>The role of MEF-derived soluble factor(s) might not be restricted in the transcriptional activation of endogenous <italic>Gata6 </italic>and <italic>Gata4</italic>. It has been reported the post-translational modification of GATA4 is important to acquire full transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. According to this report, acetylation of GATA4, which might be mediated by p300, increases its DNA-binding, resulting enhancement of its transcriptional activity. It is also possible that this pathway is regulated by MEF-derived factor(s). Efficient maintenance of ExEn cells without MEF by activation of GATA4GR or GATA6GR might reflect their ability to compensate for both signal dependencies on transcription and post-translational modification by an unexpected effect of the fusion to the GR ligand binding domain.</p><p>gExEn cells express many ExEn marker genes, including those specific for VE and PE. gExEn cells have the potential to contribute to PE <italic>in vivo </italic>in chimeras, as do XEN cells, indicating that activation of <italic>Gata4 </italic>or <italic>Gata6 </italic>is sufficient to induce proper differentiation of XEN-like cells from ES cells. However, as is the case for XEN cells, gExEn cells exhibit a strong bias to contribute to PE in chimeric embryos. Indeed, <italic>Gata6 </italic>is required for VE formation; <italic>Gata6</italic>-null ES cells fail to differentiate into VE on the surface of embryoid body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. During Dex withdrawal-induced differentiation of early passage gExEn cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, their morphology became flattened with ruffled membranes, reminiscent of VE following upregulation of VE markers, as found in XEN cells. Blastocyst injection showed, however, that PrE and nascent VE cells directly isolated from embryos contributed mostly to PE, indicating that PrE or VE dissected from ICM or epiblast tends to become PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, Casanova and Grabel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] reported that VE-like cells derived from the embryoid bodies of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells maintain the VE phenotype on the surface of EB or gelatin-coated dextran beads but lose it rapidly under monolayer conditions, with repression of the VE marker <italic>Afp </italic>and activation of the PE marker <italic>Plat</italic>. Therefore, the bias of gExEn and XEN cells to the PE phenotype may be due to 2-dimensional culture conditions, which are not permissive for maintenance of the VE phenotype.</p><p>As previously shown, we found that artificially-expressed <italic>Gata4 </italic>or <italic>Gata6 </italic>activated both endogenous <italic>Gata4 </italic>and <italic>Gata6 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] to maintain the propagation of gExEn cells. After 5 passages, however, gExEn cells gradually acquire the ability to propagate without activation of exogenous Gata factors. Such weaning from exogenous GATA activity may be achieved by locking the auto-regulatory positive feedback loop between endogenous <italic>Gata4 </italic>and <italic>Gata6</italic>. This may mimic the situation <italic>in vivo</italic>, where transient exogenous signals activating the expression of Gata factors are required to generate the mature ExEn cell population that propagates continuously as it expands along the yolk sac. It is also possible to regard this phenomenon as an artificial condition generated by continuous activation of GATA factors at high levels. In any case, since the embryo-derived XEN cells never proliferate without MEF, the balance of the transcription factors in these cell lines should be different, and a global comparison of their transcriptomes will provide a cue to solve the structure of the transcription factor network including <italic>Gata4 </italic>and <italic>Gata6 </italic>in ExEn cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have succeeded in the establishment of ExEn cell lines, that have the same character of XEN cells derived from embryos, from ES cells by the constitutive activation of ExEn specific transcription factor, GATA4 and GATA6.</p><p>Establishment of gExEn cells, as with TS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], from ES cells confirmed that the two differentiation events in mouse pre-implantation development could be mimicked by the <italic>in vitro </italic>activation of lineage-specific transcription factors.
