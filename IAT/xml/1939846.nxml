Glutathione (GSH) is one of the most important antioxidants in human lung and lung secretions, but the mechanisms participating in its homeostasis are partly unclear. Glutathione-S-transferase omega (GSTO) is a recently characterized cysteine containing enzyme with the capability to bind and release GSH <italic>in vitro</italic>. GSTO has not been investigated in human lung or lung diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>GSTO1-1 was investigated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis in 72 lung tissue specimens and 40 sputum specimens from non-smokers, smokers and COPD, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in plasma from healthy non-smokers and smokers. It was also examined in human monocytes and bronchial epithelial cells and their culture mediums <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>GSTO1-1 was mainly expressed in alveolar macrophages, but it was also found in airway and alveolar epithelium and in extracellular fluids including sputum supernatants, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, plasma and cell culture mediums. The levels of GSTO1-1 were significantly lower in the sputum supernatants (p = 0.023) and lung homogenates (p = 0.003) of COPD patients than in non-smokers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>GSTO1-1 is abundant in the alveolar macrophages, but it is also present in extracellular fluids and in airway secretions, the levels being decreased in COPD. The clinical significance of GSTO1-1 and its role in regulating GSH homeostasis in airway secretions, however, needs further investigations.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Several studies suggest the importance of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cigarette smoke not only contains high levels of oxidants, but it also activates oxidant producing pathways in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The oxidant/antioxidant imbalance present in the lungs of these patients also results from the impaired capacity of the antioxidant/detoxification enzymes to detoxify the harmful reactive oxygen metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Very little is known about specific changes in the major antioxidant defence mechanisms in mild or severe COPD.</p><p>One of the major antioxidants in human airways is glutathione (GSH) (L-&#x003b3;-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-glycine); however the regulatory mechanisms controlling the intra- and extra-cellular concentrations of GSH are not completely understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The rate limiting enzyme in GSH biosynthesis, glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) is induced by cigarette smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], but controversially shown to either increase or decrease in COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. GCL levels alone do not explain the changes observed in the free GSH levels of airways in smokers or COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Other enzymes that can participate in GSH homeostasis in the lung and airway secretions include glutathione peroxidases (Gpx); for example Gpx2 is induced in experimental mice model by smoke exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and Gpx3 is increased in the bronchial epithelium and epithelial lining fluid of smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Another additional group of enzymes that is associated with GSH homeostasis in human airways is glutaredoxin (Grx) family of enzymes. The classical member of this family, Grx1, is regulated in bronchial epithelial cells by oxidants and cigarette smoke <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], but has also been shown to be present in the extracellular fluids including sputum supernatants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. One important function of glutaredoxins is their thioltransferase activity and the subsequent effects on the glutathionylation state of proteins in the lung. It has become apparent that there is another thioltransferase i.e. glutathione-S-transferase omega (GSTO) in mammalian cells which may have potential role in regulating GSH homeostasis. This enzyme belongs to the glutathione-S-transferase family (GST) that detoxify toxic substrates present in tobacco smoke by a GSH-dependent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. GSTO contains an N-terminal glutathione-binding domain suggesting its role in the metabolism and maintenance of GSH levels in intact cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Since GSH is one of the major antioxidants of the airways, it can be hypothesized that GSTO may participate in the maintenance of GSH not only intracellularly, but also in the extracellular space and this may be modulated by oxidative stress.</p><p>The present study was undertaken 1) to investigate the cell specific distribution and expression of GSTO1-1 in healthy human lung, 2) to compare the GSTO1-1 expression patterns in the lung of non-smokers, smokers without obstruction and smokers with variable severities of COPD, 3) to assess whether GSTO1-1 is associated with COPD severity and 4) to analyze whether GSTO1-1 can be detected in airway secretions/induced sputum supernatants, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or plasma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue, induced sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage and plasma specimens</title><p>Lung tissue specimens from 72 patients including 26 current smokers with COPD, 22 current smokers with normal lung function, 16 life-long non-smokers undergoing resection for lung tumour (local carcinoma or hamartoma) and 8 ex-smokers with severe COPD undergoing lung transplantation were collected for immunohistochemical studies from the archives of the Departments of Pathology, Oulu University Hospital or Helsinki University Hospital.

Here we show that GSTO1-1 has a highly specific localization in the lung, being expressed mainly in alveolar macrophages, but also weakly in other cell types such as airway/alveolar epithelial cells. Importantly GSTO1-1 could also be detected in extracellular fluids including sputum supernatants, BALF, plasma and the cell culture mediums of cultured monocytes and bronchial epithelial cells. This finding strongly supports the idea that the regulation of the GSH homeostasis is not only regulated by intracellular antioxidant enzymes, but is associated with extracellular thiol-modulating proteins that participate in GSH binding and release.</p><p>Previously the distribution of GSTO1-1 has been investigated in one human study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] which showed it to be abundant in a wide range of normal tissues, particularly in the liver but also in the lung (three specimens); in the lung GSTO1-1 could be found only in macrophages. The results of the present study are in line with these findings, but also found GSTO1-1 immunoreactivity in the bronchial and alveolar epithelium. The immunoreactivity was also confirmed in BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells in culture.</p><p>GSTO1-1 was also detectable in extracellular fluids such as induced sputum supernatants, BALF, plasma and cell culture mediums. Previous studies have already indicated that GSTO1-1 is highly expressed in the liver, suggesting that plasma GSTO1-1 positivity may also be associated with hepatic secretion. All sputum and BALF supernatants were positive for GSTO1-1, but negative for several other markers of intracellular proteins including &#x003b2;-actin. Over 80% of the cells were viable which also argues against any leakage of GSTO1-1 through damaged cell membranes. It is therefore possible that GSTO1-1 is similar to Grx1, in being able to be excreted into the airways where it can participate in the maintenance of GSH homeostasis. GSH levels are increased in the BAL fluid representing epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of cigarette smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], but decreased in the ELF during COPD exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. At present the regulation of GSH in the airway secretions/ELF is far from clear, but GSH synthesis in the ELF is very unlikely to occur. Significant amounts of GSH may be present, however, as protein-GSH mixed disulfides that are known to accumulate during oxidative stress both intracellularly and to the extracellular space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. GSTO1-1 is one potential enzyme capable of participating in these reactions: it contains cysteine in its active site where Cys32 can form a disulphide bond with GSH and thereby function as a potential reservoir of GSH during oxidative stress. Previous structural studies have indicated that the active site of GSTO1-1 is relatively open and could potentially accommodate glutathionylated protein structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] though the capacity of these reactions is probably diminished in COPD. Overall the regulation of GSH maintenance, binding of GSH to proteins, its oxidation and release is complicated. This study significantly extends earlier observations on these pathways and importance of extracellular fluids in these reactions; summary of these reactions has been gathered to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Suggested role of GSTO (glutathione transferase omega) in cigarette smoke induced oxidative stress. Enzymes maintaining GSH homeostasis are important in protecting lung against cigarette smoke induced oxidative stress. GSTO belongs to the glutathione-S-transferase family (GST) that detoxifies toxic substrates present in tobacco smoke by a GSH-dependent mechanism. GSTO contains an N-terminal glutathione-binding domain and is able to bind and release GSH. GSH is one of the major antioxidants in airway secretions, and it can be hypothesized that GSTO participates in the maintenance of GSH homeostasis not only intracellularly but also in the extracellular space. ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNS, reactive nitrogen species; GSH, reduced glutathione; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; GR glutathione reductase; GCL, glutamate cysteine ligase; Grx, glutaredoxin; Prxe, peroxiredoxin, GPXe, glutathione peroxidase (extracellular); GSX, glutathione; ECSOD, extracellular superoxide dismutase; GSNO, nitrosoglutathione; GS, glutathione syntethase.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1465-9921-8-48-6"/></fig><p>Tissue studies showed elevated percentage of GSTO1-1 positive macrophages in peripheral lung in severe COPD compared to smokers or stage I-II COPD with negative correlation to lung function parameters. Furthermore, alveolar epithelium was always found to be GSTO1-1 positive in severe COPD. These results may refer to continuing efforts to protect inflamed, remodelled alveolar epithelium and possibly also macrophages against oxidative stress. Overall the synthesis/level of GSTO1-1 may be enhanced in smoker's lung/COPD but together with other antioxidant enzymes is not sufficient to maintain adequate levels of free GSH against oxidative stress.</p><p>Tissue homogenates that contain both the cells and matrix showed decreased levels of GSTO1-1 in COPD. These changes in the GSTO1-1 levels in COPD may be partly associated both with decreased levels of macrophages in severe COPD, but also with the presence of all tissue components including the matrix in the lung homogenates and lowered GSTO1-1 levels in the extracellular space.</p><p>In summary, this study significantly extends earlier understanding about the antioxidant defence in human lung and extracellular fluids. The important new finding of the presence of GSTO1-1 in extracellular fluids will require further investigation to elucidate the role of GSTO1-1 there since the regulation of GSH levels in these fluids is still poorly understood. The regulation of GSTO is also unknown and there is no literature concerning the effect of oxidative stress on GSTO expression. This is also a critical area requiring research in future investigations.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
