Through this action, p120 promotes a sessile cellular phenotype when associated with epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) or a motile phenotype when associated with mesenchymal cadherins. In this study, we show that p120 also exerts significant and diametrically opposing effects on tumor cell growth depending on E-cadherin expression. Endogenous p120 acts to stabilize E-cadherin complexes and to actively promote the tumor-suppressive function of E-cadherin, potently inhibiting Ras activation. Upon E-cadherin loss during tumor progression, the negative regulation of Ras is relieved; under these conditions, endogenous p120 promotes transformed cell growth both in vitro and in vivo by activating a Rac1&#x02013;mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway normally activated by the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix. These data indicate that both E-cadherin and p120 are important regulators of tumor cell growth and imply roles for both proteins in chemoresistance and targeted therapeutics.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: ANOVA, analysis of variance; E-cadherin, epithelial cadherin; ECM, extracellular matrix; EGFR, EGF receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; KD, knockdown; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; PAK, p21-activated kinase; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Traditionally, cadherins have been studied for their central role in cell&#x02013;cell adhesion. They comprise a superfamily of transmembrane proteins that link adjacent cells via calcium-dependent homophilic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yagi and Takeichi, 2000</xref>). A group of cytoplasmic proteins, the catenins, interact with and modulate cadherins at two highly conserved intracellular domains. &#x003b2;-Catenin associates with the most C-terminal conserved domain and is responsible for indirectly inducing the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gottardi and Gumbiner, 2001</xref>). p120 catenin (herein, p120), however, binds to the juxtamembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yap et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thoreson et al., 2000</xref>) and is critical for cadherin stability and turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ireton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiao et al., 2003</xref>). Although cadherins have been heavily studied for their vital role in cell adhesion, several studies have also shown them to be involved in signaling events that modulate other cellular processes, including cell migration and invasiveness, cell growth, and terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behrens et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vleminckx et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perl et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">St. Croix et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gottardi et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) loss is thought to promote tumor invasion and metastasis via a mechanism that involves both &#x003b2;-catenin and p120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wong and Gumbiner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa and Anastasiadis, 2006</xref>). p120 plays a pivotal role in these events by either promoting E-cadherin stability and a sessile cellular phenotype or by inducing cell migration and invasiveness of E-cadherin&#x02013;deficient cells through its effects on Rho GTPase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa and Anastasiadis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yanagisawa et al., 2008</xref>). Rho GTPases are important molecular switches that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, adhesion, and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hall, 2005</xref>). Several studies indicate that p120 regulates the activity of Rho family GTPases (including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) in a cadherin/adhesion-dependent manner (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anastasiadis, 2007</xref>). p120 inhibits RhoA activity by suppressing GDP dissociation and therefore activation in the cadherin-unbound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anastasiadis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yanagisawa et al., 2008</xref>) or by recruiting the negative regulator p190 Rho GTPase-activating protein to cadherin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wildenberg et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, p120 overexpression promotes Rac1 activation in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noren et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grosheva et al., 2001</xref>), whereas the recruitment and activation of Rac1 upon cadherin ligation requires p120 catenin binding to the cadherin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodwin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gavard et al., 2004</xref>). As Rho GTPases play critical roles in the formation and maintenance of both cadherin-mediated adherens junctions and integrin-mediated focal adhesions, the data argue that p120 is a critical intermediary in the cross talk between these cellular structures and their respective roles in regulating the sessile versus motile behavior of cells (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anastasiadis, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The effects of either E-cadherin or p120 on cell growth are far less understood. Available data show that E-cadherin has both positive and negative effects on cell growth. Early studies argued that E-cadherin suppresses cell proliferation by inhibiting nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gottardi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stockinger et al., 2001</xref>). More recently, E-cadherin expression was shown to inhibit cell growth via a mechanism that involves &#x003b2;-catenin association but not signaling and likely the subsequent suppression of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perrais et al., 2007</xref>). Cadherins associate closely with RTKs (including the EGF receptor [EGFR], c-erbB2, c-Met, IGFR1, VEGF receptor, and FGF receptor), and several studies have uncovered a complex and intimate relationship in which E-cadherin&#x02013;mediated cell&#x02013;cell adhesion is either promoted or disrupted by RTK signaling or, conversely, in which RTK signaling to downstream effectors is either promoted or inhibited by cadherin clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pece and Gutkind, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Comoglio et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lilien and Balsamo, 2005</xref>). Finally, early studies suggested that the inhibitory effect of E-cadherin&#x02013;mediated adhesion on cell proliferation is mediated by the Cdk inhibitor p27 (KIP1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">St. Croix et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Motti et al., 2005</xref>). However, despite a general agreement that E-cadherin suppresses tumor cell migration, the role of E-cadherin as a more classical suppressor of tumor growth has not been studied extensively. Confounding this effort, recent data indicate that E-cadherin&#x02013;mediated cell&#x02013;cell adhesion can promote cell proliferation under conditions of low confluence via a mechanism that requires p120 and Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, increased expression of E-cadherin induces Akt and MAPK signaling and promotes the growth of ovarian carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reddy et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>p120 is often mislocalized or lost altogether in human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thoreson and Reynolds, 2002</xref>). These p120 phenotypes have been correlated to altered Rho GTPase signaling and increased invasiveness in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa and Anastasiadis, 2006</xref>). The ability of p120 to stabilize cadherin complexes on the plasma membrane, to mediate signaling downstream of RTKs (c-Met and the PDGF receptor), and to regulate the activity of Rho family GTPases suggests that the mislocalization or loss of p120 in human cancer may have important implications on tumor cell growth. Interestingly, conditional p120 knockout in either the salivary glands or skin of mice induces a hyperproliferative response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis and Reynolds, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perez-Moreno et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we consider p120's role in regulating tumor cell growth through its effects on Rho GTPases and E-cadherin. Our data reveal significant and diametrically opposing effects of endogenous p120 on tumor cell growth depending on the presence of E-cadherin. Endogenous p120 promotes the transformed growth of E-cadherin&#x02013;deficient tumors by promoting Rac1 activation and inducing MAPK signaling. In contrast, p120 potently suppresses the growth of tumor cells expressing endogenous or exogenous E-cadherin. Furthermore, E-cadherin suppresses tumor cell growth in a p120 and Ras-MAPK&#x02013;dependent manner. These data provide important insights into the roles of cadherin complexes in general, and p120 in particular, in cellular proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumor progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Endogenous p120 induces MDA-MB-231 tumor growth</title><p>Previously, we reported that depletion of endogenous p120 in E-cadherin&#x02013;deficient MDA-MB-231 cells significantly reduces cell migration and invasiveness and that reexpression of full-length murine p120 rescues these effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa and Anastasiadis, 2006</xref>). We have now used the same retrovirally infected stable cell lines to test the hypothesis that endogenous p120 affects tumor cell growth. Initially, we tested the ability of p120 to mediate anchorage-independent growth by plating MDA-MB-231 cells in soft agar. Control pRS/LZRS-neo&#x02013;infected MDA-MB-231 cells (pRS) grew well under these conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). In contrast, p120-depleted cells (p120 knockdown [KD]) failed to grow under conditions of anchorage independence, and this effect was reversed by the expression of exogenous murine p120 isoform 1A (p120KD &#x0002b; mp120). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> shows that when p120-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells were plated on plastic, they exhibited a slower growth rate than control cells over time, which was significant at 72 and 96 h. This effect was also reversed by ectopic p120 expression, indicating that it is not caused by &#x0201c;off-target&#x0201d; effects of the p120 short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Furthermore, cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry indicated that p120-depleted cells exhibit greater distribution during either G0&#x02013;G1 or G2&#x02013;M phases of the cell cycle and a significant reduction of cells in the S phase. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref> shows that these effects of p120 depletion on the cell cycle were also completely reversed by the ectopic expression of murine p120 (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805113/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805113/DC1</ext-link>).

Stable polyclonal cell populations were generated, and the ability of the cells to grow in soft agar was tested. p120-depleted cells (p120KD) were less able to grow in soft agar when compared with control (pRS) cells or cells reexpressing p120 (&#x0002a;&#x0002a;&#x0002a;, P &#x0003c; 0.0001; analysis of variance [ANOVA]).

The mean tumor volume increased rapidly in control pRS tumors. In contrast, flanks injected with p120-depleted cells exhibited an initial decline in tumor volume, which was followed by a very slow tumor growth in only 2 of the 10 injection sites (compared with 10 out of 10 for control). Reexpression of p120 in these cells by the ectopic addition of murine p120 significantly increased tumor volume as well as tumor take (seven tumors for 10 injected flanks). Collectively, these data indicate that endogenous p120 promotes the transformed growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>p120 promotes MDA-MB-231 tumor growth via activation of Rac1</title><p>We have previously shown that the depletion of endogenous p120 in MDA-MB-231 cells results in increased RhoA and reduced Rac1 basal activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa and Anastasiadis, 2006</xref>).

Consistent with this, p120-depleted cells exhibit reduced ERK phosphorylation, reduced levels of cyclin D1, and increased levels of p27/KIP1. Consistent with their ability to activate Rac1, expression of either full-length murine p120 or of the N-terminally truncated p120 mutant (&#x00394;N) rescued both Raf and MEK phosphorylation at these sites, induced activation of ERK1/2, increased expression of cyclin D1, and inhibited p27. Furthermore, direct activation of Rac1 in p120-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells by expression of constitutively active Rac1 induced the same phosphorylation events and activated MAPK signaling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>).

Previous studies have indicated that Rac1 is activated by E-cadherin&#x02013;mediated cell&#x02013;cell adhesion of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakagawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kovacs et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fukuyama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perez et al., 2008</xref>). However, the expression of E-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells results in an overall suppression of basal Rac1 activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Furthermore, in repeated experiments, the ability of E-cadherin to suppress Rac1 required p120 binding because a p120-uncoupled E-cadherin mutant failed to significantly inhibit Rac1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). In addition, the expression of a nonmembrane-targeted E-cadherin tail mutant that can bind p120 but not &#x003b2;-catenin (&#x00394;CB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa and Anastasiadis, 2006</xref>) also inhibits Rac1 activity in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>), suggesting that the adhesive function of E-cadherin is not required for inhibiting Rac1 activity. These data are consistent with our previous observation that p120-mediated Rac1 activation in control MDA-MB-231 cells requires mesenchymal cadherin association and that E-cadherin expression competes p120 away from mesenchymal cadherins, leading to their destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa and Anastasiadis, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Combined, our data support a model in which p120-mediated Rac1 activation cooperates with Ras-MAPK signaling to induce the transformed growth of MDA-MB-231 cells.

In contrast, ectopic expression of wild-type but not p120-uncoupled E-cadherin potently inhibits Ras activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). The data argue that E-cadherin suppresses the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells by affecting Ras-MAPK signaling at two distinct levels: it suppresses activation of Ras, and it blocks the cross talk of Rac1&#x02013;MAPK signaling by inhibiting Rac1. In the absence of E-cadherin (control MDA-MB-231 cells), p120 promotes Rac1 activation and tumor growth.

Nonetheless, both cadherin-mediated cell&#x02013;cell contact and Rho GTPase signaling can also regulate cell growth, suggesting a potential growth regulatory role for p120.

E-cadherin is widely considered to be a suppressor of tumor cell invasion, and several studies have indicated that its reexpression in E-cadherin&#x02013;deficient carcinomas reverts cells to a less invasive, less aggressive phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behrens et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frixen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vleminckx et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perl et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">St. Croix et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gottardi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa and Anastasiadis, 2006</xref>).

In this study, we show that in the absence of E-cadherin, p120 promotes tumor cell growth on plastic, in soft agar, as well as after tumor cell injection into nude mice. The reduced growth of p120-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells is not related to decreased Ras activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>) but to reduced activity of Rac1 and reduced cross talk between Rac1 and Ras-MAPK signaling. Indeed, the expression of an activated Rac1 mutant rescues both the signaling and the growth of p120-depleted cells in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>Previous experiments on the mechanism by which anchorage to the ECM induces cell growth have implicated integrin-mediated Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frost et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coles and Shaw, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eblen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Slack-Davis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beeser et al., 2005</xref>). Through its downstream effector kinase PAK, Rac1 induces the phosphorylation of critical serines on Raf and MEK, promoting complex formation and recruitment of ERK. Thus, Rac1 cooperates with other growth signals in the propagation of Ras-MAPK signaling. Transformed cells that can grow anchorage independently would be expected to have developed mechanisms to overcome the need for this integrin-mediated signaling. Our data show that p120-mediated activation of Rac1 is one of the mechanisms that E-cadherin&#x02013;deficient tumor cells use to grow under conditions of anchorage independence. We have shown previously that p120 induces Rac1 in these cells via its association with mesenchymal cadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa and Anastasiadis, 2006</xref>). We have also shown that reexpression of E-cadherin results in the preferential association of p120 with E-cadherin complexes and the destabilization of mesenchymal cadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa and Anastasiadis, 2006</xref>). Consistent with these observations, ectopic expression of E-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells results in a marked reduction of Rac1 activation and potently inhibits anchorage-independent cell growth. Remarkably, the growth-suppressive function of E-cadherin requires p120 because either p120 depletion or mutation of the p120-binding site of E-cadherin abrogates E-cadherin's ability to inhibit the growth of cells in soft agar (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Therefore, p120 induces the transformed growth of E-cadherin&#x02013;deficient cells by activating a Rac1&#x02013;MAPK signaling pathway normally activated by the adhesion of cells to the ECM, whereas E-cadherin (stabilized by p120 association) selectively and potently inhibits the transformed growth of epithelial cells.</p><p>The aforementioned interpretation is also in agreement with experiments in MCF7 cells, which express endogenous E-cadherin. The depletion of p120 in these cells sharply reduces the levels of E-cadherin and induces anchorage-independent growth, phenocopying the effect of p120 depletion in MDA-MB-231 cells that ectopically express wild-type E-cadherin. Furthermore, the depletion of endogenous E-cadherin mimics the effects of p120 depletion on intracellular signaling and anchorage-independent growth. Therefore, in E-cadherin&#x02013;expressing cells, p120 affects growth by promoting the tumor-suppressive function of E-cadherin complexes. The exact mechanism by which E-cadherin suppresses cell growth is unclear. However, several recent studies implicate &#x003b2;-catenin and either its nuclear signaling or the negative regulation of RTK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gottardi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stockinger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perrais et al., 2007</xref>). Although we have not specifically addressed this question, our data show that E-cadherin exerts a potent inhibitory effect on Ras activation, which is consistent with an inhibitory effect on cadherin-associated RTKs. Interestingly, our experiments in MDA-MB-231 cells show that p120 does not affect Ras activation in the absence of E-cadherin; however, it is essential for E-cadherin&#x02013;mediated suppression of Ras.</p><p>In addition to binding cadherins, p120 can also associate with microtubules and centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Franz and Ridley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yanagisawa et al., 2004</xref>). p120 overexpression experiments have suggested that this association can induce the stabilization of cyclin E&#x02013;Cdk2 complexes during mitosis, inhibit cell growth, and increase polyploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chartier et al., 2007</xref>). The observation that the microtubule-uncoupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yanagisawa et al., 2004</xref>) p120 &#x00394;N mutant can induce anchorage-independent growth in our cells suggests that this mechanism of growth regulation by p120 cannot account for our effects. Finally, using a Rho-uncoupled p120 mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>) or constitutively active and dominant-negative RhoA mutants (not depicted), we found no evidence that either p120 or E-cadherin&#x02013;mediated MDA-MB-231 growth effects were mediated by changes in RhoA signaling. However, several studies indicate that RhoA and its downstream effector Rho kinase can also promote sustained ERK/MAPK activation and cell cycle progression of mitogen-stimulated cells, especially fibroblasts (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coleman et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that, as with Rac1 and RhoA, the ability of p120 to affect growth is context dependent.</p><p>Cellular context is also likely critical for the ability of p120 and E-cadherin to regulate Rac1 activity. Previous studies using primarily MDCK cells and calcium switch to induce cell&#x02013;cell adhesion have shown that E-cadherin trans-interaction can induce Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakagawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kovacs et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fukuyama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perez et al., 2008</xref>). Increased cell confluence was shown to activate Rac1 in MDCK and 293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noren et al., 2001</xref>). Surprisingly, in this study, we show that the overall Rac1 activity is significantly reduced in E-cadherin&#x02013;expressing MDA-MB-231 cells. Consistent with this, the depletion of endogenous E-cadherin increases Rac1 activity in MCF7 (breast), A431 (squamous), and Caco-2 (intestinal epithelial) cells. These data suggest the existence of cell-specific differences in cadherin signaling, which are likely important for normal cell function and tumor progression. Previous data have argued that E-cadherin&#x02013;dependent activation of Rac1 requires the EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betson et al., 2002</xref>). However, E-cadherin clustering can also potently inhibit several RTKs, including EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qian et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that the interplay between cadherins and RTKs is critical for E-cadherin effects on Rac1. In the case of MDA-MB-231 cells, Rac1 activation is induced by p120 binding to mesenchymal cadherins and is inhibited by the recruitment of p120 away from these complexes. We postulate that the binding of mesenchymal cadherins to a diverse group of RTKs and their reduced ability to cluster into adhesive complexes when compared with E-cadherin may result in an increased overall activation of Rac1. Therefore, the effects of E-cadherin on Rac1 may depend on the complement of classical cadherins and associated RTKs expressed in a given cell. Future experiments using cadherin cytoplasmic domain mutants or chimeras of E-cadherin and mesenchymal cadherin will be important for elucidating the differential mechanisms by which E-cadherin or mesenchymal cadherin signals toward Rac1.</p><p>In summary, our data support an unexpected dual role of p120 on the transformed growth of tumor cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). In the presence of E-cadherin expression, p120 acts to stabilize E-cadherin complexes and to promote their tumor-suppressive function, potently inhibiting Ras activation. Upon E-cadherin loss during tumor progression, the negative regulation of Ras is relieved; under these conditions, endogenous p120 induces transformed cell growth by activating Rac1 and the subsequent phosphorylation of Raf and MEK, which result in the constitutive, anchorage-independent activation of the Ras&#x02013;MAPK&#x02013;ERK signaling pathway. These data have significant implications for tumor biology and cancer treatment. The status of E-cadherin has long been associated with a worse prognosis and aggressive disease. We have recently shown that targeting p120 function prevents the invasive behavior of E-cadherin&#x02013;deficient carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanagisawa and Anastasiadis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yanagisawa et al., 2008</xref>). The current data suggest that understanding and targeting the ability of p120 to activate Rac1 may also block the transformed growth of these E-cadherin&#x02013;deficient cells. Recent studies have shown that tumors exhibiting an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and thus lacking E-cadherin expression, are more resistant to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yauch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Witta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2008</xref>). These data raise the possibility that upon E-cadherin loss, multiple mechanisms leading to Ras activation are induced. This possibility is supported by the observation that multiple RTKs can be inhibited by E-cadherin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qian et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, in E-cadherin&#x02013;deficient cells, specific RTK inhibitors may fail to inhibit Ras activation, whereas endogenous p120 could still promote the constitutive activation of MAPK signaling and transformed growth via Rac1 activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures, infections, and transfections</title><p>Cells were cultured in DME supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin (Mediatech). shRNA expression was achieved by retroviral (pRS) or lentiviral (pLKO) infection, and polyclonal stable cell lines were generated after selection in 5 &#x003bc;g/ml puromycin.
