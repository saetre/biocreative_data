In Brazil, its proliferative form is the second cause of irreversible blindness among adults of working age. Despite the strong association of DR with disease duration and degree of chronic hyperglycemia, genetic predisposition has been recognized as a possible trigger in the development of this complication. Recent studies have demonstrated that the development of DR in patients with type 1 diabetes is associated with the occurrence of polymorphisms at the 5'-end of the aldose reductase gene (ALR2). There are no reports investigating these polymorphisms in type 1 diabetes Brazilian patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the AC(n) repeat and C(-106)T polymorphisms of the <italic>ALR2</italic> gene with the susceptibility to the development of DR in Brazilian patients with type 1 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We selected 64 patients who had diabetes for at least 10 years from Santa Casa de S&#x000e3;o Paulo and State University of Campinas. The study group was divided into the following: Group 1, patients with no evidence of diabetic retinopathy; group 2, patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR); and group 3, patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), confirmed by fundoscopy. The AC(n) microsatellite region was evaluated through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and automated genotyping and the C(-106)T substitution through polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>When each allele of the AC(n) polymorphism was evaluated, the Z allele (24 repeats) was significantly associated with the development of PDR (p=0.014). The C allele of the C(-106)T substitution wasn't associated with the susceptibility to this microvascular complication (p=0.153). When the Z and C allele were concomitantly evaluated regarding their presence or absence a positive correlation was observed for the presence of both alleles and the development of PDR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In our sample of Brazilian patients with type 1 diabetes, the presence of the AC(n) polymorphism Z allele may be considered a risk factor for the development of PDR. The C allele of the C(-106)T polymorphism, in association with the Z allele, also increased the risk for the development of PDR, but when it was analyzed by itself there was no association with the complication.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR), one of the most important microvascular complications in both forms of diabetes mellitus, has been considered a major cause of visual impairment worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>].</p><p>Many biochemical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the structural and functional abnormalities associated with overexposure of the vascular tissues to hyperglycemia including advanced glycation end products (AGEs), increase in aldose reductase (AR) activity, free radicals acummulation (reactive oxygen intermediate pathway, ROI), resulting in oxidative stress and protein-kinase C activation (PKC) through diacylglycerol accumulation (DAG). All these pathways, either directly or indirectly, are associated with the production and signaling of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), contributing to the development of neovessels in DR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>].</p><p>Although diabetes duration and inadequate glycemic control are important risk factors in the development of DR, genetic factors may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of this complication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Some genes have been specifically implicated in the etiology of DR, including the ones associated with glycosylation, immune response, collagen formation, platelet adhesion and aggregation, and the polyol pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>].</p><p>AR, the first enzyme of the polyol pathway, probably plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the long-term complications of diabetes by means of alterations that result from sorbitol increase and myo-inositol reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. AR is responsible for the conversion of glucose to sorbitol, which is then converted into fructose by the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD). During the exposition to hyperglycemia, there is an enhanced flux of AR (increased enzyme activity and expression of the aldose reductase gene-<italic>ALR2</italic>) and a reduced flux of SORD. This imbalance results in the accumulation of sorbitol, which leads to several abnormalities in cellular metabolism and hence contributes to the development of diabetic microvascular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>].</p><p>Different reports suggest that the AC(n) dinucleotide polymorphism, located 2.1 kb upstream the transcription start site of <italic>ALR2</italic>, is associated with the susceptibitily to diabetic complications as nephropathy and retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Recently Cheung and co-workers, through the study of <italic>ALR2</italic> gene knockout mice, suggested that AR is responsible for the early events in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, triggering a cascade of retinal lesions that would lead to neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>].</p><p>In addition, another polymorphism, the C-(106)T in the promoter region of <italic>ALR2</italic>, has also been correlated with the susceptibility to the development of DR, acting alone or combined with the AC(n) polymorphism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>].</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are four studies related to these polymorphisms in <italic>ALR2</italic> in Latin America. Two studies were performed by Olmos and colleagues in Chilean type 2 diabetic patients, who found a positive correlation between the Z-2 allele of the AC(n) polymorphism and a faster progression of retinopathy when compared with patients who harbored other alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>] and also an association between the CC genotype of the C(-106)T polymorphism with the development of retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. The first study performed by Santos and co-workers analyzed a specif type 2 diabetic population in the south Brazil, which was denominated Euro-Brazilian. They reported no correlation between the C(-106)T polymorphism with DR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. In a recent study the same group evaluated a greater number of Caucasian-Brazilians as well as African-Brazilians DM2 patients, demonstrating that among the Caucasian-Brazilian patients the CC genotype was independently associated with an increased risk of PDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correlation between the AC(n) and C(-106)T polymorphisms and diabetic retinopathy in DM1 Brazilian patients. This population is characterized by an ethnic admixture and there is no study that evaluates these two <italic>ALR2</italic> structural alterations in DM1 patients from Brazil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The study group was constituted by 64 Brazilian patients with diabetes mellitus type 1, with at least 10 years of disease.

The Mann-Whitney Test was used for continuous variables. p-values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the studied patients was 26.72&#x000b1;10.52 years, ranging from 12.10-57 years. Forty-three patients were female (67.2%) and, in relation to the skin color, 47 were white (73.4%), five black (7.8%), and 12 mulatto (18.8%). As stated at both introduction and discussion, the Brazilian population is highly miscigenated, making it difficult to establish an ethnicity. In this study, skin color was arrived at based on the observation of the researchers. The classification of white, black, and mulatto was determined not only by the skin color, but also by the observation of other characteristics, such as hair, lips, and nose shape. The predominant genotype for the AC(n) polymorphism was Z/Z-2 (26.6%), followed by Z/Z+2 (12.5%), and Z-2/Z-2 (12.5%), totalizing 18 different genotypes observed. The most common alleles of this polymorphism were Z-2 (35.2%), Z (35.2%), and Z+2 (15.6%). The distribution of the alleles of the AC (n) polymorphism in relation to the classification of fundoscopy as well as in normal controls is depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. The most common genotype of the C-106T polymorphism was CT corresponding to 50% of the cases, followed by CC, corresponding to 40.3% of the analyzed cases. In relation to the distribution of the alleles of this polymorphism, allele C, encompassing 65.3% of the cases, was more frequent than allele T (34.7%).</p><table-wrap id="t1"

Today there is considerable evidence that some diabetic complications are influenced not only by the long exposure to hyperglycemia but also by genetic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>].</p><p>Aldose reductase gene promoter polymorphisms AC(n) and C(-106)T have been extensively investigated in different populations. Some studies have shown that they may lead to increased mRNA expression of the <italic>ALR2</italic> gene and consequently to the accumulation of sorbitol and cellular damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>].</p><p>The most common genotype related to the AC(n) polymorphism is represented by 24 dinucleotides AC and denominated Z [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Although results conflict, depending on the population, most studies correlate the Z-2 allele with complication risk while the Z+2 allele appears to be linked to protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>].</p><p>In our population, the Z allele appeared to be significantly associated with the development of PDR, with a complication development risk that was three times greater than individuals harboring other alleles. This data differ from all other groups previously studied. It is important to consider that our population is ethnically distinct and that there are no previous studies of this polymorphism in the Brazilian population. In Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes the Z-4 allele may determine the predisposition to retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>] while Wang and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>] observed that the Z+6 allele may confer a protective effect. In order to evaluate the existence of a possible bias due to the greater duration of diabetes in individuals with diabetic retinopathy, we evaluated the duration of the disease in the presence and absence of the Z allele. Our analysis showed that this variable is not statistically different between patients with and without this allele. However, the p value is too close to the limit of significance and hence the duration of the disease could not be excluded as a confounding factor. In contrast, the duration of diabetes was greater among patients with the XX genotype (16.10&#x000b1;5.40) than in individuals with the ZZ genotype (14.43&#x000b1;3.95).</p><p>A more definite relationship can be established between the Z allele of the AC(n) polymorphism and predisposition to the development of PDR, by performing gene expression studies in our population of DM1 patients, as the study conducted by Shah and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>].</p><p>In the analysis of the genotype of our patients we did not find correlation with the susceptibility or protection to DR development, probably due to the small number of patients for each genotype, as reproduced by previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>].</p><p>In respect to the C(-106)T polymorphism, many groups suggest that the presence of the T allele gives some protection to the development of DR, and the presence of the C allele raises the susceptibility to the development of this complication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. In relation to the functional aspect, Li [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>] examined the possible correlation between the C-(106)T polymorphism and the <italic>ALR2</italic> gene expression, and found that the presence of the C allele increases twice mRNA expression.</p><p>In the present study, it was not observed any statistical association based on the genotypes, although no patient with PDR presented the TT genotype and among 6 individuals with this genotype, 5 were normal and 1 presented a mild form of DR. The C allele was not related to DR susceptibility when analyzed separately, probably due to the size of our sample. Our findings are similar to the ones described by Santos for DM2 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>].</p><p>Kao [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] and Demaine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>] analyzed the (AC)n and C(-106)T polymorphisms and verified that the C allele in association with the Z-2 allele is related to the development of DR. When we investigated the effect of the presence and absence of both polymorphisms in our population, we found a 5.65 times greater tendency for the development of PDR to individuals who presented both alleles compared to the ones who didn't present. We found no increased risk in the development of PDR when the presence of C and Z alleles was compared to the presence of only C or only Z allele.</p><p>There are many factors that could explain the association of the Z allele with PDR in our population. First, populations evaluated for these polymorphisms are ethnically distinct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. Second, the Z allele could be linked to another susceptibility gene, acting as a modulator, or even it could be linked to another polymorphisms within the same gene as C(-106)T, for example. Finally, the complex mechanism of the development of retinal damage, involving at least four different metabolic pathways, suggests that we could possibly have a genotype pattern in our population that leads the Z allele in the <italic>ALR2</italic> gene to become associated with the development of PDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>].</p><p>One possible source of bias in case-control studies is population stratification. The Brazilian population in this particular set of patients has a high degree of admixture, hindering accuracy in any attempt to stratify allele frequencies according to ethnic backgrounds. However, we have to address that both the control and the study groups are similar in regard to ethnical background and geographical distribution. Besides, allele frequencies for both polymorphisms are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the normal control group. The study design, as well as the sample size, could also interfere with the results.</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first report regarding the investigation of <italic>ALR2</italic> promoter polymorphisms in DM1 Brazilian patients. Two other studies were performed in DM2 Brazilian patients, evaluating only the C(-106)T substitution. The results demonstrate an association of the Z allele of the AC(n) polymorphism, alone or in combination with the C allele of the C(-106T) polymorphism, with the predisposition to the development of PDR. This work opens possibilities to further functional studies in order to confirm the influence of this genetic change in the susceptibility to diabetic microvascular complications, which are among the main causes of visual impairment in the world. This kind of study is also important to establish the role of genetic factors in the risk of developing DR, improving the control of the disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the FAP, Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo para a Pesquisa da Santa Casa de S&#x000e3;o Paulo (project number 03/3010) for their financial support of this work and to the Support Center for Scientific Publications of Santa Casa de S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Faculty of Medical Sciences for the editorial assistance.
