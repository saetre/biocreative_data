In yeast, the process is maintained by the mega-Dalton Ccr4-Not complex, of which both the Ccr4p and Pop2p subunits are 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonucleases potentially responsible for the deadenylation reaction. Here, we present the crystal structure of the Pop2p subunit from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> determined to 1.4&#x02009;&#x000c5; resolution and show that the enzyme is a competent ribonuclease with a tunable specificity towards poly-A. In contrast to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Pop2p, the <italic>S. pombe</italic> enzyme contains a fully conserved DEDDh active site, and the high resolution allows for a detailed analysis of its configuration, including divalent metal ion binding. Functional data further indicates that the identity of the ions in the active site can modulate both activity and specificity of the enzyme, and finally structural superposition of single nucleotides and poly-A oligonucleotides provide insight into the catalytic cycle of the protein.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Controlled removal of mRNA is a crucial regulatory point of gene expression in all cells. In eukaryotes, cytoplasmic mRNA degradation usually begins with shortening of the 3&#x02032; poly-A tail (deadenylation), which is followed by removal of the 5&#x02032; cap structure (decapping) and 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonucleolytic degradation of the mRNA body [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>)]. In an alternative pathway, processive 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; degradation by the cytoplasmic exosome can directly follow deadenylation. In both scenarios, however, deadenylation is the first and probably also rate-limiting step and therefore a central control point of mRNA turnover and overall gene expression in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>The major deadenylase function resides in the mega-Dalton Ccr4-Not complex and in the yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, enzymatic activity has been localized to two proteins with exonuclease signatures, Ccr4p and Pop2p (also called Caf1p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), both potentially responsible for the process. However, several lines of evidence from both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments indicate that Ccr4p may be the main nuclease responsible for deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Nevertheless, Pop2p orthologues from many organisms show strong homology to DEDD-type exonucleases and both the mammalian and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein can function as an independent deadenylase <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9">6&#x02013;9</xref>). In addition, disruption of the <italic>caf1</italic> gene encoding Pop2p leads to longer mRNA half-lives and incomplete deadenylation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Nevertheless, the deadenylase function of Pop2p does not appear to be absolutely required for poly-A removal in yeast <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). These conflicting observations mean that the functional importance of the dual nuclease activity in the deadenylase complex is still not understood.</p><p>In mammals, and most likely other higher eukaryotes, the Ccr4-Not complex is part of a biphasic deadenylase system that also includes the exonuclease Pan2 and its partner, Pan3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In these organisms, deadenylation is initiated by the Pan2-Pan3 deadenylation complex, which shortens the poly-A tail to &#x0223c;110&#x02009;nt before the Ccr4-Not complex takes over and completes the process. An additional eukaryotic deadenylase enzyme, poly-A-specific RiboNuclease (PARN), has also been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). This nuclease may be required for more specialized processes in some eukaryotes, such as AU-rich-element (ARE)-mediated mRNA decay, which involves the rapid decay of mRNAs containing AREs in their 3&#x02032; UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). However, PARN is not part of the major deadenylation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and is not conserved in all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>Pop2p, Pan2 and PARN all belong to the DEDDh subgroup of the DEDD family of nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), while Ccr4p is related to DNase I and Exonuclease III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). DEDD nucleases have three aspartates (D) and a glutamate (E) in their active site and the DEDDh subgroup additionally requires a nearby histidine for activity (DEDD<underline>h</underline>). The four acidic residues assist in coordinating two divalent metal ions, which are involved in both substrate binding and interaction with a water molecule essential for the proposed general, hydrolytic reaction mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>Crystal structures of two of the DEDDh-type deadenylases have previously been reported; the exonuclease domain of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Pop2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and the N-terminal part including the exonuclease domain of the human PARN protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In addition, the structure of PARN co-crystallized with a poly-A oligomer has also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, none of these structures contain the two metal ions required in the active site, and in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Pop2p, the core DEDDh consensus motif is replaced by an unusual SEDQt sequence. Although the nuclease domain of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Pop2p was shown to possess RNase activity on polynucleotide substrates <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), this activity was not specific to poly-A and therefore left open the question of whether Pop2p really acts as an active subunit during deadenylation in yeast. In the light of this, we decided to investigate the structure and function of the Pop2p orthologue from fission yeast, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, which in contrast to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein contains a fully conserved DEDDh active site and also naturally lacks the repetitive N-terminal sequence that was removed for crystallization of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein. In this article, we present the crystal structure of the full-length <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pop2p protein determined to 1.4&#x02009;&#x000c5; resolution by X-ray crystallography. The high-resolution data allows for a precise description of the active site of the enzyme, including the two metal ions. We show that the protein can function as a competent 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; riboexonuclease <italic>in vitro</italic> and further that the specificity and activity of the enzyme depend on the identity of the available divalent metal ions. A comparison of the active site with those of homologous enzymes allows us to propose a model for substrate binding and cleavage, and homology analysis leads to the identification of Pop2p and deadenylase-specific regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning and expression</title><p>In the initial PCR, Pop2pombeLICtev1-22: 5&#x02032;-<underline>GACGACGACAAGATG</underline><bold>GAGAATCTTTATTTTCAGGGC</bold> ATGAATTCGAATTTTTCTTATC-3&#x02032; and Pop2pombeLIC999-979,1M: 5&#x02032;-<underline>GAGGAGAAGCCCGGT</underline><italic>T</italic>TAAACTACACGAGGAGGAAA-3&#x02032; were used as forward and reverse primers to amplify the full-length <italic>caf1</italic> (Systematic name: SPCC18.06c) open reading frame from <italic>S. pombe</italic> contig c1676, clone c18 obtained from GeneDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genedb.org">http://www.genedb.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Sequences used for the ligation-independent cloning procedure are underlined. The forward primer introduces a Tev-protease cleavage site in the construct (bold) allowing for removal of the fusion tag during protein purification, and the reverse primer contains a single nucleotide mismatch (italics) that optimizes the stop codon from UAG to UAA. The PCR product was inserted into the pET-30 Ek/LIC vector (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the cloning was verified by sequencing. The pET-30 Ek/LIC vector adds a polyhistidine tag in the N-terminus of the construct, which is used in the first step of protein purification. The D50A active site mutant was constructed by PCR using the pET-30 Ek/LIC-Pop2p vector as a template and the reverse complementary mutagenesis primers 5&#x02032;-CCAGTTGTTTCTATGG<bold>C</bold>TACAGAATTTCCAGG-3&#x02032; (sense, <bold>bold</bold>&#x02009;=&#x02009;mutation) and 5&#x02032;-CCTGGAAATTCTGTA<bold>G</bold>CCATAGAAACAACTGG-3&#x02032; (anti-sense). After the PCR, the template vector was removed by digestion with the methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease, DpnI, before transforming <italic>E. coli</italic> cells with the unligated PCR product. The single A to C point mutation, which changes the codon GAU (D50) into GCU (A50), was confirmed by sequencing.

The protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) and the polyhistidine tag removed from the fusion protein by proteolytic cleavage with recombinant Tev protease (100:1 (w/w) fusion protein to Tev protease) for 1&#x02009;h at room temperature.

The initial model was subsequently refined against the non-isomorphous 1.4&#x02009;&#x000c5; native data following molecular replacement, and to our knowledge represents the highest resolution structure of any exonuclease to date. The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains a single protein molecule and the final model covers residues 17&#x02013;271 of the 332 amino acids in the protein, 327 solvent molecules and 2 magnesium ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The polypeptide chain is clearly defined in all parts of the electron density map except the region 61&#x02013;67, which could be traced, but has relatively poor electron density. </p><p>Overall, the molecule appears as a single compact and globular domain with an irregular surface in the active site region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), essentially like the previously published structure of the Pop2p exonuclease domain from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). A protrusion formed by the N-terminus contributes to the irregular surface, but the most striking feature is the deep central cavity holding the active site residues and ions. The cavity extends from the &#x003b2;-sheet in the inner part of the protein and is surrounded by &#x003b1;-helices and loops. The protein is more compact around the active site than its <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> counterpart due to shifts of the helices surrounding the active site cavity, mainly &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;3. There is a strong crystal contact in the active site region, which apparently prevents binding of substrate analogues in this crystal form. It is also possible that this affects the conformation of some amino acid side chains in &#x003b1;3 and the N-terminal half of the loop 53&#x02013;67.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>S. pombe</italic> Pop2p contains a competent active site</title><p>Despite differences on the surface of the exonuclease core, the active site region is highly conserved among the DEDD nucleases. The active site of Pop2p is located in the innermost part of the central cavity on the edge of the &#x003b2;-sheet and consists of residues from the C-terminal part of &#x003b2;2 as well as &#x003b1;10 and &#x003b1;6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). The histidine, which is important for catalysis in the DEDD<underline>h</underline>-subgroup, is situated in a loop extending from the N-terminal end of &#x003b1;10. Though Pop2p from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was found to be active <italic>in vitro</italic>, its unconventional SEDQt active site raised doubts as to whether these proteins indeed retain the classical reaction mechanism of the DEDD nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Pop2p, on the other hand, contains all of the conserved residues in the active site, and the presence of the divalent metal ions and the high-resolution data has allowed for a very detailed analysis of the active site configuration in the present structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C).</p><p>The active site of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pop2p consists of the two metal ions, which are magnesium in this structure due to its presence in the crystallization buffer (Mg<sub>A</sub> and Mg<sub>B</sub>), in addition to the conserved acidic residues, D50, E52, D171, D240 and H235. Of these, D50 takes a central position by contacting both metal ions. Mg<sub>A</sub> is also coordinated by E52 and D240, while D171 contacts Mg<sub>B</sub>. In addition, seven water molecules, three associated with Mg<sub>A</sub> and four with Mg<sub>B</sub>, complete the dual octahedral coordination spheres of the two ions. One of the water molecules associated with Mg<sub>A</sub> also forms a hydrogen bond with H235, thereby bridging these. The overwhelming similarity between the active site of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pop2p and other known DEDDh nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) thus strongly suggests that Pop2p is a catalytically competent protein that uses the conserved hydrolytic reaction mechanism of the DEDD nucleases.</p></sec><sec><title>The active site ions define the activity and specificity of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pop2p</title><p>In order to further investigate the possibility that Pop2p from <italic>S. pombe</italic> might be a competent 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease, we set up an <italic>in vitro</italic> deadenylation assay using defined RNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). One substrate, <italic>Generic-polyA</italic>, contained a 20-nt generic RNA sequence with little or no secondary structure followed by a 10-nt poly-A tail whereas the other substrate, <italic>Stemloop-polyA</italic>, contained a strong 8-bp stemloop followed by a 10-nt poly-A tail. In order to be able to define the ions present in the active site, protein used for the experiment was first changed into a buffer devoid of any divalent metal ions. Though this may not completely remove ions from the active site of the enzyme, it provides the best possible starting point for defining the composition of the ions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, there is no degradation of the Generic-polyA RNA substrate by wt Pop2p in the absence of divalent metal ions in the buffer (lane marked &#x02018;wt/&#x02212;&#x02019;), nor with 5&#x02009;mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the buffer in the absence of protein (&#x02018;Buffer/Mg&#x02019;). On the other hand, incubation of the RNA substrate in the presence of wt Pop2p and 5&#x02009;mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> resulted in limited, but consistent 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity (&#x02018;wt/Mg&#x02019;), while incubation with 5&#x02009;mM Mn<sup>2+</sup> results in almost complete degradation of the Generic-polyA RNA in 60&#x02009;min (&#x02018;wt/Mn&#x02019;). To check that the observed nuclease activity is indeed due to the specific activity of the purified Pop2p, we constructed a D50A mutant that removes the carboxyl group from the central bipartite aspartate responsible for coordinating the ions in the active site. The mutant enzyme has no activity in the presence of 5&#x02009;mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (&#x02018;D50A/Mg&#x02019;), and likewise, activity is also completely lost when the ions are removed from the wt enzyme by incubation with 10&#x02009;mM with EDTA (&#x02018;wt/EDTA&#x02019;). To confirm that Pop2p is specific to RNA, we synthesized the Generic-polyA substrate as an oligodeoxynucleotide substrate (&#x02018;DNA&#x02019;), which is also not degraded illustrating that Pop2p is specifically a 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; riboexonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). </p><p>To further analyse the observed differences in activity as a result of the ions present in the active site, Pop2p was incubated for 60&#x02009;min with the Generic-polyA substrate in the presence of 5&#x02009;mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x02009;mM Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes &#x02018;wt/Mg&#x02019; and &#x02018;wt/Mg Zn&#x02019;), 5&#x02009;mM Mn<sup>2+</sup>&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x02009;mM Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes &#x02018;wt/Mn&#x02019; and &#x02018;wt/Mn Zn&#x02019;), or a mix containing all three ions in their approximate, physiological concentrations, namely 7.1&#x02009;mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 75 uM Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and 220&#x02009;&#x003bc;M Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lane &#x02018;wt/Ph&#x02019;). Under the physiological conditions, the RNA is quickly degraded to &#x0223c;20-nt, corresponding to removal of the 10-nt poly-A tail (lane &#x02018;wt/Ph&#x02019;), while the enzyme appears to be inhibited by the high zinc concentration in the experiments with only two ions and 1&#x02009;mM Zn<sup>2+</sup> (lanes &#x02018;wt/Mg Zn&#x02019; and &#x02018;wt/Mn Zn&#x02019;)</p><p>Assuming that only two ions can bind in the active site at any one time, we next performed drop-out experiments to clarify which of the ions in the physiological mix are responsible for the observed specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). To make sure that the enzyme does not simply pause at the end of the poly-A tail, experiments were allowed to run to completion by overnight incubation at 30&#x000b0;C. In the absence of divalent metal ions, we observe a limited residual activity from the ion-depleted wt Pop2p after the long incubation (lane &#x02018;&#x02212;&#x02019;), while the combination of all three ions consistently makes the enzyme stop after degradation of &#x0223c;10-nt (lane &#x02018;All&#x02019;). This illustrates that <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pop2p is able to specifically degrade the poly-A tail under the right conditions. In the drop-out experiments using the same concentrations of ions but leaving one ion out in each case, the combination of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> appears to create a fast and non-specific enzyme (lane &#x02018;Mg Mn&#x02019;), while both the combinations Mg<sup>2+</sup>&#x02013;Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup>&#x02013;Zn<sup>2+</sup> give the same specificity as observed for all three ions. However, the 20-nt band is more smeared in the Mn<sup>2+</sup>&#x02013;Zn<sup>2+</sup> case, probably reflecting full degradation of part of the substrate molecules in this case, in accordance with the above results for Mn<sup>2+</sup> alone showing a fast but non-specific enzyme. In the final experiment, we used Mn<sup>2+</sup> alone in the active site to investigate whether <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pop2p is able to degrade stable secondary structure under the least discriminative conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). When there is no secondary structure (&#x02018;Generic-polyA&#x02019;), Pop2p almost completely degrades the RNA in 20&#x02009;min, while it stops immediately before the hairpin with the Stemloop-polyA substrate, showing that Pop2p most likely cannot degrade strong secondary structure.</p></sec><sec><title>The Pop2p structure is compatible with the general two metal ion hydrolytic reaction mechanism</title><p>To directly visualize RNA binding by Pop2p, crystals were soaked in either single monophosphate nucleotides (product) or non-hydrolysable RNA oligonucleotides (substrate) and analyzed by X-ray diffraction. Unfortunately, due to crystal contacts between adjacent molecules in the active site region, none of these experiments were successful. However, the high degree of structural conservation among DEDD nucleases combined with the accurately defined active site in the present structure has allowed us to propose a precise model for RNA binding by Pop2p in the lack of experimental data. Human PARN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and the &#x003b5;-subunit of the <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA polymerase III (exonuclease subunit) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) are the closest structural neighbours to Pop2p, and as structures of these proteins bound to either poly-A RNA or single nucleotides are available, we have a rigorous framework for modelling interactions between Pop2p and RNA.</p><p>The PARN poly-A RNA substrate fits well and with no clashes into the Pop2p active site when the proteins are superposed by least-square-based alignment of the conserved active site residues, and provides a snapshot of the presumed conformation of the protein in the pre-hydrolysis state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). An oxygen atom from the 3&#x02032;-most phosphordiester is placed between the two metal ions that probably orient and restrain the phosphate for the following nucleophilic attack. In agreement with the proposed two metal ion reaction schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), H235 is poised to act as a general base by activating one of the water molecules associated with Mg<sub>A</sub> for an attack on the phosphate in an S<sub>N</sub>2 nucleophilic substitution reaction. This leads to breakage of the scissile bond between the phosphate group and the O3&#x02032; of the penultimate pentose sugar and subsequent release of a monophosphate nucleotide from the 3&#x02032; end of the RNA. </p><p>Alignment of the two single nucleotides found in the structure of the &#x003b5;-subunit of <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA polymerase III soaked in dTMP at pH 5.8 also shows a good fit, and illustrates a possible post-cleavage situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). In this structure, two partially occupied dTMPs were observed in the active site. The minor conformation (&#x0223c;15%) mimics the 3&#x02032; nucleotide of an uncleaved RNA, whereas the major conformation has a phosphate oxygen atom that seems to contact H235 as well as Mg<sub>A</sub>, much like the activated water in the pre-hydrolysis state. This appears to correspond to the position of the 3&#x02032; nucleotide in the post-cleavage state of the enzyme.</p><p>The modelling of nucleotides into the active site of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pop2 structure provides snapshots of the reaction cycle of the enzyme and strongly suggests that the enzyme uses a classical DEDDh-type reaction pathway in the hydrolysis of RNA. One caveat is that the octahedral coordination of the ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) most likely gets interrupted at some point during the reaction cycle due to sterical constraints in the RNA substrate. This may be one of the reasons why the presence of the more promiscuous zinc ion in the active site gives higher specificity, as it would allow more flexibility with respect to substrate orientation and possibly permit direct recognition of the base in a nearby region. In support of this, it was recently found that the DEDDh exonuclease, Rrp6p is able to bind two octahedral manganese ions in the active site simultaneously, but only binds nucleotides with a combination of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). A similar ion substitution experiment was carried out for <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pop2p and showed that the distance between the two active site ions decreases with &#x0223c;1&#x02009;&#x000c5; as a result of the presence of both magnesium and zinc as opposed to magnesium alone (data not shown). This result further substantiates the idea that the nature of the ions influences the finer architecture of the active site and may therefore be important for the catalytic function of the protein <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Pop2p may interact with RNA in a wider region</title><p>Superposition of the poly-A RNA substrate from the human PARN structure onto the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pop2p structure shows a good fit also outside of the core active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). This allows potential Pop2p&#x02013;RNA interactions in a wider region to be postulated, though the obvious limitations of such a model must be borne in mind.</p><p>The model predicts several potential contacts between Pop2p and the RNA backbone. At the very 3&#x02032; end, recognition of the 2&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; OH groups could be mediated by the backbone atoms of F53 and G55 as well as the side chain of the active-site residue E52, which can provide H-bonds to both OH groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). These amino acids are conserved in Pop2p in most other species and in both PARN and Rrp6p have been shown to recognize the 2&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; OH groups of the terminal nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The phosphate group between the 3&#x02032; nucleotide (N) and the penultimate nucleotide (N&#x02013;1) is clearly kept in place by the two metal ions in the pre-hydrolysis state as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), while the penultimate phosphate, linking N&#x02013;1 and N&#x02013;2, may make contacts to the backbone amino group of L219 and the side chain of K206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). These residues are likely to be involved in keeping the phosphate in place like the homologous residues (L343 and K326) in PARN, and consistently, the two amino acids are conserved in Pop2p proteins from most species. In conclusion, it appears that Pop2p is able to engage in a range of specific interactions with the RNA backbone allowing the protein to place the substrate optimally for cleavage to take place.</p><p>On the other hand, the PARN-RNA structure did not provide an explanation of the basis of sequence specificity, as no discriminative base atoms are contacted by the protein. However, as PARN apparently functions as a homodimer, the situation is complicated by the fact that the specificity could be contributed by residues on the neighbouring molecule that could potentially reach the nucleotide bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In contrast to PARN, there is no evidence that Pop2p should function in an oligomeric state and the basis of sequence-specific RNA recognition may therefore differ significantly between the two proteins. However, based on the position of the bases in the PARN poly-A RNA, we can identify a few potential sites in Pop2p that could mediate direct protein&#x02013;base contacts, such as the conserved E121, S122 and several residues in the Pop2-specific loop, 53&#x02013;67 (see below), which may show a different conformation <italic>in vivo</italic> or when bound to substrate. Previous experiments with Pop2p from different organisms have shown varying results concerning the sequence specificity of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9">6&#x02013;9</xref>) and our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments show that the enzyme can degrade non-poly-A substrates under some conditions. This means that a strict sequence discrimination may not be an intrinsic property of the enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural alignment of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pop2p suggests a common ancestral fold</title><p>As indicated by the modelling of RNA from the PARN-RNA structure into the active site groove, it appears that Pop2p is structurally very similar to PARN. High structural similarity between proteins is often indicative of a functional relationship, whereas structural differences may imply functional divergence. Structural comparison can therefore indicate which parts of the proteins are important for shared function, but also point out those that have diverged to serve unique roles. To compare <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pop2p to structurally similar proteins, a DALI search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) was carried out and the resulting structural alignment used to identify regions of similarity and divergence. The results of the analysis are shown colour coded in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B with blue representing regions found in most or all of the structures and red the structural features found solely in <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pop2p. Other colours represent regions of intermediate conservation as indicated. The highly conserved core domain consists of the mixed five-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet with alpha helices on both sides (blue) that contains the four active site residues of the DEDD nucleases. Pop2p has a one-strand extension to the &#x003b2;-sheet of the core motif (&#x003b2;1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B) and additional helices and loops surrounding the core nuclease region (green, yellow, orange and red). In general, the least structurally conserved region of Pop2p is situated on one side of the active site and is composed of helices &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;3 and the loop spanning amino acids 53&#x02013;67. Whereas &#x003b1;3 is shared with a number of other DEDDh-type nucleases and thus may be a part of a general DEDDh exonuclease architecture, the N-terminal extension of &#x003b1;2 (orange) is currently only found in the structures of human PARN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and yeast Pop2p. The conformation observed for the loop 53&#x02013;67 in the present Pop2p structure is unique, as the corresponding region is absent from the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein and located differently in PARN. This region, as well as part of &#x003b1;2 that also shows great variation between the homologous structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B) are therefore likely to be involved in Pop2p or deadenylase-specific functions. Consistently, mutation of residues in this loop results in failure of the enzyme to bind Ccr4p in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (42) indicating its importance for protein&#x02013;protein interactions inside the Ccr4-Not complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Eukaryotic DEDD nucleases differ markedly in their sequence organization</title><p>To reveal how the different DEDD-type nucleases have adapted structurally to their specific functions, we then compared the DEDDh-type Pop2p to a protein from the DEDDy group. With a DALI <italic>Z</italic>-score of 10.2, the recent structure of the nuclear exonuclease Rrp6p from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is the closest structural neighbour to Pop2p in this group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Structural alignment shows that the two proteins share a common core nuclease region surrounded by several unique structural expansion elements presumably required for the specific function of each protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). However, sequence analysis reveals that these features arise in different ways. In Pop2p, the expansion elements are mostly found as insertions in the core exonuclease sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and C), whereas in Rrp6p, they mainly come from the extended N-terminal sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B and C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). A single internal extension element is found in the exonuclease domain of Rrp6p (residues 336&#x02013;361), but this element harbours the active site tyrosine (DEDD<underline>y</underline>) and may therefore be a part of a general subgroup architecture since it is also found in a number of other DEDDy-type proteins. It thus seems that Pop2p has added specialized functions to the common DEDD nuclease architecture by insertions into the primary exonuclease sequence, whereas Rrp6p has a rather undisturbed exonuclease motif and uses flanking sequences to add unique features to the core nuclease. Pop2p and Rrp6p therefore represent two different architectural approaches to adaptation of a common ancestral nuclease to changes in function. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here, we have presented the 1.4-&#x000c5; crystal structure of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pop2p deadenylase subunit that together with functional data clearly shows that the protein is a competent 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; DEDD-type riboexonuclease with a tunable active site specificity. Superposition of RNA and nucleotides into the active site shows that the mode of substrate binding is very likely to be conserved as well and that the reaction pathway most likely follows the same conserved hydrolytic mechanism. The protein contains insertions in the nuclease core domain that surround the conserved active site, which presumably provide deadenylase-specific structural features, however, these elements may not provide the enzyme with a strict poly-A specificity.</p><p>It is interesting to note that although RNA&#x02013;backbone contacts seem to be somewhat conserved between Pop2p and PARN, base interactions most likely are not. If an inherent poly-A specificity were a key requirement for the function of these proteins, a stronger conservation would be anticipated. The lack of a strict poly-A specificity has been confirmed for different Pop2p enzymes by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments showing that although the enzymes generally have a subtle poly-A preference, they are also capable of degrading non-poly-A substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9">6&#x02013;9</xref>). Our <italic>in vitro</italic> results show that while the enzyme is able to degrade a non-poly-A substrate, the identity and relative amounts of divalent metal ions present can modulate this behaviour. Thus, Mn<sup>2+</sup> alone causes the enzyme to be fast and non-specific, while Zn<sup>2+</sup> in combination with Mn<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> appears to be required for specificity. With the physiological mix of three ions, it is likely that the 100-fold higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration over Mn<sup>2+</sup> (7.1&#x02009;mM versus 75&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) completely competes out Mn<sup>2+</sup> from the active site and therefore that the observed poly-A specificity arises from the precise combination of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the active site. However, future structural studies with defined ions and substrates will hopefully reveal the details of these subtle differences. One possibility is that the more promiscuous zinc ion gives more flexibility with respect to substrate binding than the strictly octahedral ions Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and thereby allowing higher selectivity.</p><p>In any case, substrate selectivity is likely also defined by the cellular context of the protein. In this respect, we note that residues in the Pop2-specific loop (residues 53&#x02013;67) appear to be involved in the interaction with Ccr4p. The proximity of this loop to the active site raises the possibility that Ccr4p may influence the entry of substrates into the active site of Pop2p and thereby affect the catalytic activity and possibly specificity of the enzyme. In any case, it is reasonable to believe that the control with deadenylation and thereby the overall rate of mRNA turnover requires more complexity than can be achieved with single nucleases specific for poly-A RNA, and that the process therefore is controlled at several levels. In the larger cellular context, RNA turnover has been shown to be regulated through localization of the mRNAs, for example via the so-called P-bodies that harbour a number of degradative enzymes involved in 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The Ccr4-Not complex is also found in the P-bodies, but not exclusively, as there appears to be a large cytoplasmic population as well, suggesting that localization to the P-bodies is not the main control point in RNA turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>Several key questions about deadenylation still remain to be addressed: How is degradation regulated, what structural features of Pop2p and the Ccr4-Not complex provide the specificity for poly-A and why does the complex contain two nucleases? As for the role of Pop2p, there now appears two likely scenarios: One possibility is that the active site of Pop2p is suppressed or obscured inside the Ccr4-Not complex and that Ccr4p is the only active nuclease <italic>in vivo</italic>. That would reduce the role of Pop2p to an inactive, architectural protein as seen for some of the nuclease subunits in the exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Pop2p has been shown to constitute the physical link between Ccr4p and the rest of the Ccr4-Not complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), and its presence would then be required to maintain the overall structure of the complex and mediate interactions with external partners, such as the Puf proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). These observations have resulted in a conceptual &#x02018;open model&#x02019; for the structure of the Ccr4-Not complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), in which the two nucleases are protruding from the core Not complex with Pop2p bridging between Ccr4p and Not proteins. This model could explain the reduced evolutionary pressure on the Pop2p to maintain its DEDD signature in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. </p><p>But the structure of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pop2p and the functional data provided here have shown that this subunit of the Ccr4-Not complex at least in some organisms is a functional 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease with poly-A specificity under the right conditions. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> degradation experiments show that even the aberrant <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Pop2p can act as an active nuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Therefore, it is more likely that both the Pop2p and Ccr4p nucleases are active at certain times or under certain conditions inside the cell, and that perhaps both are required to degrade all substrates. The situation is again reminiscent of the exosome, where several phosphorolytic and hydrolytic nucleases form a ring that enclose and regulate entry to some of the active sites at the centre. This has already turned out to be a general theme for degradative complexes in the cell, which in line with the proteasome protect the reactive and potentially harmful active sites within a larger structure. In the &#x02018;exosome model&#x02019; for the Ccr4-Not complex, both active sites are regulated, not so much by RNA binding by the individual nucleases, but through controlled entry to the central cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). The targeting of mRNAs to the nuclease core is most likely controlled by external factors. An example of this is the Puf proteins, which bind to the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) of specific mRNAs and guide these to the Ccr4-Not complex by interacting with Pop2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>We thus suggest that the Ccr4-Not complex may form a contained structure that assists in the substrate-screening process and protects the cell from unwanted RNA degradation. Overall, the emerging picture is that of a complex deadenylation machinery, which is activated by and interacts with many other cellular factors, such as RNA-binding proteins and helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). These mechanisms may also partly ensure that deadenylation stops at the correct sites and does not proceed through non-poly-A sequence. The Ccr4-Not complex may thus form a central platform for directing deadenylase activity through the interaction with external factors, thereby making strict poly-A specificity of the nucleases superfluous.</p></sec><sec><title>COORDINATES</title><p>The structure of wt <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pop2p has been deposited along with structure factors in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.rcsb.org">www.rcsb.org</ext-link>) with entry 2P51.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank Prof. Clyde Denis, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, USA for critical reading of the manuscript and helpful suggestions, Dr J.
