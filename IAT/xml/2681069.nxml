The leading hypothesis is that evolutionary processes independently selected recurrent architectural relationships among regulators and target genes (motifs) to produce characteristic expression patterns of its members. However, even with the same architecture, the genes may still be differentially expressed. Therefore, to define fully the expression of a group of genes, the strength of the connections in a network motif must be specified, and the <italic>cis</italic>-promoter features that participate in the regulation must be determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have developed a model-based approach to analyze proteobacterial genomes for promoter features that is specifically designed to account for the variability in sequence, location and topology intrinsic to differential gene expression. We provide methods for annotating regulatory regions by detecting their subjacent <italic>cis</italic>-features. This includes identifying binding sites for a transcriptional regulator, distinguishing between activation and repression sites, direct and reverse orientation, and among sequences that weakly reflect a particular pattern; binding sites for the RNA polymerase, characterizing different classes, and locations relative to the transcription factor binding sites; the presence of riboswitches in the 5'UTR, and for other transcription factors. We applied our approach to characterize network motifs controlled by the PhoP/PhoQ regulatory system of <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>and <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>serovar Typhimurium.

Recurrent patterns of interactions, termed network motifs, occur far more often than in randomized networks, forming elementary building blocks that carry out key functions. This is a convenient representation of the architecture of a set of regulatory Boolean (i.e. ON-OFF) networks, in which each gene is either fully expressed or not expressed at all, or that it has a binding site for a transcriptional regulator or lacks such a site. However, this approach has serious limitations because most genes are not expressed in a simple Boolean fashion. Indeed, genes that are co-regulated by the same transcription factor are often differently expressed with characteristic expression levels and kinetics. Therefore, a deeper understanding of regulatory networks demands the identification of the key features used by a transcriptional regulator to differentially control genes that display distinct behaviours despite belonging to networks with identical motifs.</p><p>The identification of the promoter features that determine the distinct expression behavior of co-regulated genes is a challenging task because: first, these features are often short combinations of a constrained four-symbol DNA alphabet. Therefore, it is not clear how to distinguish a sequence pattern that could affect gene expression from a just slightly different random sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Second, the sequences recognized by a transcription factor may differ from promoter to promoter within and between genomes and may be located at various distances from other <italic>cis</italic>-acting features in different promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Third, similar expression patterns can be generated from different or a mixture of multiple underlying features, thus, making it more difficult to discern the causes of analogous regulatory effects.</p><p>In this study, we present a method specifically aimed at handling the variability in sequence, location and topology that characterize gene transcription. We decompose a feature into a family of models or building blocks that uncover important differences among observations that are often concealed when using global patterns that tend to average sequences between promoters and even across species. This approach maximizes the sensitivity of detecting those instances that weakly resemble a consensus (e.g., binding site sequences) without decreasing the specificity. In addition, features are considered using fuzzy assignments, which allow us to encode how well a particular sequence matches each of the multiple models for a given promoter feature. Individual features can be linked into more informative composite models that can be used to explain the kinetic expression behavior of genes.</p><p>We applied our method to analyze promoters controlled by the PhoP/PhoQ regulatory system of <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>and <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>serovar Typhimurium. This system responds to the same inducing signal (i.e. low Mg<sup>2+</sup>) in both species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover, the <italic>E. coli phoP </italic>gene could complement a <italic>Salmonella phoP </italic>mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The DNA-binding PhoP protein appears to recognize a tandem repeat sequence separated by 5 bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], consistent with being a dimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The PhoP/PhoQ system is an excellent test case because it controls the expression of a large number of genes, amounting to ca. 3% of the genes in the case of <italic>Salmonella </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the PhoP/PhoQ regulon has been shown to employ a variety of network motifs including the single-input module (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), the multi-input module (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), the bi-fan (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), the chained (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), and the feedforward loop (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Our analysis uncovered the salient features that distinguish genes co-regulated by PhoP belonging to similar networks. Gene transcription measurements provided experimental support for the investigated predictions.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The PhoP/PhoQ system employs a variety of network motifs to regulate gene transcription</bold>. (A) In the single-input module, PhoP as a single transcription factor regulates a set of genes (i.e. <italic>mgtA</italic>, <italic>phoP </italic>and <italic>pmrD</italic>). (B) In the multi-input module, two or more transcription factors (e.g., PhoP and RcsB) regulate a target gene (i.e. <italic>ugd</italic>). (C) In the bi-fan module, a set of genes (i.e. <italic>pmrD </italic>and <italic>yrbL</italic>) are each regulated by a combination of transcription factors (i.e. PhoP and PmrA). (D) In the chained motif, genes are regulated in an ordered cascade. (E) In the feedforward loop, a transcription factor (i.e. PhoP) regulates the expression of a second transcription factor (i.e. YhiW), and both jointly regulate one or more genes (i.e. <italic>hdeA/D</italic>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2105-10-S4-S1-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Approach</title><p>We investigated five types of <italic>cis</italic>-acting promoter features by extracting the maximal amount of useful information from datasets and then creating models that describe promoter regulatory regions. This entailed applying three key strategies: first, we conducted an initial survey of the data provided from different available sources, capturing and distinguishing between broad and easily discernable patterns. We then used these patterns as models to re-visit the data with greater sensitivity and specificity. This allowed us not only to recognize those instances with a low resemblance to consensus models, but also to reflect and annotate the diversity of the observations (<italic>i.e</italic>., when distances between the transcription factor binding site and RNA polymerase are unusual). Second, we utilized fuzzy clustering methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] to encode promoter matching to multiple models for a given promoter feature, which avoided having to make premature categorical assignments, and producing an initial classification of the promoters into multiple subsets. Finally, we applied fuzzy logic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] to relate some basic features into more informative composite models that may explain the distinct expression behavior of genes belonging to similar networks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A distinguishing characteristic of our approach is that promoters for orthologous genes are considered individually. This is in contrast to some phylogenetic footprinting methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] that often ignore regulatory differences among closely-related organisms due to their strict reliance on the conservation of regulatory motifs across bacterial species.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>PhoP-regulated promoters are described on the basis of five types of features</bold>. We conform a database including whether the position of the PhoP box suggests that a promoter is activated or repressed (activated/repressed); the orientation of the PhoP box (orientation); distinct PhoP box patterns (motif patterns); the distance of the PhoP box relative to the RNA polymerase site and the class of sigma 70 promoter (RNA polymerase sites); and the presence of potential binding sites for 24 transcription factors in the PhoP-regulated promoters (Other TFBs). The identification of a feature in a promoter is based on measuring the degree of match between a promoter instance and a model that represents that feature, which results in a vector of [0, 1] values where 1 (red) corresponds to maximum matching and 0 (green) corresponds to the absence of the feature. Individual genes are allowed to have more than one promoter because more than one candidate PhoP box can be identified in an intergenic region. In addition, promoters for the same gene in different genomes are considered separately in the <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>Salmonella </italic>genomes. Activated/repressed analysis discriminates among three groups (A<sub>1</sub>-A<sub>2</sub>) corresponding to activated, and repressed genes, respectively. The PhoP box could be present in the opposite (O<sub>1</sub>) or the same (O<sub>2</sub>) orientation as the regulated open reading frame. Pattern analysis of the PhoP box resulted in four preliminary groups (M<sub>1</sub>-M<sub>4</sub>). RNA polymerase sites analysis revealed six groups (P<sub>1</sub>-P<sub>6</sub>) corresponding to types and location of sigma 70 promoters: (1) <italic>close class II</italic>, (2) <italic>close class I</italic>, (3) <italic>medium class II</italic>, (4) <italic>medium class I</italic>, (5) <italic>remote class II </italic>and (6) <italic>remote class I</italic>.

Because the expression signal is sometimes absent or too low to be informative, we considered the location of a transcription factor binding site relative to that of the RNA polymerase to separate promoters into activated and repressed subsets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Learning promoter features</bold>. Promoter features were learned as models from examples in databases (e.g., RegulonDB) and then used to describe the intergenic regions of the <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>S. enterica </italic>genomes. (A, B) Promoters were classified into activated (A), repressed (B) or both, based on the location and the distance of a regulatory protein binding site to the RNA polymerase site. Different distributions are observed for activated, repressed and activated/repressed genes. The property that characterizes activated genes was learned from distances between the transcription start sites (+1) and the binding sites of different transcription factors. These distances were grouped in histograms and codified as elastic (fuzzy) functions, which can be interpreted as the membership degrees (in a unit interval) by which subsets of the dataset can embrace this property. (B) The histogram and membership function corresponding to repressed promoters. &#x003bc; is maximal at much closer distances. Thus, the promoter distances can be probabilistically interpreted as the posterior probability <italic>p</italic>(<italic>close</italic>/<italic>activated</italic>) that given an <italic>activated </italic>gene, the regulator binding site is at a <italic>close </italic>distance from the transcription start site, following Bayes' rule. (C) The distances between transcription start sites (+1) and the binding sites of regulators were grouped into a histogram and codified as elastic (fuzzy)unit-interval functions. This process is analogous to fitting data from a parametric or non-parametric distribution and then assigning probabilities of membership to such distributions. We used these models to characterize the relationships between binding sites for the PhoP protein and the RNA polymerase binding site in the genome. Relationships were classified according to their similarity (fuzzy membership) with the prototypes to obtain a similarity vector of expression values. (D) The histogram illustrates the distances for binding sites of different regulators sharing the same promoter regions. The resulting membership functions, which were learned from such distributions, allows evaluating the putative relationship between a transcription factor motif and a PhoP box based both on motif quality and physical location.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2105-10-S4-S1-3"/></fig><p>We determined that the location of binding sites functioning in activation is different from that corresponding to sites functioning in repression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>), being centered ~40 and ~20 bp upstream of the transcription start site, respectively. This allowed us to distinguish among PhoP-regulated promoters that have apparently similar network motifs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). For example, we identified a PhoP binding site at a relative distance to the RNA polymerase consistent with repression in the promoter region of the <italic>hilA </italic>gene, which encodes a master regulator of <italic>Salmonella </italic>invasion and had been known to be under transcriptional repression by the PhoP/PhoQ system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Several promoters, including those of the <italic>Salmonella pipD </italic>and <italic>nmpC </italic>genes, were classified as candidates for being both activated and repressed, because the distance between the predicted transcription start site and the PhoP box is consistent with either activation or repression. Gene expression experiments conducted in <italic>E. coli </italic>indicate that <italic>nmpC </italic>is a PhoP-repressed gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Other promoters were predicted to have more than one PhoP box (e.g., those of the PhoP-activated <italic>mgtC </italic>and <italic>pagC </italic>genes), where by their location one could correspond to an activation site and the other to a repression site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription factor binding site orientation</title><p>Functional binding sites for a transcription factor may be present in either orientation relative to the RNA polymerase binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This is due to the possibility of DNA looping and to the flexibility of the alpha subunit of the bacterial RNA polymerase in its interactions with transcriptional regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Yet, promoters harboring binding boxes in different orientation can be controlled by PhoP using the same network motif. That is the case of the <italic>yobG</italic>, and <italic>slyB </italic>(direct), compared to <italic>pagK </italic>and <italic>pagC </italic>(opposite) <italic>Salmonella </italic>promoters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Analysis of PhoP-regulated promoters revealed that the PhoP box could be found with the same probability in either orientation in the intergenic regions of the <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>Salmonella </italic>genomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). For example, the <italic>E. coli ompT </italic>and <italic>yhiW </italic>promoters and the <italic>Salmonella mig-14, pipD</italic>, <italic>pagC </italic>and <italic>pagK </italic>promoters harbor putative PhoP binding sites in the opposite relative orientation to that described for the prototypical PhoP-activated <italic>mgtA </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

The use of four patterns instead of a single consensus increased the sensitivity for PhoP binding sites from 46% to 74%; yet, the specificity remained essentially the same (i.e., 98% in a consensus model versus 97%). Importantly, this approach is not exclusive to binding sites recognized by the PhoP protein, but for other transcription factors reported in the RegulonDB database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], where we could increase the sensitivity in an average of 35%, while retain almost the same sensitivity than a single position weight matrix (O.H. <italic>et al</italic>, manuscript in preparation).</p></sec><sec><title>Riboswitch site patterns</title><p>Riboswitches are structured domains that usually reside in the non-coding regions of mRNAs (UTRs), where they bind specific metabolites and control gene expression. The most common effects occur at the level of premature termination of transcription (<italic>cis</italic>-acting) or translation initiation. Upstream regions of PhoP regulated genes were screened for riboswitches by analyzing the presence of segments with conserved secondary structure across genomes and thermodynamic stability; because Rfam <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam"/> searches did not produce significant hits. Then, we evaluate if these candidate segments could be either small non-coding RNA or riboswitches, depending on their relative location to the beginning of the gene. Those candidates with conserved helixes, stable thermodynamically energy, and located close (&#x0003c;5 bp) to the translation start site of the closest gene, were further inspected as possible riboswitches. We found several genes with a long UTR region as possible candidates (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gps-tools2.wustl.edu/data/riboswitch.xls"/>). One of these genes is the <italic>Salmonella mgtA </italic>promoter, which has been experimentally validated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] showing that the DNA corresponding to a 264 nucleotide riboswitch confers Mg<sup>2+ </sup>regulation when cloned in front of a reporter gene and behind a derivative of the <italic>lac </italic>promoter.

These classes correspond to the different types of contacts that can be established between a transcription factor and RNA polymerase. We identified six patterns among PhoP-regulated promoters of <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>Salmonella </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) that combine promoter class and distance between the PhoP box and the RNA polymerase site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

The RNA polymerase site feature was evaluated using 721 RNA polymerase sites from RegulonDB as positive examples and 7210 random sequences as negative examples. We obtained an 82% sensitivity and 95% specificity for detecting RNA polymerase sites. These values provide a false discovery rate &#x0003c;0.001 and a correlation coefficient of 82%. In addition, we selected 34 examples of RNA polymerase sites reported to be of class II, which all differ from the typical class I promoter by exhibiting a degenerate -35 sequence motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and obtained 74% sensitivity and 95% specificity.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding sites for other transcription factors</title><p>Certain promoters harbor binding sites for more than one transcription factor.

For example, the <italic>Salmonella pmrD</italic>, <italic>ugd </italic>and <italic>yrbL </italic>promoters and the <italic>E. coli yrbL </italic>promoter harbor PhoP- and PmrA-binding sites, consistent with the experimentally-verified regulation by both the PhoP and PmrA proteins that can be described by the bi-fan network motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). In addition, the relative position of transcription factor binding sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) can play a critical role because the PmrA-box in the <italic>Salmonella pmrD </italic>and <italic>yrbL </italic>promoters is located closer to the PhoP-box (~38 bp and ~24 bp, respectively) than in the <italic>udg </italic>promoter (~65 bp). By analyzing both the binding site quality and the location of transcription factor binding sites, we increase the chances of identifying co-regulated promoters.</p><p>By considering the presence of binding sites for multiple transcription factors, it is possible to generate hypotheses about potential network motifs.

We hypothesize that distinct promoter features may affect gene expression even in similarly arranged network motifs. To test this notion, we compared the gene expression patterns of wild-type <italic>Salmonella </italic>harboring plasmids with a transcriptional fusion between a promoterless <italic>gfp </italic>gene to different PhoP-activated promoters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Measurements of promoter activity and growth kinetics for GFP reporter strains with high-temporal resolution</bold>.

These annotations cannot be uncovered by simpler sequence analysis approaches (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).

The learned features were used to make genome-wide predictions in the <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>Salmonella </italic>genomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Programming resources</title><p>The scripts and programs used in this work, some of which are accessible from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gps-tools2.wustl.edu"/> web site, were based on Perl, Matlab r2006a and C++ interpreters/languages, and the visualization routines were performed on Spotfire DecisionSite software 8.2. Data and predictions for <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>Salmonella </italic>genomes are available at supplemental table S1 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gps-tools2.wustl.edu"/>.</p></sec><sec><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions</title><p>Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S2, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>serovar Typhimurium strains used in this study are derived from strain 14028s. Bacteria were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] or N-minimal medium pH 7.7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] supplemented with 0.1% Casamino Acids, 38 mM glycerol, MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Kanamycin was used at 25 &#x003bc;g/ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Constructions of GFP reporter plasmids</title><p>Promoter regions (i.e. the intergenic region between two ORFs) were amplified using PCR. A list of the promoter-specific primers used in the PCR reactions is shown in Table S3, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. The PCR fragment was digested with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Xho</italic>I, purified, then introduced to the cloning site of pMS201 (GFP reporter vector plasmid, a gift from Alon, U. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]). Sequences of promoter region were verified by nucleotide sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements of promoter activity and growth kinetics for GFP reporter strains</title><p>Promoter activity and growth kinetics of wild-type <italic>Salmonella </italic>strain harboring GFP reporter plasmid was measured in parallel using automated microplate reader (VICTOR<sup>3</sup>, Perkin Elmer) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Overnight cultures of strains in N-minimal medium with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 25 &#x003bc;g/ml of kanamycin were washed with the same medium without MgCl<sub>2 </sub>then diluted (1:100) to 96-well plate (Packard) containing 150 &#x003bc;l of N-minimal media supplemented 50 &#x003bc;M MgCl<sub>2</sub>. After overlaying the wells with 50 &#x003bc;l of mineral oil (Sigma) to prevent evaporation of media, the plate was inserted in the VICTOR<sup>3 </sup>machine pre-warmed to 37&#x000b0;C. The fluorescence and optical density (600 nm) of cells were recorded with shaking of the plate (1 min with 0.1 mm diameter), and this protocol was repeated every 6 min for 99 times. The background fluorescence was measured using a strain carrying empty vector and subtracted from the test values. Each experiment was conducted independently twice, and a representative is shown in the figures.</p></sec><sec><title>Data preprocessing</title><p>The raw GFP and OD signals were used to calculate the promoter activity as [<italic>dG</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub><italic>(t)/dt</italic>]/<italic>OD</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub><italic>(t)</italic>. The activity signal was then smoothed by a shape-preserving interpolant (Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial, Matlab r2006a) fitting algorithm that finds values of an underlying interpolating function at intermediate points that are not described in the experimental assays. Then, we applied a polynomial fit (sixth order, Matlab r2006a) on each expression signal. This smoothing procedure captures the dynamics well, while removing the noise inherent in the differentiation of noisy signals.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>OH and IZ designed and implemented the methods and wrote the manuscript; CV designed and implemented the riboswitch identification methods; RRZ coded the perl scripts and the web page; DS performed the experimental validation using GFP technology; HH provided advice on the project and revised the manuscript; EAG supported the project and drafted the manuscript.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>Additional File 1</title><p><bold>Supplemental tables</bold>.
