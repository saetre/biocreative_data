BRCA2 is essential for homologous recombination <italic>in vivo</italic>, but isolated BRC repeat peptides can prevent the assembly of RAD51 into active nucleoprotein filaments <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting a model in which BRCA2 sequesters RAD51 in undamaged cells, and promotes recombinase function after DNA damage. How BRCA2 might fulfill these dual functions is unclear. We have purified a fragment of human BRCA2 (BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>) with 1127 residues spanning all 8 BRC repeats but excluding the C-terminal DNA-binding domain (BRCA2<sub>CTD</sub>). BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> binds RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments in a ternary complex, indicating it may organize RAD51 on DNA. Human RAD51 is relatively ineffective <italic>in vitro</italic> at strand exchange between homologous DNA molecules unless non-physiological ions like <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>NH</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> are present. In an ionic milieu more typical of the mammalian nucleus, BRCA2<sub>BRCI&#x02013;8</sub> stimulates RAD51-mediated strand exchange, suggesting it may be an essential co-factor <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, the human BRC repeats, embedded within their surronding sequences as an eight-repeat unit, mediate homologous recombination independent of the BRCA2<sub>CTD</sub> through a previously unrecognized role in control of RAD51 activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>BRCA2, a tumour suppressor whose inactivation is associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer predisposition, is essential for DNA repair in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). BRCA2-deficient cells are defective in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by error-free homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), allowing error-prone repair processes to create gross chromosomal re-arrangements that may promote carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The role of BRCA2 in homologous recombination has been linked to its functions in the regulation of RAD51, a RecA-related recombinase that forms the nucleoprotein filaments on damaged DNA that are crucial to recombinational repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). BRCA2 binds directly to RAD51 through 6 of the 8 BRC repeats, &#x0223c;30 amino acid motifs encoded within the central exon 11 region of all known mammalian <italic>BRCA2</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). This feature distinguishes mammalian BRCA2 molecules from simpler eukaryal homologues such as Brh2 in <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>, which contains a single BRC repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>Available data concerning the nature and consequences of the interaction between human BRCA2 and RAD51 mediated by the BRC repeats raise an important but unresolved question. On the one hand, peptides encoding isolated BRC repeats such as BRC3 when present in excess can prevent the assembly of RAD51 into nucleoprotein filaments on DNA substrates, and can dissolve pre-formed RAD51 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). A structural basis for this apparently inhibitory activity is suggested by the fact that BRC repeats can bind to RAD51 by mimicking its mode of self-association; thus preventing multimerization and dispersing existing multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Conversely, however, there is evidence that isolated BRC repeat peptides under certain conditions can bind to the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, rather than disrupting it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), in keeping with biological evidence that BRCA2 promotes (rather than inhibits) RAD51 foci formation and DNA recombination in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). These observations have been reconciled in a hypothetical model proposing that BRCA2 sequesters RAD51 in a monomeric form bound to BRC repeats, until activation by DNA damage signals results in the mobilization of BRCA2&#x02013;RAD51 complexes, and their targeting to sites of DNA repair where BRCA2 may promote recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Studies on the dynamics of functional GFP&#x02013;RAD51 fusion proteins in the nuclei of living cells before and after DNA damage offer support for this view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), although the lack of direct biochemical evidence that human BRCA2 is a recombination mediator has been noted as an important hiatus in current understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>How can BRCA2&#x02013;RAD51 complexes delivered to sites of DNA damage operate to promote repair by homologous recombination? Whilst the function of the C-terminal domain of BRCA2 in recombination can be rationalized by its ability to bind DNA and stimulate RAD51-mediated strand exchange <italic>in vitro</italic> through the displacement of the single-strand DNA-binding protein RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), the role of the BRC repeat-containing region is less clear, given the ability of isolated BRC repeat peptides to both disrupt filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) and bind to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), depending on the experimental conditions. These studies&#x02014;and indeed, most previous work on the biochemical function of the BRC repeats&#x02014;have utilized isolated BRC repeat peptides. However, all mammalian BRCA2 molecules contain eight conserved BRC repeats in the exon 11 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Several features of the organization of the exon 11 region, shared across mammalian evolution, point to the fact that isolated BRC repeat peptides may not accurately reflect the biological activities of the eight BRC repeats embedded within the context of surrounding sequences in exon 11. First, although the exon 11 sequence that flanks the BRC repeats is poorly conserved even in close mammalian species, the spacing that it provides between consecutive BRC repeats has been well conserved in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Second, there is a considerably higher degree of sequence conservation between the same BRC repeat of different mammalian species than between different BRC repeats of one species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). This raises the possibility that during evolution, diverse selective pressures have been placed on the BRC repeats at different sites in exon 11, with each BRC repeat adopting an idiosyncratic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). This is supported by evidence of differences in the functional characteristics of BRC3/BRC4 and BRC7 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). However, the practical difficulties of producing either full-length mammalian BRCA2 (&#x0003e;3000 amino acids) or the BRC repeat-containing exon 11 region (&#x0003e;1000 amino acids) in a form suitable for experimentation, have meant that experiments have thus far been devoted to studying the function of isolated BRC repeats rather than the more physiologically relevant collective function of the eight BRC repeats within the context of the exon 11 region.</p><p>To address this, we have purified a 1127 amino acid fragment of human BRCA2 that contains all 8 BRC repeats (BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>). We show here that purified BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> forms a ternary complex with RAD51 and DNA, and is capable of promoting RAD51-mediated strand exchange <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, despite the apparently inhibitory effects of isolated BRC repeats, within the framework provided by the exon 11 region, BRC repeats function to stimulate DNA recombination. This novel activity provides direct biochemical evidence that BRCA2 functions as a mediator of homologous recombination in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein expression, purification and peptide synthesis</title><p>A region of human <italic>BRCA2</italic> corresponding to a 1127 amino acids fragment between residues 987 and 2113 of the encoded protein was cloned into a pET28a vector (Novagen) and expressed in Rosetta (DE3) competent cells (Novagen).

The 126 kDa protein was found to be highly over-expressed in the form of inclusion bodies. The BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> polypeptide was recovered from the insoluble fraction and purified under denaturing conditions through anionic and cationic exchange chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Once purified, the denatured sample was renatured in the presence of the refolding additive <sc>l</sc>-arginine; thereafter the BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> protein was found to be soluble and stable in standard protein buffers, thus allowing its use in biochemical investigations. The sequence of the purified BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> protein was confirmed and shown by mass spectrometry to be unaffected by possible chemical alteration due to the high concentrations of denaturant (data not shown). The protein was found to be functional in RAD51 binding through the co-immunoprecipitation of a RAD51&#x02013;BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> complex using either anti-RAD51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) or anti-BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) antibodies. The RAD51-binding capacity of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> was tested through RAD51&#x02013;BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> co-immunoprecipitation using anti-BRCA2 antibodies over molar ratios from 0.5:1 up to 10:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). An increasing amount of RAD51 was co-immunoprecipitated between 0.5:1 and 5:1 molar ratios, with binding saturation observed between 5:1 and 10:1 molar ratios. This indicates the presence of multiple RAD51-binding sites, with each BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> molecule binding several RAD51 molecules.</p></sec><sec><title>Biophysical features of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub></title><p>In order to investigate the conformation of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>, the structure of the purified protein was probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Far UV spectra comparing renatured and denatured samples of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> revealed that the renatured sample does contain secondary structural elements including both &#x003b1;-helices and &#x003b2;-sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Indeed, the secondary structure makeup of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> was further defined through the deconvolution of a far UV spectrum over the range 185&#x02013;240 nm. The sample was found to consist of 9% &#x003b1;-helix, 33% &#x003b2;-sheet, 24% turns and 34% random coil (data were fitted with normalized r.m.s.d. of 0.031). The finding that the BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> protein consists of 42% secondary structural elements and 58% turns or random coil suggests that whilst it contains some structured regions that are potentially of functional significance, it is also intrinsically flexible with much unordered sequence. It is important to note that the sequence of the exon 11 region displays in general only a moderate degree of conservation amongst closely related BRCA2 orthologues. Whilst the BRC repeats are themselves well conserved, the intervening sequences between consecutive repeats are remarkably poorly conserved. However, the length of the spacing they provide between BRC repeats is preserved. This is consistent with a portion of the BRCA2 exon 11 sequence constituting intrinsically unstructured flexible linkers rather than structured regions in their own right. The structural features of the renatured BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> protein are thus in keeping with the predicted nature of this region of human BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>BRCA2 <sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> forms a ternary complex with RAD51 and DNA</title><p>Isolated BRC repeats can either prevent RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) or form a ternary complex with RAD51 on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). We tested the ability of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>&#x02013;RAD51 complexes to bind DNA, or the effect of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> on RAD51&#x02013;DNA complexes, by EMSA. As expected, radiolabelled linear &#x003c6;X174 dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, lane 1) was retarded in its mobility by addition of RAD51, marking formation of a nucleoprotein filament (lane 2). Interestingly, pre-formed BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>&#x02013;RAD51 complexes induce a further, concentration-dependent retardation in the mobility of the radiolabelled dsDNA (lanes 3&#x02013;9). An apparent plateau in retardation occurs at &#x0003e;2.8 &#x000b5;M of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> that may reflect saturation of binding. Addition of increasing amounts of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> to pre-formed RAD51&#x02013;DNA complexes (lanes 10&#x02013;16) reveals a similar retardation in the mobility of the radiolabelled dsDNA. Retardation peaks at 1.7&#x02013;3.3 &#x000b5;M BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>, with a slight decrease in retardation at 3.9 &#x000b5;M, whose significance could not readily be ascertained, because the BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> fragment could not be purified at higher concentrations. We speculate, however, that this biochemical feature could reflect the proposal that BRCA2 may not only deliver RAD51 for filament formation at sites of recombinational repair, but also help to dissolve RAD51 filaments following the completion of repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> alone does not retard the mobility of radiolabelled dsDNA (lanes 17 and 18), indicating that complex formation with DNA occurs via RAD51. Thus, irrespective of the order of addition, our findings are indicative of a ternary complex in which BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> binds to the RAD51&#x02013;DNA nucleoprotein filament.</p><p>Further evidence for ternary complex formation comes from affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A short, 73 bp biotinylated-ssDNA oligonucleotide was annealed to a homologous circular 5386 bp &#x003c6;X174 ssDNA molecule in order to create a biotinylated substrate, which predominantly represents a ssDNA circle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). RAD51 and BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> (either alone or together, as indicated) were then incubated with the DNA substrate. Proteins bound to the DNA-joint molecule (labelled &#x02018;b&#x02019; in the figure) were isolated by affinity chromatography on magnetic-streptavidin beads, resolved by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, and revealed by protein staining. Unbound proteins left behind in the supernatant (labelled &#x02018;s&#x02019; in the figure) were compared with proteins bound to the DNA-joint molecules.</p><p>As expected, RAD51 alone binds efficiently to DNA-joint molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lanes 1 and 2), marking the formation of a nucleoprotein filament. In the absence of RAD51, the majority of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> remains in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 3), whilst a small amount of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> binds to the DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 4). Since similar levels of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> bind to the streptavidin beads alone (data not shown), BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> pull-down in this case likely reflects a non-specific interaction with the beads rather than DNA binding. Importantly, when RAD51 is present, the majority of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> is brought down with the DNA-joint molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4 with 5 and 6). Ternary complex formation between BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>, RAD51 and DNA was observed over a range of nucleotide/protein concentration ratios, including 1:1 (data not shown), 2:1 and 3:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), at which RAD51 has been shown previously to perform strand exchange <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>This conclusion is further substantiated by the concentration-dependent binding of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> to a fixed amount (5 &#x000b5;M) of the RAD51&#x02013;DNA-joint molecule complex formed at a nucleotide/protein concentration ratio of 1:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). At 1 &#x000b5;M concentration, BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> is entirely bound to the RAD51&#x02013;DNA complex (compare lanes 2 and 6), further confirming the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. Increasing amounts of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> are pulled down with the RAD51&#x02013;DNA complex, reaching saturation at &#x0223c;3 &#x000b5;M (compare lanes 3 and 7 versus 4 and 8). This is similar to the results of EMSA shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, where saturation of binding occurs at 2.8&#x02013;3.9 &#x000b5;M. Each BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> molecule contains multiple BRC repeats potentially capable of binding RAD51 with varying affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Thus, the saturation we observe as the concentration of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> is increased could reflect intermolecular competition for binding to limiting amounts of RAD51, with only those BRC repeats in each BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> molecule that have the highest affinity for RAD51 able to bind when the BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>&#x02013;RAD51 molar ratio approaches 1:1.</p><p>Taken together, the findings we have presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> provide direct evidence that the multiple BRC repeat region of BRCA2 can form a ternary complex with RAD51 on DNA rather than disrupting it. This is in contrast to the apparently inhibitory effect of individual BRC repeats on RAD51 nucleoprotein filament formation [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) and data not shown), suggesting that function of BRC repeats is modified and directed when present as an eight-repeat unit within the context of the exon 11 region.</p></sec><sec><title>BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> promotes RAD51-mediated strand exchange</title><p>The recombination function of RAD51 may be demonstrated through its ability to perform strand exchange between circular ssDNA and linearized dsDNA (radiolabelled and non-radiolabelled) in the presence of ssDNA-binding protein, RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The strand exchange assay is now well established as a method of demonstrating recombination <italic>in vitro</italic>, and has been used to study the recombination functions of all RAD51 recombinases. Interestingly, whilst <italic>E.coli</italic> RecA and yeast RAD51 are both highly active in recombination, mammalian RAD51 is a relatively poor recombinase when isolated <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Clearly, co-factors present in mammalian cell nuclei are required to promote RAD51-mediated recombination that are not necessary for the recombinase function of yeast and bacterial RAD51 homologues.</p><p>In order to study RAD51-mediated strand exchange outside its normal cellular environment, buffer systems have been developed that optimally stimulate RAD51 recombinase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Importantly, the addition of different ionic species stimulates the recombinase activity of mammalian RAD51. It has been reported that the inclusion of either (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the reaction buffer enhances RAD51-mediated strand exchange <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). This has provided a useful tool for investigating the recombinase activity of mammalian RAD51, which would otherwise be difficult to study. Consistent with these previous reports, we find that in the presence of ammonium sulphate, RAD51 mediates strand exchange in a concentration-dependent manner with respect to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and C) that is absolutely dependent on RPA as has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Similarly, RAD51 is effective at strand exchange in the presence of 0.3&#x02013;0.6 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, also as reported previously (data not shown).</p><p>However, the conditions used in these <italic>in vitro</italic> assays for RAD51-mediated strand exchange do not conform to the ionic milieu found within the mammalian cell nucleus, in which K<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> are the predominant ionic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Indeed, there is structural evidence that K<sup>+</sup> may modulate the ATPase activity of an archael homologue of RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Accordingly, we performed experiments under approximately physiological conditions (200 mM K<sup>+</sup> and 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>), in the absence of ammonium or calcium ions, and in the presence of an ATP regenerating system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).The concentration of RPA in the reaction was also adjusted so that the need for the BRCA2<sub>CTD</sub>, which is required to displace RPA, was obviated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>).</p><p>At ssDNA/RAD51 ratio of 3:1, RAD51 was found to weakly stimulate strand exchange, as has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lane 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). However, upon the addition of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>, RAD51-mediated strand exchange was robustly stimulated in a dose-dependent manner, with the formation of joint molecule and complete recombination products in the form of nicked circles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;4). BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> stimulated strand exchange when present at one-fifth of the concentration of RAD51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lane 2). Efficient formation of a ternary complex with RAD51 and DNA is observed at a non-saturating concentration of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, lane 6) which would suggest that the binding of RAD51 is thus likely to involve multiple BRC repeats of each BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> molecule. Stimulation of strand exchange by BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> is also clearly dependent upon the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>We observe a stimulatory effect of &#x0223c;3 &#x000b5;M BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> on RAD51-mediated strand exchange, equating to &#x0223c;24 &#x000b5;M of single BRC repeats. However, under the same conditions, an equivalent concentration of isolated BRC4 peptide inhibits, rather than promotes, strand exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), consistent with its ability to inhibit RAD51 nucleoprotein formation [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) and data not shown]. This suggests that the eight BRC repeats, when organized in the context of the BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> fragment, may possess an activity not shared with isolated BRC peptides. However, given the differences in sequence between the different BRC repeats in human BRCA2, which are poorly characterized in terms of function, further investigation is warranted.</p><p>Another ion found in the mammalian nucleus is Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is reportedly present at concentrations of &#x0223c;0.1 &#x000b5;M free Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), although higher local concentrations might be achieved during biological signalling. Although Ca<sup>2+</sup> alone at 0.3&#x02013;0.6 mM can stimulate RAD51-mediated strand exchange <italic>in vitro</italic> [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) and data not shown], we find that when physiological concentrations of K<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> are also present, RAD51 activity is relatively low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, compare lane 1 with lanes 2&#x02013;5). However, under these conditions, a sub-stoichiometric amount of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> provided a substantial stimulus to the strand exchange reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, compare lane 6 with lanes 7&#x02013;10). Thus, in an ionic milieu approaching the physiological conditions of the mammalian nucleus, we find that whilst recombinase activity of RAD51 diminishes, the level of stimulation achieved by BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> greatly increases.</p><p>We have demonstrated that, at the 3:1 DNA/RAD51 ratio used in the strand exchange assays, BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> forms a ternary complex involving RAD51 and ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), which plausibly represents the species active in stimulating strand exchange. However, to rule out the possibility that BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> promotes strand exchange by sequestering RAD51 away from the linear dsDNA used in these reactions, we examined the ability of RAD51 to promote strand exchange&#x02014;in the absence or presence of an increasing concentration of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>&#x02014;at different DNA/RAD51 ratios ranging from 1:1 to 5:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). If BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> were simply serving as a sink for free RAD51, this experiment should reveal an increase in strand exchange by RAD51 alone as the DNA/RAD51 ratio increases. This does not occur. Instead, we find that BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> stimulates strand exchange best when the DNA/RAD51 ratio is between 1:1 and 3:1, the same optimum reported with RAD51 alone, but under different ionic conditions in which species such as <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>NH</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) substitute for BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>.</p><p>Collectively, our findings have two important implications. First, they highlight an interesting difference between the high-RAD51 activity under the relatively non-physiological conditions so far used <italic>in vitro</italic> and its markedly diminished capacity to mediate strand exchange in ionic conditions more typical of the mammalian nucleus. We infer from our work that <italic>in vivo</italic>, additional co-factors such as BRCA2 are essential for efficient homologous recombination mediated by RAD51. This is entirely consistent with the cellular effects of BRCA2 inactivation on DNA repair or chromosomal integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), and on homology-mediated gene conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, the experiments we report here demonstrate a role for the multi-BRC repeat region conserved in all mammalian BRCA2 molecules, which is independent of the BRCA2<sub>CTD</sub>. The DNA-binding BRCA2<sub>CTD</sub> has been shown to stimulate RAD51-mediated strand exchange <italic>in vitro</italic>; its role is believed to involve a displacement of RPA from single-stranded DNA in order to allow RAD51 to bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). However, we find that when RPA concentrations are lowered to obviate the need for its displacement by the BRCA2<sub>CTD</sub>, a previously unrecognized activity of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> in directly promoting RAD51-mediated strand exchange is revealed. Thus, our findings also establish a biological function for the evolutionarily conserved region of BRCA2 containing the eight BRC repeats.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this paper we describe a significant advance in understanding the role of mammalian BRCA2 in homologous recombination. We have expressed and purified a 1127 amino acid region of human BRCA2 containing all 8 BRC repeats (BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>), and have demonstrated that as a collective unit, the multiple BRC repeats can associate in a ternary complex with RAD51 on ssDNA and dsDNA. Ternary complex formation and the stimulation of RAD51-mediated strand exchange occur at sub-stoichiometric concentrations of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> relative to RAD51, indicating that each BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> molecule probably binds several molecules of RAD51.</p><p>We have further shown that BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> stimulates RAD51-dependent strand exchange under physiologically relevant conditions in which human RAD51 shows only poor recombinase activity. Crucially, our description of a novel function for the BRC repeat region of mammalian BRCA2, does not depend on the BRCA2<sub>CTD</sub>. Previous work had shown stimulation of strand exchange by the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> BRCA2<sub>CTD</sub>, the <italic>U.maydis</italic> BRCA2 homologue Brh2 containing a CTD and single BRC repeat and the human BRC3&#x02013;4 fused to a CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). Our results establish BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> as a co-factor necessary to promote RAD51-dependent homologous recombination under physiological conditions resembling those present in the nuclei of living cells, consistent with the known importance of BRCA2 to homologous recombination <italic>in vivo.</italic></p><p>Our data are consistent with a model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) inferred from the observations that BRCA2 is complexed to RAD51 even before DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) and is required to target RAD51 to sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) protected by RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>) in preparation for homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, BRCA2 is expected to function both in sequestering RAD51 to prevent promiscuous filament formation in undamaged cells, and in targeting and promoting RAD51's recombinase function at sites of DNA damage, perhaps as a result of activation by post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). At sites of damage, BRCA2 is likely to perform multiples functions in promoting RAD51-mediated homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The displacement of RPA by the BRCA2<sub>CTD</sub> may arrange the exon 11-BRC repeat-bound RAD51 molecules in a manner conducive to their loading on to damaged DNA for nucleoprotein filament formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Indeed, whilst the <italic>in vitro</italic> strand exchange reaction presented here does not depend on the DNA-binding BRCA2<sub>CTD</sub>, it is likely that <italic>in vivo,</italic> the CTD helps, not only to target the active BRCA2&#x02013;RAD51 complex to junctions between ssDNA and dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) but also to orientate the complex with respect to the polarity of the resected double-strand break.</p><p>Our proposal for the function of the multiple BRC repeats within the exon 11 region is supported by the finding that under specific conditions, BRC3 and BRC4 can associate with a nucleoprotein filament without causing its disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Given the known antagonism between the BRC repeat&#x02013;RAD51 interaction and RAD51 oligomerization, this might conceivably be explained by BRC repeats possessing two modes of RAD51 binding, one that is inhibitory to filament formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) and another that is compatible with filament formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), reflecting the duality of the function of BRCA2 in regulating RAD51 activity during homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). BRC repeats may thus interact with a RAD51 filament as a ternary complex if present in sub-stoichiometric amounts, but then disrupt the filament through their inhibitory binding mode if present in excess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). The large exon 11 sequence that houses the eight BRC repeats would thus be expected to control the binding mode of the BRC repeats, allowing them to form a ternary complex with RAD51 and DNA, as described in this study.</p><p>However, it is also possible that the inhibition and the stimulation of RAD51 activity by BRCA2 reflect only a single mode of BRC repeat-RAD51 binding, and not two distinct modes. One major difficulty with the hypothesis of a second mode of binding of the BRC repeat to RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) lies in the observation that the amino acid conservation within BRC repeats is already accounted for by the known inhibitory interaction between BRC repeats and RAD51 through mimicry of self-association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). It would therefore be surprising for a second RAD51-binding mode to have emerged for BRC repeats with a similar pattern of sequence conservation as that of the first binding mode.</p><p>We therefore favour an alternative explanation for the stimulation of RAD51-mediated strand exchange by BRCA2, which does not invoke a second binding mode. We envision that the BRC repeats of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> bind RAD51 in only one mode, inhibitory of RAD51 oligomerization, with each BRC repeat capping one self-association surface of RAD51, but permitting filament growth from its opposite surface (Figure 7 circled inset). The resulting nucleoprotein filament would thus consist of multiple filaments separated by interleaved BRC repeats. Indeed, the long exon 11 sequence between adjacent BRC repeats would allow for considerable growth of each capped filament. It is important to note, however, that our results are consistent with either of these structural possibilities explaining the novel activity of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> in promoting RAD51-mediated strand exchange.</p><p>In summary, we have established a unique tool for research into mammalian homologous recombination through the expression and purification of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>, a fragment of BRCA2 containing all eight BRC repeats. We report that within the context of the wider sequence provided by BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>, the eight BRC repeats exert a previously unrecognized, collective function in promoting RAD51-mediated strand exchange through ternary complex formation, independent of the BRCA2 C-terminal domain. Thus, our work provides direct biochemical evidence that human BRCA2 can function as a recombination mediator&#x02014;a critical but unresolved issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). The identification of a mechanism for the stimulation of RAD51-mediated recombination by the multiple BRC repeat-containing region of human BRCA2 provides an important insight into the process of recombinational DNA repair in mammalian cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Shahin Zibaee (CIMR, University of Cambridge) for assistance in circular dichroism spectroscopy.

(<bold>A</bold>) Human BRCA2 is a large protein of 3418 amino acids that can be divided into three general regions: an N-terminal region of unknown function, a central exon 11 region and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (in addition to an extreme C-terminal RAD51-binding site encoded by exon 27). The eight RAD51-binding BRC repeats are located well spaced from one another amidst the long and divergent exon 11 region. We cloned and expressed a 1127 amino acid fragment of human BRCA2 corresponding to amino acid residues 987&#x02013;2113 and spanning all 8 BRC repeats (BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>). (<bold>B</bold>) The 126 kDa BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> protein was expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> as an insoluble protein; it was purified under denaturing conditions by anionic exchange chromatography using Q Sepharose, and then cationic exchange chromatography using SP Sepharose. The resulting purified denatured sample was renatured in a buffer containing 500 mM <sc>l</sc>-arginine and was then soluble and stable after dialysis into a standard protein buffer. (<bold>C</bold>) Co-immunoprecipitation of purified BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> with human RAD51; purified BRCA2 and/or purified RAD51 were incubated with pre-formed complexes of protein A&#x02013;Sepharose and rabbit polyclonal anti-RAD51 antibodies or non-immune rabbit serum IgG. The resulting complexes were visualized by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and protein staining with SimplyBlue, showing that the purified BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> protein is functional in RAD51 binding. (<bold>D</bold>) An interaction between BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> and RAD51 is further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation anti-BRCA2 antibodies (visualized by western blot using anti-RAD51 antibodies). BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> (10 nM) was incubated with 1&#x02013;100 nM RAD51 before immunoprecipitation using pre-formed complexes of protein A&#x02013;Sepharose and anti-BRCA2 or control irrelevant IgG. (<bold>E</bold>) The RAD51-binding capacity of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> was tested through an immunoprecipitation of BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> (0.1 &#x000b5;M) with anti-BRCA2 antibodies, in the presence of 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 &#x000b5;M RAD51 (providing molar ratios of 0.5, 1, 5 and 10:1). Increasing amounts of RAD51 were co-immunoprecipitated at molar ratios between 0.5:1 and 5:1 (detected using anti-RAD51 antibodies), with binding saturation between 5:1 and 10:1. This suggests the presence of multiple RAD51-binding sites within each BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> molecule.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl505f1"/></fig><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Circular dichroism spectroscopy of purified BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>.

Deconvolution of this spectrum using the CDSSTR algorithm indicates that the purified BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> protein consists of 9% &#x003b1;-helix, 33% &#x003b2;-sheet, 24% turns and 34% random coil (data were fitted with normalized r.m.s.d. of 0.031). This mixture of structured regions and flexible unstructured sequence is consistent with the predicted nature of the exon 11 region of BRCA2 given its generally poor conservation in terms of sequence but strong conservation in terms of inter-BRC repeat spacing between mammalian BRCA2 orthologues. (<bold>B</bold>) The differences between far UV spectra recorded over the range 205&#x02013;360 nm under native and denaturing (6 M guanidine&#x02013;HCl) conditions confirm that the renatured BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub> sample does contain secondary structural elements that are destroyed upon denaturation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl505f2"/></fig><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>EMSA analysis of ternary complex formation between BRCA2<sub>BRC1&#x02013;8</sub>, RAD51 and DNA.

Following DNA damage, the activated BRCA2&#x02013;RAD51 complex is targeted via the C-terminal domain (CTD) to the linear-duplex DNA of the RPA-coated, resected single-stranded ends. The CTD is essential to displace RPA, enabling the BRCA2&#x02013;RAD51 complex to bind DNA to form the ternary complex demonstrated here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). This may help to orient the BRCA2&#x02013;RAD51 complex with respect to the polarity of the resected double-strand break. Our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggest that the multi-BRC repeat region of BRCA2 can stimulate RAD51-mediated strand exchange, distinct from the RPA-displacing activity of the CTD, a novel activity that promotes homologous recombination. We speculate that stimulation of strand exchange involves the same mode of RAD51&#x02013;BRC repeat binding as in the inactive complex, with each BRC repeat capping one self-association surface of RAD51, but permitting filament growth from its opposite surface (circled inset). The resulting nucleoprotein filament might thus consist of multiple RAD51 multimers separated by interleaved BRC repeats.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl505f7"/></fig></sec></back></article>
