Bifunctional proteins additionally catalyze the hydrolysis of (p)ppGpp. We have earlier demonstrated that although both catalyze identical the (p)ppGpp synthesis reaction, they exhibit a differential response to Mg<sup>2+</sup> due to a unique charge reversal in the synthesis domain; an R<italic>X</italic>KD motif in the synthesis domain of bifunctional protein is substituted by an E<italic>X</italic>DD motif in that of the monofunctional proteins. Here, we show that these motifs also determine substrate specificities (GTP/GDP), cooperativity, and regulation of catalytic activities at the N-terminal region through the C-terminal region. Most importantly, a mutant bifunctional Rel carrying an E<italic>X</italic>DD instigates a novel catalytic reaction, resulting in the synthesis of pGpp by an independent hydrolysis of the 5&#x02032;P<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>-O-P<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> bond of GTP/GDP or (p)ppGpp. Further experiments with RelA from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> wherein E<italic>X</italic>DD is naturally present also revealed the presence of pGpp, albeit at low levels. This work brings out the biological significance of R<italic>X</italic>KD/E<italic>X</italic>DD motif conservation in Rel proteins and reveals an additional catalytic activity for the monofunctional proteins, prompting an extensive investigation for the possible existence and role of pGpp in the biological system.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by a <grant-sponsor>Wellcome Trust</grant-sponsor>, <grant-sponsor>United Kingdom International Senior Research Fellowship</grant-sponsor> (to B.

Microorganisms utilize a hyperphosphorylated guanine nucleotide guanosine 5&#x02032;-(tri- or di)phosphate,3&#x02032;-diphosphate ((p)ppGpp),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">6</xref> also known as the &#x0201c;alarmone&#x0201d; to cope up with unfavorable environmental conditions. (p)ppGpp, through a phenomenon termed the &#x0201c;stringent response,&#x0201d; accomplishes this by a rapid shutdown of active transcription, translation, and up-regulation of protein degradation and amino acid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). The major effect of stringent response is so far attributed to the interactions of ppGpp to RNA polymerase, &#x003c3; factors, and DksA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Apart from its effect on transcription and translation, (p)ppGpp is implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of physiological processes including sporulation, antibiotic production, nucleotide and fatty acid metabolism, surface organelle production, and more importantly, in the virulence of pathogenic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>).</p><p>(p)ppGpp is synthesized and hydrolyzed by two distinct domains in the N-terminal region of the Rel family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). They are further grouped into a Rel/SpoT bifunctional class (that synthesize and hydrolyze) and a RelA monofunctional class (that can only synthesize) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Although both domains are present in all Rel proteins, monofunctional proteins lack hydrolysis activity due to the absence of a conserved HD<italic>XX</italic>ED motif in the hydrolysis domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Although the synthesis and hydrolysis activities are confined to the N-terminal &#x0223c;385 amino acids, the C-terminal region (&#x0223c;385&#x02013;750) ensures their regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). In <italic>Streptococcus equisimilis</italic> (Rel<italic><sub>S. eq</sub></italic>), a bifunctional protein, the C-terminal region renders a negative regulatory effect on the synthesis activity and facilitates hydrolysis; deletion of the C-terminal region enhances synthesis activity by &#x0223c;12-fold while significantly reducing the hydrolysis activity (&#x0223c;150-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). A direct interaction of C-terminal region with the synthesis domain has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>); however, the key players remain elusive.</p><p>During stress, Rel proteins catalyze the transfer of a pyrophosphate from ATP to the 3&#x02032;-OH of GTP or GDP to synthesize pppGpp or ppGpp, respectively, collectively termed as (p)ppGpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). As favorable conditions are restored, the stringent response can be reversed by the hydrolysis of (p)ppGpp to GTP/GDP and pyrophosphate (PP<sub>i</sub>) by the bifunctional Rel proteins. Although both GTP and GDP can act as pyrophosphate acceptors for (p)ppGpp synthesis, the Rel proteins seem to display differential preference for either GDP or GTP; Rel from Rel<italic><sub>S. eq</sub></italic> prefers GTP over GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>), and Rel from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Rel<italic><sub>M. tb</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) and RelA from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>) are reported to utilize both GTP and GDP with equal efficiency. However, as the intracellular concentration of GDP is very low, it is believed that GTP would be the principal pyrophosphate acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>), and this notion is substantiated by the presence of phosphatases like GppA that hydrolyze pppGpp to ppGpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). On the other hand, in <italic>E. coli</italic> ppGpp has been shown to be the most potent molecule to elicit stringent response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>), which would imply a preference for GDP. In line with this, a closer analysis revealed that differences in (p)ppGpp synthesis by RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic> and Rel<italic><sub>M. tb</sub></italic>, reported in our earlier work, are not in consensus with the aforesaid equal preference for GTP and GDP.</p><p>Earlier, using the N-terminal regions of Rel proteins, we had shown that they differ in utilizing Mg<sup>2+</sup> for (p)ppGpp synthesis and had attributed this difference to a charge reversal in the synthesis domain where an R<italic>X</italic>KD in the bifunctional protein is substituted to an E<italic>X</italic>DD in monofunctional proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Here, using the full-length proteins, we further explore the significance of the distinct conservation of these motifs in Rel proteins. In contrast to the earlier reports, we found that monofunctional RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic> utilizes GDP and bifunctional Rel<italic><sub>M. tb</sub></italic> utilizes GTP as the principal pyrophosphate acceptor, and this specificity is determined by the E<italic>X</italic>DD and R<italic>X</italic>KD motifs, respectively. We further find that the presence of an R<italic>X</italic>KD motif also leads to cooperative nucleotide binding, whereas E<italic>X</italic>DD does not. Interestingly, in bifunctional protein the substitution R<italic>X</italic>KD &#x02192; E<italic>X</italic>DD (in Rel<italic><sub>M. tb</sub></italic>) led to a drastic reduction in (p)ppGpp synthesis (where &#x02192; indicates the interchange of the motifs). In contrast, a similar reversal in monofunctional proteins (<italic>i.e.</italic> E<italic>X</italic>DD &#x02192; R<italic>X</italic>KD in RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic>) resulted in enhanced synthesis. Analogous effects were not found when the N-terminal regions of the proteins were employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>), implying a critical role for these motifs in determining the regulation of catalytic activities through their interaction with the C-terminal region. The most important finding, however, is that R<italic>X</italic>KD &#x02192; E<italic>X</italic>DD substitution in the bifunctional Rel<italic><sub>M. tb</sub></italic> resulted in the synthesis of a novel molecule that we identify as pGpp. Inspired by this observation, we probed the ability of RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic>, which naturally carries an E<italic>X</italic>DD motif, to synthesize pGpp. The presence of pGpp in this reaction, albeit at low levels, opens the avenue to explore the significance of pGpp <italic>versus</italic> (p)ppGpp in microbial physiology.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Cloning, Expression, and Purification</italic>&#x02014;<italic>rel</italic> from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> was amplified using forward (5&#x02032;-TTAGAATTCCATATGACCGCCCAACGCAGCACCACC-3&#x02032;) and reverse (5&#x02032;-GGATCCAAGCTTTTACCAGTCGAGCAGCTGACGCATCCA-3&#x02032;) primers from genomic DNA.

When synthesis reactions were carried out using the N-terminal regions of RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic> and mutant Rel<italic><sub>M. tb</sub></italic> (R<italic>X</italic>KD &#x02192; E<italic>X</italic>DD) with ATP and GTP as substrates, we were surprised to observe an additional spot in the autoradiograms apart from pppGpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Here, the same assay was performed using full-length RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic> (WT-RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic>). Like the N-terminal fragments, it also showed an additional spot in the autoradiograms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>dotted circle</italic> in <italic>lane 1</italic>) apart from the anticipated pppGpp (pentaphosphate) (<italic>lane 1</italic>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Based on its position in polyethyleneimine-coated TLC, the additional spot appeared to be the tetraphosphate, ppGpp. To confirm this GTP was replaced by GDP, which resulted in the formation of ppGpp (tetraphosphate) (<italic>lane 2</italic>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The position of the additional spot indeed corresponds to the ppGpp produced in <italic>lane 2</italic>. However, ppGpp synthesis in <italic>lane 1</italic> was intriguing, as no GDP was provided in the reaction except a possible contaminant in the GTP pool that might arise from the intrinsic hydrolysis of GTP. The formation of ppGpp utilizing even the trace amount of contaminant GDP would indicate a very high affinity of RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic> for GDP. This rationale would be contrary to the earlier reports that suggested equal affinity of WT-RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic> for GTP and GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). Interestingly, the additional spot could also be detected with the N-terminal fragment of mutant Rel<italic><sub>M. tb</sub></italic> that had an E<italic>X</italic>DD motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) like WT-RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic>. Taken together, these results indicated E<italic>X</italic>DD-containing proteins to have a higher affinity for GDP than GTP. On the other hand, Rel from <italic>S. equisimilis</italic> (Rel<italic><sub>S. eq</sub></italic>) was reported to have a higher affinity for GTP over GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>), and Rel<italic><sub>M. tb</sub></italic> was reported to utilize GTP and GDP with equal efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>).

Mobilities similar to GTP indicated that the new product might contain identical number of phosphates on the guanine nucleoside, suggesting pGpp, ppGp, or pppG as the possible molecules. Because [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP was used in <italic>lanes 4</italic> and <italic>5</italic>, where the new molecule is formed, it must bear a radiolabeled pyrophosphate transferred from [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP to the 3&#x02032;-OH of the guanine nucleotide. This eliminates ppGp and pppG as candidates, and hence, the product should be 5&#x02032;-pGpp-3&#x02032;. This was further examined by intrinsic (in)stability of the new product under alkaline conditions. This is because the presence of &#x003b2;-phosphates at the 3&#x02032;-OH is known to be alkali-labile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>).

Hence the new product would be 5&#x02032;-pGpp-3&#x02032; and not its isoform, 5&#x02032;-ppGp-3&#x02032;, which is stable under alkaline conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the formation of pGpp requires GMP, which was not supplied.

However, Rel proteins were shown to utilize GMP very inefficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>), and because GTP/GDP, the efficient substrates, were provided in excess, the possibility of pGpp production due to contaminant GMP might be negated.

This demonstrated that the new catalytic subsite in the full-length protein, created by E<italic>X</italic>DD, functioned independent of pyrophosphate transfer from ATP but required ATP binding at the active site.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The Rel family of proteins is essential for microbial survival under stress by virtue of its ability to metabolize (p)ppGpp, the mediator of stringent response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). That monofunctional and bifunctional Rel proteins, due to a unique charge reversal in the synthesis domain, differ in Mg<sup>2+</sup> utilization to synthesize (p)ppGpp, was earlier reported by us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Driven by the observation that monofunctional proteins generate both pppGpp and ppGpp, although only GTP but not GDP was provided, together with ATP in the synthesis reaction, we set out to examine the effects rendered by the E<italic>X</italic>DD motif. Here, we uncover several other intriguing aspects of this seemingly simple charge reversal.</p><p>Here, for the first time we generalize substrate specificities for the Rel family of proteins based on the presence of a conserved motif in the nucleotide binding region of the synthesis domains. Proteins with an R<italic>X</italic>KD motif prefer GTP, and those with an E<italic>X</italic>DD prefer GDP as the principal pyrophosphate acceptor to synthesize (p)ppGpp. This preference is also indicated by the kinetic constants shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Although these values were determined in the absence of any cofactors or denaturants, unlike in the earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>), we believe that R<italic>X</italic>KD and E<italic>X</italic>DD motifs continue to govern substrate specificity, although the absolute values of <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> and <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> would change in presence of the cofactors <italic>in vivo</italic>. So far, based on qualitative analysis, Rel<italic><sub>M. tb</sub></italic> was inferred to utilize GTP and GDP with equal efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>), but a quantitative study on Rel<italic><sub>S. eq</sub></italic> showed a preference for GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Both being bifunctional R<italic>X</italic>KD-containing proteins, the motif-based generalization of specificity concurs with our finding that Rel<italic><sub>M. tb</sub></italic> also prefers GTP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). That RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic> with an E<italic>X</italic>DD motif utilizes GDP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) as the principal pyrophosphate acceptor is also in concurrence. However, it is not in agreement with the equal GTP/GDP efficiencies reported by Cochran and Byrne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). Perhaps this discrepancy arises due to the methods used to prepare RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic>; Cochran and Byrne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>) used the NH<sub>4</sub>Cl wash of 70 S ribosomes that also contained ribosome-associated GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), which would hydrolyze GTP used in the assays to GDP, leading to an apparent equal affinity. Also, the efficiency was calculated based on the total amount of both pppGpp and ppGpp synthesized. On the other hand, the procedures employed by us (see &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;) ensured high purity of the protein. The implication of a high GDP affinity of RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic> indicates its ability to synthesize ppGpp directly bypassing phosphatases GppA to hydrolyze pppGpp to ppGpp; ppGpp is known to be the major mediator of stringent response in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). In addition, this high GDP affinity may also be utilized by RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic> to ensure a rapid supply of ppGpp necessary to maintain a high fidelity of amino acid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) and to elicit a prompt response to the dynamically changing environment. This is possible because active translation utilizes a large amount of GTP to ensure high fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) and that may perhaps result in a higher local GDP concentration in the microenvironment around the ribosomes which could be exploited by RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic>.</p><p>Although significance to a high GDP affinity of RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic> may be construed, the genesis of the differential GDP/GTP specificities of E<italic>X</italic>DD/R<italic>X</italic>KD motifs is intriguing. In the earlier work, based on the crystal structure of Rel<sub><italic>S. eq</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>) and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-independent nucleotide binding in R<italic>X</italic>KD-containing proteins, we speculated that the phosphate groups of GTP could be coordinated by the positively charged Lys and Arg residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Hence, the presence of &#x003b3;-phosphate may explain the observed preference of R<italic>X</italic>KD for GTP. In the case of E<italic>X</italic>DD enzymes, we reasoned that the interactions provided by Lys and Arg of R<italic>X</italic>KD are compensated by interactions from an additional Mg<sup>2+</sup>, coordinated by the carboxyl groups of Glu and Asp of E<italic>X</italic>DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). They may bind guanine nucleotides by replacing the Mg<sup>2+</sup> of GDP&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup>/GTP&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup> complexes with the E<italic>X</italic>DD-coordinated Mg<sup>2+</sup>. A possible reasoning for the preference of these motifs for GTP/GDP may stem from their different modes of nucleotide binding and also from the difference in coordination of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in GDP&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup> and GTP&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup> complexes. Mg<sup>2+</sup> of GDP&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordinates P<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> and P<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>, and that in GTP&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup> would also involve P<sub>&#x003b3;</sub>, leading to a difference in the positioning of Mg<sup>2+</sup> while binding to the protein. Such a difference in the position of Mg<sup>2+</sup> is observed in the structures of ppGpp bound to RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>) and GTP bound to Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). This differential positioning of Mg<sup>2+</sup> may lead to differences in binding energy for motifs R<italic>X</italic>KD and E<italic>X</italic>DD to replace the GTP/GDP coordinated Mg<sup>2+</sup> such that it is optimal for E<italic>X</italic>DD to bind GDP&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup> and R<italic>X</italic>KD to bind GTP&#x000b7;Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Interestingly, K<sup>+</sup> ion channels similarly exploit subtle differences in hydration energy to selectively transport K<sup>+</sup> ions, but not Na<sup>+</sup>, although the latter is smaller in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). Although this speculation may explain the differential specificities in Rel proteins, evidently rigorous crystal structure analysis in the presence of GDP and GTP for both E<italic>X</italic>DD and R<italic>X</italic>KD-containing proteins will be needed to comprehensively understand this intriguing attribute.</p><p>Apart from substrate specificity, different modes of regulation in bifunctional and monofunctional Rel proteins may be inferred based on the finding that R<italic>X</italic>KD imparts cooperative ATP and GTP binding but not E<italic>X</italic>DD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). Perhaps a better regulation is achieved by R<italic>X</italic>KD for bifunctional proteins as they need to regulate two activities (<italic>i.e.</italic> synthesis and hydrolysis) at distinct domains. Delving further, we found that the C-terminal region exerts a negative regulatory effect on (p)ppGpp synthesis by means of interactions mediated through these motifs at the N-terminal region. R<italic>X</italic>KD &#x02192; E<italic>X</italic>DD reversal in bifunctional Rel<italic><sub>M. tb</sub></italic> led to a drastic reduction in (p)ppGpp synthesis, whereas E<italic>X</italic>DD &#x02192; R<italic>X</italic>KD in RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic> increased synthesis by 2.5-fold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). However, when only the N-terminal regions of the same proteins were employed, a similar influence was not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Hence, the observed differences in synthesis are likely due to differences in interactions of the C-terminal region with the E<italic>X</italic>DD and R<italic>X</italic>KD motifs. An E<italic>X</italic>DD &#x02192; R<italic>X</italic>KD interchange in MT-RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic> apart from enhancing synthesis activity, exhibited a reduction in the intrinsic fluorescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). We attributed the reduced fluorescence in the full-length protein to a possible exposure of Trp-260 (in the catalytic loop) to an aqueous environment that was otherwise buried due to interactions by the C-terminal region. The presence of R<italic>X</italic>KD in the mutant would have altered the interactions between the synthesis domain and the C-terminal region and thereby enhanced synthesis. On the contrary, R<italic>X</italic>KD &#x02192; E<italic>X</italic>DD in Rel<italic><sub>M. tb</sub></italic> that displayed a severe reduction in synthesis did not show a difference in fluorescence, although here too the catalytic loop contained a tryptophan (see the <italic>inset</italic>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). Unaltered fluorescence negates a major conformational change, and the reduction in (p)ppGpp synthesis would perhaps have arisen due to a strengthened interaction of E<italic>X</italic>DD with the C-terminal region in the mutant. Such strengthening may not influence the environment of the tryptophan in the catalytic loop but would be necessary to occlude water to facilitate the formation of a new catalytic site. Together with the observed increase in synthesis for Rel<italic><sub>S. eq</sub></italic> (with R<italic>X</italic>KD) upon deleting the C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>), we conclude that the C-terminal region regulates the activities of Rel proteins through interactions mediated by these motifs.</p><p>However, it would be interesting to compare the conformational changes seen in the full-length protein and the N-terminal half carrying only the catalytic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). In the latter we had earlier proposed a &#x0201c;loop to helix&#x0201d; transition of the catalytic loop, present in the synthesis domain. Based on circular dichroism experiments, we had proposed that these structural changes occur in R<italic>X</italic>KD-containing Rel proteins (N-terminal part) with increasing Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Here, although the observed change in intrinsic fluorescence is due to a Trp residue present in the same catalytic loop, the conformational changes appear to arise due to an interaction between the C-terminal region in the full-length protein and the E<italic>X</italic>DD motif, as discussed above.</p><p>Thus far our work reveals several interesting features of Rel proteins, attributed by the motifs R<italic>X</italic>KD and E<italic>X</italic>DD. However, an important finding is the additional catalytic reaction by E<italic>X</italic>DD-containing proteins to synthesize pGpp (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This new catalytic activity, involving the hydrolysis of the 5&#x02032; &#x003b1;-&#x003b2; ester bond of GTP/GDP/(p)ppGpp, occurs in same active site of the synthesis domain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The key features of this additional reaction are as follows. 1) It requires the presence of an E<italic>X</italic>DD motif. 2) The reaction is independent of the pyrophosphate transfer reaction from ATP. 3) It requires both GTP/GDP and ATP bind to the pocket. 4) In addition, it also requires the C-terminal region, as the additional product, pGpp, was absent when the N-terminal regions alone were employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). The fact that pGpp synthesis was pronounced in R<italic>X</italic>KD &#x02192; E<italic>X</italic>DD mutant of Rel<italic><sub>M. tb</sub></italic> than in RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic>, where E<italic>X</italic>DD is present naturally, made it possible to identify the existence of pGpp. A possible reason for the different amounts of pGpp produced may be provided based on the strength of interactions between the C-terminal region and the synthesis domain as described above; the stronger the interaction, the lower the (p)ppGpp synthesized and higher the pGpp synthesized. These conjectures raise several possibilities and warrant the structure determination of full-length Rel proteins.</p><p>In summary, our findings open new avenues to further explore the function of Rel proteins. It may appear that pGpp is a byproduct of (p)ppGpp synthesis by RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic>. However one cannot rule out that depending on the biological context, RelA<italic><sub>E. coli</sub></italic> may fine-tune interactions between synthesis domain and C-terminal region to promote pGpp synthesis. Thus, Gram-negative bacteria may have an evolutionary advantage of having a monofunctional RelA in addition to SpoT, a bifunctional enzyme, to adjust to the dynamic environment more rapidly than the Gram positives, which need to cope with a single copy of bifunctional Rel. As R<italic>X</italic>KD &#x02192; E<italic>X</italic>DD in bifunctional proteins introduced a third activity, <italic>i.e.</italic> pGpp synthesis, efficient regulation of three independent catalytic activities in a single polypeptide chain may not be viable and, hence, the absence of an E<italic>X</italic>DD in bifunctional proteins. This would be in line with the drastic reduction in (p)ppGpp synthesis upon R<italic>X</italic>KD &#x02192; E<italic>X</italic>DD substitution in bifunctional Rel<italic><sub>M. tb</sub></italic>. Similarly, monofunctional proteins would have overcome this constraint of regulating three activities by compromising the hydrolysis activity, ensured by the presence of SpoT in the organism and thereby facilitating the efficient acquisition of a new catalytic activity in the synthesis domain.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We sincerely thank the members of Prakash laboratory for input during the course of the study.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Cashel, M., Gentry, D., Hernandez, V.
