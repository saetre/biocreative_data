Here we show for mice, using histological, immunochemical and PCR-based methods, that stimulation of innate resistance was followed by appearance of numerous endogenous retroviruses and ensuing PrP up-regulation in germinal centers of the spleen. Subsequently, the activated retroviruses disappeared in a PrP-dependent manner. Our results reveal the regular involvement of endogenous retroviruses in murine immune responses and provide evidence for an essential function of PrP in the control of the retroviral activity.

In the absence of PrP, TSE symptoms do not develop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Bueler1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, and the accumulation of misfolded PrP in diseased tissue is a hallmark of TSE. According to the widely accepted protein-only hypothesis, misfolded PrP itself constitutes the infectious agent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Prusiner1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Yet, this dogma awaits to be proven and is challenged by strong evidence for the involvement of non-PrP molecules as &#x0201c;partners in crime&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Caughey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. A recent study demonstrated that synthetic poly(A) RNA, added to purified native hamster PrP, is a sufficient stoichiometric cofactor for <italic>in vitro</italic> amplification of misfolded PrP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Deleault1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Remarkably, hamsters inoculated with samples obtained by these amplification experiments developed TSE. Rather unexpectedly though, the disease occurred not only with samples from amplification that had been initiated by a seed of misfolded PrP originating from diseased hamster brain, but likewise with samples from amplification that had started spontaneously, i.e. in the absence of an initial TSE seed. Moreover, strain characteristics of TSE caused with inoculum from seeded and spontaneous <italic>in vitro</italic> amplification were undistinguishable, but they differed from TSE caused with inoculum of misfolded PrP that was used to seed amplification. Hence, TSE strain characteristics of the inoculum generated by <italic>in vitro</italic> amplification seemed to be imprinted not by a seed of misfolded PrP, as the protein-only hypothesis would entail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Prusiner1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, but rather by the accessory poly(A) RNA. The putative role of RNA in TSE is also supported by a related study reported earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Deleault2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, where the accessory component extractable from tissue homogenate and sufficient for <italic>in vitro</italic> amplification of misfolded PrP was recognized to be particular RNA. By other researchers, RNA aptamers specifically interacting with native or misfolded PrP were isolated by in vitro selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Sayer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Weiss1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. This indicates that in complex mixtures, RNA species may compete for binding to PrP conformers, which could be the basis for TSE strain formation and interferences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Weissmann1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Nishida1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, despite the evidence gained by means of <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments for a cofactor role of RNA in TSE, no TSE-specific RNA has ever been identified. Therefore, the roles of PrP and possible cofactors in TSE have remained controversial.</p><p>The physiological function of PrP might be a key towards better understanding TSE pathophysiology. Numerous reports from the past two decades proposed various physiological roles of PrP in processes as diverse as copper homeostasis, leukocyte differentiation or neuritogenesis, indicating that PrP may serve more than one purpose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Caughey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Westergard1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, PrP is a broadly expressed and highly conserved gene product <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Bendheim1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Wopfner1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that susceptibility to TSE, which could be considered a negative selection criterion for this protein, is outweighed by a vital function of PrP. Though, this view is in harsh contrast with observations that PrP seems to be dispensable for normal development and health of individual mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Bueler2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Richt1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Up to date, no concept has emerged that would reconcile the conflicting aspects of this enigmatic protein.</p><p>We have recently described an up-regulation of PrP in the germinal centers of mouse spleens following immune-stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Ltscher1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Although this regulation is suggestive of an immunological role of PrP, no consequences of the increased PrP level could be demonstrated. Here we report that PrP up-regulation occurs in response to massive appearance of endogenous murine retroviruses in the germinal centers upon immune-stimulation. We show that elevated PrP expression helps to reduce the retroviruses to the level before their activation, whereas in the absence of PrP virus abundance persists. Hence, we have identified in the mouse a key role of PrP in the control of activated endogenous retroviruses. Our findings may resolve the aforementioned conflict in the conception of PrP function and suggest a plausible candidate for an RNA species possibly involved in TSE.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Co-localized massive appearance of endogenous murine retroviruses and increased PrP expression in immune-stimulated splenic FDC networks</title><p>Splenic PrP up-regulation was observed 8 days after infection of na&#x000ef;ve mice with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or intravenous administration of preformed immune complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Ltscher1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Clarification of this issue was expected from the identification of MLV-specific proviral genes involved in the observed appearance of MLV particles in immune-stimulated mouse spleens. First, we analyzed total splenic RNA using real-time RT-PCR with a primer-probe set of broad specificity for MLV-related RNA sequences. All spleen samples tested positive for MLV RNA, without significant differences between na&#x000ef;ve and immune-stimulated mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001158-t001">Table 1</xref>). This result most likely reflected the general abundance of MLV-related RNA species in mouse spleens, as indicated already by the notable RT &#x0201c;background&#x0201d; activity level of na&#x000ef;ve spleen lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001158-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

Complementary DNA corresponding to the purified MLV RNA was amplified and subcloned. From the subcloned PCR products two sequences of 732 nucleotides each were identified. They are homologous to published MLV-related sequences in the NCBI GenBank, with accession number U63133 (nucleotide range 2058&#x02013;2789) and X94150 (range 2061&#x02013;2792), respectively. Because these sequences seemed to represent <bold>i</bold>mmune-activated <bold>m</bold>urine <bold>e</bold>ndogenous <bold>r</bold>etro<bold>v</bold>iruses, we named them IMERV-1 (homologous to U63133) and IMERV-2 (X94150).

We first tested this hypothesis in a cell culture model of 3T3 fibroblasts infected <italic>in vitro</italic> with MLV. Western blot analysis of cell lysates showed that MLV-propagating cells expressed significantly more PrP than non-infected control 3T3 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001158.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Thus, the presence or activity of MLV is associated with increased PrP expression. Importantly, this PrP increase was not correlated with an increase of PrP-related RNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001158-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that a mechanism independent of transcription was involved. Correspondingly, in mice splenic PrP was up-regulated posttranscriptionally after immune-stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Ltscher1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. This indicated that PrP up-regulation occurred more specifically than just by broad gene activation in response to viral burden.</p><p>We examined splenic PrP expression and the presence of MLV p30 over 14 days following immune-stimulation of C57Bl/6 mice by VSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001158-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Retroviral p30 increased at day 5 post-infection, peaked around day 8 and decreased again by day 14. Increased PrP expression was detected by day 8 and persisted beyond day 14. Thus, the kinetics was in line with the assumption that splenic PrP up-regulation occurred in response to IMERV, but also that increased PrP expression might be linked to IMERV regression.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Retrovirus regression in response to increased PrP expression</title><p>If there was an inhibitory effect of up-regulated PrP on IMERV, then PrP-deficient mice should show sustained IMERV activity.

They were compared with C57Bl/6 wild-type mice (PrP- and IMERV-competent) and 129/Sv wild-type mice (PrP-competent, IMERV-deficient) on day 8 and day 30 after VSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001158-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001158-g003">3</xref>). In 129/Sv spleens, no MLV p30 was detected at any time point and PrP expression remained low. C57BL/6 wild-type spleens revealed high MLV p30 and PrP presence on day 8, yet on day 30 the two proteins differed. While PrP expression was still high, MLV p30 expression had nearly vanished. In contrast, in C57BL/6 mice lacking PrP (<italic>Prnp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> Nagasaki) MLV p30 was found enhanced on day 8 and stayed high at least until day 30. Hence, these results support our hypothesis that PrP up-regulation negatively controls the splenic presence of IMERV. An uncertainty about the correct interpretation, however, was caused by the known particularity of <italic>Prnp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> Nagasaki mice to ectopically express Doppel protein (Dpl), a PrP paralogue, in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Rossi1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Conceivably, Dpl may as well be ectopically expressed in the splenic FDC network, and if so, the persistence of IMERV in <italic>Prnp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> Nagasaki mice might not be the result of PrP absence but of Dpl presence. Immunohistochemistry indeed revealed that Dpl was expressed in the splenic FDC network of <italic>Prnp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> Nagasaki mice. In the <italic>Prnp<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> F1 generation of a crossing of C57Bl/6 wild-type and <italic>Prnp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> Nagasaki mice, both PrP and Dpl were localized in the FDC network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001158.s006">Figure S6</xref>). This co-localization permitted us to show that PrP expression in <italic>Prnp<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> F1 mice restored the phenotype of IMERV regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001158-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) irrespective of a putative role of splenic Dpl in IMERV activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study has revealed that PrP up-regulation occurring in the mouse spleen after immune-stimulation coincides and co-localizes with the transient appearance of endogenous MLV (IMERV). Because PrP up-regulation did not occur in mice that lack the respective IMERV, and in turn, IMERV persisted in the spleen of mice without PrP expression, we conclude that splenic PrP expression plays a crucial role in the negative feedback control of immune-activated endogenous MLV.</p><p>Whether PrP expression and retroviral activity are similarly interconnected in non-splenic tissues and other mammalian species remains to be determined, yet, support for such an assumption is provided by cell culture experiments. Over-expression of PrP counteracted the formation of endogenous MLV in N2a neuroblastoma cells (data not shown) and repressed HIV-1 in an infected human cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Leblanc1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings also indicate that the antiretroviral function of PrP might rely on cell-autonomous mechanisms. In the case of HIV-1 repression PrP was reported to interfere with the synthesis of distinct viral proteins on the level of translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Leblanc1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, implying an interaction with retroviral RNA. In support of such an interaction, functional binding of PrP to retroviral RNA was demonstrated in a cell-free system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Gabus1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, and PrP was found to be present not only in cell membranes but also in the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Mironov1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Although PrP binding to retroviral RNA in mammalian cells waits to be confirmed, it is consistent with the concept of PrP and RNA partnering in TSE as summarised in the Introduction. We propose that PrP binding to retrovirus-related RNA is crucial for the antiretroviral effect of PrP expression as well as the pathophysiology of TSE. The latter may explain the interactions observed between TSE and (endogenous) retroviruses in murine <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Leblanc2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Lee1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. The involvement of retrovirus-related RNA in TSE might also account for the activation pattern of microglia that was found to be reminiscent of an inflammatory response to latent or persistent viruses rather than to amyloidogenic proteins (including abnormal PrP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Baker1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Besides the combined evidence for an involvement of retrovirus-related RNA in TSE, it is worth mentioning that in mammals this RNA species occurs ubiquitously, on occasion abundantly, and in various sizes (down to the range of small interfering RNA). Omnipresence or small size could be reasons why no TSE-specific RNA was identified so far. In addition, RNA species can adopt various conformations, and therefore, tissue preparations containing (enriched) TSE infectivity may fail to show TSE-specific ribonucleotide sequences because TSE specificity is imprinted in the secondary structure. According to our model, in which interacting PrP and RNA both can assume TSE-related conformations, principally either binding partner might be able to initiate <italic>per se</italic> propagation of the TSE agent. For the maintenance of propagation and strain characteristics, however, we assume the interaction of both components, PrP and RNA, to be required (in accordance with the results of Deleault et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Deleault1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>The massive appearance of IMERV in the FDC network of the mouse spleen is a remarkable finding by itself. Because IMERV activity occurred in response to various immune-stimuli and in several inbred mouse strains, it may be a common trait with physiological functions. Evidence for a connection between endogenous C-type viruses and the humoral immune response of mice was reported already three decades ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Moroni1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Since then, diverse immunological roles have been discussed for endogenous retroviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Nelson1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and we may speculate that IMERV activity likewise can provide antiviral resistance or modulate immune responses. The absence of genomic IMERV sequences and IMERV activity, as reported here for 129/Sv mice, might therefore be associated with immunological aberrations. Indeed, mice of the 129 strain show deficits in macrophage recruitment as well as NK and B cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-White1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Corcoran1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The causes of these deficiencies have remained elusive, however, the macrophage impairment was reported to be a polygenic trait <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-White1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, which might be consistent with the absence of IMERV-related genes.</p><p>Regarding the putative immunological impact of IMERV, control of IMERV-like activity may be important, all the more since retroviral activity in general increases the risks of insertional modifications of the genome or the emergence of new retroviral pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Lower1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The PrP function suggested here might well extend to the control of further retroviral elements in addition to IMERV, as indicated by the potential of PrP revealed in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Leblanc1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Gabus1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001158-Adler1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Still, for individual animals the restriction of retroviral activity by PrP might be dispensable, like any proposed role of PrP, as implicated for instance by the viability of inbred PrP-deficient laboratory mice. However, it might be vital at the species level to limit risks posed by the activity of endogenous retroviral elements.</p><p>In summary, our experiments have revealed, by correlation, a crucial role of PrP expression in the limitation of a common, but previously unrecognized, phenomenon in the mouse spleen, namely the massive activity of endogenous retroviruses in germinal centers after various immune-stimulations. The biological significance of transient retroviral activity in the spleen and anti-retroviral PrP function remains to be established. Yet, our findings offer an intriguing new viewpoint from which the conceptual conflicts thus far associated with PrP function and TSE pathophysiology may be resolved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>All mice were bred and maintained under SPF-conditions and experiments performed in accordance with institutional and Swiss-national guidelines.
