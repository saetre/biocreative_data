Backcrossed to the SJL/J background, most RR mice spontaneously develop RR experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with episodes often altering between different central nervous system tissues like the cerebellum, optic nerve, and spinal cord. Development of spontaneous EAE depends on the presence of an intact B cell compartment and on the expression of MOG autoantigen. There is no spontaneous EAE development in B cell&#x02013;depleted mice or in transgenic mice lacking MOG. Transgenic T cells seem to expand MOG autoreactive B cells from the endogenous repertoire. The expanded autoreactive B cells produce autoantibodies binding to a conformational epitope on the native MOG protein while ignoring the T cell target peptide. The secreted autoantibodies are pathogenic, enhancing demyelinating EAE episodes. RR mice constitute the first spontaneous animal model for the most common form of multiple sclerosis (MS), RR MS.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Autoimmune diseases can affect most organs of the body including liver, heart, the endocrine system, the musculoskeletal apparatus, and the central nervous system (CNS). They commonly start off at a young age and then last throughout life, often resulting in severe disability. The factors that trigger the onset, modulate the course, and determine the clinical character of autoimmune diseases have remained obscure, a deficit of knowledge which sets limits to the design of specific and efficient therapies.</p><p>Yet there is increasing evidence that organ-specific autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and multiple sclerosis (MS), are the result of a pathogenic interaction of autoimmune T and B cells. There is substantial information on the role of T cells in organ-specific autoimmunity. Some act as effector cells attacking self-tissues, either directly or via recruiting accessory cells like macrophages. Other T cells regulate the time course of the response and still others provide help to autoantibody-producing B cells. The contribution of autoimmune B cells to the inflammatory pathogenesis seems to be complex as well. Beyond producing humoral autoantibodies, B cells serve as APCs activating pathogenic T cells, and, through their capacity of releasing cytokines, B cells are involved in shaping local microenvironments favorable to evolving cellular autoimmune responses.</p><p>Deciphering the interactions between T and B cells in the spontaneous development of organ-specific autoimmune responses requires suitable animal models. Naturally occurring models are available for type 1 diabetes mellitus and systemic lupus erythematosus but not for autoimmunity in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Recently, we and others described a double-transgenic mouse model, which simulates opticospinal MS (OSMS) remarkably well, a variant of which is also known as Devic's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). These mice, termed opticospinal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE [OSE]) mice, express myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)&#x02013;specific receptors on T and B cells and spontaneously develop demyelinating inflammatory disease at frequencies &#x0003e;50%. Like in human OSMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), the lesions in affected mice are restricted to optic nerve and spinal cord, and, in most cases, the disease takes a chronic progressive course without remissions and marked relapses. It should, however, be noted that the type of MS that most prevalently affects Caucasian populations differs fundamentally from OSMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Typically, MS starts out with a relapsing-remitting (RR) course, where disease episodes may completely resolve only to be followed by a subsequent relapse. In this disease variant, the pathogenic lesions, demyelinating plaques, may be located throughout the CNS, thus causing the notoriously varied neurological defect patterns.</p><p>In this paper, we describe a new transgenic mouse model that spontaneously develops RR-EAE and, thus, recapitulates the &#x0201c;Western&#x0201d; variant of MS. Furthermore, and most importantly, we found that in these mice transgenic autoimmune T cells expand autoimmune B cells from the endogenous immune repertoire and guide them to produce antibodies against conformational epitopes of the MOG protein, which, together with complement, may initiate the destruction of MOG-expressing target cells.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>New MOG-specific TCR transgenic SJL/J mice</title><p>We generated transgenic mice expressing a TCR specific for the rat/mouse MOG peptide 92&#x02013;106 in the context of I-A<sup>s</sup>.

We have now created similar double-transgenic mice by mating TCR<sup>1640</sup> SJL/J mice to IgH<sup>MOG</sup> on SJL/J background. Double-transgenic TCR<sup>1640</sup> &#x000d7; IgH<sup>MOG</sup> mice developed spontaneous EAE very similar to TCR<sup>1640</sup> single transgenics, with some apparently minor differences. Almost all double-transgenic females came down with disease by 120 d of age, whereas males of the same age showed an EAE rate of &#x0003c;40%. This gender gap was highly significant but narrowed during the subsequent weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>).</p><p>We also crossed IgH<sup>MOG</sup> mice to the medium and low frequency lines TCR<sup>1639</sup> and TCR<sup>1586</sup>, respectively. Only 1 out of 17 medium frequency TCR<sup>1639</sup> &#x000d7; IgH<sup>MOG</sup> mice displayed EAE and none of the low frequency TCR<sup>1586</sup> &#x000d7; IgH<sup>MOG</sup> showed any clinical symptoms (Table S1).</p><p>The CNS disease spontaneously developing in TCR transgenic SJL/J mice differed dramatically from spontaneous OSE seen in OSE mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). In TCR transgenic SJL/J mice, single-transgenic TCR<sup>1640</sup> mice, and double-transgenic TCR<sup>1640</sup> &#x000d7; IgH<sup>MOG</sup> mice, disease was extremely variable both in course and clinical nature. Typically, in females EAE started with an RR course. Often, the first attacks resolved completely but were followed by further bouts. Intriguingly, individual EAE bouts often differed radically in their neurological defects. In a substantial number of cases, the initial bout was dominated by ataxia rather than by classical EAE defects. Affected mice were unable to walk along a straight line, deviating and falling to the side, but did not show limb weakness or paralysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090299/DC1">Video 1</ext-link>). In many cases, the mice recovered completely until a first relapse, which commonly showed a completely different clinical picture, for example, hind limb paralysis as seen in typical EAE. Again, this second disease episode subsided, giving way to partial remission. Later disease episodes mostly showed classical paralytic EAE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090299/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table I.</label><caption><p>Spontaneous EAE in TCR transgenic SJL/J mice: course of disease</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mice (gender)</td><td colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">RR (n)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Progressive (n)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">With full remission</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">With partial remission</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>%</italic></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>%</italic></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>%</italic></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">TCR<sup>1640</sup> (f)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.4 (5/7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.3 (1/7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.3 (1/7)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">TCR<sup>1640</sup> (m)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35.3 (6/17)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.7 (2/17)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53 (9/17)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">TCR<sup>1640</sup> &#x000d7; IgH<sup>MOG</sup> (f)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43.7 (7/16)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.0 (4/16)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.2 (5/16)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">TCR<sup>1640</sup> &#x000d7; IgH<sup>MOG</sup> (m)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.2 (1/16)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.0 (4/16)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.8 (11/16)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">rMOG imm.

The disease starts spontaneously and, in contrast to OSE mice described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), in most cases takes an RR course, with clinical signs differing between individual bouts. Importantly, development of spontaneous disease goes along with the expansion of myelin autoimmune B cells from the endogenous immune repertoire.</p><sec><title>Spontaneous RR-EAE</title><p>RR mice are transgenic SJL/J mice expressing at high frequency a TCR specific for MOG peptide 92&#x02013;106 in the context of I-A<sup>s</sup>. RR mice differ substantially from previously created transgenic SJL/J mice expressing TCRs recognizing a dominant peptide of PLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). These animals, kept under specific pathogen-free conditions, developed spontaneous disease but, in contrast to RR mice, the disease was mostly progressive without remissions and subsequent relapses.</p><p>The course and clinical expression of autoimmune diseases are determined by diverse factors, both genetic and environmental. Indeed, SJL/J mice are predisposed to develop fluctuating disease. Depending on the protocol applied, active immunization against encephalitogenic proteins may trigger RR disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Clearly, this response pattern is facilitated by distinct regulatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), which may also influence spontaneous EAE developing in RR mice. So far, our breeding results suggest that B10.S mice, which have a distinct genetic background but share the MHC and the TCR transgene with SJL/J RR mice, very rarely develop spontaneous EAE, and in the few cases observed, the disease took a chronic rather than RR course (unpublished data).</p><p>Most variants of induced EAE present a stereotypical clinical syndrome with motor deficiencies starting at tail and hind limbs and progressing cranially with ongoing disease. Histologically, this clinical picture is reflected by a caudocranial gradient of inflammatory lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). In a few models, however, additional parts of the CNS are affected. For example, in C57BL/6 mice, MOG-induced EAE has a predilection to affect the optic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), and cerebellar disease was noted in further antigen/mouse combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Our RR mouse models are the first to show immune attacks against different CNS parts in subsequent inflammatory relapses. They thus provide a unique paradigm to study the mechanisms underlying the targeting of MS lesions within the CNS during ongoing disease.</p><p>Several investigators reported that in RR-EAE actively induced by immunization with encephalitogenic peptides, relapses went along with the T cell reactivity against new epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), a phenomenon termed &#x0201c;determinant spreading&#x0201d; by Lehmann et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Recent work by McMahon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>) suggests that in actively induced chronic EAE, initial bouts of CNS inflammation result in the induction of professional APCs within or near the affected CNS target tissue. By taking up myelin antigens and presenting crucial epitope components to newly arrived naive autoreactive T cells, the repertoire of target autoantigens spreads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). It should, however, be mentioned that determinant spreading, i.e., recruitment of potentially encephalitogenic T cells specific for epitopes other than MOG p92-106, has not been patent in spontaneous disease of our RR mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Expansion of MOG-specific B cells from endogenous repertoire</title><p>As described recently, in the C57BL/6 OSE model, MOG-reactive TCR transgenic T cells require the presence of MOG-specific B cells to kindle spontaneous EAE at high frequency. In this model, the MOG-specific B cells were transgenic with their germline IgJ region replaced by the rearranged H chain of a MOG-specific mAb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>).</p><p>Based on these previous observations, we initially created double-transgenic mice by crossing our new MOG TCR transgenic SJL/J strain with MOG-specific B cell knock-in SJL/J mice. These mice presented with spontaneous RR-EAE at high frequency. Less expected spontaneous EAE was noted also in TCR single-transgenic SJL/J mice with a high proportion of MOG-reactive CD4 T cells but without transgenic B cells. It turned out that in these TCR single-transgenic mice, MOG-specific B cells were expanded from the endogenous B cell compartment. Substantial numbers of B cells were observed to invade the inflammatory lesions, and there were heavy local deposits of Ig along with some activated complement. Most importantly, TCR single transgenics produced high titers of anti-MOG autoantibodies of IgG1 and IgG2 isotypes, which bound to correctly conformed membrane bound autoantigen, destroyed MOG-expressing target cells, and, thus, have demyelinating potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>MOG-reactive B cells are essential for the spontaneous development of RR-EAE. Depletion of B cells by treatment with anti-CD20 mAb profoundly suppressed RR-EAE when started at young age. Treatment of adult mice produced much more inconsistent results, a phenomenon which was recently noted in other investigations in actively induced EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).</p><p>B cells contribute to immune and autoimmune responses by secreting humoral antibodies, by acting as APCs, and by releasing cytokines. RR mice, both single and double transgenic, produce MOG-specific autoantibodies that share their dominant isotype, IgG1, with the original demyelinating anti-MOG mAb 8.18-C5 and that, in vivo, aggravate EAE when transferred i.v. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Importantly, we found large Ig deposits in the demyelinating lesions of single- and double-transgenic RR mice. At least part of these antibodies may have been produced by local infiltrating B cells. In fact, B cells isolated from CNS infiltrates were found to secrete anti-MOG antibodies at high levels.</p><p>Beyond autoantibody secretion, MOG-specific B cells profoundly influence autoimmune responses by directly interacting with autoimmune T cells. In OSE mice, as well as in TCR<sup>1640</sup> &#x000d7; IgH<sup>MOG</sup> mice (unpublished data), MOG-specific B cells concentrate highly diluted MOG and present the antigen to MOG-reactive T cells. Hence, antigen-presenting B cells may contribute to the initiation and progression of spontaneous EAE. But, in addition, B cells may act into the opposite direction; they were shown to limit EAE by releasing IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) and by influencing function of regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>).</p><p>The spontaneous recruitment and expansion of autoimmune B cells from the endogenous repertoire by organ-specific autoimmune T cells in the absence of exogenous autoantigen represents a mechanism of autoimmunity that has not yet been described. The MOG-specific B cell expansion process critically requires the presence of the endogenous target autoantigen, as <italic>Mog</italic>-deficient TCR transgenic SJL/J mice never produced anti-MOG autoantibodies, nor did they develop spontaneous RR-EAE.</p><p>The role of endogenous MOG is intriguing, considering that this target autoantigen is predominantly confined to the CNS tissues, which are largely inaccessible to circulating T and B cells. This hidden localization distinguishes the RR mouse paradigm from transgenic mice, where activation of virus-specific B cell was noted in the presence of high numbers of virus-specific transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and a viral pseudo-autoantigen expressed throughout the organism in cell types including DCs and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>).</p><p>Several mechanisms could be involved in MOG-specific B cell expansion. MOG-specific T cells could intrude into the naive CNS and create immunogenic conditions that allow the activation and expansion of naive B cells in the local milieu. This scenario has been forwarded recently as an explanation of epitope spreading in actively induced EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Alternatively, immunogenic MOG and/or myelin debris could be transported to local lymph nodes, either as cell-free material or by phagocytes, to be presented there to autoreactive B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Although MOG is predominantly expressed in the CNS, its messenger RNA was also found in some non-CNS organs, such as thymus, spleen, and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>), and low protein levels were found in the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Presentation of very low amounts of peripherally available MOG remains, at least in theory, an alternative mechanism of B cell expansion in RR mice.</p><p>Finally, animal models with spontaneously developing EAE show promise for the discovery of new drugs and the validation of existing medications. Thus, the opticospinal type of EAE described previously may represent essential features of human OSMS/Devic's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), a disease variant which is rarely found in high prevalence populations. The spontaneous RR-EAE, with its conspicuous variation of neurological deficiencies, will provide a model for the most frequent type of MS, as it is seen typically in early phases of the disease.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>SJL/J mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. <italic>Mog</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) were backcrossed into SJL/J for seven generations, crossed with TCR<sup>1640</sup> transgenic SJL/J mice, and then intercrossed to generate TCR<sup>1640</sup> transgenic <italic>Mog</italic> KO mice.
