Prior studies in mice with single deletions of the IRF-3 or IRF-7 genes showed increased vulnerability to West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Whereas mice and cells lacking IRF-7 showed reduced IFN-&#x003b1; levels after WNV infection, those lacking IRF-3 or IRF-7 had relatively normal IFN-b production. Here, we generated IRF-3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x000d7; IRF-7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> double knockout (DKO) mice, analyzed WNV pathogenesis, IFN responses, and signaling of innate defenses. Compared to wild type mice, the DKO mice exhibited a blunted but not abrogated systemic IFN response and sustained uncontrolled WNV replication leading to rapid mortality. Ex vivo analysis showed complete ablation of the IFN-&#x003b1; response in DKO fibroblasts, macrophages, dendritic cells, and cortical neurons and a substantial decrease of the IFN-&#x003b2; response in DKO fibroblasts and cortical neurons. In contrast, the IFN-&#x003b2; response was minimally diminished in DKO macrophages and dendritic cells. However, pharmacological inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B and ATF-2/c-Jun, the two other known components of the IFN-&#x003b2; enhanceosome, strongly reduced IFN-&#x003b2; gene transcription in the DKO dendritic cells. Finally, a genetic deficiency of IPS-1, an adaptor involved in RIG-I- and MDA5-mediated antiviral signaling, completely abolished the IFN-&#x003b2; response after WNV infection. Overall, our experiments suggest that, unlike fibroblasts and cortical neurons, IFN-&#x003b2; gene regulation after WNV infection in myeloid cells is IPS-1-dependent but does not require full occupancy of the IFN-&#x003b2; enhanceosome by canonical constituent transcriptional factors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that infects birds, horses, and humans and has become an emerging infectious disease threat in the Western Hemisphere. In humans, WNV can invade into the brain and spinal cord and destroy neurons, causing severe neurological disease, particularly in the immunocompromised and elderly. A better understanding of how the immune system controls WNV infection is critical for developing new treatments and vaccines. In this study, using a mouse model of WNV infection, we evaluate the combined role of two key transcription factors, interferon-regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) and IRF-7, that orchestrate antiviral and interferon (IFN) responses after infection. Mice that lack both IRF-3 and IRF-7 were highly vulnerable to lethal infection and cells lacking IRF-3 and IRF-7 had a markedly attenuated IFN-&#x003b1; response. Surprisingly, macrophages and dendritic cells lacking IRF-3 and IRF-7 showed a relatively normal IFN-&#x003b2; response. Furthermore, a genetic deficiency of IPS-1, a protein that signals downstream of the RIG-I- and MDA5 cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors, completely abolished IFN-&#x003b2; production. Our experiments suggest that in specific cell types infected with WNV, IFN-&#x003b2; can be induced through an IPS-1-dependent transcriptional signal that does not require the master transcriptional regulators IRF-3 and IRF-7.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The rapid production of type I interferon (IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;) and the IFN-induced antiviral response serve as primary host defense mechanisms against infection by many viruses (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000607-Koyama1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000607-Stetson2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>).

A current paradigm for type I IFN production after RNA virus infection describes a two-step or positive feedback model that is modulated by the master transcription factors interferon regulatory factors (IRF)-3 and -7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000607-Honda1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000607-Honda3">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In the initial phase, viral sensing by PRR induces nuclear localization of IRF-3, which stimulates gene transcription and production of IFN-&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b1;4 by infected cells. In the second phase, these IFNs bind to a common IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; receptor in a paracrine and autocrine manner and signal through the JAK-STAT pathway resulting in the induced expression of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISG) (e.g., PKR, RNAse L, viperin, ISG15, and ISG20), which limit viral replication through multiple mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000607-Lenschow1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000607-Samuel1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Whereas IRF-3 is constitutively expressed throughout many tissues and functions downstream of specific PRR (e.g., TLR3, MDA5, and RIG-I) to inhibit RNA viruses, IRF-7 is both an ISG and a transcriptional activator downstream of distinct PRR (e.g., TLR7 and TLR8); IRF-7 participates in an IFN amplification loop by inducing IFN-&#x003b2; and many subtypes of IFN-&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000607-Honda4">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Recognition of West Nile virus (WNV), a neurotropic virus of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family of RNA viruses, by the intrinsic cellular immune response is believed to occur through concerted signals by several PRR (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, RIG-I, and MDA5) that recognize single or double-stranded RNA and signal through their constituent adaptor molecules (TRIF, MyD88, and IPS-1). Tissue culture experiments with murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) suggested that RIG-I is an initial and primary PRR for WNV as genetically deficient cells had an abrogated ISG response at early time points after infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000607-Fredericksen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Surprisingly, the IFN-&#x003b2; response remained intact suggesting possible redundant effects of IRF-3 and IRF-7 in regulating IFN-&#x003b2; gene expression. These results agree with an independent study in which IRF-7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEF infected with herpes simplex (HSV), vesicular stomatitis (VSV), or encephalomyocarditis (EMCV) virus showed residual IFN-&#x003b2; responses that were abolished in IRF-3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x000d7; IRF-7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000607-Honda4">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To understand the combined roles of IRF-3 and IRF-7 in innate immune programs following WNV infection in vivo, we generated IRF-3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x000d7; IRF-7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> double knockout (DKO) mice.

Remarkably, in experiments with myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) ex vivo, the IFN-&#x003b2; response after WNV infection was abolished by the absence of IPS-1 but was largely unaffected by a combined deficiency or the transcription factors IRF-3 and IRF-7 or individual deficiencies of IRF-1, IRF-5, or IRF-8.

Thus, a combined deficiency of IRF-3 and IRF-7 in vivo delays and diminishes the accumulation of type I IFN in serum. However, over time, type I IFN accumulates in the serum of DKO mice after WNV infection. Thus, additional regulatory factors must contribute to the systemic IFN response.

TRAF6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEF, however, exhibited reduced IFN-&#x003b1; mRNA levels and protein secretion (240-fold and 4-fold reduction, P&#x0003c;0.0001) despite a relatively normal early IFN-&#x003b2; response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000607-g011"><bold>Fig 11A and 11C</bold></xref>). Thus, TRAF6 appears dispensable for the early IFN-&#x003b2; gene response but required for amplifying the late IFN-&#x003b1; and -&#x003b2; responses in MEF. Our experiments suggest that TRAF3 and TRAF6 have distinct and complementary functions in activating the type I IFN response in MEF after WNV infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Early protection of the host against viral infections relies on the rapid detection of the pathogen and optimal activation of the type I IFN response. Here, using mice and primary cells lacking expression of both IRF-3 and IRF-7, we demonstrate that these transcriptional activators have essential non-redundant functions: DKO mice exhibited a more rapid lethality with enhanced tissue viral burden compared to mice lacking either IRF-3 or IRF-7. Associated with this profound virological phenotype, DKO mice had attenuated levels of systemic type I IFN. A combined deficiency of IRF-3 and IRF-7 however, showed heterogeneous cellular IFN-&#x003b2; but not -&#x003b1; responses. Whereas IFN-&#x003b1; was virtually abolished in all DKO cells tested, the IFN-&#x003b2; response was sustained in DKO M&#x003c6; and mDC. The uncoupling of virus induction of IFN-&#x003b2; from IFN-&#x003b1; in DKO M&#x003c6; and mDC establishes a cell-type specificity and IRF-3/IRF-7-independence of this pathway.</p><p>The combined absence of IRF-3 and IRF-7 largely abrogated the IFN-&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; responses in primary fibroblasts and cortical neurons. This data agrees with previous experiments showing loss of IFN-&#x003b1; and -&#x003b2; gene induction in DKO MEF infected with HSV-1, VSV, or EMCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000607-Honda4">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, a deficiency of both IRF-3 and IRF-7 had a relatively modest effect on the IFN-&#x003b2; response in M&#x003c6; and mDC. Thus, IFN-&#x003b2; induction after WNV infection in myeloid cells depends on IRF-3 and IRF-7-independent transcriptional signals. This result is consistent with data showing significantly reduced but not abrogated type I IFN levels in serum of DKO mice after WNV infection. Analogously, a recent study showed residual IFN-&#x003b2; activity in serum after MCMV infection in independently generated DKO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000607-Steinberg1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

As pDCs require IRF-7 for IFN production, yet DKO mice still produce systemic levels of IFN after WNV infection, non-pDC cell population(s) must contribute to this response. This result agrees with recent data showing no alteration of systemic type I IFN production in TLR7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice infected with WNV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000607-Town1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The current model for optimal IFN-&#x003b2; gene transcriptional depends on complete occupancy of the enhanceosome of the IFN-&#x003b2; gene promoter by the transcriptional factors IRF-3, IRF-7, NF-&#x003ba;B and ATF-2/c-Jun.

Our data with MEF lacking IRF-3 and IRF-7 show a requirement of all individual enhanceosome constituents in efficiently regulating the IFN-&#x003b2; response. Consistent with this, pharmacological inhibition of the other enhanceosome constituents, NF-&#x003ba;B and ATF-2/c-Jun in MEF expressing IRF-3 and IRF-7 also strongly reduced the efficacy of IFN-&#x003b2; gene transcription. Surprisingly, this model did not apply to mDC where only functional loss of all four enhancesome components strongly diminished IFN-&#x003b2; gene activation. Thus, in mDC, IFN-&#x003b2; expression after viral infection can be induced robustly without full occupancy of the enhanceosome by the canonical transcriptional regulators. Although we do not fully understand the molecular basis for the cell-type restriction of enhanceosome occupancy and IFN-&#x003b2; gene induction, it is possible that in myeloid cells other transcriptional regulators can substitute for the canonical complex members to activate IFN-&#x003b2; gene transcription. However, other individual IRF family members (e.g., IRF-1 or IRF-8), which are known to induce the IFN-&#x003b2; response after viral infection or engagement of PRR in some systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000607-Tailor1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000607-Matsuyama1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000607-Tailor2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, did not have a dominant regulatory effect in the context of WNV infection.

The generation of triple IRF-3, IRF-7 and IRF-5 knockout mice and cells may help to address this question. Alternatively, a differential level of histone acetylation of the IFN-&#x003b2; gene could exist in MEF and mDC. A more &#x0201c;relaxed&#x0201d; chromatin structure of the IFN-&#x003b2; gene in mDC might not require the coordinate recruitment of all chromatin-remodeling proteins; thus, full occupancy of the enhanceosome by transcription factors may not be a prerequisite for optimal activation of IFN-&#x003b2; gene transcription in this cell type.</p><p>Our results also establish that IFN-&#x003b2; gene activation in several cell types is largely IPS-1-dependent and likely occurs downstream of RIG-I and MDA5 recognition of WNV RNA.

Gale, unpublished results).</p><p>Further dissection of the IPS-1-dependent signaling pathway in MEF showed a differential role of TRAF3 and TRAF6 in regulating IFN-&#x003b2; responses. Based on studies with deficient MEF, TRAF3 contributes dominantly to the early phase of IFN-&#x003b2; production, likely by recruiting TBK1. Consistent with this, others have shown that TBK1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEF infected with Sendai virus have a reduced IFN-&#x003b2; response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000607-Perry1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast to TRAF3, TRAF6 had a more dominant function in sustaining the type I IFN positive feedback. Thus, after WNV infection, the type I IFN amplification loop appears mediated by signals downstream of the IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R receptor, which may include induction and/or activation of IRF-7 and TRAF6.

The host through recognition of an as yet undefined viral RNA PAMP in the cytoplasm detects WNV. RIG-I acts as the primary PRR sensor for WNV during the early stages of infection. RIG-I activation promotes association with IPS-1, which leads to recruitment of TRAF3 and TBK1, and phosphorylation of IRF-3. NF-&#x003ba;B and ATF-2/c-Jun and the small amounts of constitutively expressed IRF-7 may also be activated via this IPS-1-dependent pathway. IRF-3, IRF-7 NF-&#x003ba;B, ATF-2/c-Jun translocate to the nucleus, bind the IFN-&#x003b2; gene promoter and promote transcription. Secretion of IFN-&#x003b2; by infected cells during this early phase results in autocrine and paracrine type I IFN signaling through binding of the IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R. (2). Activation of IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R results in phosphorylation of JAK1 and Tyk2, which activate STAT1 and STAT2 leading to formation of the heterotrimer ISGF3 (STAT1, STAT2 and IRF-9). Nuclear translocation and promoter binding of ISGF3 upregulates hundreds of different ISG, including IRF-7. (3). During a later phase of infection, detection of WNV in MEF also relies on MDA5 and PKR. Recruitment of TRAF3 and TRAF6 activates IRF-3 and IRF-7. NF-&#x003ba;B and ATF-2/c-Jun are also activated via an as yet undefined mechanism. Subsequently, IRF-3, IRF-7, NF-&#x003ba;B, and ATF-2/c-Jun translocate to the nucleus, bind the IFN-&#x003b2; gene promoter and induce optimal transcription. Induction of IFN-&#x003b1; genes occurs through TRAF6 and the transcriptional activation of IRF-7.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1000607.g012"/></fig><p>In summary, our studies demonstrate that IRF-3 and IRF-7 coordinately play essential but differential roles in vivo in protecting against WNV pathogenesis primarily by regulating the IPS-1-dependent type I IFN responses through a cell type-dependent mechanism. These studies illuminate the cell-specific complexity of IFN induction and enhance our understanding of how an effective innate response becomes activated soon after viral infection.
