A relevant issue is how this newly acquired DNA interacts and integrates in the regulatory networks of the bacterial cell. The global modulator H-NS targets both core genome and HGT genes and silences gene expression in response to external stimuli such as osmolarity and temperature. Here we provide evidence that H-NS discriminates and differentially modulates core and HGT DNA. As an example of this, plasmid R27-encoded H-NS protein has evolved to selectively silence HGT genes and does not interfere with core genome regulation. In turn, differential regulation of both gene lineages by resident chromosomal H-NS requires a helper protein: the Hha protein. Tight silencing of HGT DNA is accomplished by H-NS-Hha complexes. In contrast, core genes are modulated by H-NS homoligomers. Remarkably, the presence of Hha-like proteins is restricted to the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>. In addition, conjugative plasmids encoding H-NS variants have hitherto been isolated only from members of the family. Thus, the H-NS system in enteric bacteria presents unique evolutionary features. The capacity to selectively discriminate between core and HGT DNA may help to maintain horizontally transmitted DNA in silent form and may give these bacteria a competitive advantage in adapting to new environments, including host colonization.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Acquisition of DNA by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) significantly increases bacterial genetic variability. Relevant issues are the mechanisms that bacterial cells have evolved to efficiently integrate the newly acquired DNA into the host cell regulatory machinery. In Gram negative cells, the nucleoid associated protein H-NS has been shown to bind AT-rich sequences of HGT DNA and silence unwanted expression of these genes. This has led to consider H-NS as a &#x0201c;genome sentinel.&#x0201d; Nevertheless, this proposed role must be compatible with its role modulating core genome genes. Weak expression of recently transferred genes must be coordinated with proper expression levels of housekeeping genes. In this paper, we describe a strategy that enteric bacteria have developed to differentially modulate HGT and core genome genes. Two independent lines of experimental evidence suggest that the H-NS system of enteric bacteria may have evolved to discriminate between core genome and HGT DNA. The plasmid R27-encoded H-NS protein selectively modulates HGT genes. This avoids plasmid-encoded H-NS interfering with modulation of core functions. We also show that, for efficient silencing of HGT genes, resident chromosomal H-NS recruits the Hha protein and forms heteromeric complexes with DNA. In contrast, housekeeping genes are modulated by H-NS alone.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acquisition of DNA by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a crucial mechanism by which bacteria increase genetic variability. Among others, functions that enable bacterial cells to cause disease (virulence factors) as well as to overcome the effect of antimicrobial drugs are often encoded in HGT DNA (i.e., bacterial plasmids or genomic islands). While HGT DNA may provide a potential advantage in host colonization, the incorporation of foreign DNA may constitute a potential perturbation for the regulation of the core genome, resulting in a significant fitness cost. An efficient mechanism that enables the bacterial cell to control the expression of foreign DNA is exemplified by the H-NS protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Dorman1">&#x0005b;for a review see 1&#x0005d;</xref>. H-NS belongs to the superfamily of bacterial nucleoid-associated proteins and is involved in the adaptative response of bacterial cells to changes in environmental factors such as temperature or osmolarity. The regulatory region of H-NS-modulated genes usually contains two separated target sequences, which have often been characterized by being AT-rich curved DNA stretches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Rimsky1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Interaction of H-NS molecules with their target sequences results in protein oligomerization and the generation of a DNA loop. When this nucleoprotein complex is formed, transcription is switched off <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Rimsky1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Dorman2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Mapping of H-NS binding sites on the <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium chromosome by a ChlP on chip approach showed that H-NS binds preferentially to AT-rich HGT DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Navarre1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Lucchini1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. This finding has been interpreted as H-NS playing a relevant role in the silencing of unwanted expression of these sequences and has led to the proposal of a predominant role of the H-NS protein as a genome sentinel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Dorman3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Several conjugative plasmids, such as those of the IncH1 group, also encode plasmidic forms of H-NS and Hha. IncH1 plasmids are common in the causal agent of typhoid fever, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> subsp. <italic>enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium, and are associated with the multi-drug resistance (MDR) phenotype that some isolates exhibit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Wain1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. A well-characterized representative of this incompatibility group is plasmid R27 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Sherburne1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. This plasmid was isolated from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium in the 1960s and since then has been detected in several <italic>S.</italic> Typhi outbreaks. R27 is 180 kbp in length, confers tetracycline resistance and shows a temperature-dependent conjugative phenotype. R27 encodes single copies of <italic>hns</italic> and <italic>hha</italic> genes (ORFs 164 and 182 respectively).

Here we provide evidence that plasmid-encoded H-NS-like proteins have evolved to selectively target HGT and not core genome DNA. We also show that chromosomally-encoded H-NS targets both HGT and core genomic DNA, but differentially modulates them by using Hha-like proteins to specifically silence HGT genes. Altogether, our results suggest that in enteric bacteria the H-NS modulator may have evolved to discriminate between vertically and horizontally inherited DNA sequences, efficiently silencing the latter. This feature could provide a fitness advantage by allowing the presence of a large number of silent virulence genes to be available, without interfering with the regulation of the bacterial core genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Acquisition of R27 plasmid by an <italic>hns</italic> mutant from <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium strain SV5015 restores wt expression of only a subset of H-NS-sensitive genes</title><p>Analysis of the contribution of chromosomal- and R27-encoded H-NS proteins in silencing the functions required for plasmid conjugation suggested that these proteins are functionally interchangeable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Forns1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

We hypothesized that the set of SV5015 genes sensitive to H-NS<sub>R27</sub> are similar to the set of genes that are co-regulated by H-NS/Hha proteins. To test this hypothesis, we first performed global transcriptomic studies to determine H-NS and Hha-dependent modulation of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> genome in a range of conditions of osmolarity and temperature. Gene expression patterns of strains SV050515, SV5015AV (<italic>hns</italic>) and SV5015HY (<italic>hha ydgT</italic>) grown either in low and high osmolarity LB medium, and either at 25 or 37&#x000b0;C in conventional LB medium, were compared (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000513.s004">Table S3</xref>). <italic>hha ydgT</italic>-mediated gene deregulation in LB medium at 37&#x000b0;C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Vivero1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> was observed under the osmolarity and temperature conditions tested. Remarkably, most of the genes deregulated in the <italic>hha ydgT</italic> mutant were also deregulated in the <italic>hns</italic> mutant: a total of 162 genes were overexpressed both in <italic>hha ydgT</italic> and <italic>hns</italic> mutants, and most of them were overexpressed under several growth conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000513.s004">Table S3</xref>). Although the extent of overexpresssion differed, repression of a set of genes by H-NS/Hha at low and high temperature and at low and high osmolarity indicates that the H-NS/Hha complex efficiently silences their expression under a wide range of non-permissive conditions. Overexpression in the <italic>hns</italic> mutant was fully compensated by R27 in 60&#x00025; of these genes, and partially compensated in an additional 14&#x00025;. Therefore, there is a significant correlation between the H-NS-sensitive genes that require Hha for efficient modulation and those that are sensitive to H-NS<sub>R27</sub>. A significant number of those are located in HGT DNA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is well-documented and accepted that a key role of the global modulator H-NS is to silence large stretches of AT-rich HGT DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Navarre1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Dorman3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Castang1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The capacity of this protein to preferentially bind to AT-rich motifs that display planar curvature probably underlies HGT DNA silencing. Efficient silencing of unwanted expression of foreign DNA appears, in turn, as a critical issue to facilitate the integration of newly acquired DNA into the host regulatory network. Nevertheless, several reports have also shown that H-NS modulates the expression of housekeeping genes, such as <italic>proV</italic> or <italic>leuO</italic>. Hence, a role for H-NS as a genome sentinel must be compatible with its function as a general gene regulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Dorman3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results open up a new perspective about how these two roles are accomplished by H-NS in enteric bacteria.</p><p>To date, plasmid-encoded H-NS-like proteins have been considered to be functionally equivalent to the corresponding chromosomally-encoded paralogues. Indeed, functional replacements and equivalent sets of interactions have been shown for plasmid- and chromosomal- H-NS-like proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Forns1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Deighan1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Doyle1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. On the basis of this equivalence, the presence of H-NS-like proteins in plasmids has been interpreted as providing an additional source of H-NS that can compensate the depletion of resident H-NS caused by binding of the protein to AT-rich stretches of newly acquired plasmids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Doyle1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The results reported here evidence that plasmidic and chromosomal H-NS proteins show considerable functional differences. H-NS<sub>R27</sub> may contribute to reducing the fitness cost of housing HGT DNA by targeting plasmid sequences while leaving chromosomal H-NS available for its corresponding chromosomal targets, as suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Doyle1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, H-NS<sub>R27</sub> does not influence the intrinsic regulation of H-NS- sensitive housekeeping genes, such as <italic>rcsA</italic>, <italic>psiF</italic>, <italic>proV</italic> or s<italic>tpA</italic>. The identification of a HGT-specific plasmid-encoded H-NS protein suggests that H-NS sensitive genes form two distinct genetic compartments. A relevant question is how resident chromosomal H-NS recognizes and differentially modulates genes from both compartments. We show that H-NS interacts with members of the Hha/YmoA family to specifically silence HGT but not core genome genes. Coregulation of gene expression by H-NS/Hha proteins was first evidenced for the <italic>E. coli hly</italic> operon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Nieto1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Further data demonstrated that other genes in several enteric bacteria are modulated by an H-NS/Hha complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Silphaduang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Navarre1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, rather than by H-NS alone. A recent global transcriptomic analysis has shown that, when <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium SV5015 is grown in LB medium at 37&#x000b0;C, the set of genes sensitive to modulation by Hha and/or its paralogue YdgT is coincident with the set of H-NS-modulated genes that map in HGT DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Vivero1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Remarkably, Hha/YdgT proteins appear to silence mainly HGT genes. The effect of <italic>hha/ydgT</italic> mutations on the transcriptome of <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BSN26 is very limited. Only a small number of genes is affected (our unpublished results). We interpreted these data as strain BSN26 containing a very limited amount of HGT DNA.</p><p>Genes sensitive to Hha/YdgT modulation are silenced under several <italic>in vitro</italic> growth conditions (i.e., low and high temperature, low and high osmolarity), and a significant number are silenced by H-NS under the same conditions. H-NS-controlled weak expression of HGT DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Taoka1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> must be compatible with the expression of several housekeeping genes, which are readily switched on in response to specific stimuli. A good example of the latter is osmolarity-dependent modulation of <italic>proV</italic>, which is silenced by H-NS alone and is insensitive to Hha silencing.</p><p>We found a significant coincidence between the set of genes modulated by H-NS/Hha and those sensitive to H-NS<sub>R27</sub>. Plasmidic genes and chromosomal genes incorporated by HGT are prominent members of the set that are both silenced by H-NS<sub>R27</sub> or require Hha to be silenced by the chromosomal form of H-NS. This observation strengthens the notion that H-NS-modulated genes can be assigned to two genetic compartments. The first includes genes encoding housekeeping functions that are modulated by chromosomal H-NS alone and are insensitive or only weakly modulated by plasmidic H-NS<sub>R27</sub>. In contrast, the genes belonging to the second compartment, which includes mostly horizontally acquired genes, require a helper protein of the Hha family for their complete silencing by chromosomal H-NS, and can also be modulated by plasmidic H-NS.</p><p>For many years, it was considered that H-NS did not recognize a consensus DNA sequence, but bound to AT-rich curved stretches of DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Dorman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In recent years, significant efforts have been devoted to defining high-affinity binding sites for H-NS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Bouffartigues1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Lang1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results suggest that H-NS-sensitive promoters fall into at least two categories. H-NS sensitive promoters may share some basic common characteristics but display differences that can be picked up by the plasmidic H-NS form or by H-NS/Hha complexes. Differential affinity of H-NS-like proteins for DNA regions targeted by H-NS has also recently been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Uyar1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The StpA paralogue binds to DNA regions similar to those bound by H-NS in <italic>E. coli</italic> wt cells. In contrast, only one-third of these sequences are bound by StpA in the absence of H-NS. This partial binding results in only partial StpA-mediated modulation of H-NS-sensitive genes in <italic>hns</italic> mutants. While the basis for such differential affinity may be the generation of either StpA-H-NS hetero- or StpA-StpA homodimers, in the example reported here structural differences between H-NS and H-NS<sub>R27</sub> might account for the differential affinity of these two proteins for some promoter regions. Sequence conservation between H-NS<sub>R27</sub> and H-NS in the N- and C-terminal domains was very high; however, significant differences between H-NS and H-NS<sub>R27</sub> were located in the linker domain (53&#x00025; of the positions were different) (data not shown). The linker domain is predicted to be partially unstructured in the isolated protein and is associated with protein oligomerization although it has also been implicated in the modulation of DNA binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Shindo1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>While H-NS-like proteins are widely distributed within &#x003b3;-proteobacteria, both Hha-like proteins and the presence of H-NS-like proteins in conjugative plasmids appear to be an evolutionary trait of members of the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Madrid3">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Members of this family display the ability to use the H-NS protein to silence HGT regions with the help of co-repressors of the Hha family of proteins. Specialized plasmidic H-NS-like molecules also have the capacity to modulate HGT DNA, but have evolved not to interfere with core genes. These features should facilitate the incorporation of HGT DNA, leading to more complex genomes with increased capability to adapt to new environments. This adaptive capacity may also explain why several enterobacterial representatives, such as virulent <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, have become such successful pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Wirth1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000513-Pigtout1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmids and strains</title><p>Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000513.s007">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000513.s005">Table S4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000513.s006">Table S5</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>&#x003b2;-galactosidase assay</title><p>Levels of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity were assayed by standard techniques, using the CHCl<sub>3</sub>-sodium dodecyl sulfate permeabilization procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overexpression of proteins by the T7 RNA polymerase system and purification of His-Tagged proteins</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) &#x00394;<italic>hns</italic> strain was used as host induction of H-NS-like R27 protein expression.
