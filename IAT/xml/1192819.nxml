So, the mechanism by which 11-ketotestosterone exhibits such high potency remains unclear. Recently we cloned the cDNA of an 11-ketotestosterone regulated protein, spiggin, from three-spined stickleback renal tissue. As spiggin is the only identified gene product regulated by 11-ketotestosterone, the stickleback kidney is ideal for determination of the mechanism of 11-ketotestosterone gene regulation. A single androgen receptor gene with two splicing variants, belonging to the androgen receptor-&#x003b2; subfamily was cloned from stickleback kidney. A high affinity, saturable, single class of androgen specific binding sites, with the characteristics of an androgen receptor, was identified in renal cytosolic and nuclear fractions. Measurement of ligand binding moieties in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions as well as to the recombinant receptor revealed lower affinity for 11-ketotestosterone than for dihydrotestosterone. Treatment with different androgens did not up-regulate androgen receptor mRNA level or increase receptor abundance, suggesting that auto-regulation is not involved in differential ligand activation. However, comparison of the trans-activation potential of the stickleback androgen receptor with the human androgen receptor, in both human HepG2 cells and zebrafish ZFL cells, revealed preferential activation by 11-ketotestosterone of the stickleback receptor, but not of the human receptor. These findings demonstrate the presence of a receptor preferentially activated by 11-ketotestosterone in the three-spined stickleback, so far the only one known in any animal.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Androgens have critical physiological roles in male sexual differentiation and in the development of male secondary sex characteristics. Androgens primarily mediate their actions through interactions with receptors belonging to the steroid hormone receptor super-family. Androgen receptors (AR) have been identified in many vertebrates and demonstrate similar binding characteristics in the various species investigated. Most vertebrates have one AR with high specificity for 5&#x003b1;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). However, some teleosts have two AR with high binding affinities for either testosterone (T) or DHT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. 11-ketotestosterone (KT) is a major androgen in many teleosts and it often occurs at higher levels in the circulation and has a higher potency in inducing male reproductive functions than other androgens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although several AR have been isolated and characterized from teleost species, none of these have characteristics expected in a specific KT receptor. Consequently, an explanation for the high androgenic potency of KT in teleosts is currently not available.</p><p>AR have been cloned and characterized from several teleosts, including Japanese eel (<italic>Anguilla japonica</italic>), rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>), tilapia (<italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic>) and red seabream (<italic>Pagrus major</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Rainbow trout, tilapia and Japanese eel have two AR isoforms and while only one isoform (AR&#x003b1;) is a functional AR in rainbow trout, both Japanese eel AR are functional receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Following transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with either of the Japanese eel AR cDNAs it was observed that KT and DHT were equally potent activators of both AR isoforms, while T was significantly less potent in activating an MMTV-LTR driven luciferase reporter vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In contrast, the red sea bream AR was equally activated by T and KT via an MMTV promoter system in transfected COS-7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Similarly, a rainbow trout AR&#x003b1; reporter system in a carp EPC cell line was equally activated by DHT, KT and T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, none of the previously cloned AR genes show any preference for KT in trans-activation assays. A lack of specificity for KT in androgen signaling pathways was also suggested by androgen binding studies on tissues from Atlantic croaker (<italic>Micropogonias undulatus</italic>), kelp bass (<italic>Paralabrax clathratus</italic>), rainbow trout and goldfish (<italic>Carassius auratus</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Based on tissue specific binding profiles there are two forms of AR in Atlantic croaker and kelp bass. One isoform, AR1, shows the highest binding affinity for T followed by DHT and KT while the other, AR2, shows the highest affinity for DHT followed by T and KT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A limitation of the previous studies was that no KT-regulated gene had been identified in any of the studied species, and therefore no definite conclusion regarding endogenous gene regulation by KT could be drawn.</p><p>Hypertrophy of the kidneys and the production of a glue, spiggin, used in nest building by the kidneys of male three-spined sticklebacks (<italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>) during the breeding season, is currently the clearest example of a male reproductive process induced by KT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although treatment of stickleback with a variety of androgens can induce the kidney hypertrophy normally observed during the breeding season, KT is by far the most potent inducer of kidney hypertrophy and spiggin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These findings are of physiological importance because KT is the major plasma androgen during the breeding season in male stickleback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, a previous study showing that [<sup>3</sup>H]-KT was equally displaced from stickleback kidney tissue fragments by unlabelled KT or DHT provided no evidence for the presence of a specific KT AR in this species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Thus, even in sticklebacks, where a specific KT-regulated gene product has been identified, the mechanism by which KT exhibits high androgenic potency remains unclear.</p><p>Due to the well-known regulation of spiggin by KT in the three-spined stickleback, the stickleback kidney is an ideal system in which to determine the mechanism by which KT regulates gene expression in teleosts and to determine the possible involvement of specific KT receptors in this signaling pathway. The binding characteristics of stickleback kidney cytosolic and nuclear preparations were comprehensively investigated in the present study to determine the androgen specificity of the AR(s) in this species. Furthermore, AR was cloned from stickleback kidney RNA and the molecular structures of two splicing variants, AR&#x003b2;1 and AR&#x003b2;2, were characterized. While the investigations of the binding affinities of androgens for the stickleback AR indicated that DHT bound better than KT to the receptor, comparison of the trans-activation potency of the stickleback AR with the human AR showed that KT was more potent at down-stream gene activation than DHT, in transfected HepG2 and ZFL cells, in the presence of the stickleback AR but not of the human AR.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>[<sup>3</sup>H]-DHT (92.84 Ci/mmol) and [<sup>3</sup>H]-KT (98.05 Ci/mmol) were purchased from New England Nuclear (Boston, MA, USA) and stored at -20&#x000b0;C. The unlabeled steroids were purchased from either Steraloids, Inc. (Wilton, NH, USA) or from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO, USA). All radiolabelled steroids were stored in 95% ethanol at -20&#x000b0;C. Chemicals and salts used for making the buffers were purchased from Sigma and from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The scintillation cocktail was a mixture of 4 L toluene, 16 g PPO (7,5-diphenyl-oxazole), and 0.4 g POPOP (1,4-bis [5-phenyl-2-oxazolyl]-benzene).</p><sec><title>Fish Maintenance</title><p>Adult stickleback were caught in &#x000d6;resund and routinely housed in large aquaria containing brackish water (0.5% salinity) at 20&#x000b0;C under a photoperiod of 16:8 h light:dark (LD). A total of 300 male and female sticklebacks were used in the present study. The fish ranged in weight between 1 and 3 g. The water was aerated and filtered and the bottom was covered with sand. The fish were fed red midge larvae daily. Kidneys from males that had been brought into breeding condition by exposure to 20&#x000b0;C under a photoperiod of 16:8 h LD were used for the characterization of the AR. For the experimental treatments, the fish were initially in non-breeding condition. For the spiggin-experiment post-breeding females were used, these had been exposed to LD 16:8 and 17&#x000b0;C for a few months. For the other experimental treatments, fish were caught in non-reproductive seasons and housed under low temperature (9&#x000b0;C) and a photoperiod of LD 8:16 until a few days before treatment when they were put into high temperature and long photoperiod in order to acclimate. These investigations were approved by the Stockholm Northern Animal Experiment Ethical Committee (permit N 185/00).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Tissue sampling and steroid treatments</title><p>Steroid treatments were performed using females, as their kidneys do not undergo hypertrophy under natural conditions, and castrated males. The fish were anesthetized with 0.1% (v/v) 2-phenoxyethanol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and implanted intraperitoneally with Silclear silicone tubing (10-mm length, 0.6-mm inner diameter, 1.2-mm outer diameter) containing steroids dissolved in cocoa butter. The steroids used were 11-ketoandrostenedione (KA), DHT, T and 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (E2) (1 or 25 &#x003bc;g &#x003bc;l<sup>-1</sup>). KA was used as this steroid is converted into KT by the fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Tubes containing cocoa butter alone were used as controls. Following implantation the fish were maintained in 50-liter aquaria containing brackish water (0.5% salinity) at 20&#x000b0;C under LD 16:8 h. At sampling fish were decapitated and the kidneys were excised, frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70&#x000b0;C. A number of experiments were performed as follows. Spiggin mRNA was measured in post-breeding females that were dissected 2 days following implantation of tubes. Cytosolic androgen-receptors were measured in females and in castrated males. Males were castrated under anesthesia as above, by making a 1.5 mm long incision into the abdominal cavity on each side and removing the testes using forceps. The females and the castrated males were implanted with control and high dose tubes and dissected after 6 days. AR mRNA was studied in females implanted for 12 h, 2 and 16 days (separate experiments) with control and high dose tubes and in males castrated as above and implanted for 10 days with control tubes and high doses of KA or E2.</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from a pooled sample of five mature male kidneys using Tri Reagent&#x02122; (Sigma).

Binding was also observed for E2 (85.10 &#x000b1; 17.87 nM), but not for 17,20&#x003b2;-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20&#x003b2;-P), 17,20&#x003b2;,21-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (20&#x003b2;-S) or F (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>). Using AR&#x003b2;2 containing reticulocyte extract, the highest affinity again was observed for DHT (EC<sub>50 </sub>= 0.67 &#x000b1; 0.19 nM), followed by KT and T (2.18 &#x000b1; 0.71 nM and 3.03 &#x000b1; 0.43 nM), while E2 showed lower binding affinity (64.61 &#x000b1; 0.28 nM) and F showed poor binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>). Thus, in both cases DHT was found to have higher affinity than KT or T for the stickleback AR.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Competition curves for the binding of various natural steroids to AR in kidney</bold>. <italic>A</italic>, cytosolic extracts, and <italic>B</italic>, reticulocyte lysate samples.

Central to androgenic signaling is the interaction between the hormone and its receptor. So far no AR, which is preferentially activated by KT, has been identified in any animal. The only KT-induced gene product clearly identified to date is the underwater adhesive protein, spiggin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which is synthesized in the kidneys of male three-spined sticklebacks and used to construct a nest. While KT is the main inducer of spiggin production, other androgens will also increase spiggin synthesis in a dose-dependent fashion, although less efficiently. Measurements of androgen levels in stickleback have shown that KT is a prominent androgen in males during the breeding period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It has been shown that the KT levels increased from 2 ng/ml during the prespawning period to peak at 40 ng/ml during spawning and to thereafter return to lower levels (&#x02264;1 ng/ml) in post spawning male sticklebacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Through these stages the T levels remain at about 1&#x02013;4 ng/ml plasma. In spawning female stickleback the KT levels have been determined to be 1 ng/ml while the T levels are 20 ng/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Circulating DHT levels have not been measured in the stickleback, but are likely to be low since neither DHT nor 5&#x003b1;-androstane-3,17-dione were formed in significant amounts (&#x02264;0.5%), if at all, when nesting stickleback testes tissue were incubated with tritiated androstenedione (reexamination of data on which [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] are based). While there are also no measurements of DHT levels in the stickleback kidney, 5&#x003b1;-reductase has been identified in stickleback kidney samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], thus suggesting that DHT may be locally formed and functional in stickleback. However, these studies suggest that KT is the main androgen in spawning male sticklebacks. In the present study KA was 10 times more potent than DHT and 50 times more potent than T at inducing spiggin mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In a previous study, using longer exposures (16 days) spiggin mRNA induction was only observed with KA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These results clearly show that 11-ketoandrogens are by far the most effective inducers of spiggin mRNA. Furthermore, androgen induction of spiggin protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and mRNA synthesis (Olsson, P.-E., Berg, A.H., Lindberg, C., unpublished results) can be blocked by the anti-androgen flutamide. This suggests that spiggin is induced, preferentially by KT, via a traditional AR, belonging to the nuclear steroid hormone receptor family.</p><p>Cloning and characterization of the stickleback AR demonstrated that there is a single AR gene locus that codes for a single receptor and that the ligand-binding characteristics of both the cloned and the endogenous receptor are indicative of a single class of high affinity AR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) with higher affinity for DHT than for KT or T (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The binding kinetics shows that the AR present in the stickleback kidney has ligand-binding characteristics similar to those of previously characterized nuclear AR from other teleosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The stickleback AR shows the greatest similarity to AR from seabream and tilapia, fishes that like the stickleback, but unlike the rainbow trout and eel, belong to Series Percomorpha among the Acanthypterygii [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The receptor was found to have 2 splicing variants and 2 poly adenylation sites, and therefore could result in 4 possible different transcripts. The ligand-binding domain of the AR was found to be highly similar to other AR and contains the amino acids that are thought to be important for DHT interaction with the human AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The crystallographic structure of human AR indicates that N705, Q711, R752 and T877 have possible hydrogen bonds with DHT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These 4 amino acids are conserved in teleost AR with one exception; in tilapia AR&#x003b2; has a R752K substitution (GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB045212">AB045212</ext-link>). However, no data is available on the function of that receptor. Amino acids L704, M745 and F764 that are considered to have close contact with the ligand in human AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], are also conserved in teleost AR. An additional amino acid considered to be important for the architecture of AR is R779 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Three mutations (R779A, R779Q and R779S) of the human AR were tested for trans-activation in COS cells and were found to lead to complete inactivation of AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It is interesting to note that this amino acid is not conserved among teleosts where both R779S and R779T are found. Neither of these alternative amino acids results in silencing of AR in teleosts as observed by transcriptional activation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These results demonstrate that the AR ligand binding domains of teleosts and mammals are highly similar, although not identical.</p><p>Several previous studies have shown the presence of DHT and T receptors in teleosts, but so far no specific KT receptor has been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Comparison of trans-activation efficacy between human AR and Japanese eel AR&#x003b1; and AR&#x003b2;, using 293 cells, showed that KT was equally effective at activating gene transcription via either the human AR or Japanese eel AR&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and that all three AR failed to distinguish between KT, DHT and T. Although several studies have determined either the ligand binding affinity of AR or the trans-activation of AR, there are few studies dealing with both aspects. However, in one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], the rainbow trout AR&#x003b1; ligand binding properties were determined in a heterologous system, the COS-1 cell line. The potency of binding was highest (IC<sub>50</sub>: 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-10 </sup>M), for DHT followed by T, while the poorest binding (IC<sub>50</sub>: 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-9 </sup>M) was observed for KT. In contrast to this, determination of the trans-activation potential using the carp epithelioma papillosum cyprini cell line indicated that the efficiency of activation of the rainbow trout AR&#x003b1; was equal for all three natural androgens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, there was an apparent discrepancy between the binding studies, showing that rainbow trout AR&#x003b1; had higher affinities for DHT and T than KT, and the reporter gene studies, showing that this difference was not reflected in activation potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the present study we observed that DHT bound with higher affinity than KT to the native stickleback AR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>) and the <italic>in vitro </italic>translated recombinant stickleback AR&#x003b2;2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>). However, following transfection of the stickleback AR&#x003b2;2-CMVTNT expression vector into either human HepG2 or zebrafish ZFL cells, together with either the <italic>slp</italic>-ARU or the <italic>slp</italic>-ARE, KT was in both cases approximately 2 to 3-fold more potent than DHT in activating the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). In contrast to this the human AR was equally activated by DHT, KT and T (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>), which is in agreement with earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Taken together the results are consistent with the data obtained on rainbow trout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and suggest that KT preferentially activate the stickleback AR&#x003b2;2. The N-terminal domain has been suggested to be important for both trans-activation and protein-protein interactions and it is conceivable that there are ligand specific interactions between the LBD and the N-terminal trans-activation domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Evidence that ligand-dependent conformational changes may occur with the AR has been obtained with mesterolone, a synthetic androgen with an additional methyl group on carbon 1 of the A ring. Although mesterolone was found to have a similar binding affinity as DHT and T for both the wild type human AR and a mutant AR found in subfertile men, only mesterolone was able to restore mutant AR function to normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The 3-fold difference in trans-activation potential probably does not entirely explain the observed potency differences between KT and DHT in inducing spiggin in stickleback <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This result may partly be due to the different in the binding affinities of various androgens to the sex steroid binding proteins in fish blood. While KT has low affinity for binding to sex steroid binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], both DHT and T show high affinities for these binding proteins in both mammals and teleosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The lower binding affinity of 11-ketoandrogens for sex steroid binding proteins in the plasma, and the resulting higher circulating levels of free steroid, may also contribute to the higher effectiveness of KT in inducing spiggin and kidney epithelium hypertrophy as well as male reproductive behavior in three-spined stickleback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to estrogen receptors that are auto-regulated by estrogens, AR is not generally up-regulated by androgens and no ARE have been found in the promoter or 5'-flanking region of cloned AR. While AR is generally transcriptionally down regulated by androgens, the protein half-life appears to be increased by androgens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Auto-regulation has, however, been observed in some tissues, including rat ventral prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], the Harderian gland located in the orbital cavity of the golden hamster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], male rat forebrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], human bone cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and Atlantic croaker brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. ARE have been identified in the coding region of AR cDNA from rat and shown to be functional, but require interaction with Myc family protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The ARE sequences (5'-TGTCCT-3') and (5'AGTACTCC-3') are separated by 182 bp in the rat AR cDNA and highly similar sequences are also found in other species, including the three-spined stickleback. However, despite the presence of possible AREs in the AR cDNA we did not observe any auto-regulation of kidney AR by androgens. E2 was the only steroid tested that altered AR mRNA and protein levels. Down-regulation of AR by estrogens is a common feature of AR, and E2 was shown to reduce both the AR mRNA and protein levels of stickleback kidney. This could be a component in the mechanism by which estrogens can suppress kidney hypertrophy in the stickleback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In the present study we found no evidence that upregulation of AR mRNA or protein stability contributes to the KT specificity of spiggin induction. Thus, the stickleback AR is the first example of an AR preferentially activated by KT in any animal. Our results indicate that auto-regulation is not involved in this phenomenon. However, the lower binding affinity of KT than either DHT or T to sex steroid binding proteins in the circulation may be a contributing factor <italic>in vivo</italic>. As these proteins are not present in the <italic>in vitro </italic>systems the presently observed differences in ligand dependent transcriptional activation cannot be due to transport proteins.</p><sec><title>Summary</title><p>The present study indicates the presence of a single gene coding for a nuclear AR in the three-spined stickleback. Furthermore, while the results show that the receptor has the highest binding affinity for DHT, it is preferentially activated by KT. While the present study represents the first identification of an AR preferentially regulated by KT, the elucidation of the KT signaling mechanism in teleosts clearly requires further research.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The ARE-luciferase (ARU-<italic>slp</italic>-Luc) reporter was a kind gift from Dr. Guy Verrijdt at the Division of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Campus Gasthuisberg, University of Leuven, Belgium.
