In oestrogen receptor alpha-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, relaxin was shown to down-regulate the metastasis-promoting protein S100A4 (metastasin), a highly significant prognostic factor for poor survival in breast cancer patients. The cellular mechanisms of relaxin exposure in breast cancer cells are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate short-term and long-term effects of relaxin on cancer cell motility and S100A4 expression and to determine the long-term effects of relaxin on <italic>in vivo </italic>tumour growth in an oestrogen-independent context.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>We have established stable transfectants of highly invasive oestrogen-receptor alpha-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells with constitutive expression of bioactive H2-relaxin (MDA/RLN2). RLN2 secretion was determined by ELISA. Relaxin receptor RXFP1 (Relaxin-family-peptide) was detected by reverse transcription (RT) PCR and its activation was assessed by induction of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Stable MDA/RLN2 clones and RLN2 treated MDA-MB-231 cells were subjected to motility and <italic>in vitro</italic>-invasion assays. Proliferation was assessed in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and MTT assays. S100A4 expression was determined by RT-PCR and Western blot. Specific small interfering RNA was employed to down-regulate relaxin receptor and S100A4. MDA/EGFP vector control and two MDA/RLN2 clones were injected subcutaneously in nude mice to determine tumour growth and cancer cell invasiveness <italic>in vivo</italic>. Xenograft tumour tissues were assessed by histology and immunohistochemistry and frozen tissues were used for the detection of S100A4 and RLN2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Short-term exposure to relaxin for 24 hours increased cell motility in a relaxin receptor-dependent manner. This increase in cell motility was mediated by S100A4. Long-term exposure to relaxin secreted from stable transfectants reduced cell motility and <italic>in vitro </italic>invasiveness. Relaxin decreased cell proliferation and down-regulated cellular S100A4 levels in MDA-MB-231 and T47D breast cancer cells. Stable MDA/RLN2 transfectants produced smaller xenograft tumours containing reduced S100A4 protein levels <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results indicate that long-term exposure to relaxin confers growth inhibitory and anti-invasive properties in oestrogen-independent tumours <italic>in vivo</italic>, which may in part be mediated through a down-regulation of S100A4.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The polypeptide hormone relaxin is increased in human breast carcinoma tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In all human breast tumours investigated, immunoreactive H2 relaxin (RLN2) was localised to the cytoplasm of neoplastic epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The expression of RLN1 and RLN2 genes in neoplastic breast tissues demonstrated the local production of relaxin in breast carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Relaxin was also shown to be increased in human carcinoma of the prostate gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and thyroid gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In addition, the breast is a physiological producer and target for relaxin and mammary epithelial cells, and myoepithelial cells in normal human breast tissue of prepubertal and all ages of adult women were shown to produce relaxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Apart from placental production during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], relaxin was not detectable in the plasma of cycling and lactating women suggesting local production and autocrine/paracrine actions of relaxin within the glandular breast tissue. The recently reported elevated relaxin serum levels in women with metastatic breast cancer suggest that relaxin may be a novel marker associated with breast cancer metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Relaxin binds predominantly to the 7-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor LGR7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], also known as the relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Activation of RXFP1 by relaxin caused elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies have linked relaxin expression with invasive behaviour of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. With treatment with porcine relaxin, SK-BR3 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells showed increased secretion of MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-7 causing increased migration through matrigel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Adenoviral-mediated expression of human prorelaxin in CF33.MT canine mammary carcinoma cells was described to enhance <italic>in vitro </italic>invasiveness through a laminin matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Whether these pro-migratory effects of relaxin were mediated by RXFP1 is unknown. Earlier studies have also reported that porcine relaxin reduces proliferation and induces differentiation in the oestrogen receptor-alpha (ER&#x003b1;)-positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7 <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Until now, these conflicting actions of relaxin in breast cancer cells have not been fully understood. Although <italic>in vivo </italic>studies in rat uterus have provided evidence for a crosstalk between RXFP1 and ER&#x003b1; and demonstrated ER&#x003b1;-mediated oestrogenic effects with relaxin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], a direct oestrogenic action of relaxin in breast cancer has not been described. Oestrogen-independent breast cancer usually shows a more aggressive clinical course and poorer treatment responses. Currently, little information is available on the role of relaxin in ER&#x003b1;-negative human breast cancer cells.</p><p>We have previously identified the EF-hand (helix-turn-helix structural domain) calcium-binding protein S100A4 (metastasin) as a relaxin target in oestrogen-independent, ER&#x003b1;-negative, highly invasive MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. S100A4 was linked to cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis in various human cancer types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and <italic>in vivo </italic>cancer models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Expression of the S100A4 protein is positively correlated with breast cancer invasiveness of rodent mammary carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and serves as an independent prognostic marker that is highly significant for poor survival in breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Both, extracellular and intracellular functions of S100A4 contribute to tissue invasiveness. The interaction with non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA has been extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and was associated with migratory behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Extracellular S100A4 was also shown to stimulate angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>ER&#x003b1;-negative human breast cancers carry a high risk of metastatic disease and have poor therapeutic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of long-term relaxin exposure &#x02013; mimicking the persistent exposure to relaxin produced by breast carcinoma cells within the cancer tissue &#x02013; on <italic>in vitro </italic>cell migration and <italic>in vivo </italic>tumour growth in an oestrogen-independent breast cancer cell model. We propose a novel causal relationship between relaxin expression, attenuated expression of S100A4 and reduced tumour growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and relaxin exposure</title><p>MDA-MB-231 and T47D human breast cancer cells were cultivated in HAM's F12 medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) substituted with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mmol L-glutamine (Gibco, Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada), 6 ng/ml insulin (Gibco; Invitrogen Corp, Burlington, ON, Canada), 3.75 ng/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma, Oakville, ON, Canada). Stable MDA-MB-231/pIRES-EGFP-RLN2 and MDA-MB-231/pIRES-EGFP vector control transfectants, referred to as MDA/RLN2 and MDA/EGFP, respectively, were cultured in the same medium supplemented with 800 &#x003bc;g/ml of the selective antibiotic Geneticin (Gibco; Invitrogen Corp, Burlington, ON, Canada). MCF7 cells were propagated in MEM with Earle's salts (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mmol L-glutamine, 1 nM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, Invitrogen Corp, Burlington, ON, Canada) and 0.8 &#x003bc;g/ml insulin (Gibco, Invitrogen). All cells were incubated in a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere at 37&#x000b0;C. The culture medium was changed every second day and cells were passaged every two to four days using accutase (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Linz, Austria). Cells were frozen in 10% DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) containing culture medium and stored in liquid nitrogen. Before treatment with 100 ng/ml and 500 ng/ml RLN2 (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Belmont, USA) in 1% FCS culture medium, cells were adjusted to 1% FCS-containing culture medium for 24 hours. For incubation periods longer than 24 hours, medium with fresh RLN2 at the same concentration was changed daily.</p></sec><sec><title>Stable MDA-MB-231-pIRES transfectants</title><p>The generation of stable transfectants MDA/RLN2 and MDA/EGFP was described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A pre-proRLN2 pIRES-EGFP construct was used and five MDA/RLN2 and two MDA/EGFP clones were employed for this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional analysis</title><p>Total RNA of the stable MDA/RLN2 and MDA/EGFP transfectants was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany) and the amount of total RNA was determined by spectrophotometry at 260 nm/280 nm (Ultrospec 3300 pro, Amersham, USA). Extraction of total RNA from nude mouse tumour tissues was performed with the Trizol reagent after homogenisation of the frozen tissue samples. Total RNA (1 &#x003bc;g each) was used for the preparation of first strand cDNA employing the superscript reverse transcriptase II (Gibco, Berlin, Germany) and 100 ng/&#x003bc;l of random primer 50 (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada). For the amplification of pre-proRLN2 and the partial coding sequence of human RXFP1 intron-spanning oligonucleotide primers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) were employed to preclude any genomic DNA amplification. For semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR analysis, the 18S amplification in each cDNA preparation served as a reference in determining relative cDNA levels per sample using the BIO 1D software (LTF, Wasserburg, Germany). The following conditions were used: 2 &#x003bc;l of cDNA, 2.5 &#x003bc;l of 10&#x000d7; Advantage2 polymerase mix buffer (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), 100 &#x003bc;M of dNTP, 10 pmol of each primer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and 2 U Taq DNA-polymerase (Life Technologies, Invitrogen, Canada) in a final volume of 25 &#x003bc;l. The amplification conditions were optimised for each gene and consisted of 35 PCR cycles for the respective target genes, with the exception of 18s mRNA detection which was performed for 10 cycles (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). PCR cycles consisted of an initial denaturation for three minutes at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by several cycles of denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), annealing temperature specific for each primer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), both for one minute each, an elongation step for two minutes at 72&#x000b0;C and a final extension cycle for 10 minutes at 72&#x000b0;C. Amplicons were separated on a 2% agarose gel. Kodak software (Kodak Digital Science 1D v.3.0.2.; Kodak, Toronto, ON, Canada) was used to perform semi-quantitative assessment of the specific PCR-products by densitometry using the 18S amplicons as cDNA-specific internal standard.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Oligonucleotide primers employed at melting temperatures (T<sub>M </sub>in &#x000b0;C) used to determine the expression of RLN2, human RXFP1 relaxin receptor (RXFP1), S100A4 and 18S transcripts in human breast cancer cell lines and xenograft tumours.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>Primer</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>size</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>primer sequence (5'-3')</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>T<sub>M</sub></bold></td><td align="center"><bold>cycles</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">S100A4</td><td align="center">289 bp</td><td align="left">sense &#x02013; gaa ggc cct gga tgt gat ggt g</td><td align="center">65&#x000b0;C</td><td align="center">35</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="left">antisense &#x02013; cat ttc ttc ctg ggc tgc tta tc</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center">RLN2</td><td align="center">485 bp</td><td align="left">sense &#x02013; tct gtt tac tac tga acc aat tt</td><td align="center">55&#x000b0;C</td><td align="center">35</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="left">antisense &#x02013; cat ggc aac att tat tag cca a</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center">RXFP1</td><td align="center">243 bp</td><td align="left">sense &#x02013; ccc aat tct cta tac tct gac cac aag</td><td align="center">65&#x000b0;C</td><td align="center">35</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="left">antisense &#x02013; tca tga ata gga att gag tct cgt tga tt</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center">18S</td><td align="center">344 bp</td><td align="left">sense &#x02013; gtt ggt gga gcg att tgt ctg g</td><td align="center">62&#x000b0;C</td><td align="center">10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="left">antisense &#x02013; agg gca ggg act taa tca acg c</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Relaxin ELISA</title><p>MDA/RLN2 and MDA/EGFP transfectants were seeded at 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml per well and incubated for 24 hours at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified carbon dioxide incubator.

The human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 does not express ER&#x003b1; and, thus, is a suitable model to study oestrogen receptor-independent effects of RLN2. MDA-MB-231 cells produced very low endogenous levels of RLN2. The relaxin receptor RXFP1 was expressed and functional as determined by the induction of intracellular cAMP on exposure to human recombinant RLN2. We employed MDA/RLN2 stable transfectants previously established in our laboratory and shown to produce the 18 kDa pro-RLN2. These stable MDA/RLN2 clones were shown here to secrete bioactive RLN2 and to retain the expression of RXFP1. Thus, MDA/RLN2 transfectants served as a cellular tool for the investigation of long-term relaxin exposure.</p><p>We show here that a 24 hour short-term exposure to rhRLN2 dose-dependently increased cell motility, as did conditioned media from MDA/RLN2 containing secreted RLN2. These data confirm previous findings by us and other authors who described relaxin as an enhancer of cancer cell motility/migration employing the human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and SKBr3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], human prostate cancer cells PC3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], human thyroid carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and human endometrial carcinoma cell lines HEC-1B and KLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Our results with siRNA knock-down of the relaxin receptor RXFP1 clearly demonstrated that the relaxin-induced increase in cell motility was RXFP1-dependent in MDA-MB-231 cells. The motility enhancing effect was paralleled by a small but significant reduction in cell proliferation demonstrating that relaxin did not act as mitogen in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Relaxin was previously described to lack a growth stimulatory effect on the human endometrial cancer cell lines HEC-1B and KLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], human MDA-MB-435 and canine CF33.MT breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Earlier <italic>in vitro </italic>studies found, that distinct relaxin concentrations and exposure times had a differentiation-promoting and growth-inhibitory effect of relaxin on MCF-7 cells after seven days of incubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>We employed stable MDA/RLN2 transfectants to investigate the long-term effects of constitutive exposure to relaxin, which is most likely to be equivalent to the situation in breast tumours. Surprisingly, MDA/RLN2 transfectants showed a markedly reduced motility when compared with the EGFP-vector controls. Indeed, long-term exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells to rhRLN2 for seven consecutive days before motility assays also abolished the relaxin-induced increase in motility. This decreased motility in MDA/RLN2 was not the result of a down-regulation of RXFP1. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed no reduction in RXFP1 transcripts in MDA/RLN2 transfectants and RXFP1 protein was detected by immunocytochemistry in MDA/RLN2 transfectants and MDA/EGFP vector controls. Interestingly, relaxin was previously shown to increase RXFP1 transcripts in a dose- and time-dependent manner in human decidual cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Earlier studies reported a relaxin-mediated enhanced cell migration and extracellular matrix invasiveness with several different cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our results demonstrated that long-term RLN2 exposure to relaxin negatively impacted on the invasive capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells as assessed by <italic>in vitro </italic>invasion assays using collagen A and laminin extracellular matrix components. We did not use the tumour matrix components of Matrigel to avoid the influence of numerous growth factors contained within this tumour matrix. The reduced invasive potential of MDA/RLN2 transfectants <italic>in vitro </italic>suggested that the reduction in cellular motility through down-regulation of S100A4 was the dominant mechanism of relaxin's long-term effect on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The small calcium-binding protein S100A4 was known to enhance cell motility by interacting with non-muscle myosin II and was described to selectively stimulate cell motility in mouse mammary carcinoma cell lines without increasing <italic>in vitro </italic>invasiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. We had previously reported that relaxin down-regulated S100A4 in MDA-MB-231 and in a stable MDA/RLN2 transfectant, thus, identifying S100A4 as a novel target gene for relaxin in breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Here, we confirmed and extended this finding employing additional MDA/RLN2 transfectants, all of which having almost undetectable levels of S100A4 protein. We were able to demonstrate a similar down-regulation of S100A4 protein in ER&#x003b1;-positive T47D human breast cancer cells after 48 hours and 72 hours of RLN2 exposure. We have shown in this study that S100A4 siRNA knock-down abolished the ability of exogenous rhRLN to up-regulate cell motility in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings demonstrated that the regulation of cell motility induced by relaxin was dependent on S100A4 and emphasise the importance of S100A4 as a relaxin target.</p><p>This down-regulation of the metastasis-promoting protein S100A4 is of high clinical importance. S100A4, also named metastasin, is a known promoter of tumour invasiveness and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and was demonstrated to increase invasiveness in mouse mammary carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and in a transgenic mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The expression of S100A4 in breast tumour tissues serves a prognostic marker for poor patient survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. When injected subcutaneously in nude mice, all xenograft tumours derived from MDA/RLN2 transfectants contained reduced or almost undetectable levels of S100A4 protein when compared with the MDA/EGFP tumour tissues. This demonstrated for the first time that S100A4 is a relaxin target molecule <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>in human breast cancer cells. However, we were unable to detect a negative regulation of metastasis because all of the xenografts, including those of MDA/EGFP, failed to show macroscopic metastases. The 60 day time interval for this investigation was most likely to be too short for metastatic lesions to develop. The markedly reduced tumour size in MDA/RLN2 xenografts may have been a result of the reduced S100A4 production within the tumour cells.</p><p>Extracellular S100A4 was described to function as an angiogenic factor as observed in S100A4 transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and <italic>in vitro </italic>when tested on human cerebro-microvascular endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Although MDA/EGFP and MDA/RLN2 xenografts showed large areas of necrotic tissue, on observation of haematoxylin and eosin-stained tumour sections there was some indication that there might be fewer blood vessels in MDA/RLN2 tumours. The reduced tumour size of MDA/RLN2 xenografts is potentially a combined result of the observed reduction in cell proliferation and the lack of an angiogenic stimulus by S100A4 secreted from the tumour cells. S100A4 was shown to bind to the tumour suppressor protein p53 and to co-operate with wild type p53 in apoptosis induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. TUNEL assays performed on the xenograft sections failed to detect apoptotic nuclei in our MDA/RLN2 xenograft model with reduced tumour growth. Instead, relaxin may directly stimulate cell differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have detected an increased number of cells with positive staining for smooth muscle actin suggesting the presence of myoepithelial cells in MDA/RLN2 tumours. In addition, the collagen distribution in MDA/RLN2 tumours as determined by picrosirious red staining showed collagen to be more regularly distributed among strands of tumour cells in MDA/RLN2 tumours when compared with MDA/EGFP tumours. This may suggest a higher epithelial differentiation and organisation in the MDA/RLN2 tumours. Earlier studies showed that human MCF-7 breast cancer cell xenografts in oestrogen-treated nude mice revealed an increased differentiation response to systemic application of relaxin with the formation of differentiated epithelial- and myoepithelial-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that long-term exposure to relaxin may trigger differentiation-promoting and anti-invasive changes in breast cancer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>down-regulation of S100A4 identifies a new and potentially clinically relevant property of relaxin in human breast cancer. Further studies are ongoing to identify the signalling pathways involved in the relaxin-induced regulation of S100A4.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BrdU = bromodeoxyuridine; cAMP = cyclic adenosine monophosphate; ER&#x003b1; = oestrogen receptor-alpha; FCS = fetal calf serum; IBMX = 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine; PBS = phosphate buffered saline; rhRLN = recombinant human RLN; RLN2 = H2 relaxin; RT-PCR = reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; RXFP1 = relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 1 (formerly: LGR7 = leucin-rich G protein-coupled receptor 7); siRNA = small interfering RNA; TUNEL = dUTP nick end labelling.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Y.R. performed the majority of the experiments and analysed the data.
