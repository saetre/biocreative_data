The process to reverse EMT is not well established. Our purpose is to define signaling pathways and transcription factors that maintain the TGF-&#x003b2;-induced mesenchymal state.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Inhibitors of five kinases implicated in EMT, TGF-&#x003b2; Type I receptor kinase (T&#x003b2;RI), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), MAP kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase activator kinase (MEK1), c-Jun NH-terminal kinase (JNK), and Rho kinase (ROCK), were evaluated for reversal of the mesenchymal state induced in renal tubular epithelial cells. Single agents did not fully reverse EMT as determined by cellular morphology and gene expression. However, exposure to the T&#x003b2;RI inhibitor SB431542, combined with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632, eliminated detectable actin stress fibers and mesenchymal gene expression while restoring epithelial E-cadherin and Kidney-specific cadherin (Ksp-cadherin) expression. A second combination, the T&#x003b2;RI inhibitor SB431542 together with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, was partially effective in reversing EMT. Furthermore, JNK inhibitor SP600125 inhibits the effectiveness of the T&#x003b2;RI inhibitor SB431542 to reverse EMT. To explore the molecular basis underlying EMT reversal, we also targeted the transcriptional repressors ZEB1 and ZEB2/SIP1. Decreasing ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression in mouse mammary gland cells with shRNAs was sufficient to up-regulate expression of epithelial proteins such as E-cadherin and to re-establish epithelial features. However, complete restoration of cortical F-actin required incubation with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 in combination with ZEB1/2 knockdown.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We demonstrate that reversal of EMT requires re-establishing both epithelial transcription and structural components by sustained and independent signaling through T&#x003b2;RI and ROCK.

During EMT, cells diminish epithelial gene expression and acquire mesenchymal gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Cortical actins, the actin filament bundles below the plasma membrane, reorganize or are lost, while stress fibers comprising F-actin are gained. In normal development, EMT has been associated with processes in gastrulation, heart formation, palate formation, and Mullerian tract regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In disease states, EMT has been exploited in both cancer and organ fibrosis. The mortality in human cancers is caused by primary tumor cells that have undergone oncogenic EMT and metastasized to other organs. Other diseases, such as end-state organ failure by fibrosis, are caused by repeated and sustained infliction of EMT. Thus, understanding the cellular mechanisms to reverse EMT is of great importance.</p><p>The TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway is considered a good target for EMT reversal because it is a key mediator of fibrosis and facilitator of metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; induces EMT by both Smad-dependent and -independent signaling events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2;1 ligand exerts its signaling effects by activating a heteromeric receptor of two transmembrane serine/threonine kinases, type I and type II receptors (T&#x003b2;RI and T&#x003b2;RII) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. T&#x003b2;RII transphosphorylates T&#x003b2;RI, activating its kinase function. Activated T&#x003b2;RI then phosphorylates the intracellular proteins Smad2 and Smad3. The phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 associate with Smad4, with the activated complex translocating to the nucleus where it interacts with other transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors to regulate expression of numerous genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This Smad-dependent signaling up-regulates expression of several transcription factors important for EMT induction, including Snail, Slug, Twist, and members of the ZFH family, ZEB1 (also called EF1, TCF8, AREB6, ZFHEP, NIL-2A, ZFHX1A, and BZP) and ZEB2 (also called SIP1, SMADIP1, ZFHX1B, and KIAA0569) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Of particular importance are ZEB1 and ZEB2 because they are crucial regulators of EMT during embryonic development and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These transcription factors activate EMT by binding to E-box elements present in the E-cadherin promoter, suppressing synthesis of this cell-cell adhesion protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. ZEB1 also promotes EMT by repressing expression of basement membrane components and cell polarity proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. ZEB2 has also been implicated in the induction of EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The loss of E-cadherin and other epithelial structural components is a major event during EMT. Mutations in the <italic>TCF8 </italic>gene (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_030751">NM 030751</ext-link>) result in a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) in mouse embryos by reprogramming gene expression, leading to developmental defects by diminishing progenitor cell proliferation and cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus, it is crucial to understand the role of ZEB1 and ZEB2 in the reversal of TGF-&#x003b2;-induced EMT.</p><p>Multiple signaling proteins in addition to Smads have been implicated in the induction of EMT by TGF-&#x003b2;1. These include Ras/MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], integrin &#x003b2;-1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], integrin-linked kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], RhoA Kinase (ROCK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], Jagged1/Notch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], SARA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], Par6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and ERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, much less is known about how these signaling pathways and transcription factors maintain the mesenchymal program. Studies examining the reversal of EMT by perturbing one component of a signaling pathway with inhibitors or shRNAs demonstrate partial reversal of the mesenchymal state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Here, we report full reversal of EMT morphology and patterns of gene expression by concurrently inhibiting T&#x003b2;RI kinase and ROCK. We show that inhibition of T&#x003b2;RI kinase blocks mesenchymal gene expression, an effect mediated by down-regulation of ZEB1 and ZEB2 levels, while the ROCK inhibitor stabilizes the epithelial structure. These findings demonstrate that combined use of T&#x003b2;RI kinase and ROCK inhibitors is important to decrease TGF-&#x003b2; signaling to enable full reversal of EMT.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>TGF-&#x003b2;1 induces EMT in mTEC-KO cells</title><p>We used primary mouse tubular epithelial cells isolated from the renal cortex of TGF-&#x003b2;1 knockout mice (mTEC-KO cells) to model EMT in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The mTEC-KO cells exhibit greater epithelial features than do wild-type renal epithelial cells. Renal tubular epithelial cells were chosen because of the correlation between the extent of tubulointerstitial fibrosis and the prognosis for end-stage renal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the absence of TGF-&#x003b2;1, mTEC-KO cells form an epithelial sheet; incubation with 100 pM TGF-&#x003b2;1 for 72 hours induced the mTEC-KO cells to acquire a more fibroblast-like, spindle shaped morphology indicative of mesenchymal cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Incubation with the T&#x003b2;RI inhibitor SB431542 blocked the TGF-&#x003b2;1-induced transition of the mTEC-KO epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells. The morphological transformation correlated with major changes in the actin cytoskeleton as revealed by phalloidin staining. Untreated epithelial cells exhibited a cortical actin staining below the cell membranes, whereas the TGF-&#x003b2;1-treated cells displayed elongated F-actin stress fibers. In the cells treated with the T&#x003b2;RI inhibitor SB431542, short, non-cortical actin fibers were detected.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>TGF-&#x003b2;1 induces EMT in renal tubular epithelial cells</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Phase contrast (left) and Phalloidin staining (right) of mTEC-KO cells incubated for 72 hours as indicated without TGF-&#x003b2;1, with 100 pM TGF-&#x003b2;1, or with TGF-&#x003b2;1 and 10 &#x003bc;M SB431542.

Thus, we also examined the expression levels of several genes regulated by TGF-&#x003b2;1 as markers for the epithelial and mesenchymal states. In mTEC-KO cells, incubation with TGF-&#x003b2;1 led to a significant decrease in expression of the epithelial protein E-cadherin and increase in expression of the mesenchymal protein &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;-SMA) by 72 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><p>Because TGF-&#x003b2;1 is known to regulate expression of multiple cadherins, we also examined expression of Kidney-specific cadherin (Ksp-cadherin).

Incubation with TGF-&#x003b2;1 led to a significant reduction in the level of Ksp-cadherin RNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), while it led to significant increases in the RNA levels of mesenchymal markers matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) and smooth muscle protein 22 (transgelin) (SM22) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).

The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 did not reduce either the SM22 or MMP-9 expression level, indicating that presence of this p38 MAPK inhibitor failed to reverse expression of these genes associated with the mesenchymal state. The ROCK inhibitor Y27632 partially reduced SM22 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), but increased MMP-9 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). This increase in MMP-9 expression was prevented by treatment with T&#x003b2;RI inhibitor SB431542 combined with ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the T&#x003b2;RI inhibitor SB431542 by itself is sufficient to induce the accumulation of some transcripts specific to epithelial cells; however, the combination of T&#x003b2;RI and ROCK inhibitors can effectively induce the accumulation of certain additional epithelial-specific transcripts such as Ksp-cadherin that correlate with the full reversal of EMT.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Restoration of epithelial gene expression patterns requires a combination of kinase inhibitors</bold>. mTEC-KO cells were incubated with 100 pM TGF-&#x003b2;1 for 72 hours to induce EMT.

A p38 MAPK inhibitor also plays a role by working in conjunction with the T&#x003b2;RI kinase inhibitor to further lessen the mesenchymal structural elements to reverse EMT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). We defined the success of an agent in reversing EMT as the re-expression of key epithelial proteins (<italic>e.g</italic>., E-cadherin, cortical actin) and the re-positioning of these proteins to allow for epithelial cell morphology. We also demonstrated that reversal of EMT by the T&#x003b2;RI inhibitor SB431542 involves, in part, inhibiting expression of ZEB1, a key transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin expression and the epithelial state (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

We hypothesize that re-acquisition of the epithelial cytoskeleton might sequester the mesenchymal signaling associated with the unformed cell-cell adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].

When T&#x003b2;RII is activated, Par6 is phosphorylated and recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 to the cell membrane, thereby regulating the localization of Rho by ubiquitination. This implies that the location of Rho is important for the arrangement of actin in epithelial cells.

In certain cancers, treatment with a T&#x003b2;RI inhibitor shows promise in halting metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. Therapeutics in the form of growth factors such as BMP-7 can also act as TGF-&#x003b2; antagonists to treat fibrotic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. Other approaches to block TGF-&#x003b2; activity, such as anti-sense DNA targeting TGF-&#x003b2;, are in clinical trials as a vaccine against tumor cells or as therapeutics for treating patients with high-grade gliomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. In addition, ROCK and p38 MAPK inhibitors are in clinical trials as potential therapeutics targeting a variety of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>]. These recent developments suggest multiple therapeutic strategies may be possible for treating patients with diseases in which TGF-&#x003b2;-induced EMT contributes to the pathology.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We showed here that reversing EMT in mTEC-KO cells requires inhibition of both T&#x003b2;RI kinase and ROCK. The T&#x003b2;RI kinase inhibitor decreased expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2, thereby increasing expression of the epithelial protein E-cadherin, and the ROCK inhibitor was necessary to fully eliminate mesenchymal actin stress fibers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells and Reagents</title><p>Early passage (passage 2) TGF-&#x003b2;1 knockout murine renal tubular epithelial cells (mTEC-KO) and early passage (passage 5) murine renal tubular epithelial cells (mTEC-WT) were generously provided to us by Dr. Jeffrey Kopp (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Bethesda, MD). The cells were grown until passage 20. They were maintained in Renal Epithelial Cell Growth Medium (Cambrex, MD) supplemented with 0.25% fetal bovine serum (FBS), a Bullet Kit that contained epidermal growth factor, insulin, hydrocortisone, GA-1000, epinephrine, T<sub>3</sub>, and transferrin (Cambrex, NJ), and penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco-Invitrogen, CA). Namru murine mammary gland (NMuMG) cells were obtained from Dr. Caroline Alexander (UW-Madison, WI). They were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml insulin, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml penicillin, and 100 U/ml streptomycin. 293T cells were purchased from ATCC (VA). They were grown in 10% DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml penicillin, and 100 U/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained in a 37&#x000b0;C humidified 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator. Carrier-free TGF-&#x003b2;1 was obtained from R&#x00026;D Systems (MN). Chemical inhibitors SB203580, SP600125, and Y27632 (Calbiochem, CA); SB431542 (Sigma, MO); and U0126 (Promega, WI) were aliquoted after reconstitution and frozen at -80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Production of Lentiviruses</title><p>The lentiviral shRNAmir vectors targeting ZEB1 (target set NM_011546), ZEB2 (target set NM_014795), and control pLKO.1 (RHS4080) were purchased from OpenBiosystems (Thermo Scientific, AL). Plasmid pLKO.1 contains a scrambled sequence that results in synthesis of a shRNA that does not appear to inhibit expression of any known cellular gene. To generate virus, mycoplasma-free 293T cells were transfected using LT1 (Mirus, WI) with 10 &#x003bc;g total of a mixture containing shRNAmir ZEB1 and ZEB2 or pLKO.1 as indicated, 3 &#x003bc;g lentiviral DNA encoding Gag/Pol, and 1 &#x003bc;g VSVG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>] (provided by Dr. Bill Sugden, Madison, WI). The medium was supplemented with 50 mM HEPES solution, pH 7.3 (Invitrogen) and changed after 6 hours. Viral supernatant was collected after 24 hours and passed through a 0.45 &#x003bc;m filter. NMuMG cells were infected daily with the pool of shZEB1 and shZEB2 viruses over 48 - 72 hours to decrease ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>After treatment as indicated, cells were washed with cold PBS, lyzed in TNE buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% NP40, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA] and pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Lysates were prepared using TNE buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, NJ) and protease inhibitor cocktail solution III (Calbiochem, CA). Cell homogenates were incubated for 10 min at 100&#x000b0;C in 2&#x000d7; loading buffer. Equal amounts of protein, as assessed by BCA Protein Assay Kit (BioRad, CA), were added to each well. The proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 4% - 20% gradient polyacrylamide gels (ISC BioExpress, UT) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, MA) or nitrocellulose filters (ISC Biosystem, UT). The primary antibodies used for detection were as follows: E-cadherin (BD Biosciences, CA), ZEB1 (H102, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA), ZEB2 (Dr. Michel Sanders, University of Minnesota, MN; purified by Dr. Xianming Yu, UW-Madison, WI), and &#x003b1;-Smooth Muscle Actin (Sigma). Anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Millipore) was used as the secondary antibody. Blots were developed by ECL (GE Healthcare, NJ). Where indicated, the immunoblots were stripped by incubation with 100 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mM TRIS (pH 8.2) at 65&#x000b0;C for 1 hour and reprobed with &#x003b2;-actin (Sigma) or &#x003b2;-tubulin (Sigma) primary antibody as indicated and HRP secondary antibody (GE Healthcare). Relative protein levels were determined by densitometry using Bio-Rad Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad), with normalization to the amount of cellular &#x003b2;-actin or &#x003b2;-tubulin present in each sample. Changes in the amount of a protein present in an experimental sample are shown relative to the amount of this protein present in the untreated control sample processed in parallel.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>After treatment as indicated, total RNA was isolated from the cells using RNAeasy Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and quantified by UV spectrophotometer. 1.5 &#x003bc;g of RNA from each sample was converted by reverse transcriptase into cDNA using an OmniScript kit (Qiagen). Primers used for qRT-PCR were as follows: mouse Ksp-cadherin: forward-5'-CTGCACACAGAAGTCCCTGA-3', reverse 5'-CCTTGTCGCCACTAGAAAGC-3'; mouse MMP-9: SuperArray primer (MD) PPM03661A; mouse SM22: forward 5'-GCAGTCCAAAATTGAGAAGA-3', reverse 5'-CTGTTGCTGCCCATTTGAAG3'; mouse PAI-1: forward 5'-TTCAGCCCTTGCTTGCCTC-3', reverse 5'-ACACTTTTACTCCGAAGTCGGT-3'; ZEB1: forward 5'-AACGGAGATTTGTCTCCCAGT-3', reverse 5'-CTGTCCAGCTTGCATCTTTTC-3'; ZEB2: forward 5'-TAGCCGGTCCAGAAGAAATG-3', reverse 5'-GGCCATCTCTTTCCTCCAGT-3'[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; mouse GAPDH: forward 5<sup>'</sup>-AGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG-3<sup>'</sup>, reverse 5<sup>'</sup>-TGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCA-3<sup>'</sup>; and P0: forward, 5'-GACAATGGCAGCATCTACAAC-3', reverse, 5'-GCAGACAGACACTGGCAAC-3' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>]. cDNA was amplified in an Opticon 2 PCR machine (MJ Research) and labelled using an ABI SYBR Green qPCR Kit (ABI Systems, CA). The amplifications were carried out in the following manner: initial denaturation for 10 min at 95C, denaturation for 10 sec at 95&#x000b0;C, annealing for 30 sec at an optimal temperature for each cDNA, and extension for 30 sec at 72&#x000b0;C. Standards were created from Pfu (Stratagene, CA)-amplified PCR products purified by gel electrophoresis. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control to normalize gene expression levels, except for ZEB1 and ZEB2 where the ribosomal protein P0 was used, instead. Relative ZEB1 and ZEB2 RNA levels were calculated by a modified Ct method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Cells were seeded on glass cover slips (Fisher, PA) or 8-well chamber slides (Fisher) and cultured as described. Afterward, the cells were fixed by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Non-specific binding was blocked with 10% BSA or normal goat serum for 30 min. F-actin was stained at a 1:1000 dilution in 2% BSA of Texas Red-conjugated or FITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) for at least 30 min. E-cadherin (BD Biosciences) was diluted 1:50 in 2% normal goat serum and incubated overnight. A secondary antibody made in goat (Invitrogen) was used at a 1:1000 dilution and incubated for 2 hours in a humid chamber with minimal exposure to light. All washes were done in 1&#x000d7; PBS. An anti-fade solution containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, CA) was used in mounting the slides. Images were taken at room temperature with an Axiocam digital camera attached to a Zeiss microscope. Axiovision was used to acquire the image. Adobe Photoshop was used to merge images.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Unless indicated otherwise, all experiments were performed on three separate occasions, each time with triplicates, with the figures showing means of the triplicates for one of the experiments (n = 3).
