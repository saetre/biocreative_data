However, islet isolation and transplantation-induced oxidative stress and autoimmune-mediated destruction are still the major obstacles to the long-term survival of graft islets in this potential therapy. To protect islet grafts from inflammatory damage and prolong their survival, we transduced islets with an antioxidative gene <italic>thioredoxin (TRX) </italic>using a lentiviral vector before transplantation.

Islet transplantation can provide near perfect, moment-by-moment control of the homeostasis of blood glucose concentration and is much more effective than insulin injection, which cannot prevent nephropathy, retinopathy, vascular, and heart disease. However, inflammation, allorejection, and recurrent autoimmune damage can contribute to early graft loss and are major obstacles to successful islet transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The process of islet isolation also triggers a cascade of stressful events in the islets involving the induction of apoptosis or necrosis and production of proinflammatory molecules that negatively influence islet viability and function. Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; produced by islet-resident macrophages are toxic to islets and can induce ROS formation in islet cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Inflammatory cytokines and free oxygen radicals released in situ can cause apoptosis and loss of islets after implantation, and eventually graft failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that by using different strategies to protect islet from those detrimental immune response result in greatly improving graft function and prolonging graft survival. These strategies include modulating immune response by CTLA-4-Ig or TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], inflammatory blockade by chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], overexpressing antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and reducing oxidative stress by overexpression of antioxidative genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, different animal models used made it difficult to compare with each work.</p><p>Because islets produce very low antioxidative enzymes and are very sensitive to oxidative stress, clearance of ROS is crucial in the viability of islet graft. The concept of antioxidative treatment in islets has been proven in many models, including the transgenic mouse model with specific expression of antioxidative genes in islets or islet grafts transduced by viral vector carrying those genes. Transgenic expression of antioxidant genes in islets, such as glutathione peroxidase, different isoforms of superoxide dismutase, metallothionein, or catalase, significantly increases the islet viability and reduces ROS formation after challenge with free radical donor or hypoxia exposure <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The role of ROS scavengers in islet transplantation has also been investigated in these transgenic mouse models using syngeneic or allogeneic islet transplantation. However, only islets from metallothionein transgenic mice showed prolonged islet graft survival in an allogeneic transplantation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In summary, most results regarding that overexpression of antioxidative genes in islets protects them from oxidative injury were obtained from in vitro experiments, the <italic>in vivo </italic>function and survival of these genetically-modified islets in diabetic recipients was not clear.</p><p>Thioredoxin (TRX) is a small, ubiquitously expressed protein in the cell. TRX has many biological functions including the regulation of the cellular reduction-oxidation balance, promotion of cell growth, inhibition of apoptosis, and regulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated that administration of recombinant TRX protein reduces brain damage induced by focal cerebral ischemia in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In other studies, transgenic overexpression of TRX by the &#x003b2;-actin promoter protected from the disease or reduced the disease severity in different disease models such as acute hepatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and ischemic brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] which are caused mainly by oxidative stress, indicating that TRX has strong cytoprotective properties. TRX with antioxidative and antiapoptotic functions has been demonstrated to prevent &#x003b2; cells from autoimmune destruction in a &#x003b2; cell-specific TRX transgenic NOD model, strongly suggesting that oxidative stress plays an essential role in the destruction of &#x003b2; cells by infiltrating inflammatory cells in pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These results suggested that TRX is a better candidate gene than other antioxidative genes which may have therapeutic application in prevention of islet grafts from inflammatory insults. To improve islet grafts viability and maintain euglycemia after islet transplantation in autoimmune diabetes, we used a lentiviral vector delivery system to carry the <italic>TRX </italic>gene into islets before transplantation. In the present study, islet cells overexpressing TRX were more resistant to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced cell toxicity and had prolonged islet survival after transplant into diabetic recipients. Our results show that controlling the inflammation-mediated and ROS-mediated islet graft damage is critical for successful islet transplantation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>NOD/Sytwu (K<sup>d</sup>, D<sup>b</sup>, L<sup>d</sup>, I-A<sup>g7</sup>) mice were purchased originally from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and were subsequently bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Animal Center of the National Defense Medical Center (Taipei, Taiwan), which was accredited by AAALAC.

Considering the advantages of the antioxidative and antiapoptotic functions of TRX, we hypothesized that overexpression of this gene would protect islets from the stress induced by the transplantation procedure and subsequent autoimmune attack. Freshly isolated islets were transduced with Lt-TRX or Lt-eGFP and cultured for 1 day. Around 700 marginal islets were transplanted under the left kidney capsule of newly diabetic female NOD mice. Islet grafts with TRX transduction showed better glycemic control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>) and prolonged islet graft survival in diabetic recipients (mean graft survival days, 18 vs. 6.5, n = 9 and 10, respectively, p &#x0003c; 0.05) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). We also performed nephrectomy of the left kidney implanted with grafted islets to confirm further the glucose-regulatory function of the Lt-TRX-transduced islet grafts. The NOD recipients with normal glycemia became hyperglycemic after the islet-implanted kidney was removed, indicating that the islet grafts were still functional and maintained the normal glycemia in transplanted recipients (data not shown). Histological analysis of the graft-bearing kidneys revealed that although Lt-TRX-transduced islets showed much less leukocytic infiltration than the Lt-eGFP-transduced islets, they were not completely free from lymphocyte infiltration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Immunohistochemical staining showed that Lt-TRX transduced islet grafts were insulin-producing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>) and TRX-expressing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>), suggesting that these islets with transgene expression were still functional. Since heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mediates a strong cytoprotection in cells under a variety of stresses, the induction of HO-1 in TRX-transduced islets may have a synergistic effect with TRX to protect them from apoptosis and improve islet survival and function after transplantation. Results from immunohistochemical staining revealed that the distribution of HO-1-expressing cells was quite close to that of the TRX-expressing cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5e</xref>), consistent with the previous reports that TRX facilitates the induction of HO-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

To investigate the protective mechanisms mediated by TRX in islet grafts, we further analyzed the expression of genes such as c-fos, c-jun, and HO-1 that were regulated by TRX. We also analyzed AP-1 activity in &#x003b2; cell-derived NIT-1 cells after Lt-TRX virus transduction. Quantitative PCR analysis reveals that expression of HO-1 and c-fos was up-regulated after Lt-TRX transduction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Cellular responses to TRX overexpressing</bold>.

These results are consistent with previous reports that TRX regulates cellular redox status and promotes cell survival through inducing cell protective genes expression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Clinical trials of islet transplantation are showing remarkable success since the Edmonton protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] was developed, and this glucocorticoid-free immunosuppressive protocol was replicated successfully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, inadequate islet donors and recurrent autoimmunity are major obstacles in the treatment of type I diabetes. The transplantation procedure such as collagenase-based islet isolation triggers proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production by islets, which contributes to early graft loss or primary loss of function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In this study, we overexpressed TRX in islet grafts to determine whether this would protect them from oxidative stress-induced cell damage. We found that TRX did not alter the glucose-induced insulin-secreting function of the islets but protected them from ROS challenge. In the islet transplantation experiment, TRX-overexpressed islets showed better glycemic control and longer graft survival, indicating that TRX has a strong cytoprotective effect on islets.</p><p>Many approaches have been shown to have protective effects in islets, including the regulation of the immune response by overexpressing anti-inflammatory cytokines or cytokine inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]; and by reducing cellular stress by overexpression of antiapoptotic and antioxidative genes in islets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These approaches might protect islets from apoptosis or promote islet function <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>in vivo</italic>, although the choice of target genes and the methods to overexpress the target genes can affect the results significantly. In general, therapeutic targets that have a paracrine action have a more marked biological effect than do genes that target intracellular molecules. In addition, the selected vectors for carrying the target genes to the islets should have low immunogenicity, and long-term and stable gene expression in islets is required. In this work, we used a lentivirus to carry the TRX gene into the islets, which do not divide or have a low rate of division. This approach has some advantages. First, lentivirus can infect both dividing and nondividing or quiescent cells efficiently and provide for the stable integration into the host cell genome. Second, this method does not elicit an immune response <italic>in vivo</italic>. Third, TRX is a strong ROS scavenger in the cytoplasm and can clear H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>directly and repair the oxidized proteins.</p><p>TRX also regulates the expression or activity of other proteins. In some circumstances, TRX translocates to the nucleus to regulate transcription factor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] or can be secreted and act as a growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Under stimulation by inflammatory mediators, TRX regulates AP-1 activity and enhances heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The AP-1 activity was around 3-fold increase in Lt-TRX-transduced cells than in Lt-GFP-transduced cells, suggesting that TRX could regulate gene transcription through the up-regulation of AP-1 activity in our model. HO-1 expression was observed in Lt-TRX-transduced islets and induction of HO-1 in islet grafts have been demonstrated to protect them from apoptosis and improve their function after transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus, TRX and HO-1 may play coordinated roles in protecting cells from inflammatory stress. The reduced form of TRX also binds to a variety of cellular proteins. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is one TRX-binding protein that mediates stress- and cytokine-mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. TRX binds to the N-terminus of ASK1, and activation of ASK1 requires dissociation of the TRX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Taken together, the antioxidative and antiapoptotic functions of TRX may contribute to protecting islets from inflammation-induced cell injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>It is unlikely that any single biological agent will be sufficient to stop such complicated autoimmune processes such as cytokine imbalance, free radical formation, and cellular apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Using newly diabetic NOD mice that had developed strong autoimmunity to pancreatic islets as the recipients, we showed that TRX can prolong graft survival significantly. This effect may reflect the multiple biological functions of TRX, which has both antioxidative and antiapoptotic activities. These are important functions for preventing islets from immune attack, and this idea has been demonstrated in the transgenic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, despite its beneficial effects, TRX could not inhibit the leukocytic infiltration into the islet grafts completely, and future studies using combinations of immunoregulatory genes may help prolong graft survival and maintain long-term glucose homeostasis in diabetic recipients.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FCC ried out the molecular genetic studies, participated in the sequence alignment and drafted the manuscript, participated in the design of the study and performed the statistical analysis, conceived of the study, and participated in its design and coordination and helped to draft the manuscript.
