Its specificity therefore influences the repertoire of peptides presented by MHC molecules. Compared to human TAP, murine TAP's binding specificity has not been characterized as well, even though murine systems are widely used for basic studies of antigen processing and presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We performed a detailed experimental analysis of murine TAP binding specificity by measuring the binding affinities of 323 peptides. Based on this experimental data, a computational model of murine TAP specificity was constructed. The model was compared to previously generated data on human and murine TAP specificities. In addition, the murine TAP specificities for known epitopes and random peptides were predicted and compared to assess the impact of murine TAP selectivity on epitope selection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Comparisons to a previously constructed model of human TAP specificity confirms the well-established differences for peptide substrates with positively charged C-termini. In addition these comparisons show that several residues at the N-terminus of peptides which strongly influence binding to human TAP showed little effect on binding to murine TAP, and that the overall influence of the aminoterminal residues on peptide affinity for murine TAP is much lower than for the human transporter. Murine TAP also partly prefers different hydrophobic amino acids than human TAP in the carboxyterminal position. These species-dependent differences in specificity determined <italic>in vitro</italic> are shown to correlate with the epitope repertoire recognized <italic>in vivo</italic>. The quantitative model of binding specificity of murine TAP developed herein should be useful for interpreting epitope mapping and immunogenicity data obtained in humanized mouse models.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T lymphocytes monitor cells for non-self protein expression by scanning their surface for MHC class I molecules presenting peptides derived from proteins expressed inside the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Shastri1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

The importance of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> immune responses for human health has motivated many <italic>in vivo</italic> studies aiming to identify the peptide targets of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> responses. As studies with human patients are often not ethically feasible and samples can be hard to obtain, many epitope discovery studies have been conducted in humanized mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Sette1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Pascolo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore important to understand differences between murine and human antigen processing machinery that may affect the identity and immunodominance of HLA class I-restricted peptide epitopes.</p><p>The majority of peptides recognized by CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are generated through the endogenous MHC-I antigen processing and presentation pathway. Initially proteins in the cytosol are cleaved into peptide fragments by proteasomes, possibly in concert with TPPII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Seifert1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Reits1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, and by other proteases. The produced peptides are subject to rapid degradation by cytosolic aminopeptidases, and only approximately 1&#x00025; of the peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Princiotta1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Fruci1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> escape degradation through transport into the ER by the TAP transporters that prefer peptides with a length of 8 to 16 residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Momburg1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-vanEndert1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Inside the ER, peptides are subject to further N-terminal trimming by ERAP1, which efficiently cleaves substrates between 8 and 16 residues in length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Chang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In humans, an additional ER aminopeptidase, ERAP2, with a preference for basic residues, complements ERAP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Saveanu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, peptides with suitable length and sequence are able to bind empty MHC class I molecules with the help of multiple chaperones forming the MHC class I loading complex. The peptide:MHC complex is then transported to the cell surface through the Golgi apparatus. Sequence specificities at each step in this antigen processing pathway influence what peptides are eventually presented to T cells.</p><p>The focus of the present study is the murine TAP transporter, a heterodimeric complex consisting of the TAP1 and TAP2 proteins, both of which are members of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Higgins1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Peptide transport by TAP is a sequential process initiated by peptide binding to a site probably located at the interface between the cytosol and the transmembrane channel of TAP, followed by ATP dependent transport of the peptide into the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-vanEndert2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Two assays measuring peptide affinity for TAP are available.

This assay has the advantage of measuring the complete peptide transport process, but may also be affected by the rate of peptide degradation in the cytosol either before transport into the ER, or after retrograde transport out of the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Momburg1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Koopmann1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Roelse1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. While cytosolic peptide degradation is generally extremely rapid, some peptides, for example those with multiple basic residues in the aminoterminal positions, have been found to be more resistant to degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Reits1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Herberts1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

While it was theoretically conceivable that some peptides bind TAP but are not transported, which would have rendered the latter assay unreliable, it has been found that addition of very long side chains is required to produce peptides that bind TAP without being transported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Gromme1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

Additional studies of the influence of the aminoterminal and internal peptide sequence, carried out using the peptide transport assay, concluded that these positions have little effect on TAP affinity, with the exception of Pro residues in several positions which decreased transport efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Momburg2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Neefjes2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. However, detailed studies of human TAP specificity using the peptide-binding assay elucidated a significant influence of the three N-terminal peptide residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-vanEndert3">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Peters1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Daniel1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Uebel1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. The same preferences are found in peptides of different lengths for the first three N-terminal and the C-terminal positions. This makes it likely that peptide binding to TAP involves two contact sites at the free peptide ends, with each having a defined binding preference, while the connecting residues can form loops of variable lengths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Daniel1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. This model would also explain why there is a minimal peptide length required for efficient transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Momburg1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-vanEndert1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In summary, while past studies with model substrates have demonstrated differences between murine and human TAP specificity, subsequent large-scale studies that allow for the development of general quantitative prediction models have focused on human TAP alone. In this study, we have therefore characterized the binding specificity of murine TAP with a large panel of peptides, allowing for a detailed comparison between the transport preferences in the two species. We have further utilized this data to build a predictive model of TAP transport for peptides of any length, which can be applied to identify likely epitopes or their precursors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Establishing the murine TAP binding assay</title><p>We previously established an assay measuring competition for binding to human TAP complexes, over-expressed in insect cells, between a radio-labeled reporter peptide and unlabeled test peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-vanEndert1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

A prediction was generated using only peptides from the training set, and used to predict the affinity of all peptides in the blind set.

The most drastic difference between matrix scores was observed for Lysine (K) and Arginine (R) at the C-terminus. This corresponds to the previously described finding that only human but not murine TAP complexes can bind peptides with positively charged C-termini <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Momburg2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Momburg3">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Methionine (M) and Tryptophane (W) are strongly preferred residues for binding at the C-terminus of murine TAP, while they have little or no effect for human TAP. Moreover, compared to the human TAP matrix, the charged residues D and E are essentially neutral in positions 1 and 2 of murine TAP, whereas they clearly inhibit binding to human TAP. Finally, Proline (P) at position 3 disrupts binding to murine TAP while being essential neutral for the human transporter. In summary, although the relative weight of the aminoterminal positions differs between human and murine TAP (see below), binding affinity for both depends mainly on the three N-terminal and the C-terminal residues of a peptide. While the two transporters share many preferences, there are a number of residues with clearly distinct binding patterns.</p><p>Next we examined the overall importance of C-terminal and N-terminal peptide residues for binding to human and mouse TAP. Mouse TAP has strong preferences or aversion for 13 of 20 amino acids at the C-terminus, while human has only 7. Conversely, human TAP shows preferences or aversion for 16 amino acids in positions 1 to 3 (6 in P1, 4 in P2, 6 in P3), while mouse TAP displays only 7 (1 in P1, 2 in P2, 4 in P3). At the C-terminus, this difference is statistically significant when comparing the absolute coefficient values (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.030, Mann-Whitney Test). For the three N-terminal residues, the p value is 0.062, just slightly above the customary cutoff of p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.05.</p><p>To quantify the relative impact of N-terminal residues and the C-terminus with a single number, we calculated the ratio of standard deviations for the scores for human and mouse TAP at the corresponding positions. For human TAP, the standard deviation of the C terminal scores is 0.59 and 0.41 at the N-terminus, which gives a ratio of 1.4. In contrast, for murine TAP the standard deviation at the C-terminus is 0.82 and 0.31 at the N-terminus, corresponding to a ratio of 2.6 which is nearly twice as high. Overall this shows that murine TAP selects its ligands much more on the basis of the C terminus than its human counterpart.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Predicting peptide binding for varying lengths</title><p>As TAP is known to transport precursor peptides longer than nine residues into the ER, we examined if we could predict their affinity using an approach we had previously developed for human TAP. This was based on representing peptides of any length by their three N-terminal residues plus their one C-terminal residue, and assigning them a binding score based on matrix columns 1, 2, 3 and 9 of the matrix for 9-mer peptides. To evaluate this approach, we first tested a set of 92 peptides with length 8, 10 and 11 for binding to murine TAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002402.s001">Table S1</xref><bold>). </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002402-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref> shows scatterplots of the predicted versus measured affinities for each of these peptides, using either the human or the murine matrices as predictors.

Thus, the previously established approach to improve epitope predictions for human TAP by including the transport of precursors was not successful when applied to murine TAP and the prediction of viral epitopes.

In addition, the present study provides the first quantitative specificity data for over seventy residue/position combinations not covered by published substation library data. This complete coverage ensures that no residue/position combination that strongly influences binding has been overlooked, which is necessary to quantitatively predict murine TAP binding specificity for any peptide sequence.</p><p>We took advantage of being able to compare human and murine TAP specificity matrices, and found that several residues at the N-terminus of peptides that strongly influence binding to human TAP showed little effect on binding to murine TAP. This includes a complete lack of any residue with a strong positive effect on binding in position 1. In contrast, for peptide C-termini, murine TAP is more specific in its binding preference than human TAP. Taken together, we showed that murine TAP is more skewed than human TAP towards binding peptides based on their C-terminus alone.

This demonstrates that our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies correlate with antigen processing events <italic>in vivo</italic>. It also reinforces that studies of epitope repertoire in mice and human need to take differences between their TAP transporters into account.</p><p>As TAP is known to transport epitope precursors up to a length of about 16 residues, it is important to characterize its substrate specificity for varying lengths. We were able to successfully predict the affinity of peptides between 8 and 11 residues in length by modeling their binding interaction at the C terminus and the three N terminal residues. In this model of binding, the connecting residues 4 to C-1 of longer peptides are assumed to make only weak interactions with the TAP molecules. This model was previously applied to human TAP, and is shown for the first time to apply to murine TAP as well.</p><p>The description of murine TAP specificity provides one crucial component towards explaining species specific differences in epitope recognition, which could explain differences in epitope repertoire in humans and HLA transgenic mice frequently used in epitope discovery and vaccine development studies. These data likely will have to be complemented by other studies directed at understanding the impact of other components of the antigen processing pathway that are known to differ between the two species. This includes the lack of ERAP2 in mice, and incompatibilities between human MHC molecules and the murine peptide loading complex (specifically tapasin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002402-Peh1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>). Also, the difference in mouse and human self, which, due to the requirement for self-tolerance, leads to differences in TCR repertoire, may have to be taken into account.
