During embryonic development <italic>wg</italic> is involved in the allocation of the limb primordia. During imaginal disk development <italic>wg</italic> is involved in distal development and it has a separate role in ventral development. The expression pattern of <italic>wg</italic> is highly conserved in all arthropods (comprising data from insects, myriapods, crustaceans, and chelicerates), suggesting that its function in leg development is also conserved. However, recent work in other insects (e.g. the milkweed bug <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic>) argued against a role of <italic>wg</italic> in leg development. We have studied the role of <italic>wg</italic> in leg development of the flour beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>. Using stage-specific staggered embryonic RNAi in wild-type and transgenic EGFP expressing enhancer trap lines we are able to demonstrate separable functions of <italic>Tribolium wg</italic> in distal and in ventral leg development. The distal role affects all podomeres distal to the coxa, whereas the ventral role is restricted to cells along the ventral midline of the legs. In addition, severe leg defects after injection into early embryonic stages are evidence that <italic>wg</italic> is also involved in proximal development and limb allocation in <italic>Tribolium</italic>. Our data suggest that the roles of <italic>wg</italic> in leg development are highly conserved in the holometabolous insects. Further studies will reveal the degree of conservation in other arthropod groups.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Wingless</kwd><kwd>Leg development</kwd><kwd>Arthropods</kwd><kwd>Appendage evolution</kwd><kwd><italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2010</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The gene <italic>wingless</italic> (<italic>wg</italic>) is mainly known for its role in segment polarity specification during body segmentation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (reviewed in Sanson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2001</xref>). However, <italic>wg</italic> is also an important factor in <italic>Drosophila</italic> leg development (e.g., Cohen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1993</xref>; Struhl and Basler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1993</xref>; Campbell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1993</xref>). The leg primordium in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is already specified in the embryo. At embryonic stage 11 the primordium of the leg is still combined with the wing primordium in the so-called thoracic limb primordium (Cohen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1993</xref>). Wg is required for the specification of the entire thoracic limb primordium where it activates the <italic>Distal-less</italic> (<italic>Dll</italic>) gene via the early <italic>Dll</italic> enhancer 304 (Cohen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1993</xref>; Kubota et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2003</xref>; McKay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2009</xref>). This early function of Wg is repressed on the dorsal side by Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling and on the ventral side by epidermal growth factor receptor signaling (Goto and Hayashi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1997</xref>; Kubota et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2000</xref>), thus restricting the thoracic limb primordium to the ventral&#x02013;lateral side. At embryonic stage 14 the cells of the wing primordium downregulate Wg signaling and separate from the leg primordium (Cohen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1993</xref>). The cells of the leg primordium subdivide further into proximal and distal cells. Wg is also involved in this process by activating the late enhancer LT ("leg trigger") of <italic>Dll</italic> in the distal cells, whereas the proximal cells do not require <italic>wg</italic> function at this stage (McKay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2009</xref>; Estella and Mann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>; Estella et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2008</xref>). This function of <italic>wg</italic> is separate from the early <italic>wg</italic> function as evidenced by the fact that Wg cooperates with Dpp rather than being repressed by it (Held et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1994</xref>; Diaz-Benjumea et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1994</xref>; Penton and Hoffmann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1996</xref>; Jiang and Struhl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1996</xref>; Theisen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1996</xref>; Lecuit and Cohen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1997</xref>; Theisen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2007</xref>). Finally, <italic>wg</italic> is then required for the specification of ventral fate in the legs (Struhl and Basler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1993</xref>; Theisen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1996</xref>; Brook and Cohen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1996</xref>; Johnston and Schubiger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1996</xref>). This function, however, appears to be mechanistically different from the previous function where Wg protein forms a morphogen gradient. The ventral function of <italic>wg</italic> is local and does not require Wg protein to form a morphogen gradient (Diaz-Benjumea and Cohen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1994</xref>; Wilder and Perrimon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1995</xref>; Theodosiou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1998</xref>). Instead, Wg might interact with other local factors to specify ventral fate through its target gene <italic>H15</italic> (Wilder and Perrimon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1995</xref>). In summary, <italic>wg</italic> has three temporally separate and mechanistically different functions during the development of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> leg. The earliest function specifies and allocates the entire leg primordium including the proximal cells. By contrast, the later function in organizing pattern formation along the proximal&#x02013;distal axis concerns only distal cells and the proximal cells do not require <italic>wg</italic> at this stage. The ventral role, finally, is temporally and functionally separate from the proximal&#x02013;distal role.</p><p>The <italic>wg</italic> gene was the first segment polarity gene that has been shown to have a conserved expression pattern in long-germ and short-germ insects (Nagy and Carroll <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1994</xref>). In the meantime, <italic>wg</italic> has been isolated and studied in a number of other arthropods including different insect species (e.g. Jockusch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2000</xref>; Niwa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2000</xref>; Dearden and Akam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2001</xref>; Miyawaki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>), as well as myriapods (Hughes and Kaufman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2002</xref>; Prpic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>; Janssen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2004</xref>), crustaceans (Duman-Scheel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2002</xref>; Nulsen and Nagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1999</xref>; Prpic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2008</xref>), chelicerates (Damen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2002</xref>; Prpic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2003</xref>), and an onychophoran (Eriksson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>). These data show that the expression pattern of <italic>wg</italic> in all arthropods is highly conserved suggesting conserved functions. Surprisingly, however, functional tests have so far provided no support for highly conserved functions. Especially the three separate roles of <italic>wg</italic> in leg development (allocation, distal, and ventral development) seem not to be conserved. In the milkweed bug <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic> and the cricket <italic>Gryllus bimaculatus wg</italic> is necessary for normal body segmentation, but does not seem to have a role in leg development (Angelini and Kaufman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2005a</xref>; Miyawaki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>). These two species belong to more basal hemimetabolous insect groups and Angelini and Kaufman (Angelini and Kaufman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005b</xref>) have therefore suggested that the role of <italic>wg</italic> in appendage development evolved only later in the holometabolous insects. Previous data from <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> indicated that in this holometabolous insect <italic>wg</italic> is indeed required for appendage allocation, because legs were absent after <italic>wg</italic> RNAi, but a role of <italic>wg</italic> in distal and ventral development remained unclear (Ober and Jockusch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>). We have therefore studied the temporal requirement of <italic>wg</italic> in <italic>Tribolium</italic> leg development using staggered stage-specific RNAi. Our results show that in <italic>Tribolium wg</italic> has three consecutive roles in allocation, distal, and ventral development, like in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Our data suggest that the origin of these functions in insect evolution must predate the split between Diptera and Coleoptera.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Parental and embryonic staggered RNAi</title><p>Parental RNAi was performed as described previously (Bucher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2002</xref>).

Each leg segment (podomere) has a characteristic set of cuticle markers. However, not all markers are present in all individuals or on all legs and sometimes the number of certain markers may differ between individuals. <fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>A map of cuticular markers on the thoracic appendages of <italic>T castaneum</italic>. <bold>a</bold> Schematic drawing of a leg in dorsal (<italic>left</italic>) and ventral (<italic>right</italic>) aspect.

These two markers are bristles, cx-1 and cx-2, that are located close to each other on the anterior dorsal side of the coxa. Two groups of smaller bristles, cx-a and cx-p, are present in most individuals and mark the anterior and posterior part of the coxa, respectively. However, the number of bristles in each group is variable (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The remaining bristles occur singly (except cx-bp which may be present as a pair) and are present in most individuals. The tiny ventral bristle cx-v, however, is more frequently missing on thoracic leg 1 than on legs 2 and 3 (boxed in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The trochanter has eight cuticle markers most of which are present in all individuals. The best trochanter marker is a group of campaniform sensillae, tr-cs, that may comprise two or three members (denoted by a red dot in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The dorsolateral bristle tr-l is less suited, because it is more frequently missing on thoracic legs 1 and 2 than on leg 3 (boxed in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The femur has 10 cuticle markers of which the long ventral bristle fe-v1 is the most conspicuous one and is present in all individuals. The remaining bristles are present in most individuals; the two smaller bristles fe-la and fe-lp can serve as markers for the anterior and posterior femur as they are present in all individuals (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The campaniform sensillae fe-csa and fe-csp are less suited as markers, because they are lacking in a large portion of individuals. The tibiotarsus has 11 cuticle markers of which the thorn-like bristle tt-v and the dorsal campaniform sensilla tt-cs are good markers, because they are present in all individuals. The remaining bristles are present in the majority of individuals. The two dorsal bristles tt-dla and tt-dlp are conspicuous, but one or both may be missing making them less suitable as markers.

We have performed pRNAi experiments with <italic>wg</italic> in order to study the role of <italic>wg</italic> in development. The eclosion rate and the survival of eclosed imagines after <italic>wg</italic> dsRNA injection (injected pupae: <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;118) was similar to the GFP dsRNA control injection (injected pupae: <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;55), but slightly lower than in the uninjected control pupae (pupae: <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;42; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). This indicates that <italic>wg</italic> pRNAi has no effect on the eclosure rate or the subsequent survival of the imagines, but the injection per se leads to a slightly reduced rate of eclosure and survival. A significant effect was seen in the productivity of the females after injection. The uninjected control females layed approximately 13 eggs per female during the first egg-laying period after eclosure and this rate increased to approximately 17 eggs per female during the second egg-laying period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, left). In dsGFP-injected females the productivity was lower, probably owing to the injection procedure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, center). However, productivity was even lower in females injected with <italic>wg</italic> dsRNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, right). Thus, this effect cannot be attributed to injection stress alone, and must have been caused by the <italic>wg</italic> dsRNA. <fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Results of the parental RNAi experiments. <bold>a</bold> Eclosion rates and survival rates of the eclosed beetles (in percent).

All eggs that reached hatching in both controls and also in the experiment gave rise to wild-type larvae. These data indicate that pRNAi with <italic>wg</italic> is leading to reduced female productivity (probably by interfering with gonad development or oogenesis), is embryonically lethal and the few obtained wild-type larvae in the <italic>wg</italic> dsRNA-injected animals likely are escapers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Embryonic RNAi effects after staggered injections</title><p>Since the pRNAi experiments lead to either empty egg shells or wild-type cuticles, we turned to staggered embryonic RNAi (eRNAi). eRNAi circumvents the problem of effects already during gonad formation or oogenesis, and by staggering the injections the effects that lead to early embryonic lethality can also be excluded.</p><p>We performed the earliest injections 4&#x000a0;h after egg laying. At this time point the embryo is still at a very early stage of development and the cleavage nuclei are in the process of approaching the egg periphery. Not unexpected therefore, these injections led to 90% empty egg shells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) indicating early embryonic lethality similar to the results of the pRNAi. However, 10% of the larvae developed a cuticle. Three percent of these displayed only irregular cuticular structures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) that were also present in the control injections (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), 1% were wildtype, and 6% of the larvae had legs with severely disturbed proximal&#x02013;distal axis formation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, c</xref>). These results indicate that eRNAi can produce weaker phenotypes than pRNAi and that these weaker phenotypes include severe defects in morphology (including leg formation). <fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Results of the staggered embryonic injections. <bold>a</bold> Control injections (injection buffer). <bold>b</bold><italic>wg</italic> dsRNA injections.

At 8&#x000a0;h of development the embryo has reached the blastoderm stage, and we anticipated to circumvent in this way to interfere with very early <italic>wg</italic> functions before blastoderm formation. At 12&#x000a0;h of development serosal closure takes place, the thoracic segments have already formed, but the leg primordia are not yet specified. We anticipated that in this way we could avoid to interfere with thoracic segment formation, but affect leg bud formation from the start. At 18&#x000a0;h of development germ band elongation is complete and all segments are formed, and the leg buds are already present. In this way we expected to be able to specifically interfere with late processes of leg development, without affecting segmentation or limb primordium specification. Injections later than 18&#x000a0;h after egg laying were not possible, because the vitelline membrane becomes too rigid and cannot be penetrated with the beveled borosilicate needles used in our experiments without squashing the embryo. The results of the 8-h injections were very similar to the 4-h injections. There was no significant decrease of empty egg shells or increase of proximal&#x02013;distal leg axis phenotypes (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d&#x02013;f</xref>). The 12-h injections lead to a strong decrease of the amount of empty egg shells, and the occurrence of proximo-distal leg phenotypes increased simultaneously to almost 30%. This proximo-distal leg phenotypes included specimens with malformed legs that nevertheless were composed of some leg segments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d, f</xref>), and specimens with more severely malformed legs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e, g</xref>). In these legs it was not possible to confidently establish the identity of the remaining leg portions because the morphology was too severely disturbed and most cuticle markers were absent. However, two additional phenotypes, that we term "candy cane" and "nonpareille" phenotypes, could be analyzed in more detail. In the "nonpareille" phenotype (named for Nonpareils pearls) all remaining leg segments appear rounded (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>) and in severe cases they are lined up like pearls on a chain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). In these phenotypes several cuticular markers were present (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b, c</xref>) that indicate that the legs comprise a coxa with largely wild-type morphology, a long femur with ectopic constrictions, and a shortened tibiotarsus, and are lacking the claw. Thus, this phenotype reveals severe problems with proximal&#x02013;distal axis formation distal to the coxa and distal-most structures are even lacking. The severe form of the "nonpareille" phenotype apparently is the "candy cane" phenotype where the podomeres do not form a chain anymore, but are fused into a long cane with a curiously bent distal end (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Many of these specimens were simultaneously lacking the flagellum on the antennae (not shown). <fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Thoracic appendages of larvae hatched from eggs injected after 12&#x000a0;h after egg laying. <bold>a</bold> Typical "candy cane" leg phenotype. <bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold> "Nonpareille" leg phenotypes.

The overall amount of leg phenotypes remained constant, but the distal phenotype decreased and a novel, weaker phenotype appeared that does not lack distal leg segments. Instead, the claw is abnormally shaped: thin and pin-shaped and without the normal ventral bend (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>). This phenotype also lacks the typical marker bristles that grow on, or very close to the ventral midline of the legs: on the femur (fe-v1) and tibiotarsus (tt-v, tt-pv). The lack of the ventral bend of the claw together with the lack of the ventral marker bristles indicates that this phenotype is caused by the loss of ventral tissue in the legs and we have therefore termed this phenotype "ventral-less". <fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p>Thoracic appendages of larvae hatched from eggs injected after 18&#x000a0;h after egg laying. <bold>a</bold> Wild-type larval leg for comparison. <bold>b</bold>&#x02013;<bold>d</bold> Different "nonpareille" phenotypes.

The weakest cases had all typical podomeres including the claw, but the femur was elongated and thinner than in the wildtype and the tibiotarsus showed ectopic constrictions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). The intermediate phenotype had normal coxa and trochanter, but a shortened tibiotarsus, no claw and a single ectopic constriction in the femur (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>), and the most severe phenotypes were "nonpareille" phenotypes with pearl-shaped tibiotarsus and rounded ectopic subdivisions of the femur, and the trochanter seems to be fused entirely to the coxa (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>).</p><p>We have then used molecular markers for the ventral and distal tissues in the developing <italic>Tribolium</italic> leg. The GEKU insertional mutagenesis screen has produced about 50 enhancer trap lines with EGFP expression in the legs (Trauner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2009</xref>). We have used two of these lines to perform staggered RNAi with <italic>wg</italic>. The line Goe-04609 expresses EGFP mRNA along the ventral side of the legs, and in addition in a segmentally repeated pattern and in the developing heart (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). In embryos injected 18&#x000a0;h after egg laying the expression is largely identical to the expression in the wildtype, but the ventral expression in the legs is lacking (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>). This demonstrates that ventral leg tissue is missing. In the embryos injected earlier, the pattern of Goe-04609 is disturbed more severely: the segmental pattern is fused along the anterior&#x02013;posterior axis and the expression in the heart is missing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>). The line Goe-12407 expresses EGFP mRNA in a ring of cells near the tips of the legs, and in addition in a punctate pattern in the central nervous system (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>). In embryos injected 18&#x000a0;h after egg laying the expression is very similar to the expression in the wildtype, but the distal ring in the legs is reduced to a spot of expression on the dorsal side of the legs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8e</xref>). This indicates that ventral leg tissue is missing. In the embryos injected earlier, the pattern of Goe-12407 is weak (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8f</xref>). However, the expression in the antennae is much stronger, indicating that the enhancer trapped in Goe-12407 is normally repressed in the antenna by <italic>wg</italic>. <fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;8</label><caption><p>Expression of molecular markers for ventral and distal leg fate is altered in <italic>wg</italic> RNAi embryos. <bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>c</bold> Expression of the ventral leg marker enhancer trap Goe-04609 in wild-type embryos (<bold>a</bold>) and embryos injected after 18 (<bold>b</bold>) and 12&#x000a0;h (<bold>c</bold>) after egg laying. <bold>d</bold>&#x02013;<bold>f</bold> Expression of the distal leg marker enhancer trap Goe-12407 in wild-type embryos (<bold>d</bold>) and embryos injected after 18 (<bold>e</bold>) and 12&#x000a0;h (<bold>f</bold>) after egg laying. <italic>t1</italic> prothoracic leg, <italic>t2</italic> mesothoracic leg, <italic>t3</italic> metathoracic leg.

Despite good eclosion and survival rates, the females that eclosed from pupae injected with <italic>wg</italic> dsRNA had a very low productivity and from the few eggs almost no larvae hatched; those larvae that did hatch were wildtype. The low productivity suggests that <italic>wg</italic> might have a role already during oogenesis. The low hatching rate indicates that <italic>wg</italic> has functions early in development that lead to early embryonic lethality and the few wild-type larvae must be escapers that by chance did not receive <italic>wg</italic> dsRNA.</p><p>Early injections into eggs lead to similar effects. Most of the eggs of the 4- and 8-h injections were empty or contained irregular cuticular structures similar to those observed by Bolognesi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>). The few larvae that developed showed severe phenotypes indicating problems with several developmental processes including segmentation. The legs of these larvae were severely malformed. The defects we have observed are very similar to those reported by Ober and Jockusch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>). These authors also found segmentation defects and severely truncated or missing legs after <italic>wg</italic> RNAi. The specimens figured in their Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d&#x02013;g</xref> are very similar to our results after early injections after 4 and 8&#x000a0;h. The specimen figured in their Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref> shows shortened and severely malformed appendages, which is also very similar to what we have found in the early injections. Ober and Jockusch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>) have interpreted these phenotypes as support for a role of <italic>wg</italic> in appendage allocation. However, because in all of these specimens the segments are also malformed, it is unclear whether the leg defects are true leg developmental defects or secondary defects because of the defective segment formation.</p><p>We avoided interfering with the early functions of <italic>wg</italic> in body segmentation by applying later injections after 12 and 18&#x000a0;h. The most severe leg phenotypes in these injections are seen in the 12-h injections: the legs are malformed and all parts of the leg are affected including the coxa. This is very similar to the early function of <italic>wg</italic> in leg allocation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> when Wg is required for activating the 304 enhancer of <italic>Dll</italic> in all cells of the leg primordium including proximal (coxal) cells (Cohen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1993</xref>; McKay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2009</xref>). We thus interpret the severe malformations in 12-h injections as evidence for a role of <italic>Tribolium wg</italic> in the specification and allocation of the entire leg primordium.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Separate functions of <italic>wg</italic> in distal and ventral development</title><p>In the "candy cane" and "nonpareille" phenotypes in the 12- and 18-h injections the coxa is not affected indicating that at this stage of development <italic>wg</italic> is not required for the development of the proximal leg parts anymore. The distal leg parts, however, are malformed and the distal-most portion, the claw, is missing in most specimens. This distal function is very similar to the distal function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> leg imaginal precursors where <italic>wg</italic> is required for the development of all leg portions distal to the coxa by activating the LT enhancer of <italic>Dll</italic> (Cohen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1993</xref>; Estella et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2008</xref>; McKay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2009</xref>). The extra constrictions in the femur or the tibiotarsus in the strong and weak "nonpareille" phenotypes, respectively, are unexpected and their origin is unclear. The normal number of constrictions (future joints) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is specified by the action of the Notch pathway (de Celis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1998</xref>; Rauskolb and Irvine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1999</xref>; Bishop et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1999</xref>) which is regulated by the leg gap genes and these are regulated by Wg signaling in conjunction with Dpp signaling (Lecuit and Cohen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1997</xref>; Estella and Mann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>). It is currently unknown whether a similar cascade exists in <italic>Tribolium</italic>, but this is very likely because the role of the Notch pathway in leg segmentation is also conserved in the spider <italic>Cupiennius salei</italic>, a basally branching arthropod (Prpic and Damen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2009</xref>). Thus, it is possible that interference with the distal function of <italic>wg</italic> disturbs the normal segmentation of the <italic>Tribolium</italic> legs leading to ectopic constrictions in the distal segments.</p><p>The "ventral-less" phenotype appeared only in the 18-h injections. In these legs all segments are normal except that the ventral-most tissue is lacking. This ventral function appears to be separate from the distal function since the "ventral-less" phenotype does not show any distal defects. Again this is very similar to the ventral function of <italic>wg</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> where Wg does not act as a concentration-dependent morphogen, but rather acts locally on the ventral side probably in conjunction with other ventrally expressed factors (Diaz-Benjumea and Cohen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1994</xref>; Wilder and Perrimon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1995</xref>; Theodosiou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1998</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our results indicate three separate functions of <italic>wg</italic> in leg development of <italic>Tribolium</italic>, and these functions also are temporally separated. The early function of <italic>wg</italic> is the specification of the entire leg primordium. This is supported by the strong leg defects after the 12-h injections that affect all leg parts including the coxa. Later injections cannot interfere with normal coxa development (the "candy cane" and "nonpareille" phenotypes in which distal leg portions are affected, but the coxa is normal) suggesting that at this stage <italic>wg</italic> has a role in the formation of the entire distal leg portion, but not in the proximal cells anymore. Future studies have to reveal whether this distal function is performed by <italic>wg</italic> as a morphogen in conjunction with <italic>dpp</italic> as the second morphogen as it is the case in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (e.g. Lecuit and Cohen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1997</xref>). Finally, the late function of <italic>wg</italic> is the specification of ventral leg cells. This function is independent of the distal function, because in the "ventral-less" phenotype the formation of the proximal&#x02013;distal axis is not affected. The fact that the effect is restricted to ventral leg cells is evidence that it does not involve a Wg gradient.</p><p>Our results indicate that the separate functions of <italic>wg</italic> in leg allocation, distal, and ventral leg development must have evolved before the split between Diptera and Coleoptera. Without further information from more basal insects or non-insect arthropods this suggests that the leg functions of <italic>wg</italic> have evolved in the last common ancestor of the holometabolous insects and thus earlier than suggested by Angelini and Kaufman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005b</xref>). In order to exactly pinpoint the origin of the involvement of <italic>wg</italic> in arthropod leg development, the function of <italic>wg</italic> has to be studied in additional holo- and hemimetabolous insect species and also in other arthropod groups where functional data are currently lacking.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Gregor Bucher, Ernst A.
