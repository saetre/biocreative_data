The first takes place before entry into S phase, does not depend on the checkpoint proteins Rad3, Cds1 and Chk1 and is independent of Cdc2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, it is not dependent upon inhibiting the Cdc10-dependent transcription required for S phase entry, unlike a G1/S checkpoint described in budding yeast. We show that expression of Cdt1, a protein essential for initiation of DNA replication, is delayed upon UV irradiation. The second part of the delay occurs after entry into S phase and depends on Rad3 and Cds1 and is probably due to the intra-S checkpoint.

They prevent cell cycle transitions until previous events have been completed or damaged DNA has been repaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Checkpoint pathways and proteins are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to man, underlining their importance in maintaining genomic integrity. In fission yeast several checkpoint pathways monitor the status of the DNA and arrest the cell cycle in response to DNA damage or inhibition of DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] They include mechanisms to inhibit mitosis when the DNA is damaged (the G2/M checkpoint) or when S phase has not been completed (the S/M checkpoint) as well as a mechanism to inhibit ongoing DNA replication when the DNA is damaged (the intra-S checkpoint). Screens designed to reveal elements of the checkpoint pathways have led to the identification of the so-called checkpoint <italic>rad </italic>genes as well as <italic>crb2</italic>/<italic>rhp9</italic>, <italic>mrc1</italic>, <italic>chk1 </italic>and <italic>cds1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] The checkpoint <italic>rad </italic>genes consist of <italic>rad1</italic>, <italic>rad3</italic>, <italic>rad9</italic>, <italic>rad17</italic>, <italic>rad26 </italic>and <italic>hus1 </italic>(reviewed in ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). Rad3 is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family of proteins and the closest mammalian homologue is the ATR (<underline>AT</underline>M and <underline>R</underline>ad3 related) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Rad3 forms a complex with Rad26 and this association is required for activation of Rad3 kinase activity in response to DNA damage or replication arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] The Rad1, Rad9 and Hus1 proteins have similarities to PCNA, the sliding clamp of the replicative DNA polymerase, and the three proteins may form a similar ring-shaped structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Rad17 has similarities to all five subunits of replication factor C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], a complex which loads PCNA onto chromatin.</p><p>There are two known effector kinases downstream of the checkpoint Rad proteins, Chk1 and Cds1. Chk1 is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage induced in late S or G<sub>2 </sub>in a Rad3 dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Phosphorylation of Chk1 leads to an increase of Chk1 kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and is often used as a convenient molecular marker for Chk1 dependent checkpoint activation. Cds1 is activated only in S phase as part of the intra-S and the S/M checkpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] Activation of either kinase leads to inhibition of Cdc2 activity by maintaining the inhibitory phosphorylation on Tyr15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Crb2 and Mrc1 act upstream of Chk1 and Cds1, respectively. Crb2 shares homology with the budding yeast RAD9 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which is involved in delaying entry into S phase upon DNA damage in G1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] In fission yeast, Crb2 is required both for activation of Chk1 and for subsequent inactivation of Chk1 for reentry into the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] Mrc1 plays a parallel role by binding to and activating Cds1. Expression of Mrc1 is regulated in the cell cycle, thus linking Cds1 activation to S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the G2/M, S/M and intra-S checkpoints, three papers have reported the existence of G1 checkpoints that inhibit mitosis when the cells are arrested in G1 using cell cycle mutants. Arrest at the <italic>cdc10 </italic>arrest point was shown to depend on Chk1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and Rum1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Arrest of <italic>orp1 </italic>mutant cells depends on the checkpoint Rad proteins and on Chk1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It should be noted that neither of these cell cycle mutants is able to replicate their DNA at the restrictive temperature, and failure of the checkpoints responsible for cell cycle arrest results in aberrant entry into mitosis and not into S phase.</p><p>A G1/S checkpoint has so far not been detected in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. The drop of CDK activity at the M/G1 transition allows the assembly of the pre-Replication Complex, preRC, which is the first step leading to initiation of S phase. The preRC consists of the ORC (Origin Recognition Complex), Cdc18, Cdt1 and the MCM proteins. Expression of Cdc18 and Cdt1 is cell cycle regulated, thus providing one of the means to regulate initiation of S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] Once the preRC is assembled, the chromatin is competent to replicate, but replication is not initiated until other replication proteins are loaded, and two kinases, Cdc2 and Hsk1, are activated. It has been shown both in fission yeast and in <italic>Xenopus </italic>that the intra-S phase checkpoint cannot be engaged until pol&#x003b1;-primase is loaded and replication begins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] This observation poses the question whether the cells have any means to respond to DNA damage sustained in G1.</p><p>G1 in fission yeast is very short under standard laboratory growth conditions, rendering the investigation of a G1/S checkpoint(s) difficult. However, G1 might be much extended in the natural habitat of <italic>S. pombe </italic>due to poor nutrient availability. We decided to use several approaches to synchronise the cells and/or to extend G1. Recently we reported the existence of a mechanism that delays entry into S phase when cycling cells are UV-irradiated in G1, using <italic>cdc10 </italic>and <italic>cdc25 </italic>mutants to synchronise the cells or growing the cells in medium where G1 is extended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Here we show that germinating <italic>S. pombe </italic>spores delay entry into S phase upon UV irradiation in early but not late G1. We demonstrate that there is a G1/S delay that is not dependent on any of the known checkpoint proteins and does not target Cdc2 phosphorylation. We argue that the delay is due to a novel mechanism that leads to delayed expression of Cdt1 and possibly other replication proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Entry into S phase is delayed by UV irradiation</title><p>Spores made from diploid cells were allowed to germinate for 3.5 h at 30&#x000b0;C before UV irradiation. At this time point, 1 &#x02013; 2 hours before S phase entry, the spores showed visible signs of germination by phase contrast microscopy. The dose of UV light was 1200 J/m<sup>2</sup>, which gave a cell survival of about 30% in wild type cells (data not shown). At the time of irradiation, the majority of germinating spores had a 1C DNA content. The timing of S phase was measured, by flow cytometry, as an increase in cellular DNA content from 1C to 2C. The decrease of the 1C population was plotted against time, and the graphs for unirradiated control and UV irradiated cells were compared at the point where 50% of the cells had 1C DNA content.</p><p>An inherent problem in the present experiments is that the time of germination varies both within each population of spores (low degree of synchrony) and between the different preparations (experiment-to-experiment variation). Thus, the time from resuspension in medium until the cells enter S phase is variable, and it is difficult to ensure that irradiation occurs at exactly the same time point relative to S phase entry. Therefore the experiments were repeated at least twice and the averages were determined (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The experiments revealed that UV irradiation made wild type cells delay their S phase entry by 76 minutes relative to unirradiated control cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). When the irradiated cells started to increase their DNA content, they did not delay appreciably within S phase compared to unirradiated control cells, suggesting that when they started to synthesise DNA, the DNA damage had been removed. However, when the germinating spores were irradiated shortly before S phase entry, they entered S phase without a delay and were arrested with a DNA content between 1C and 2C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), presumably due to the intra-S checkpoint. Indeed, the later the irradiation was performed the more pronounced the intra-S phase delay was (data not shown). We conclude that cells irradiated in early G1 arrest temporarily with 1C DNA content, then replicate their DNA with normal timing. Cells irradiated in late G1 exit from 1C with the same kinetics as unirradiated control cells do, but they are unable to complete S phase in normal time.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Length of the delay in the investigated mutants</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Mutant</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Length of the 1C delay (min)</bold>(*)</td><td align="center"><bold>Average length of the 1C delay (min)</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">wt early irradiation</td><td align="left">70, 80, 90, 60, 80</td><td align="center">76</td></tr><tr><td align="left">wt late irradiation</td><td align="left">&#x0003c;10, &#x0003c;10</td><td align="center">&#x0003c;10</td></tr><tr><td align="left">caffeine</td><td align="left">&#x0003c;10, &#x0003c;10</td><td align="center">&#x0003c;10</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>rad3</italic></td><td align="left">40, 20, 45, 15</td><td align="center">30</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>rad26</italic></td><td align="left">45, 40</td><td align="center">43</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>rad1</italic></td><td align="left">50, 40</td><td align="center">45</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>rad9</italic></td><td align="left">40, 30</td><td align="center">35</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>hus1</italic></td><td align="left">55, 40</td><td align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>rad17</italic></td><td align="left">40, 30</td><td align="center">35</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>cds1</italic></td><td align="left">50, 40</td><td align="center">45</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>chk1</italic></td><td align="left">90, 55, 70</td><td align="center">72</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>chk1 cds1</italic></td><td align="left">35, 40</td><td align="center">38</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>rum1</italic></td><td align="left">55, 45, 25</td><td align="center">42</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>res2</italic></td><td align="left">&#x0003c;10, &#x0003c;10, &#x0003c;10</td><td align="center">&#x0003c;10</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>(*) The length of the delay was measured at the point where 50% of the cells had a 1C DNA content on the quantitations.

Germinating wild type spores displayed a pronounced delay in entering S phase after UV irradiation. The delay was observed only when irradiation was carried out in early but not in late G1. We have investigated the dependence of the delay on classical checkpoint proteins and showed that they are required for some but not all of the delay with 1C DNA content. We argue that the observed delay is caused by two separate mechanisms, the first taking place before entry into S phase, and the second in early S phase (see below).</p><p>The delay in exit from the 1C population was demonstrated by means of flow cytometry, which does not allow us to distinguish between a G1/S and an early S delay. The following data represent strong evidence that part of the delay takes place before entry into S phase. First, the irradiated cells delay expression of Cdt1. In the absence of Cdt1 the cells cannot form preRCs and thus cannot initiate S phase. Second, the irradiated cells express Rum1 longer than unirradiated control cells. Since Rum1 expression is cell cycle regulated such that it is only expressed in G1, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], this observation implies that the irradiated cells do delay in G1. Furthermore, the delay is shorter in a <italic>rum1 </italic>mutant, which presumably loses the G1 part of the delay. Third, mutants lacking Mrc1 or Cds1, which are essential for S-phase checkpoints reported so far in fission yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], still delay for a significant length of time, pointing to the existence of a non-S mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Fourth, cells delay with the Cdc2 kinase in an unphosphorylated state. Cdc2 is normally inhibited by phosphorylation on Tyr15 as DNA replication commences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], arguing that the cells arrest before S phase. Fifth, the delay is not observed in a <italic>res2 </italic>mutant, which can not turn off the Cdc10 dependent transcription signal. The finding that a mutation affecting expression of proteins crucial for preparation for S phase abolishes the delay argues that the wild type cells first stop in G1 and only later stop in S phase.</p><p>On the basis of these results we conclude that there is a UV-induced G1 delay, which is not checkpoint Rad dependent and is brought about by an as yet undescribed mechanism. This part of the total delay with 1C DNA content is ca 40 minutes, since <italic>rad</italic>, <italic>cds1 </italic>and <italic>mrc1 </italic>mutants delay 30&#x02013;50 minutes and <italic>rum1&#x00394; </italic>cells lose ca 40 minutes of the delay, compared to wild type cells. The remaining ca 40 minutes of the total delay requires the checkpoint Rads, Mrc1, Cds1 and Cdc2 is phosphorylated. We argue that this part of the delay is brought about by the intra-S checkpoint. However, the resolution of our experiments is not high enough to exclude the possibility that some of the checkpoint Rad- and Cds1-dependent part of the delay occurs in late G1. We consider this possibility unlikely for two reasons; first, previous work has shown that the role of Cds1 is specific for S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and second, we have shown in the current paper that if irradiation occurs later, the cells enter S phase without delay and delay in S phase.</p><p>Since the level of synchrony is low in germinating spores, we have not emphasised minor differences in the timing of S phase entry. In spite of poor synchrony, we deem germinating spores a good model system, since spore germination is a natural phenomenon, it involves an extended G1 period and we observed clear-cut effects. Furthermore, this model system allowed us to investigate the effects of a number of mutations that would have not been possible using synchronisation by other methods.</p><p>We have explored whether the G1/S delay is caused by a checkpoint mechanism. We have shown that caffeine abolishes the delay, but this is not entirely due to inhibition of Rad3 activity, since a <italic>rad3 </italic>mutation does not abolish all of the G1/S delay. Since we have not identified a checkpoint mutation which abolishes the delay, we attribute the effect of caffeine to another effect than the inhibition of checkpoint proteins. Interestingly, recent data suggest that caffeine inhibits checkpoint responses without inhibiting the ATR and ATM kinases in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>Previously, Rhind and Russell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] showed that UV-irradiation during G1 delays passage through S-phase. However, this checkpoint arrests cells in S phase, requires Cds1 function and probably represents the intra-S checkpoint.</p><p>We have recently discovered a mechanism that delays entry into S phase in cells irradiated in early G1 in synchronised or in cycling cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] This inhibitory mechanism has several features in common with that described here. Both pathways are activated in early but not in late G1; both inhibit entry into S phase; both pathways are independent of classical checkpoint genes and of Cdc2 phosphorylation. These similarities argue that the G1/S mechanism demonstrated in germinating spores and in cycling cells is one and the same.</p><p>In budding yeast there is a G1 DNA damage checkpoint response that depends upon Mec1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], a homologue of the mammalian ATM/ATR and the fission yeast Rad3 protein. However, the budding yeast G1 checkpoint response depends on Rad53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], whereas its homologue in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, Cds1, is not involved in the present pathway. The budding yeast G1/S checkpoint delays entry into S phase by phosphorylating and thereby downregulating Swi6, the homologue of Cdc10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. In contrast, in fission yeast Cdc10 dependent transcription is not delayed during the G1/S delay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><p>Other possible mechanisms for the G1/S delay include inhibition of Cdc2 by Rum1 or an as yet unidentified mechanism such as preventing the formation of Cdc2-cyclin complexes or by restricting the availability of cyclins. We have shown that Rum1 is expressed during the delay and is required for the G1 delay. This observation does not imply that Rum1 is a direct target of the G1/S delay, but this remains an attractive possibility. Another possible mechanism for the delay is delaying expression of proteins required for the initiation of DNA replication. In particular, the findings that (1) irradiation in late G1 does not cause a delayed entry into S phase, (2) increased transcription of Cdc10 dependent genes in <italic>res2&#x00394; </italic>overrides the delay, (3) transcription of Cdc10 dependent genes is not downregulated during the delay and (4) expression of Cdt1 is delayed, suggest that the G1/S delay is caused by delayed expression of Cdt1 and probably also of Cdc18 and Cig2. Since we have shown that transcription of Cdc10 regulated genes is not downregulated, the most likely mechanism of the delay is reduced translation rate of Cdt1 and possibly other proteins required for initiation of DNA replication.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We studied the response of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe </italic>cells to UV irradiation in G1.
