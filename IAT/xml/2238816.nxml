The transcription factor FOXP3 is crucial for the suppressive activity of Tregs and is considered the most specific marker for this population.

In addition, transient FOXP3 expressing cells exhibited suppressive abilities that correlate to the methylation status of the <italic>FOXP3</italic> promoter. As an alternative to bisulphite sequencing, we present a restriction enzyme based screening method for the identification of committed Tregs and apply this method to evaluate the effect of various culturing conditions.

In these settings, there is a need for Treg markers able to distinguish this cell population from activated T cells.</p><p>Considering the importance of FOXP3 in the control of immune responses, the factors which in turn control FOXP3 become of interest. The <italic>FOXP3</italic> promoter region was recently described and shown to be accessible for the transcription machinery in both CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>lo</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Mantel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

The epigenetic mechanisms involved in Th1 and Th2 development are well described, whereas the mechanisms controlling Treg development are just beginning to be explored. Mice studies have focused on a conserved element in intron one of the <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene which shows transcriptional activity and differential methylation between CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and T regulatory cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Kim1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Floess1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the methylation status of the human <italic>FOXP3</italic> promoter has not yet been examined. The observation that human NK cells show increased FOXP3 expression when treated with the demethylating reagent 5-aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine strongly supports the assumption that FOXP3 expression is methylation dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Zorn1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this report, we investigated the epigenetic status of the human <italic>FOXP3</italic> promoter region, and correlated CpG methylation to FOXP3 expression with the aim to identify putative methylation sites to be used as Treg markers. We report Treg associated demethylation in the <italic>FOXP3</italic> promoter and identify a suitable site for methylation based screening of Treg commitment. Furthermore, we evaluate the demethylating abilities of several different stimuli and culturing conditions. In conclusion, complete demethylation of the human FOXP3 promoter is confined to committed Tregs and thus analysis of promoter methylation enables the identification of cells suitable for <italic>in vitro</italic> expansions and clinical use.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation and Analysis of Cell populations</title><p>PBMC from healthy blood donors were recovered from buffy coats.

A CpG rich region was found upstream of exon 1 displaying transcriptional activity and a differential methylation pattern between CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells. In a very recent report Kim et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Kim1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> showed that this region binds cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in a methylation dependent manner. In agreement with our data, the authors also showed a differential methylation state at the <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter region between CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells and that treatment of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells with 5-azacytidine results in elevated Foxp3 expression and demethylation at the <italic>Foxp3</italic> locus. Furthermore it was shown that addition of TGF-&#x003b2; to cell cultures induced demethylation at both the mouse promoter and the CREB binding region. Our experiments, on the other hand, show that addition of TGF-&#x003b2; during cell culture does not result in a Treg like demethylation at the human <italic>FOXP3</italic> promoter. In parallel to our study, another group have observed similar results regarding methylation in the conserved element upstream of exon 1 whitin the human <italic>FOXP3</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Baron1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The observations of differing effects of TGF-&#x003b2; on methylation status in human or mouse settings agree with functional experiments conducted by others where it has been shown that TGF-&#x003b2; can induce functional Tregs in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Park1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Fu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> but only transiently upregulates FOXP3 in humans and results in a non suppressive phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Tran1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>FOXP3 is used as a specific marker for the identification of T regulatory cells due to its correlation with suppressive function in freshly isolated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. However, as we and others have shown, FOXP3 is not restricted to naturally occurring Tregs but can be expressed by conventional T cells upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001612-g004">Figure 4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Gavin1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Pillai1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Allan2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The suppressive capacity of the induced FOXP3 expressing cells has been tested with various results. In most cases, stimulation resulted in a transient FOXP3 expression and non suppressive function, however, suppressive phenotypes have been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Gavin1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Wang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Allan2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Walker2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Regardless whether the variations in suppressive capacity of induced FOXP3 expressing cells are due to different stimulation conditions or due to donor dependent factors, it is now becoming increasingly accepted that stable FOXP3 expression is a prerequisite for a suppressive phenotype. We observed a significant difference in promoter methylation status between naturally occurring and induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> cells. This implicates that the partially methylated state in the promoter region of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>lo</sup> and induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> cells could be the cause for the transient FOXP3 expression in these cells. The restriction enzyme based screening method we describe provides a helpful tool for determination of Treg commitment as well as optimization of culturing conditions for Treg generation.</p><p>To illustrate how this method may be used, we measured FOXP3 expression in activated CD25<sup>lo</sup> cells and correlated this to methylation level as well as suppressive capacity. A stimulated culture will after a certain time contain activated, not yet activated and formerly activated T cells, a fact which could explain the differing results obtained by others when analyzing these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Walker1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Pillai1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Allan2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. To reduce the heterogeneity of the tested populations the activated T cells were sorted into CD25<sup>hi</sup> and CD25<sup>lo</sup> fractions throughout the course of stimulation prior to methylation analysis. A demethylated pattern was observed at an earlier stage in the sorted CD25<sup>hi</sup> populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001612-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), possibly due to FOXP3's linkage to expression of the IL-2R alpha chain (CD25) i.e. higher affinity to IL-2 and faster proliferative response. The association of proliferation to the gradual demethylation observed implies a cell division dependent passive demethylation process. It is interesting to note that the level of methylation in sorted CD25<sup>hi and lo</sup>, CD25<sup>lo</sup> derived, populations converges and levels off at a partial demethylation around 60&#x00025;. This convergence suggests that although the fast and slow responding cells within the CD25<sup>lo</sup> population initially differed in methylation status, the induced CD25<sup>hi</sup> cells retain their partially demethylated conformation as they downregulate CD25. In agreement with previous results, FOXP3 expression was higher in the CD25<sup>hi</sup> population throughout the culture, and greater suppressive capacity was observed in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001612-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we investigated the effect on methylation status of a spectrum of different stimuli and culturing conditions. Long-term follow-up after stimulation as well as subjection of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>lo</sup> cells to repeated stimuli revealed a partial demethylation of the &#x02212;77 reporter position. The addition of TGF-&#x003b2; and/or IL-10 did not result in any evident additional demethylation. The restriction enzyme based method allowed us to speed up the analysis, and thus allowed inclusion of considerably more culture conditions and time points than would have been practically possible with conventional bisulphite sequencing.</p><p>The chromatin structure of the <italic>FOXP3</italic> promoter region in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup>, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>lo</sup> and na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells has been shown to have an open configuration, as defined by histone H4 acetylation analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Mantel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. This accessibility was further increased upon activation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells, an observation which suggested that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells harbour a chromatin conformation which allows acquisition of a regulatory phenotype upon activation. Histone acetylation is a dynamic process, which provides a level of epigenetic regulation that is more likely to be affected during short term induction than CpG methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Wilson1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon stimulation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>lo</sup> cells demethylation occurs, although not reaching a fully demethylated pattern as we observe in FOXP3 expressing Tregs. These observations suggest that activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>lo</sup> cells possess a chromatin structure which permits FOXP3 expression but is limited by the methylation status of the promoter. In developing immune cells, demethylation during cell fate decisions occurs either passively through exclusion of maintenance methylases from the replication fork <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Wilson1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, or actively as in the case of <italic>IL-2</italic> where a yet not identified enzyme is able to actively demethylate the promoter region upon TCR stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Bruniquel1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data shows that activation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>lo</sup> cells results in partial demethylation of the human <italic>FOXP3</italic> promoter, and that the speed of demethylation seems to correlate to proliferation thus indicating passive demethylation. COBRA based analysis of the &#x02212;77 reporter position opens up for screening of the methylation status in cell populations, and future experiments will reveal whether other stimuli than the ones investigated in this paper may result in full demethylation and stable FOXP3 expression.</p><p>The observations of variable suppressive capacity of Treg expansions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001612-Wang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> raise the question of which cells to use in expansion protocols. Possibly, only a hitherto unidentified subpopulation of circulating CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells posses a predisposed epigenetic architecture at the <italic>FOXP3</italic> locus which makes them suitable for expansions. Here, we identify the CpG position that best discriminates committed Tregs from transiently FOXP3 expressing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, and introduce a method for convenient methylation screening of this site. In conclusion, we propose that the <italic>FOXP3</italic> promoter is under strict epigenetic control and that determination of the methylation status in the <italic>FOXP3</italic> promoter provides a more accurate definition of a suppressive phenotype in Tregs than FOXP3 expression alone. These considerations implicate CpG methylation analysis as a valuable tool for the distinction of committed human Tregs in both clinical and <italic>in vitro</italic> systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Isolation of Cell Populations</title><p>All procedures were done with approval from the Stockholm north regional ethic committee.
