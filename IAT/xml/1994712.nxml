Global patterns of hypermethylation are tumor-type specific and nonrandom. The biological significance and the underlying mechanisms of tumor-specific aberrant promoter methylation remain unclear, but some evidence suggests that this specificity involves differential sequence susceptibilities, the targeting of DNA methylation activity to specific promoter sequences, or the selection of rare DNA methylation events during disease progression. Using restriction landmark genomic scanning on samples derived from tissue culture and in vivo models of T cell lymphomas, we found that <italic>MYC</italic> overexpression gave rise to a specific signature of CpG island hypermethylation. This signature reflected gene transcription profiles and was detected only in advanced stages of disease. The further inactivation of the <italic>Pten</italic>, <italic>p53,</italic> and <italic>E2f2</italic> tumor suppressors in <italic>MYC</italic>-induced lymphomas resulted in distinct and diagnostic CpG island methylation signatures. Our data suggest that tumor-specific DNA methylation in lymphomas arises as a result of the selection of rare DNA methylation events during the course of tumor development. This selection appears to be driven by the genetic configuration of tumor cells, providing experimental evidence for a causal role of DNA hypermethylation in tumor progression and an explanation for the tremendous epigenetic heterogeneity observed in the evolution of human cancers. The ability to predict genome-wide epigenetic silencing based on relatively few genetic alterations will allow for a more complete classification of tumors and understanding of tumor cell biology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Genetic and epigenetic alterations of the genome are common features of cancers. The relationship between these two types of alterations, however, remains unclear. One type of epigenetic modification&#x02014;DNA methylation in promoter sequences of genes&#x02014;is of particular interest, since tumor cells have different patterns of promoter methylation than normal cells. Previous studies on human tumor samples have suggested a link between genetic alterations and the induction of aberrant DNA methylation; however, this link has been difficult to rigorously assess because of the incredible genetic heterogeneity found in human cancer. In this study, a mouse model of T cell lymphoma was used to explore the relationship between genetic and epigenetic modifications experienced by tumor cells. By introducing defined genetic changes into preneoplastic T cells of mice, such as the overexpression of the <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene and the ablation of tumor suppressor genes, we could carefully evaluate how these genetic changes impacted promoter methylation profiles during development of lymphomas in vivo. We found that the introduction of different genetic insults resulted in unique and diagnostic profiles of promoter methylation. Understanding how these methylation signatures contribute to tumor progression could eventually have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic value for human cancers.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Opavsky R, Wang SH, Trikha P, Raval A, Huang Y, et al.

Bisulfite sequencing and combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) assays confirmed tumor-specific methylation in regions surrounding the NotI site in 29 out of the 34 CpG islands tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030167-g001">Figures 1</xref>E, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030167-sg001">S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030167-sg002">S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030167-st001">Table S1</xref>). The discrepancy in the five CpG islands that were not confirmed by bisulfite-based methods may reflect assay-specific biases that rely on the utilization of different restriction endonuclease sites. Because hypermethylation is associated with gene silencing, we evaluated the expression of a subset of 16 genes corresponding to the hypermethylated CpG islands identified above. As determined by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) techniques, the expression of 15 from 16 randomly selected genes was significantly decreased in tumor samples relative to normal controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030167-g001">Figures 1</xref>F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030167-sg001">S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030167-st001">Table S1</xref>).

Thus, to evaluate CpG island methylation in a more homogenous and experimentally amenable cell system where the chronology of aberrant DNA methylation could be better evaluated during the early neoplastic process, we turned to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Primary MEFs have the potential to be transformed in vitro and in vivo by the cointroduction of two oncogenes.

Genes that are methylated and silenced in cancer are likely to be involved in specific pathways impacting any number of important processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. We reasoned that if DNA methylation events are selected for in neoplastic cells, and therefore contribute to the neoplastic process, the inactivation of key tumor suppressors impacting one or more of these same processes might diminish the selective pressure imposed during neoplastic progression.

The contribution of each DNA methylation event to the clustering observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030167-g005">Figure 5</xref>B was evaluated by a Random Forrest analysis and statistical ranking (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030167-st004">Table S4</xref>). Two important conclusions can be drawn from these experiments. The first and perhaps most obvious of these is that loss of tumor suppressor functions yield specific profiles of CpG island methylation in cancer. We view these results to mean that different tumor suppressor pathways impose unique selective pressures on neoplastic cells that drive the specificity of CpG island methylation. Interestingly, the overall frequency of hypermethylated CpG islands in <italic>Pten</italic>-deficient tumors was substantially less than seen in the other tumor cohorts (0.3&#x00025;, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.004), suggesting a particularly strong diversion of the selective pressure in the evolution of <italic>Pten</italic><sup>&#x02212;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;</sup> tumors. This suppression of tumor-specific DNA methylation by loss of <italic>Pten</italic> is likely a reflection of the broader number of pathways that Pten action impacts to prevent tumorigenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. The second conclusion is that the specificity of CpG island methylation is not likely to be a consequence of a general defect in the DNA methylation machinery since the specific profile, but not the frequency, of tumor-dependent CpG methylation events is altered by the loss of <italic>p53</italic> or <italic>E2f2</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have investigated the interplay between genetic mutations and the establishment of global DNA methylation patterns in the development of mouse T cell lymphomas. The model used here, developed by Felsher and colleagues, uses high levels of MYC expression to mimic similar events taking place during human lymphomagenesis such as in Burkitt's lymphoma (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d; and references therein). The clear advantage of using a mouse model to study the role of DNA methylation in cancer is that cohorts used are genetically homogeneous in all respects except on a defined set of genetic variables (i.e., overexpression of MYC). Therefore, we consider this mouse model to be suitable for studying the relationship between genetic and epigenetic changes during tumor development. We demonstrate that DNA methylation patterns in these tumors are characterized by frequent and nonrandom patterns, similar to what has been described in human malignancies. These patterns are exquisitely dependent on the genetic makeup of the tumor cell, as homozygous deletion of either <italic>p53</italic>, <italic>Pten</italic>, or <italic>E2f2</italic> in <italic>MYC</italic>-induced T cell lymphomas resulted in unique tumor-specific patterns of genome-wide DNA methylation. This analysis provides the first clear-cut experimental evidence showing that genetic background can drive the establishment of aberrant DNA methylation profiles during lymphoma development, offering an explanation for the tremendous epigenetic heterogeneity observed in human cancer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain the specificity of aberrant DNA methylation in human cancer, including the differential susceptibility of DNA sequences to methylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; and the targeting of methyltransferase activity to specific promoter sequences &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. The fact that our RLGS analysis identified a specific signature of CpG island methylation that could only be detected late in the <italic>MYC</italic>-induced neoplastic process suggests that MYC overexpression is insufficient to target the DNA methylation machinery to specific sites. It is unlikely that the absence of aberrant promoter methylation early in the neoplastic process was due to the notoriously slow nature of de novo methylation relative to the kinetics of gene repression, since repression was not observed at these early stages of disease, either. This view is further supported by the absence of any hypermethylation signature in cells immediately following the transformation by <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Ras<sup>61L</sup></italic>. Rather, specific patterns of DNA methylation could only be detected in <italic>MYC/Ras<sup>61L</sup></italic>-transformed MEFs that have been either cultured in vitro for an extended period of time or injected into nude mice for an equally long time. However, we cannot rule out that MYC-initiated targeting of the DNA methylation machinery could occur as an infrequent aberrant event during tumor development. Comparison of global methylation profiles between different mouse models of T cell lymphomas would not only help to answer this question but it would also address to what degree the global DNA methylation pattern is dependent on initial oncogenic insult.</p><p>The work described here provides an alternative explanation for the longstanding question of tumor-specific CpG island hypermethylation. We find that tumor-specific signatures of CpG island methylation can only be detected late in the neoplastic process, at a time when the clonal expansion of pretumor cells can be observed, suggesting that specific profiles of CpG island methylation arise from the expansion of rare neoplastic cells. While we cannot rule out the possibility that DNA methylation profiles of late-stage tumor cells may indirectly reflect the selection of cells having a unique expression profile, our observation that inactivation of different tumor suppressor pathways results in distinct aberrant DNA methylation signatures indicates that rare DNA methylation events are selected for during the course of tumor development.</p><p>The function of genes silenced by hypermethylation is expected to provide tumor cells with some selective advantage. Indeed, many of the hypermethylated genes identified by RLGS have functions consistent with a tumor suppressor role, including <italic>Id4</italic> and <italic>Ptprk</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. The observation that inactivation of different tumor suppressor pathways results in distinct aberrant DNA methylation signatures further supports the notion that rare DNA methylation events are selected for during the course of tumor development. We envision that the function of genes that are no longer selected for hypermethylation in each of the three tumor suppressor cohorts studied here must be somehow related or dependent on the function of the specific tumor suppressor targeted for inactivation. The inactivation of <italic>Pten</italic>, for example, would thus diminish the selective pressure imposed during neoplastic progression for genes involved in similar or related functions. Comparison among the three tumor suppressor cohorts suggested that this selection is strongly influenced by the specific tumor suppressor inactivated in the tumor cell. Remarkably, the strength of the influence that genetics has on this selection mechanism is illustrated by the ability of unbiased statistical algorithms to faithfully predict the tumor suppressor status in each tumor. We would predict that the nature of the initiating oncogenic insult, in this case MYC, would have an equally important role in determining the CpG methylation profile of the emerging tumor.</p><p>It is clear from in vitro experiments and more recent genome-wide sequencing efforts that the transformation of both human and mouse cells to a malignant phenotype requires multiple sequential genetic lesions. In the context of an evolving tumor, it is likely that the initial genetic insult acts as a driving force for the first round of epigenetic alterations and that subsequent genetic alterations as the tumor evolves lead to further epigenetic selection. There is also evidence that epigenetic alterations influence the evolution of genetic lesions. For example, it has been shown, that the hypermethylation and silencing of the mismatch repair gene <italic>MLH1</italic> leads to microsatellite instability in colon cancer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, the silencing induced by promoter hypermethylation of the Werner syndrome gene that occurs in several human cancer types, leads to chromosomal instability and apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the coevolution of genetic and epigenetic changes during the transformation of a normal cell may be viewed to fuel the diversity of tumor phenotypes. This interpretation is consistent with the heterogeneity of DNA methylation we observe even within a single genetic cohort of mouse lymphomas.</p><p>While the underlying mechanisms for this selection process are unknown, one could speculate that due to the loss of tumor suppressor function, gene-expression profiles are changed. These changes in gene expression may trigger a cascade of epigenetic events including nucleosome repositioning, histone tail modifications, and subsequently DNA methylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b039">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. There is indeed evidence that a similar mechanism for the specificity of CpG island methylation is also operative in human malignancies. For example, Weisenberger et al. described the tight association of <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation with a CpG island methylator phenotype in colon cancer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, and it is known that in breast cancers with either <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations stable epigenetic changes reflect gene-expression profiles in these cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b042">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030167-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. In conclusion, our findings suggest that genetic events can determine the course in the epigenetic evolution of DNA methylation during tumor development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation and maintenance of mice.</title><p>The <italic>E2f2</italic><sup>&#x02212;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>Teto-Cre</italic>, and <italic>E&#x003bc;SR-tTA;Teto-MYC</italic> mice were obtained from Stuart Orkin (Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachussetts), Andreas Nagy (Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Toronto, Canada) and Dean W.
