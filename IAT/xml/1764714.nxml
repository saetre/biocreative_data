Promoter of <italic>p16</italic><sup>INK4a</sup> gene contains at least five putative GC boxes, named GC-I to V, respectively. Our previous data showed that a potential Sp1 binding site, within the promoter region from &#x02212;466 to &#x02212;451, acts as a positive transcription regulatory element. These results led us to examine how Sp1 and/or Sp3 act on these GC boxes during aging in cultured human diploid fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Mutagenesis studies revealed that GC-I, II and IV, especially GC-II, are essential for <italic>p16</italic><sup>INK4a</sup> gene expression in senescent cells.

Consistent with the results of EMSA, ChIP assays showed that Sp1/Sp3 indeed bound to <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> promoter in vivo and the binding activity in senescent cells was higher than in that of young cells by nearly 5 folds (Sp1) and 3.5 folds (Sp3) respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000164-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000164-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Sp1 induces <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> promoter activation and both Sp1 binding and basal level of Sp1 are critical to the expression of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic></title><p>To analyze the effect of Sp1 and Sp3 on <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> promoter, Sp1 and/or Sp3 expression vectors were co-transfected with pGL3-620 into young or senescent 2BS cells.

As expected, the <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> promoter activity was inhibited by MTR in a dose-dependent manner in both young (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000164-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>) and senescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000164-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) 2BS cells.

To investigate the role of Sp1 specifically, Sp1 was knocked-down by RNAi to further confirm Sp1 binding to GC boxes is essential for the transcription of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000164-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>).

To elucidate this confusing problem, western analyses were performed using nuclear proteins from young and senescent 2BS cells. The results showed that the quantity of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins does not increase in the senescent cells. In another words, it contains the same amount of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins as that of young cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000164-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Combined with the results observed in EMSA and ChIP assays, we thus conclude that the increased binding must be due to the increase of Sp1 DNA binding affinity, which in turn lead to the higher expression of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> in senescent cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Sp1 increases SA-&#x003b2;-Gal activity whereas si-Sp1 expression inhibits SA-&#x003b2;-Gal activity</title><p>SA-&#x003b2;&#x02013;galactosidase staining is a common marker for cellular senescence. Usually, the &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity increases with the cell PD(population doubling) accumulating. The biological effect of over-expression (by Sp1 expression plasmid transfection) or knockdown (by RNAi approach) of Sp1 in 2BS cells were further evaluated by this method. The results showed that Sp1-overexpressed cells were strongly stained blue versus the control. However, there were only a few dispersed cells that were SA-&#x003b2;-Gal-stained in the Sp1 knocked-down cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000164-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). All these outcomes manifested that RNAi-mediated silencing of Sp1 gene could delay senescence accompanied with decreased <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> levels, however, over-expression of Sp1 could increase the <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> expression and finally accelerate the onset of senescence of 2BS cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic>, a tumor suppressor gene that inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and cyclin-dependent kinase 6, has also been implicated in the mechanisms underlying replicative senescence. Many transcription factors are involved in transcriptional regulation via the corresponding elements distributed in the promoter region of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic>. What should be emphasized is that the character of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> promoter is GC-rich rather than the common element such as TATA box. In addition, GC-rich boxes represent putative target sites for binding of Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000164-Pagliuca1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, we established the importance of transcription factor Sp1 on the regulation of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> gene expression from the different aspects and different strategies during aging in human embryonic lung fibroblasts, 2BS cells. Among the five GC boxes within the region of 620 bp upstream of the translation start site, the contribution of these five elements to <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> transcription is not equal, GC-I, II and IV is more important rather than GC-III and V by mutagenesis analyses, especially GC-II is the most crucial element to the <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> promoter activity, since its mutation abolished <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> gene transcription in senescent cells. What's more, the effect on the promoter activity in senescent cells is more significant than in young cells. All results mentioned above suggested that GC boxes are more instrumental to <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> gene expression coupled with aging process and it is the first time to investigate the roles of GC-boxes distributed in <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> promoter and the relationship between these elements and transcription activity of the target gene meticulously and systemically during aging.</p><p>Protein binding studies identified Sp1 and Sp3 as the major components of the complexes formed between the nuclear extracts and the oligos containing GC box. Although we cannot preclude involvement of other factors, the Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies blocked each of the specific complexes in vivo and in vitro. Sp1 is a widely studied transcription factor that can bind to and act through the GC boxes. Although it is generally believed that Sp1 is ubiquitously expressed, Sp1 gene expression can show up to 100-fold differences in different cell types and at different stages of development in mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000164-Saffer1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. While Sp3 is found to be highly homologous to Sp1 with similar affinities for GC and GT boxes, there are some striking functional differences between them. In some cell lines, it can activate transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000164-Ding1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. However, under other circumstances Sp3 is only weakly active, and in some cases, Sp3 can repress transcription driven by Sp1 or other transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000164-Galvagni1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. To investigate the transcription activities of Sp1 and/or Sp3 on <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> promoter, we co-transfected Sp1 and/or Sp3 expression vectors with pGL3-620 into young and senescent 2BS cells and performed the luciferase assays. The results showed that Sp1 induced the <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> promoter activity, while Sp3 had little effect. The induction of promoter activity was not as potent as we would expect, which might be due to the high levels of endogenous Sp1 expression and the lower transfection efficiencies of 2BS cells (The same experiments in HeLa cells showed the more evident change, data was not shown). To further prove the effect of Sp1 on <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> expression, two strategies in different way were used: MTR, an inhibitor of Sp1/Sp3 binding, and siRNA, the inhibitor of Sp1 expression. The results which reduced the <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> promoter activity and its expression both in mRNA level and protein level suggest again that Sp1 is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> gene expression in 2BS cells.</p><p>It has been documented that the expression of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> increased in senescent human fibroblast cells owing to the regulation of various of transcription factors in previous and our former work , such as E47, Id1, Jun B and RREB etc.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000164-Duan1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000164-Alcorta1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000164-Ohtani1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000164-Zheng1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, both EMSA and ChIP assays showed that senescent cell nuclear extracts contained higher Sp1/Sp3 binding activities to the <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> promoter. Taken together the results that mutation of GC boxes had more detrimental effect on the <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> promoter in senescent cells and knock-down of Sp1 by siRNA down-regulate the expression of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic>, we postulate that Sp1 transcriptional activity, including the binding activity to the GC boxes of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> promoter, is enhanced in senescent cells, which in turn plays a role in the elevated <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> gene expression during senescence. It is applied a reasonable interpretation for the observation of much more potent promoter activities for <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> in senescent cells.</p><p>In addition, though Sp1 is considered to be a constitutive transcription factor, Sp1 protein levels can vary significantly in different tissues. To test whether increased Sp1 binding is a result of induced Sp1 expression in senescent cells, we performed Western analyses. The results showed that the protein levels of Sp1 and Sp3 did not change significantly between young and senescent 2BS cells. So the increased binding observed in the senescent cells is likely the result of the augmentation of Sp1 and/or Sp3 binding affinity. On the other hand, the result of RNAi transfection demonstrated that although it need not increase Sp1 expression, however, a basal level is necessary for <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> expression. Once it is lower than certain level, the expression of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> is also weakened.</p><p>The alteration of Sp1 activity during senescence may result from different post-translational modification or transcriptional co-factor. The two major types of modification that are thought to be involved in transcription regulation by Sp1 are glycosylation and phosphorylation. O-glycosylation of Sp1 with N-acetylglucosamine has been linked to multiple changes in Sp1 function, including altered self-association, altered interaction with basal transcription factors and modulation of its degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000164-Roos1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000164-Han1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, but not its DNA binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000164-Jackson1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, while phosphorylation has been found to either decrease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000164-Armstrong1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> or increase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000164-Rafty1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> the DNA binding activity. Finally, earlier studies have shown that histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) binds to Sp1 and represses its transcription activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000164-Doetzlhofer1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Sp1 may serve as a scaffold to recruit HDAC to the promoter, which causes chromatin condensation leading to transcription repression. Since the level of HDAC1 has been found to decrease significantly in senescent human fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000164-Wagner1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, which may result in the release of Sp1, we postulate that more active Sp1 would be available for transcription activation.</p><p>All in all, among the multitudinous transcription factors, Sp1 is also an important and essential member for the transcription and expression of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic>, whereas, in another aspect, GC box distributed in the promoter of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic>, especially GC- II is also the key element for both the expression of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> and binding with Sp1. Only both of them interact properly, do the gene expression and cell physiology act in the normal program.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Robert Tjian, Dr Guntram Suske and Dr Yongfeng Shang for providing the vectors.
