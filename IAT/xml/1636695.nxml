Since such genes influence many important complex traits in various organisms, the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) is of major interest, but still encounters serious difficulties. We detected four linked genes within one QTL, which participate in controlling sporulation efficiency in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic> Following the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms by comparing the sequences of 145 genes between the parental strains SK1 and S288c, we analyzed the segregating progeny of the cross between them. Through reciprocal hemizygosity analysis, four genes, <italic>RAS2, PMS1, SWS2,</italic> and <italic>FKH2,</italic> located in a region of 60 kilobases on Chromosome 14, were found to be associated with sporulation efficiency. Three of the four &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; sporulation alleles are derived from the &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; sporulating strain. Two of these sporulation-related genes were verified through allele replacements.

To identify QTLs responsible for such a quantitative trait, the authors employed a two-step strategy: First, single-nucleotide markers (called SNPs) distributed throughout the genome were screened for prevalence among progeny with extreme characteristics, thus identifying three candidate genomic regions. Next, in one of these regions, manipulation of individual genes revealed four tightly linked genes that affected the trait, sporulation efficiency. A fifth gene that affects sporulation was recently and independently identified in the same region. This 60-kilobase region has a complex and interesting architecture: One strain, which sporulates efficiently, has sporulation-promoting alleles (alternative forms) at two major genes and inhibiting alleles at the three less important ones, whereas another strain, with inefficient sporulation, has the opposite alleles at the five genes. Moreover, one causative SNP for this trait, in the promoter region of the gene <italic>RAS2,</italic> explains sporulation differences among a set of ten winery yeast strains. These results provide a detailed view of genetic complexity in one &#x0201c;QTL region&#x0201d; and an SNP-trait association example among wild strains.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Ben-Ari G, Zenvirth D, Sherman A, David L, Klutstein M, et al.

Assessment of sporulation efficiency in the budding yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> is based on evaluating the number of cells (within the same clonal genotype) that undergo the sporulation process. It is not clear what the factors are causing one cell to complete the sporulation process, while other, genetically identical cells of the same colony are arrested and do not complete the process. Furthermore, it is not always clear at which stage the cells are arrested. However, multiple measurements of sporulation efficiency on cell populations of the same genotype result in similar values. Therefore, the assumption is that in addition to environmental effects, sporulation efficiency is controlled by genetic factors and could serve as a model for analysis of quantitative traits, as has recently been demonstrated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Analysis of pools made of equal amounts of DNA from several individuals saves on time and reduces the cost of large-scale genotyping projects.

Our approach to detect QTLs in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> was based on identification of genomic regions with significant differences in allele (SNP) frequencies between DNA pools of phenotypically similar segregants, followed by genetic manipulation of candidate genes therein. We thus identified four genes that are involved in the sporulation process and account for the differences in sporulation efficiency between the two laboratory strains. Moreover, we found that the QTL region contains alleles of opposing effects. We also identified one causative SNP in the promoter of the gene <italic>RAS2,</italic> which could explain sporulation variability among a set of ten closely related winery yeast strains.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Through sequencing of 81,480 base pairs (bp) in 145 genes from the SK1 genome, we discovered 554 SNPs that distinguish between SK1 and S288c. Of these genes, which were distributed throughout the genome (except for the smallest Chromosome 1), 132 had at least one SNP, and 46 had non-synonymous SNPs. The genes sequenced were known to be related to sporulation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020195-st001">Table S1</xref>). For the purpose of the initial scan for polymorphisms, however, any collection of random SNPs distributed over the genome would have served us equally well.</p><p>Segregating progeny of the cross between the strains SK1 (sporulation efficiency 92&#x00025; &#x000b1; 5.2&#x00025;) and S288c (sporulation efficiency 12&#x00025; &#x000b1; 1.9&#x00025;) were used to identify QTLs that are responsible for differences in sporulation efficiency between these two strains. The 326 diploid segregants generated through meiosis of the hybrids S288c &#x000d7; SK1 (sporulation efficiency 75&#x00025; &#x000b1; 2.8&#x00025;) varied between 1&#x00025; and 97.5&#x00025; in sporulation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g001">Figure 1</xref>), as determined after 7 d on sporulation plates.</p><p>DNA pools of 21 segregants from each &#x0201c;tail&#x0201d; of the sporulation efficiency distribution were used to evaluate the frequency of SNP alleles (&#x0201c;high&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; pools in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>To verify the reliability of sequencing DNA pools, a preliminary reconstruction experiment was performed as follows: DNA of the strains SK1 and S288c were pooled at various ratios and a short genomic region containing a known SNP in the gene <italic>SPS18</italic> was sequenced. The two alleles could clearly be distinguished in pools with allele ratios of 8:2 and 9:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The height of the sequencing peak was found to be a good estimator for the allele frequency (correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.99, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).</p><p>For each of the 132 genes that contained SNPs distinguishing between SK1 and S288c, one polymorphic DNA fragment was sequenced in the two DNA pools, and allele frequencies were compared between them. With this rough coverage of the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020195-st001">Table S1</xref>), only <italic>YNL100W</italic> and <italic>RAS2,</italic> which are located 3 kilobases (kb) apart on Chromosome 14, differed in allele frequencies between the two pools. In both genes, the S288c allele was the frequent allele in the &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; pool and the SK1 allele was the frequent allele in the &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The probability of finding at random two genes (out of 132) with such differences in allele frequencies between the two DNA pools is rather low even after the stringent Bonferroni correction for multiple tests (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.014).</p><p>A genome-wide discovery of SNPs, based on hybridization of genomic DNA to Affymetrix S98 yeast microarrays &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; was carried out using these two DNA pools. We compared probe intensities between five SK1 DNA hybridizations and five S288c hybridizations. As a result, we identified ~4,000 probes containing polymorphisms between these parental strains. Both the &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; and the &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; DNA pools were then hybridized to microarrays to identify differences in frequency of SNP's alleles. We detected three candidate regions, on Chromosomes 2, 7, and 14, each larger than 50 kb (with at least 20 differentiating SNPs). The SK1 allele was highly frequent in the &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; pool and the S288c allele in the &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The region detected on Chromosome 14 contained the genes <italic>RAS2</italic> and <italic>YNL100W,</italic> also detected by sequencing of the DNA pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Allele frequencies were verified by individual sequencing of the gene <italic>RAS2</italic> in 12 progeny from each pool. All 12 individuals from the &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; pool had the SK1 allele, whereas 11 out of 12 individuals from the &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; pool had the S288c allele. Based on further sequencing of the two DNA pools at 25-kb intervals flanking <italic>RAS2</italic> on both sides of the gene, the boundaries of this &#x0201c;candidate region&#x0201d; were determined to be 75 kb downstream and 100 kb upstream to <italic>RAS2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g002">Figures 2</xref> and S1). Following its identification by the genome-wide screen and by the individual SNP approach, this &#x0201c;candidate region&#x0201d; on Chromosome 14, which contains about 100 genes, was further studied in more detail.</p><p>Based on gene annotation and expression profile during meiosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;, we chose 12 genes in this region that might be involved in sporulation/meiosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020195-st002">Table S2</xref>). For each of the 12 candidates, we examined the possible contribution to the sporulation difference between the strains SK1 and S288c, by single reciprocal hemizygosity analysis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The analysis is based on a phenotypic comparison between two hybrid strains, hemizygotic for either the SK1 or S288c allele in the gene of interest, but otherwise identical. Hemizygosity was achieved by deletion of the &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; allele (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the assessment of sporulation phenotypes of the original segregants, for all reciprocal-hemizygosity and allele-replacement tests we determined sporulation efficiency after 48 h in liquid sporulation medium. Significant differences in sporulation efficiencies (10&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025;) were detected between reciprocal hemizygosity strains of four genes: <italic>FKH2, PMS1, RAS2,</italic> and <italic>SWS2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Counterintuitive to the phenotype of strain S288c (low sporulation efficiency), the presence of the sole S288c allele for each of the genes <italic>FKH2, PMS1,</italic> or <italic>RAS2</italic> resulted in higher sporulation efficiency compared to the presence of the single SK1 allele (in the same hybrid background). Only for the gene <italic>SWS2,</italic> the SK1 allele resulted in higher sporulation.

Deutschbauer and Davis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d; have recently mapped three genes controlling sporulation efficiency differences between S288c and SK1. They used segregants of backcross and DNA hybridizations to Affymetrix chips to do a linkage analysis that identified candidate regions on Chromosomes 7, 9, and 14. By reciprocal hemizygosity analysis of the genes in these three regions, they identified five genes with differences in sporulation between reciprocal hemizygous strains. These genes were further analyzed by allele replacement and site-directed mutagenesis. The genes <italic>RME1, TAO3,</italic> and <italic>MKT1</italic> are located on Chromosomes 7, 9, and 14, respectively, and were found to contribute to sporulation efficiency differences between the strains S288c and SK1.</p><p>The approach we took to identify sporulation QTLs combines a genome scan to identify inheritance bias in SNP alleles between phenotypically different DNA pools with reciprocal hemizygosity analysis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d; of individual candidate genes in the QTL region. DNA pools of 21 F<sub>2</sub> segregants from each of the two tails of the sporulation efficiency distribution were sequenced at SNPs in 132 genes distributed over the genome. This step resulted in a definition of a &#x0201c;candidate region&#x0201d; on Chromosome 14, which was found to be strongly associated with differences in sporulation efficiency. In addition, this &#x0201c;candidate region&#x0201d; was confirmed in a genome-wide screen based on hybridizations of the DNA pools to Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays. The hybridization of pools yielded two additional regions that we did not follow up on, of which one on Chromosome 7 overlaps the <italic>RME1</italic> gene that Deutschbauer and Davis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d; identified. Thus, the use of DNA pools reduced costs significantly and was useful to the preliminary identification of QTL regions. However, using DNA pools, we did not identify the region on Chromosome 9 that was detected by Deutschbauer and Davis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We have further analyzed 12 candidate genes in the Chromosome 14 QTL region by reciprocal hemizygosity analysis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, and found four in which S288c alleles contributed differently to sporulation efficiency than SK1 alleles. Interestingly, the four genes that we identified were not included among the previously identified sporulation QTLs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.

Combining the results of the two studies, the cluster on Chromosome 14 that controls sporulation contains five linked genes in a region of less than 60 kb. Strain SK1 has alleles with strong sporulation-promoting effects in the genes <italic>SWS2</italic> and <italic>MKT1</italic> and sporulation-reducing alleles in the genes <italic>FKH2, PMS1,</italic> and <italic>RAS2,</italic> whereas strain S288c has alleles of opposite effects in these five genes.</p><p>High genetic complexity of QTLs in the form of genomic clustering of genes that contribute to the same phenotype was reported previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b028">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, and here we identified four such genes that confer both promoting and inhibiting effects on the trait. Counterintuitively, however, the presence of the S288c alleles of the genes <italic>FKH2, PMS1,</italic> or <italic>RAS2</italic> resulted in higher sporulation efficiency compared to the presence of the corresponding SK1 alleles. In the gene <italic>SWS2,</italic> the SK1 allele resulted in higher sporulation efficiency than the S288c allele. The gene <italic>SWS2</italic> has a major contribution to the difference between the two parental strains, as demonstrated by the efficient sporulation (~50&#x00025;, determined after 48 h in liquid sporulation medium) of the S288c strain in which the two <italic>SWS2</italic> alleles were replaced by the corresponding alleles from the strain SK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g004">Figure 4</xref>D)<italic>. MKT1,</italic> the other gene with SK1 promoting allele in this region seems to have a milder effect on sporulation efficiency (about 15&#x00025; sporulation, determined also after 48 h in liquid sporulation medium &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;). The net effect of these five linked genes, perhaps together with additional, yet undiscovered linked genes, is that this region confers high sporulation efficiency on the progeny that inherit it from parental strain SK1 (see hybridization of the &#x0201c;tail pools&#x0201d; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>To make the genetic architecture even more complex, <italic>SWS2</italic> and <italic>PMS1</italic> are two adjacent genes coded on opposite strands and thus share a short, common 3&#x02032; region. Could the effects of the adjacent genes be due to a single difference between the parental strains? Sporulation efficiency differences between reciprocal hemizygous strains increased from 20&#x00025; when each gene was singly deleted, to 40&#x00025; in the double-deletion reciprocal hemizygosity test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These results, together with their contribution in trans (i.e., strain SK1 has the sporulation-promoting allele in the gene <italic>SWS2</italic> and the sporulation-inhibiting allele in <italic>PMS1</italic>), suggest that <italic>SWS2</italic> and <italic>PMS1</italic> have distinct effects on the phenotype. It should be noted that in a recent study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>PMS1-MLH1</italic> combinations from S288c and SK1 were found to cause defects in mismatch repair, with the causative SNP in <italic>PMS1</italic> being the SK1 allele R818K (G2453A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020195-st003">Table S3</xref>). The same mutation might be the sporulation-inhibiting SNP allele of SK1 in <italic>PMS1</italic>.</p><p>We also noticed a difference in the shape of the sporulation efficiency distribution among progeny of the cross SK1 &#x000d7; S288c between the study of Deutschbauer and Davis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d; and ours. Whereas we obtained a predominance of progeny with relatively high sporulation, like SK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g001">Figure 1</xref>), they report more progeny that resembles S288c. A possible explanation for this difference is that in our study sporulation frequency was measured after 7 d on sporulation plates, whereas their data were obtained after 24 h in liquid sporulation medium. In any case, this difference in the phenotypic distribution suggests that the genes identified by both studies may contribute at different stages and in different ways to the kinetics of the sporulation process.</p><p>It appears that in the hybrid background, the S288c alleles of all four genes are dominant over the SK1 alleles with respect to sporulation, as each hemizygous strain, when deleted for the SK1 allele, showed a phenotype similar to the non-deleted hybrid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). In addition, all hemizygous strains having only the SK1 allele of <italic>SWS2</italic> (single-, double-, and four-gene mutants) sporulated at similar high efficiencies, higher than the non-deleted hybrid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g004">4</xref>B). This suggests that at least in the hybrid background, <italic>SWS2</italic> masks the effects of the other three genes and that the S288c allele of <italic>SWS2</italic> inhibits sporulation. To test this phenomenon more thoroughly, sporulation efficiency of isogenic S288c strain with SK1 alleles of two, three, and all four genes should be determined. The differences in sporulation efficiencies between the two alleles of <italic>SWS2,</italic> as well as between the alleles of <italic>RAS2,</italic> however, are similar in both the heterozygous hybrid genetic background (reciprocal hemizygosities, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) and the S288c homozygous background (gene replacements, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g004">Figure 4</xref>D).</p><p>In the case of <italic>RAS2,</italic> where the SK1 allele had an inhibiting effect on sporulation efficiency, our results suggest that an insertion of one additional adenine to a stretch of nine others in the promoter region decreases sporulation efficiency. The mechanism by which this change exerts its effect is not clear since the expression levels of both the RNA and protein did not differ between the reciprocal hemizygous strains throughout the sporulation process.</p><p>Other QTL studies failed to find marker-trait association in wild strains &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. In the present study, the deletion of adenine in the poly-A stretch in the promoter region of <italic>RAS2</italic> distinguished the sporulation-proficient from the non-sporulating winery strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020195-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). It is reasonable to hypothesize that in this case the genetic similarity between these wild winery strains &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020195-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d; allowed the association between a DNA polymorphism and the phenotype. However, it is likely that this type of association in QTLs will be harder to find as genetic similarity drops. That the sporulation-proficient genome of strain SK1 carries the &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; sporulation alleles of <italic>RAS2, PMS1,</italic> and <italic>FKH2</italic> further emphasizes the caution required in using association-based methods to identify phenotypically relevant genetic variation.</p><p>Our results demonstrate the complexity of QTLs and have implications on similar studies in other organisms. Tight linkage between genes with alleles of opposite effects could result in difficulties to identify QTLs by linkage analysis where the net effect of alleles is low. Linked alleles of opposite effects can also reduce or &#x0201c;mask&#x0201d; variation estimates. One way to overcome such difficulties is to manipulate each gene in a suspected &#x0201c;candidate region&#x0201d; individually, and examine the phenotypic effects of such manipulations. This is more amenable in yeast, as was done here by analysis of reciprocal hemizygosity and allele replacements, and thus stresses the importance of this organism as a model for studying the genetics of complex traits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast strains.</title><p>The diploid strain SK1 was generated by mating two haploid strains having the SK1 background (NKY561 <italic>&#x0005b;MAT&#x003b1;; ho::hisG; ura3::hisG; lys2; leu2::hisG; trp1::hisG&#x0005d;</italic> and NKY1059 <italic>&#x0005b;MATa; ho::hisG; ura3::hisG; lys2; leu2::hisG; ade2; his4&#x0005d;,</italic> obtained from N.

The upper part shows reconstruction of mixtures of DNA of the strains SK1 and S288c, testing the ability to evaluate reliable allele frequencies of SNPs in DNA pools.
