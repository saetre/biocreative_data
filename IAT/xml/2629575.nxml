Particularly, the ON DS ganglion cells project their axons specifically to terminal nuclei of the accessory optic system (AOS) responsible for optokinetic reflex (OKR). We recently generated a knock-in mouse in which SPIG1 (SPARC-related protein containing immunoglobulin domains 1)-expressing cells are visualized with GFP, and found that retinal ganglion cells projecting to the medial terminal nucleus (MTN), the principal nucleus of the AOS, are comprised of SPIG1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and SPIG1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ganglion cells distributed in distinct mosaic patterns in the retina. Here we examined light responses of these two subtypes of MTN-projecting cells by targeted electrophysiological recordings. SPIG1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and SPIG1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ganglion cells respond preferentially to upward motion and downward motion, respectively, in the visual field. The direction selectivity of SPIG1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ganglion cells develops normally in dark-reared mice. The MTN neurons are activated by optokinetic stimuli only of the vertical motion as shown by Fos expression analysis. Combination of genetic labeling and conventional retrograde labeling revealed that axons of SPIG1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and SPIG1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ganglion cells project to the MTN via different pathways. The axon terminals of the two subtypes are organized into discrete clusters in the MTN. These results suggest that information about upward and downward image motion transmitted by distinct ON DS cells is separately processed in the MTN, if not independently. Our findings provide insights into the neural mechanisms of OKR, how information about the direction of image motion is deciphered by the AOS.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Visual information is segregated into modalities such as color, form, and motion at the level of the retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Livingstone1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

ON DS cells respond to bright objects moving at slow speeds, whereas ON-OFF DS cells respond to both bright and dark objects moving over a broad range of speeds.

Identification of molecular markers for a single physiological subtype of DS cells would be useful to study its developmental mechanism.</p><p>The accessory optic system (AOS) nuclei are suggested to be the first post-retinal relay station in the pathway mediating the vertical and horizontal optokinetic reflex (OKR), a class of compensatory eye movements that serve the functional purpose of stabilizing images on the retina during self-motion and/or motion of the visual surround <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Simpson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the extent to which ON DS cells and ON-OFF DS cells contribute to the OKR respectively is largely unknown. Thus, the AOS provides a unique opportunity to examine the correlation between the activity of single retinal ganglion cell type and a well characterized animal behavior.</p><p>In most mammalian species, the AOS consists of two sets of optic fibers, the inferior fasciculus of the accessory optic tract (AOT-IF) and superior fasciculus of the AOT (AOT-SF); and three terminal nuclei, medial terminal nucleus (MTN), lateral terminal nucleus (LTN), and dorsal terminal nucleus (DTN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Hayhow1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

Surface of the cerebral peduncle was injected with 1&#x00025; DiI (Invitrogen) in dimethylformamide to retrogradely label the ganglion cells that project to the MTN via AOT-SF. DiI is taken into neurons from axonal tract, while CTB is taken up only from synaptic terminals. Twenty-four h (for postnatal day (P) 5 mice) or 48 h (for P10 mice) after the injection, mice were perfused with 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde.

Then, the retina was transferred gently to a recording chamber with the vitreal surface upward, and continuously superfused at 32&#x000b0;C with bicarbonate-buffered Ames solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) which was bubbled with 95&#x00025; O<sub>2</sub> and 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Extracellular recordings were obtained using a tungsten electrode (impedance, 4&#x02013;7 M&#x003a9;) attached to an isolated AC differential amplifier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Ackert1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> (DAM80i; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Spike discharges were recorded from GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ganglion cells and CTB-labeled GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ganglion cells in the mid-peripheral region of the ventronasal retina. At first, we localized fluorescently labeled cells on fluorescence microscopy with a brief excitation (&#x0223c;5 s) to minimize photobleaching. Then the identified cells and tungsten electrodes were visualized using infrared-differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) optics and displayed on a video monitor coupled to a cooled-CCD camera (DP30W; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) mounted on the microscope. It should be noted that the tungsten electrode effectively recorded activity from cells only when placed directly atop their somata.

The luminance of the adaptation level was kept at 77.3 lx throughout the experiments. ON-sustained spike discharges were recorded from the fluorescently labeled ganglion cells in response to full-field diffuse light stimuli (intensity, 146.9 lx; duration, 5 s). Next, motion stimuli that traversed the receptive field in eight different directions was applied to examine direction-selective responses of the targeted ganglion cells: a drift of square-wave gratings; mean luminance, 77.3 lx; the Michelson contrast, 0.9; bright/dark duty cycle, 1&#x02236;1; each width, 300 &#x000b5;m on the retina; drifting speed, 10&#x000b0; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the visual angle (300 &#x000b5;m s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> on the retina); duration, 6 s. The number of spikes obtained over a sweep of the gratings in one direction was taken as the response amplitude for the given direction. From experiments with eight directions, the preferred direction was computed as the angle of the vector sum in a polar plot of responses. Next we calculated a direction selective index (DSI) as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Kim1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

In brief, retinal whole mounts taken from P12 mice were fixed in 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min. For targeting GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MTN-P cells, the retrograde tracer CTB-Alexa 647 was injected into the MTN two days before the fixation. Sharp microelectrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). The resistance of the pipette was 30&#x02013;50 M&#x003a9;, when measured with 1 M KCl. The electrode was filled with 1&#x00025; DiI in 100&#x00025; ethanol.

After the injection, the retinas were kept in 0.4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature overnight for the efficient diffusion of dye into the fine dendrites and axons. The filled cells were photographed under a confocal microscope (LSM510). The overall morphology of the filled cells was assessed by using a 20&#x000d7; lens, 0.5 NA. The stratification level of the cell was analyzed using image stacks acquired with a 63&#x000d7; oil immersion lens, 1.4 NA, at the edges of the dendritic trees, and by measuring the intensity profiles of the DiI-labeled signal along the depth of the retina. The peaks in these profiles were used to define the stratification level of the injected cell within the inner plexiform layer (IPL).

Here we show that the each mosaic population corresponds to a physiological subtype of ON DS cells with distinct preferred direction, upward or downward. It has been shown that ON-OFF DS cells are organized in four overlaid tilings, each tiling consisting of like-type cells that respond to a particular direction and that closely spaced pairs of the DS cell somata comprise different subtypes of DS cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Vaney3">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Amthor1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it may be possible to say that overlaid mosaics of DS cells with different preferred directions are a general feature of the organization for information outflow from the retina to the brain. However, when compared to ON-OFF DS cells, the dendritic tiling of ON DS cells is less precise. Retinal coverage factor for each subtype of MTN-P cells at P12 is on the order of 3.0, when it was calculated from the dendritic field area of DiI-filled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004320-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) and the density of these cells in the pan-ventronasal domain. On the other hand, estimated coverage factor for each functional subtype of ON-OFF DS cells is reportedly on the order of 1.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Amthor2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Oyster5">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. The marked difference in the coverage factor between two DSGC types may reflect differences in the structure of retinal circuitry underlying the direction selectivity.</p><p>In contrast to the direction selectivity in the visual cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Li1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, the direction selectivity in the retina has been thought to be established without visual stimulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Daw1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Masland2">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, it is not clear whether preferred direction of each DS cell is completely specified independent of retinal activity. Our results indicate that the preferred direction for SPIG1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ganglion cells, one of the ON type DS cells, is specified as upward-preferring independently of visual experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004320-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). The strength of direction selectivity of SPIG1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> subtype was not affected by the dark-rearing before eye-opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004320-g002">Figure 2F</xref>), along with the dendritic morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004320-g003">Figure 3B, C</xref>). Very recently, similar results were reported for ON-OFF DS cells in rabbits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Chan1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. These results altogether support a view that the establishment of direction selectivity is not dependent on visual experience.

The MTN begins to be innervated by GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> axons at E17.5. SPIG1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and SPIG1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ganglion cells projecting to the MTN form distinct regular mosaics as early as P1. The two subtypes of ON DS cells are inclined to reside as pairs in the retina, suggesting an interdependency in the cellular differentiation during development. The existence of segregated central projection of two ON DS cell subtypes suggests that each subtype express distinct guidance molecules at an embryonic stage. Therefore, it is likely that SPIG1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and SPIG1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MTN-P cells are genetically destined for each subtype that responds to upward and downward motion, respectively, already at the onset of central projection. Such an early divergence of subtypes might be controlled by morphogen signals and transcription factors which are asymmetrically expressed in the developing retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Yuasa1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Peters1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. Intriguingly, the preferred direction of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ganglion cells, namely SPIG1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ganglion cells, in the retina coincides with the direction in which GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> axon bundles from the dorsotemoral domain pointed toward the optic disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004320-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; tilted about 25&#x000b0; posteriorly from the dorso-ventral axis). It is also tempting to speculate that molecular gradients along retinal axes play a role in the establishment of spatially asymmetric connections between DS cells and starburst amacrine cells.</p><p>We here report a first demonstration of vertical OKR in rodents, although horizontal OKR in rodents has been analyzed by many research groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Iwashita1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Sinex1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Faulstich1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Mitchiner1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Stahl1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the gains of vertical OKR to upward and downward motion were similar and both of them were 0.39, suggesting that the asymmetry in the vertical OKR is likely related to saccadic mechanisms. Our results also indicate that retinal slip upon the visual motion stimulus constantly occurs during the stimulation period. This observation suggests that the retina actually keeps on receiving the visual stimulus moving only in one direction (upward or downward) during the stimulation period for Fos expression analysis. The speed of image motion in the retina is estimated to be 1.2&#x000b0;&#x02013;2&#x000b0;/s. Because the speed of resetting saccades is fast, ON DS cells should not be activated during the saccades.</p><p>The direction-selective responses in the mammalian AOS nuclei show species differences, which may reflect the differences in their lifestyles.

By analyzing the Fos expression, we first examined the direction selectivity of MTN neurons in the mice.

Temporal-to-nasal motion did not induce the Fos expression in the MTN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004320-g006">Figure 6C, D</xref>), indicating that the ON DS cell subtype which prefers temporal-to-nasal direction projects to the DTN, because neurons in this nucleus prefer temporal-to-nasal direction as reported in other species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Simpson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

By combining genetic labeling, retrograde labeling, and targeted electrophysiological recordings, here we provide direct evidence that axons of downward-preferring subtype of ON DS cells course through the AOT-SF and largely terminate in the MTNv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004320-g007">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004320-g005">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004320.s002">Figure S2</xref>), whereas axons of upward-preferring subtype of ON DS cells course through the AOT-IF and terminate in the MTNd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004320-g007">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004320.s001">Figure S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004320.s002">Figure S2</xref>). This was proposed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-vanderTogt1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> based on the following several observations in rats: First, neurons in the dorsomedial portion of the MTN are predominantly stimulated by upward movements and those in the ventrolateral portion of the MTN by downward movements. Second, a correlation was found between the segregation of direction-selective units and the areas in the MTN to which the retinal fibers from the two pathways distribute. In the present study, we also show that neurons in the MTNd are best activated by the upward motion and neurons in the ventrolateral part of the MTN are best activated by downward motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004320-g006">Figure 6</xref>), in mild agreement with the observation in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-vanderTogt1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Schmidt1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>. The lateral part of the MTNv may correspond to the interstitial nucleus in the posterior bundle of the superior fasciculus, which has been functionally characterized in the guinea pig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Benassi1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>. In the guinea pig, this nucleus was activated by the vertical visual motion, although it was activated equally by the upward and downward motion, when estimated by the uptake of <sup>14</sup>C-2-deoxyglucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Benassi1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>. The interstitial nucleus in the posterior bundle of the superior fasciculus is a sparse assemblage of neurons scattered throughout the course of the AOT-SF. In the present study, ventrolateral part of the MTNv, which is an entry zone for the fibers of AOT-SF into the MTN, was preferentially activated by the downward motion as shown by the Fos expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004320-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This also strongly supports our conclusion that the AOT-SF specifically conveys the information about downward visual motion. It is still an open question whether segregated projection and discrete clusters of axon terminals are also seen for ON-OFF DGSC subtypes.</p><fig id="pone-0004320-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004320.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of axonal connectivity between the retina and the contralateral MTN of the AOS.</title><p>Information of upward and downward visual motion is conveyed to the MTN by distinct neuronal pathways.

A, Upward-preferring subtype of ON DS cells (SPIG1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>; blue) predominantly projects to the MTNd via AOT-IF, whereas downward-preferring subtype of ON DS cells (SPIG1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>; orange) projects to the MTNv via AOT-SF. MTN-projecting cells in the dorsotemporal domain are all SPIG1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, but subdivided into two subtypes: one that courses through AOT-IF (blue) and the other AOT-SF (red). Most of the SPIG1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ganglion cells in the dorsotemporal domain (green) project to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and SC via optic tract (OT). The fibers of the AOT-SF split from the OT and the brachium of the SC, then they course ventrally over the surface of the cerebral peduncle (CP) and finally terminate in the MTNv. On the other hand, the fibers of the AOT-IF leave the OT just after passing through the optic chiasm (OC), then course caudally, and terminate in the MTNd. MGB, medial geniculate body.

This observation implies that the MTN-P cells in the dorsotemporal domain are also subdivided into two subtypes of ON DS cells, although not evenly. This view is supported by the finding that weak GFP signals are observed in the AOT-SF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004320.s002">Figure S2</xref>, A). By our MTN injection with CTB, approximately 10 GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ganglion cells were not labeled in the pan-ventronasal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004320-g005">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004320-t001">Table 1</xref>; please note that one GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CTB<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cell is present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004320-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This is attributable to the finding that some of the unlabeled cells projects to the ipsilateral MTN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Yonehara1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Results of the MTNd injection may suggest that one-fifth of the SPIG1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MTN-P cells that course through the AOT-SF terminates in the MTNd (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004320.s001">Figure S1</xref>, C, compare the number of GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells in the upper and lower drawings). This view is consistent with our observation that neurons in the upper half of the MTNd were significantly activated by the downward motion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004320-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, Downward, Upper MTNd). Alternatively, it is possible that the CTB injected into the MTNd was actually diffused into the MTNv, or that the segregation of axon terminals in the MTN was not completed at P6, a few days before ganglion cells make synapses with bipolar cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Sherry1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref>. We also found that dorsal part of the MTNv was activated by upward motion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004320-g006">Figure 6C, D</xref>; Upward, Dorsal MTNv). Because AOT fibers extending to the MTNd emit many terminal collaterals within the MTN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Iwahori1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>, it is assumable that axon terminals of upward-preferring subtype make synapses with neurons located at MTNv as well as at MTNd.</p><p>The MTN has several important connections to midbrain and brainstem structures to be involved in vertical OKR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Giolli3">&#x0005b;79&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably, MTN neurons send visual signals to the dorsal cap of inferior olive largely via the visual tegmental relay zone, which integrates upward and downward signals to produce bipartite receptive fields that respond best to rotation about an axis related to the vestibular semicircular canals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Simpson3">&#x0005b;80&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the structure of neural circuits that creates the bipartite receptive fields in the visual tegmental relay zone remains unknown.</p><p>Together with recent reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Kim1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004320-Huberman1">&#x0005b;81&#x0005d;</xref>, our study demonstrated that the genetic labeling of a specific subtype of retinal ganglion cell is a useful method for relating the mosaic spacing, dendritic morphology, and central projection of the subtype to its electrophysiology. Our characterization of ON DS cells may provide insights into how information about the direction of image motion is extracted in the retina, conveyed to the brain, and utilized for the production of the OKR in vertebrates. Especially, further studies will pave the way for our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanism underlying the formation of the direction-selective retinal circuitry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004320.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Projection sites of upward- and downward-preferring subtypes are segregated in the MTN.
