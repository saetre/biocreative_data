We tested the function of one protein&#x02013;protein interaction in the SSU processome, Mpp10p&#x02013;Imp4p, in ribosome biogenesis. Exploiting the reverse two-hybrid system, we screened for mutated Imp4 proteins that were conditionally defective for interaction with Mpp10p. Three different <italic>imp4</italic> sequences were isolated that: (i) conferred conditional growth in the two-hybrid strain; (ii) complemented the disrupted <italic>imp4</italic>; (iii) conferred conditional growth in the context of their normal cellular function; and (iv) resulted in defective pre-rRNA processing at the non-permissive temperatures. Domain swapping revealed that mutations that conferred cold sensitivity resided in the N-terminal coiled-coil domain while mutations in the C-terminus conferred temperature sensitivity. Surprisingly, the mutated Imp4 proteins were not measurably defective for interaction with Mpp10p in the context of the SSU processome. This suggests that other members of the complex may contribute to maintaining the Mpp10p&#x02013;Imp4p interaction in this large RNP. Since protein&#x02013;protein interactions are critical for many different aspects of cellular metabolism, our work has implications for the study of other large protein complexes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In eukaryotes, ribosome biogenesis requires the coordination of many different events, including rRNA transcription, pre-rRNA modification and processing, ribosomal protein production and rRNA&#x02013;ribosomal protein assembly. Pre-rRNA modification occurs early in ribosome biogenesis on the RNA polymerase I-transcribed nascent pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c1">1</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> this 35S rRNA bears three rRNAs (18S, 5.8S and 25S), which are subsequently released from their nascent transcripts by pre-rRNA cleavages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f1">1</xref>). The U3 snoRNA and its associated proteins form a large ribonucleoprotein (RNP), the SSU processome, which is required for the three cleavage events that mature the 18S rRNA (A0, A1 and A2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c3">3</xref>). The SSU processome is associated with the 35S and 23S pre-rRNAs, both of which retain the U3-dependent cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c4">4</xref>). U3 snoRNA&#x02013;pre-rRNA base pairing is required for cleavage, and this likely occurs in the context of the SSU processome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c6">6</xref>).</p><p>Mpp10p, Imp4p and Imp3p are three protein components of the SSU processome that are essential for its function. Mpp10p was originally discovered in a screen for human proteins that are phosphorylated during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c7">7</xref>). Mpp10p in both humans and yeast is specifically associated with the U3 snoRNA, and is required for pre-rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c9">9</xref>). Mpp10p bears multiple protein&#x02013;protein interaction domains (coiled-coil) and indeed has been found to interact with two proteins in a two-hybrid screen and <italic>in vivo</italic>, Imp3p and Imp4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c10">10</xref>). We have hypothesized that Imp3p contacts the U3 snoRNA directly via its ribosomal protein S4 RNA binding motif. Imp4 is the founding member of the Imp4 superfamily, and as such bears the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-like RNA binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c4">4</xref>). Like Mpp10p, both Imp3p and Imp4p are U3 snoRNA-associated and are required for pre-rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c10">10</xref>).</p><p>In a large RNP with 28&#x0002b; proteins like the SSU processome, it is likely that multiple protein&#x02013;protein interactions occur and that they are essential for SSU processome function. We tested the role of one of these protein&#x02013;protein interactions, Mpp10p&#x02013;Imp4p, in ribosome biogenesis. We used the reverse two-hybrid system approach to create conditionally Mpp10p interaction-defective mutated Imp4ps. Because an essential gene encodes Imp4p, we screened for the subset of Mpp10p interaction-defective mutated Imp4ps that also conferred growth at the permissive temperature. Three different mutated Imp4ps were obtained that were interaction defective in the two-hybrid screen and conferred growth at the permissive but not at the non-permissive temperatures. Surprisingly, when tested by co-immunoprecipitation, Mpp10p&#x02013;Imp4p interaction was not compromised at the non-permissive temperatures in the context of the SSU processome. However, pre-rRNA processing was defective at the non-permissive temperatures, indicating a function for particular domains of Imp4p in specific pre-rRNA cleavage steps.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids, strains and antibodies</title><p>To map the interacting portions of Mpp10p with Imp4p, <italic>MPP10</italic> and truncations of <italic>MPP10</italic> were cloned into the plasmid encoding the <italic>GAL4</italic> DNA binding domain (bait), pAS2-1. <italic>IMP4</italic> was cloned into the plasmid with the <italic>GAL4</italic> activation domain (prey), pACT-2.

The second construct (amino acids 1&#x02013;50) was generated by PCR with the appropriate oligonucleotides bearing NcoI and BamHI restriction sites and then cloned into pAS2-1 cut with the same enzymes.

Mutagenic PCR was carried out using reduced dNTP levels, MnCl<sub>2</sub> and an excess of <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase. The reaction conditions for the mutagenic PCR were: 1&#x000d7; Promega PCR buffer, 4.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4.95 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM dTTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.1 mM dATP, 0.1 mM dGTP, 2 ng of pGAD3::<italic>IMP4</italic> template, 4 ng of each BDIMP4 primer and 5 units of <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase (Roche) per 100 &#x000b5;l reaction.

To create the necessary strain, pJ69-4A cells were transformed with the <italic>MPP10</italic> plasmid cloned into pACT-2 (prey) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c10">10</xref>). The PCR products of 10 mutagenic reactions were gel purified and co-transformed with 25 &#x000b5;g of NcoI/PstI linearized pAS2-1plasmid (bait) into 12 ml of cells grown to 0.5 OD<sub>600</sub>. Because the mutagenic PCR product contains sequence homology to the gapped vector, it serves as a substrate for homologous recombination via DNA repair pathways (gapped-repair transformation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c14">14</xref>), creating a library of mutated <italic>imp4</italic> alleles. Transformants of the two-hybrid strain were grown at 30&#x000b0;C and selected on SD-Leu, Trp, His media, which selected for the <italic>GAL</italic> activating&#x02013;<italic>MPP10</italic> fusion plasmid (-Leu), the library of <italic>imp4</italic> mutations with the <italic>GAL</italic> DNA binding plasmid (-Trp) and activation of the histidine reporter gene. Transformants that could grow on this selective medium have repaired the gapped pAS2-1 plasmid with the PCR-mutagenized <italic>imp4</italic> gene. Also, to grow in SD-His medium at 30&#x000b0;C, the transformants must also have mutagenized <italic>imp4</italic> fusions proteins interacting with the Mpp10 fusion protein, thereby activating the histidine reporter gene. To screen for Imp4 proteins conditionally defective for Mpp10p interaction at 17 and 37&#x000b0;C, colonies were picked and their growth tested. Colonies that grew on SD-His at 30&#x000b0;C but not at 17 or 37&#x000b0;C were considered to be candidates for possessing an interaction-defective mutated Imp4p. The pAS2-1 <italic>imp4</italic> plasmids from these colonies were recovered by electroporation of total yeast DNA isolated by HIRT lysates of these strains into an <italic>E.coli</italic> strain auxotropic for tryptophan, JA300. On M9 media lacking tryptophan, only transformants with the pAS2-1 plasmid grow. These colonies were then replica plated on carbenicillin plates to eliminate false positives. The pAS2-1-<italic>imp4</italic> plasmids recovered from <italic>E.coli</italic> were transformed back into the starting strain (pJ69-4A containing pACT-2-<italic>MPP10</italic>) and re-screened to confirm the plasmid dependence of the observed conditional growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Complementation of &#x00394;<italic>imp4</italic> (null allele) by mutated <italic>imp4</italic> alleles</title><p>To determine whether the candidate interaction-defective Imp4 proteins maintained their conditional growth defect outside the context of the two-hybrid system, the following tests were performed. Because <italic>IMP4</italic> is an essential gene, the mutated Imp4 proteins were tested for their ability to support growth. The pAS2-1-<italic>imp4</italic> plasmids recovered above were amplified by PCR with 5&#x02032; pAS2-1.SpeI primer (5&#x02032;-GCT TTG ACT <underline>AGT ATG</underline> GCC ATG GAG-3&#x02032;) and 3&#x02032; pAS2-1.PstI primer (5&#x02032;-CGG AAT TAG CTT GG<underline>C TGC AG</underline>G-3&#x02032;). These primers anneal to the vector sequence, amplifying only the <italic>imp4</italic> coding region. Using the designated restriction sites, the mutated <italic>imp4</italic> genes were cloned into p415GPD, a constitutive expression vector with <italic>LEU2</italic> marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c15">15</xref>). The plasmids were transformed into the <italic>pGAL1::IMP4</italic> (&#x00394;<italic>imp4::HIS3</italic>) strain carrying a wild-type copy of <italic>IMP4</italic> on pGAD3, a <italic>URA3</italic> plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c10">10</xref>). The pGAD3 plasmid was shuffled out on 5-FOA, which selects against the uracil prototrophs. The strains were re-grown on SC-Leu and SC-Ura plates to confirm the presence of only the p415GPD plasmid. Strains that did not grow after plasmid shuffling were interpreted as bearing a non-complementing <italic>imp4</italic> allele.

To pinpoint the interacting domains of Mpp10p with Imp4p and of Imp4p with Mpp10p, a series of truncations of each were generated and tested with the other in the two-hybrid assay.</p><p>The Mpp10 protein possesses a number of coiled-coil domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f2">2</xref>A), known to be protein&#x02013;protein interaction domains, and it was likely that one such domain would be required for interaction with Imp4p. The original two-hybrid screen with Mpp10p, which identified Imp3p and Imp4p as interacting proteins, was carried out with an Mpp10p truncated at its C-terminus (amino acids 1&#x02013;498), thus missing one coiled-coil domain, because the full-length Mpp10p autoactivated in the beta galactosidase assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c10">10</xref>). A series of Mpp10p truncations was made from both the N- and C-termini, and tested for interaction with Imp4p in the two-hybrid assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f2">2</xref>A). Truncations from the C-terminus indicated that the Mpp10p fragment of only amino acids 1&#x02013;350 began to display reduced Imp4p interaction, and that interaction was abolished by truncation of 50 more amino acids from the C-terminus. Similarly, an Mpp10p fragment representing amino acids 350 to the C-terminus did interact with Mpp10p, while an Mpp10p fragment representing amino acids 400 to the end did not. This suggests that, surprisingly, Mpp10p amino acids 350&#x02013;400, which do not encompass a predicted coiled-coil domain, are necessary for Imp4 interaction.</p><p>A similar analysis was carried out on the sequences in Imp4p necessary for interaction with Mpp10p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f2">2</xref>B). The predicted secondary structure of Imp4p contains a single N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal domain, which contains an RNA binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c4">4</xref>). Neither the Imp4p bearing only the predicted coiled-coil domain (amino acids 1&#x02013;50) nor the Imp4p minus the predicted coiled-coil domain (amino acids 50 to C-terminus) interacted with Mpp10p in the two-hybrid assay. Thus, neither domain of Imp4p alone is sufficient for Mpp10p interaction.</p><p>We used a genetic approach to probe the function of the Imp4p&#x02013;Mpp10p interaction <italic>in vivo</italic> in the context of the normal cellular function of these two proteins. In order to study the effect of the lack of Mpp10&#x02013;Imp4 protein interaction on cell growth and ribosome biogenesis, we generated mutations in Imp4p that cause a conditional defect in Mpp10p association. We used the two-hybrid system to generate the Mpp10p interaction-defective Imp4 proteins, and then verified that they functioned in yeast and maintained their ability to confer conditional growth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f3">3</xref>).</p><p>The two-hybrid strain, pJ69-4A, was transformed with pACT-2-<italic>MPP10</italic>, which expresses Mpp10p fused to the DNA activation domain (prey plasmid). Mutant <italic>imp4</italic> alleles were generated by mutagenic PCR with primers containing vector sequences. Co-transformation with a gapped pAS2-1 (bait) plasmid facilitated gap repair and creation of a library of mutated <italic>imp4</italic> genes fused to the DNA binding domain. Transformants were selected that had both plasmids and that demonstrated Mpp10p&#x02013;Imp4p interaction at 30&#x000b0;C by activation of the histidine reporter gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f3">3</xref>). Of the 2680 colonies that grew on the triple selective medium (SD-Leu, Trp, His), 500 were patched onto three plates of the same medium to assay conditional growth at different temperatures. Transformants were incubated at 30 (permissive), 17 and 37&#x000b0;C (non-permissive) to test for conditional Mpp10p&#x02013;Imp4p interaction-defective association. Nineteen candidate transformants that grew at 30&#x000b0;C but not at 17 or 37&#x000b0;C demonstrated mutated Imp4p interaction with Mpp10p at 30&#x000b0;C but not at the non-permissive temperatures (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh318tb1">1</xref>), and were re-streaked to confirm conditional growth. pAS2-1-<italic>imp4</italic> plasmid DNA was isolated by passage through <italic>E.coli</italic> JA300 and re-transformed into pJ69-4A bearing pACT-2-<italic>MPP10</italic>. Following plasmid rescue and re-transformation, there were 12 pAS2-1-<italic>imp4</italic> plasmids that conferred conditional growth on triple selective media (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh318tb1">1</xref>).</p><p>An essential gene in yeast encodes Imp4p; therefore, to be useful for further study, the mutated Imp4 proteins must function at the permissive temperature. To test this, they were assayed for their ability to complement a null allele of <italic>IMP4</italic>. While eight <italic>imp4</italic> alleles could complement the null allele, only five of them conferred conditional growth at the non-permissive temperatures (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh318tb1">1</xref>). Interestingly, all of the mutant <italic>imp4</italic> alleles that conferred temperature sensitivity in the two-hybrid strain (pJ69-4A) also conferred temperature-sensitive growth when Imp4p was expressed in the context of its normal cellular function. Surprisingly, one allele, <italic>imp4-3</italic>, also conferred cold-sensitive growth when the mutated Imp4p was expressed in the context of its normal cellular function but not in the two-hybrid strain. DNA sequencing of the five pAS2-1-<italic>imp4</italic> plasmids revealed that they represented three unique sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f4">4</xref>). The total number of mutations in each sequence varied between 11 and 23.</p><p>Our screen for Mpp10p interaction-defective Imp4 proteins therefore yielded three different mutated Imp4 proteins. They were isolated because (i) they were conditionally Mpp10p-interaction defective in the two-hybrid system and (ii) they conferred normal growth at the permissive temperature in the context of their normal cellular function, but slow growth at the non-permissive temperatures. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we tested the mutated Imp4ps for conditional Mpp10p interaction in the context of their normal cellular function (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f5">5</xref>A). Anti-Imp4p antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate the mutated Imp4ps from the yeast strains grown at the designated temperatures. Mpp10p association was analyzed by western blotting with anti-Mpp10p antibodies. Surprisingly, in contrast to the two-hybrid results, the interactions between the mutated Imp4ps and Mpp10p were not affected at the non-permissive temperatures. Because both Imp4p and Mpp10p are components of an approximately 80S RNP, which we have termed the SSU processome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c3">3</xref>), other protein&#x02013;protein interactions may remain unaffected at the non-permissive temperatures. These interactions may continue to tether Mpp10p and Imp4p to the SSU processome and hence to each other. However, since the mutated Imp4ps do confer growth defects, the mutations are affecting an essential aspect of Imp4p function.</p><p>The integrity of the SSU processome containing the mu tated Imp4 proteins was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation of SSU processome components. Previously, we have shown that depletion of the U3 snoRNA or individual protein components leads to the loss of the SSU processome, visualized as the terminal knobs on nascent rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c3">3</xref>). Nop1p, a common box C/D protein that is required for U3 snoRNA stability, was triple HA tagged by integration in the chromosomal locus. A series of co-immunoprecipitations was carried out to examine the ability of mutated Imp4p and Nop1p-HA to associate with Mpp10p, mutated Imp4p and Nop1p-HA at the permissive and non-permissive temperatures. The results indicate that there was largely no change in SSU processome integrity at the non-permissive temperatures, as the levels of co-immunoprecipitating proteins were very similar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f5">5</xref>B). While there appeared to be a reduction in the amount of Nop1p-HA associating with Imp4-2p, Imp4-3p and Imp4-17p at 37&#x000b0;C, this correlated with a decrease in the total levels of Nop1p-HA at the elevated temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f5">5</xref>B, lanes 4, 10 and 12).</p><p>In light of the multiple mutations found in each of the mutated Imp4ps, we determined whether mutations in a particular domain of Imp4p were responsible for the cold and temperature sensitivity. We divided Imp4p according to its two domains, as introduced in the results to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f2">2</xref>B: the N-terminal coiled-coil domain (cc) and the C-terminal domain (ct). Using a BamHI restriction site within the coding region of <italic>IMP4</italic>, sections of the mutagenized sequence were swapped with wild-type sequence to pinpoint mutations that cause the cs and ts phenotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f6">6</xref>). We compared their growth at 17, 30 and 37&#x000b0;C by serial dilution. Generally, mutations in the C-terminus of <italic>imp4</italic> (<italic>imp4p-ct)</italic> conferred temperature sensitivity, while mutations in the N-terminus of <italic>imp4-3</italic> conferred cold sensitivity (<italic>imp4-3cc</italic>). Interestingly, the greater the number of mutations in the N-terminus, the less likely was the existence of the predicted coiled-coil domain as calculated by the COILS algorithm (data not shown). The Imp4-3cc protein, which was the only protein of the three to have no predicted coiled-coil domain, was also the only one that conferred a growth defect at 17&#x000b0;C. In contrast, the <italic>imp4-2cc</italic> and <italic>imp4-17cc</italic> strains, which had predicted intact N-terminal coiled-coil domains in their Imp4 proteins, were not conditional at any temperature tested. The differences in conditional sensitivities conferred by the two Imp4p domains could be indicative of their different functions. However, there is also synergy between them because the full-length mutated proteins (<italic>imp4</italic>) had more pronounced growth defects than either domain alone mutated (<italic>imp4p-cc</italic> and <italic>imp4p-ct</italic>; compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f6">6</xref>A and B with C).</p><p>We reasoned that the mutations in Imp4p would cause defects in pre-rRNA processing because they caused conditional growth defects. To investigate this, we analyzed the steady-state levels of pre-rRNAs by northern blotting with labeled oligonucleotides specific to pre-rRNA sequences (oligos b, c and e in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f7">7</xref>A). We studied the temperature-sensitive strains with mutated Imp4p throughout their entire length at 37&#x000b0;C (<italic>imp4-2</italic>, <italic>imp4-3</italic> and <italic>imp4-17</italic>), and the <italic>imp4-3</italic> strain at 17&#x000b0;C. The growth rate changes after 6 h at the restrictive temperature so RNA was analyzed from yeast 0, 3, 6 and 9 h after the temperature shift.</p><p>The pre-rRNA processing defects observed at 37&#x000b0;C in the <italic>imp4-2</italic> and <italic>imp4-17</italic> strains were similar. Probing with oligonucleotide c (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f7">7</xref>A, lanes 1&#x02013;8 and 13&#x02013;16) indicated a slight increase in the levels of the nascent 35S precursor and a decrease in the levels of the precursor that extends from A<sub>1</sub> to A<sub>3</sub> (marked with a 21S; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f7">7</xref>B and C, lanes 5&#x02013;8 and 13&#x02013;16). The 21S precursor is more prevalent in certain strains and has been previously described in our laboratory and others (sometimes referred to as &#x0002a;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c22">22</xref>). Because the normal levels of the 27SA<sub>2</sub> and 27SB precursors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f7">7</xref>D) indicate that cleavage at A<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> are unaffected, it is likely that a decrease in the levels of this precursor results from defective cleavage at site A<sub>1</sub> (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f1">1</xref> for pre-rRNA processing diagram). Primer extensions to confirm this were uninformative because they cannot distinguish between the 5&#x02032; end of this precursor and the 5&#x02032; end of the mature 18S rRNA, which is much more abundant than the precursors (data not shown). Likewise, the presence of the 33S precursor indicated that cleavage at the A<sub>0</sub> site is intact. The 21S precursor (A<sub>1</sub> to A<sub>3</sub>) appears heterogeneous from strains expressing mutant Imp4p even at 0 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f7">7</xref>C, lanes 5&#x02013;8 and 13&#x02013;16), also indicating a defect in cleavage at A<sub>1</sub>. Probing with oligonucleotides b and e indicated a decrease in the levels of the 20S precursor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f7">7</xref>D), which can also result from lack of cleavage at A<sub>1</sub>. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f7">7</xref>E indicates that the lanes were approximately evenly loaded with RNA. In summary, taken together, these results indicate that the temperature-sensitive mutations in <italic>imp4-2</italic> and <italic>imp4-17</italic> primarily cause a defect in cleavage at A<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>In contrast, analysis of the pre-rRNAs in the <italic>imp4-3</italic> strain at 37 and 17&#x000b0;C showed defects in cleavage at all three SSU processome-dependent sites, A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>. The levels of the 33S and 27SA<sub>2</sub> precursors were decreased, indicating a defect in cleavage at A<sub>0</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> at 37 and 17&#x000b0;C, respectively (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f7">7</xref>B and D, lanes 9&#x02013;12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f8">8</xref>A and B, lanes 5&#x02013;8). Similarly, at 37&#x000b0;C, the levels of the 23S precursor rRNA was slightly increased, consistent with defective cleavage at A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>. A reduction in the levels of the 20S precursor was also observed at both temperatures. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f7">7</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f8">8</xref>C indicate that the lanes were evenly loaded with RNA, and that U3 snoRNA levels were constant at the non-permissive temperatures.</p><p>To further map the defective cleavage sites in yeast expressing mutated Imp4-3p at 17&#x000b0;C, primer extension analysis of RNA was carried out. The results demonstrated a clear decrease in pre-rRNA transcripts cleaved at the A<sub>2</sub> site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f8">8</xref>D, lanes 4&#x02013;6). There was also a slight increase in the signal marking the 5&#x02032; of the pre-rRNA, as was expected because the levels of the 23S and 35S pre-rRNAs were detectably increased by northern blots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f8">8</xref>A and B). There was no change in the signal marking A<sub>0</sub> or A<sub>1</sub> cleavage in yeast expressing mutated Imp4-3p. However, primer extension to examine A<sub>1</sub> cleavage in precursors also examines the mature 5&#x02032; end of the 18 rRNA. Therefore, changes in cleavage at this site in pre-rRNAs may be masked by the presence of mature 18S rRNAs that are still extant after the temperature shift. The results of both the northern blots and primer extensions thus indicate that the yeast expressing mutated Imp4-3p have cleavage defects at A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>; however, at 17&#x000b0;C the cleavage defect at A<sub>2</sub> is most pronounced.</p><p>We also investigated the pre-rRNA processing defects in the <italic>imp4-3cc</italic> and <italic>imp4p-3ct</italic> strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f6">6</xref>) at their respective non-permissive temperatures (17 and 37&#x000b0;C). We found that the pre-rRNA processing defects in the <italic>imp4-cc</italic> strain mimic those found in the parent <italic>imp4-3</italic> strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh318f8">8</xref>), with pronounced cleavage defects at A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> (data not shown). In contrast, the pre-rRNA processing defects in the <italic>imp4p-3ct</italic> strain mimic those found in the <italic>imp4-2</italic> and <italic>imp4-17</italic> strains (data not shown). Therefore, mutations that affect growth in the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of Imp4p cause different pre-rRNA processing defects than those in the C-terminus.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The SSU processome is a large RNP with multiple protein&#x02013;protein interactions. We investigated the function of one pair of SSU processome protein&#x02013;protein interactions, Mpp10p&#x02013;Imp4p. Amino acids 350&#x02013;400 in Mpp10p were essential for Imp4p interaction as determined by two-hybrid analysis while neither of the two tested truncations of Imp4p were sufficient for Mpp10p interaction. To further explore the nature of the Mpp10p&#x02013;Imp4p interaction, we used a reverse two-hybrid system approach to generate Imp4 proteins that were conditionally defective for interaction with Mpp10p by two-hybrid analysis, and then studied their function in the context of the SSU processome. Surprisingly, none of the mutations affected Mpp10p&#x02013;Imp4p interaction at the non-permissive temperatures in the context of their normal cellular function. However, both growth and pre-rRNA processing were impaired at the non-permissive temperatures, indicating defects in Imp4p function. All three mutated Imp4ps caused temperature sensitivity; one of them also caused cold sensitivity. Domain swapping revealed that the cold sensitivity was imparted by mutations in the N-terminal coiled-coil domain, while mutations in the C-terminal portion conferred temperature sensitivity. The two mutated Imp4 proteins that conferred temperature sensitivity resulted in pre-rRNA processing defects primarily at site A<sub>1</sub>, while the mutated Imp4p that conferred both temperature and cold sensitivity resulted in pre-rRNA processing defects at all of the SSU processome-dependent sites, A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>, with a more pronounced defect at A<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>It is interesting that one mutated Imp4p (Imp4-3p) conferred only temperature sensitivity in the two-hybrid strain but both temperature and cold sensitivity in the context of the SSU processome. Cold-sensitive mutations are hallmarks of defects in macromolecular assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c23">23</xref>), suggesting that the SSU processome is inefficiently or slowly formed in the presence of this mutated Imp4p. Further support for this comes from the observation that the mutations that confer cold sensitivity occur in the coiled-coil domain, a known protein&#x02013;protein interaction domain, likely interfering with its predicted function in protein binding.</p><p>Reverse two-hybrid screens to generate interaction-defective proteins have been used to examine viral protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c24">24</xref>), to examine interaction of non-essential yeast proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c25">25</xref>) and to map interacting protein domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c26">26</xref>). This approach has not previously been used as we have used it here: to study the function of the interaction of two essential proteins. To be successful, the conditionally interaction-defective proteins generated in the two-hybrid strain must complement their null alleles at the permissive temperature, indicating full function. They must also continue to confer conditional growth. Three different mutated Imp4 proteins met these criteria. However, co-immunoprecipitation experiments at the non-permissive temperatures indicated that these mutated Imp4 proteins were not defective for Mpp10p interaction. Therefore, it is likely that while the mutated Imp4p&#x02013;Mpp10p proteins are interaction defective in a binary arrangement (two-hybrid strain), in the context of the SSU processome they are held in close proximity by multiple other protein and RNA interactions. Since there are many cellular multi-protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c28">28</xref>), our results have implications for the study of individual protein&#x02013;protein interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The C-terminus of Imp4p contains a recently identified novel 17 amino acid RNA binding domain, the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-like motif, which unites the Imp4 superfamily of RNA binding proteins, all of which are required for ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c4">4</xref>). These 17 amino acids may not be the only RNA binding domain in Imp4 because the two members of the Imp4 superfamily members that were tested have persistent RNA binding ability, but altered specificity, upon deletion of this motif. Therefore, the mutations in Imp4, particularly those in the C-terminus, may also interfere with Imp4&#x02013;RNA interaction. We have proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh318c4">4</xref>) that Imp4 may contact the pre-rRNA, and therefore these mutations may interfere with Imp4p&#x02019;s function in pre-rRNA folding and processing.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh318f1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Steps in pre-rRNA processing in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic> The precursors to the 18S rRNA mature along two different processing pathways depending on which cleavage event in ITS1 occurs first.
