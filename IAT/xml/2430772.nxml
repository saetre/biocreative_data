Human NAT1 (and the murine equivalent mouse Nat2) is found early in embryonic development and is likely to have an endogenous role. We report the detailed expression of the murine gene (<italic>Nat2</italic>) and encoded protein in mouse embryos, using a transgenic mouse model bearing a <italic>lacZ</italic> transgene inserted into the coding region of mouse <italic>Nat2</italic>. In mouse embryos, the transgene was expressed in sensory epithelia, epithelial placodes giving rise to visceral sensory neurons, the developing pituitary gland, sympathetic chain and urogenital ridge. In <italic>Nat2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice, the presence and activity of Nat2 protein was detected in these tissues and their adult counterparts. Altered expression of the human orthologue in breast tumours, in which there is endocrine signalling, suggests that human <italic>NAT1</italic> should be considered as a potential biomarker for neuroendocrine tissues and tumours.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Arylamine N-acetyltransferase/NAT</kwd><kwd>adrenal</kwd><kwd>embryo</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The arylamine <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferases (NATs) are clinically important in terms of their role in metabolism of medicinal and environmental arylamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Sim et al. 2007</xref>).

In humans, and in rodent models, the <italic>NAT</italic> genes are polymorphic, and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays of acetylation by NAT enzymes using arylamine substrates have been used to define the acetylation status of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Weber &#x00026; Hein 1985</xref>). <italic>NAT</italic> genes comprise polymorphic multigene families located at syntenic positions on chromosome 8 in mouse and man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Boukouvala &#x00026; Fakis 2005</xref>), with mouse used widely to model human <italic>NAT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Hein et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Sugamori et al. 2003</xref>). Human NAT2 was initially identified as a determinant of isoniazid metabolism and is largely active in the liver and intestine, indicating a role primarily in xenobiotic metabolism, as is the mouse Nat1 enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Sim et al. 2007</xref>). On the basis of C-terminus sequence identity, substrate specificity and expression profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Kawamura et al. 2005</xref>), human <italic>NAT1</italic> is orthologous to mouse <italic>Nat2</italic>. Human <italic>NAT1</italic> and mouse <italic>Nat2</italic> are expressed in a wide range of adult tissues and active during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">McQueen et al. 2003</xref>), reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Boukouvala &#x00026; Fakis 2005</xref>).

To further understand the role of human NAT1 in endogenous metabolism, we used homologous recombination in a mouse model to achieve functional deletion of <italic>Nat2</italic> (orthologous to human <italic>NAT1</italic>) in mice, by insertion of <italic>lacZ</italic> into the mouse <italic>Nat2</italic>-coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Cornish et al. 2003</xref>).

We found that <italic>Nat2</italic> was expressed in the sensory epithelia and epibranchial placodes, which give rise to the sensory neurons innervating the heart and digestive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Kirby 1988</xref>), in the sympathetic chain and developing urogenital system. <italic>Nat2</italic> expression has previously been described in the developing heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Stanley et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Wakefield et al. 2005</xref>). In neonates, cells expressing high levels of <italic>Nat2</italic> occur in regions of the heart innervated by the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Wakefield et al. 2005</xref>). The location of <italic>Nat2</italic> expression in both the developing and adult heart, and punctate staining pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) corresponds to that of <italic>Sox 10</italic>-expressing glial cells accompanying the autonomic innervation of the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Montero et al. 2002</xref>). In embryos, identification of cells differentiating along a neuronal pathway, using an anti-neurofilament antibody, positively identifies the sympathetic chain and suggests that <italic>Nat2</italic> is expressed in glial cells, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Stanley et al. 1998</xref>), further supporting a neuroendocrine expression pattern. <italic>Nat2</italic> expression in the developing sympathetic nervous system, which is largely derived from folate-sensitive neural crest cells is compatible with the proposed role of human NAT1 in folate metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Minchin 1995</xref>). As in humans, we found that mouse adrenal glands showed substantial pABA <italic>N</italic>-acetylating activity. Within the adrenal glands <italic>Nat2</italic> expression was observed both in the neural crest-derived medulla and in the cortex. Since the adrenal cortex plays a major role in steroid hormone and glucocorticoid synthesis from cholesterol, <italic>Nat2</italic> expression in this region is consistent with a functional role in the adult and developing neuroendocrine system.</p><p>The presence of human <italic>NAT1</italic> in luminal cells within the gut, lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Barker et al. 2006</xref>), bladder and kidney epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Stanley et al. 1997</xref>), clearly indicates that its expression is widespread. In these epithelia, human <italic>NAT1</italic> may have an endogenous function, in addition to that of xenobiotic metabolism. We observed robust mouse <italic>Nat2</italic> expression and Nat2 protein in mouse oviduct epithelia, known to respond to endogenous and xenobiotic estrogens and <italic>Nat2</italic> expression and Nat2 activity has been previously demonstrated in rodent prostate tissue, which is also oestrogen responsive.</p><p>Previous studies in mice indicate that although the deletion of the <italic>Nat2</italic> gene is compatible with normal development, and most offspring are aphenotypic, the <italic>Nat2</italic> null allele gives rise to skewed sex ratios both on mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Cornish et al. 2003</xref>) and pure genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Wakefield et al. 2006</xref>). These results indicate a gender-dependent phenotype, discernable at the population level. Such a phenotype could arise if <italic>Nat2</italic> gene mutations have opposing effects on male and female offspring, influencing sex ratios <italic>in utero</italic> and/or embryonic survival. Sex steroids (both oestrogen and testosterone) and corticosteroids are synthesized and have biological roles in both sexes and changes in the balance of these steroids may influence offspring sex ratios. The pattern of robust <italic>Nat2</italic> expression and gender-dependent effect of the <italic>Nat2</italic> null mutation implicate <italic>Nat2</italic> function in the sexual dimorphism of neuroendocrine function.</p><p>A correlation between human <italic>NAT1</italic> overexpression and oestrogen receptor status in breast cancer tissues has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Adam et al. 2003</xref>) which implicates human NAT1 in oestrogen-positive breast tumours and in relapse-free survival prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bieche et al. 2004</xref>). Using <italic>Nat2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we have been able to demonstrate low levels of expression in mouse mammary gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), indicating that in mice as in humans low levels of expression of mouse <italic>Nat2</italic>/human <italic>NAT1</italic> genes is associated with normal growth of mammary epithelia. Our findings, using mouse Nat2 to model human NAT1 function, indicate a novel aspect to the pattern of expression of mouse <italic>Nat2</italic>/human <italic>NAT1</italic> during embryogenesis and will be important in understanding the role of the human <italic>NAT1</italic> as a potential biomarker in breast cancer.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><italic>Nat2</italic> expression in mouse mammary gland epithelia.
