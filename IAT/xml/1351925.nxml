However, redundant TGF-&#x003b2; signaling activities and pleiotropism from germline mutations producing postnatal lethality have limited conclusions about the role of this signaling pathway in adult islets &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040039-b003">3</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040039-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.

The developing and adult pancreas expresses multiple TGF-&#x003b2; ligands, like TGF-&#x003b2;1, activins, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which are known to bind heteromeric receptor complexes comprised of membrane-associated type I and type II receptor kinases. Ligand activation of these receptors triggers phosphorylation of intracellular proteins called receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), which form heteromeric complexes with Smad 4. The activated Smad complexes translocate to the nucleus, where they regulate the transcription of target genes. R-Smads 1, 5, and 8 transduce BMP signaling, while R-Smads 2 and 3 are thought to mediate TGF-&#x003b2; and activin signaling &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040039-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.

Recently, we showed that Gdf11 is required for development of the appropriate number of endocrine precursor cells expressing the bHLH factor neurogenin3, and for the differentiation of embryonic &#x003b2; cell precursors into mature insulin-producing cells during pancreas development. These prior studies suggested that TGF-&#x003b2; signaling was required for &#x003b2; cell differentiation, but the islet cell defects revealed in these studies were modest and likely reflected redundant TGF-&#x003b2; signaling activities.

To begin to elucidate the mechanisms underlying insulin deficiency in these mice, we examined expression of known direct transcriptional regulators of insulin expression, and found evidence for reduction of MafA mRNA and nuclear protein. MafA is a member of the basic leucine zipper family of transcription factors, and several prior studies provide evidence that MafA is a direct regulator of insulin transcription &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040039-b028">28</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040039-b032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040039-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;.

Thus, multiple mechanisms may underlie the observed reduction in MafA following TGF-&#x003b2; signaling disruption in islets, and further studies are needed to address this point.

In addition to direct interactions between Smad7 and R-Smads, our studies suggest that Smad7 expression may also impair TGF-&#x003b2; signaling indirectly through reduced expression of the nuclear factor menin.

In neither prior study, however, did these genetic changes progress to overt diabetes, suggesting the possibility of redundant TGF-&#x003b2; signaling activities to maintain islet function.

We speculate that this method for conditional Smad7 expression may be useful for elucidating TGF-&#x003b2; roles in other organs and tissues. </p><p>Near-complete &#x003b2; cell loss precluded detailed analysis of the fate of &#x003b2; cells in bitransgenic <italic>Pdx1-tTA/Smad7</italic> embryos. To study the basis for reduction of insulin <sup>+</sup> cells in mice with disrupted TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, we therefore analyzed <italic>Gdf11</italic>-deficient embryos, which displayed defects in pancreatic islet cell differentiation similar (although qualitatively less severe) to those in <italic>Pdx1-tTA/Smad7</italic> mice. In <italic>Gdf11</italic><sup>&#x02212; <italic>/</italic>&#x02212; </sup> animals, we observed the failure of Nkx6.1 <sup>+</sup> cells to express MafA, a step known to presage the onset of insulin expression by &#x003b2; cell progenitors during islet formation &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040039-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; Thus, TGF-&#x003b2; signaling appears to be essential for &#x003b2; cell maturation in pancreas development. </p><p>In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that TGF-&#x003b2; signaling is required to establish and maintain hallmark functions of mature &#x003b2; cells in pancreatic islets. Reversal of diabetes and resumption of normal &#x003b2; cell function in our studies of conditional TGF-&#x003b2; signaling disruption suggests that dysfunctional islets in diabetic animals may remain responsive to restorative signals. Identification of endogenous TGF-&#x003b2; ligands, signal transduction components, and targets of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in islets therefore merits further study. Dissection of pathways that establish and maintain defining properties of &#x003b2; cells will be useful for creating cell-based strategies to treat pancreatic endocrine disorders like diabetes mellitus.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation, breeding, and genotyping of mice</title><p>Plasmid TRE-Smad7 was constructed by inserting a 3.0-kb EcoRI-BamHI PCR clone of human Smad7 (hSmad7) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040039-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; downstream of TRE, which consists of seven copies of the tet operator and a minimal CMV promoter (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, California, United States).

The injected embryos were cultured in vitro to the two-cell stage and transferred into the oviducts of 0.5-d pseudopregnant female mice. Mice were genotyped for the presence of the transgenes by PCR using the following forward (F) and reverse (R) primers: F = CCCAATGACCACGAGTTTATGC; and R = CTGACAAGTGAAATGATGACCGC. The PCR reaction for TRE-Smad7 was performed by denaturation at 95 &#x000b0;C for 10 min and 35 cycles of amplification (95 &#x000b0;C for 45 s, 62 &#x000b0;C for 60 s, and 72 &#x000b0;C for 90 s), followed by a 10-min extension period at 72 &#x000b0;C.

Smad7 expression in Pdx1-tTA/Smad7 embryos was inhibited by providing pregnant females doxycycline (1 g/l) in their drinking water. To permit Smad7 expression during embryogenesis, pregnant females were maintained without doxycycline throughout pregnancy, and litters were collected at specified times. To induce Smad7 in Pdx1-tTA/Smad7 adults, animals born to doxycycline-fed mothers were maintained on doxycycline until 3 wk of age. Animals were then taken off doxycycline and subjected to physiologic testing (see text). In some Pdx1-tTA/Smad7 mice and age-matched littermates taken off doxycycline at 3&#x02013;5 wk of age, doxycycline administration (1 g/l) was resumed at 7&#x02013;9 wk of age. Animals were subjected to physiologic tests and then sacrificed at 5 mo of age for total pancreatic insulin analysis. All data collected were from at least three animals per genotype. In contrast to the tTA gene product expressed from the Pdx1 locus, which is inhibited by doxycycline, the rtTA protein expressed from RIP <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in the RIP-rtTA transgene is activated by doxycycline. Thus, to induce Smad7 expression in RIP-rtTA/Smad7 animals, animals were given doxycycline (1 g/l) in their drinking water at 3 wk of age and maintained on doxycycline for 7 wk. Blood glucose concentration and glucose tolerance tests were measured weekly, as described &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040039-b002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040039-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;.
