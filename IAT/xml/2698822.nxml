Recently, a link has been established between peripheral insulin sensitivity and the retinol (vitamin A) metabolism, and insulin resistance in rodents and humans has been linked to abnormalities of the vitamin A signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. According to these studies, impaired glucose uptake in adipose tissue results in secondary systemic insulin resistance through release of the adipose-derived serum RBP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, it is unknown whether RBP4 effects on insulin sensitivity are vitamin A-dependent or vitamin A-independent. RBP4 (also called RBP) is mainly produced by the liver but also by adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In plasma, retinol-RBP4 is found in an equimolar complex with transthyretin (TTR), which is a thyroid hormone transport protein that is synthesized in and secreted from the liver. This ternary complex prevents retinol-RBP4 excretion by the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. By impairing insulin signaling in muscle, RBP4 inhibits glucose uptake and interferes with insulin-mediated suppression of glucose production in the liver, causing blood glucose levels to rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Conversely, mice lacking the <italic>RBP4 </italic>gene show increased insulin sensitivity, and normalizing increased RBP4 serum levels improves insulin resistance and glucose intolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>HMGA1 is a small basic protein that binds to adenine-thymine (A-T) rich regions of DNA and functions mainly as a specific cofactor for gene activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. HMGA1 by itself has no intrinsic transcriptional activity; rather, it can transactivate promoters through mechanisms that facilitate the assembly and stability of a multicomponent enhancer complex, the so-called enhanceosome, that drives gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>As part of an investigation into the molecular basis regulating the human insulin receptor gene, we previously showed that HMGA1 is required for proper insulin receptor gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. More recently, we showed that loss of HMGA1 expression, induced in mice by disrupting the <italic>HMGA1 </italic>gene, caused a type 2-like diabetic phenotype, in which, however, impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes coexisted with a condition of peripheral insulin hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Concomitant insulin resistance and insulin hypersensitivity in peripheral tissues may paradoxically coexist as observed in livers of lipodystrophic and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob </italic>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], as well as in <italic>Cdk4 </italic>knockout mice with defective pancreatic beta cell development and blunted insulin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The hypothesis that the paradoxical insulin hypersensitivity of <italic>Hmga1</italic>-deficient mice could be due to a deficit, in these animals, of RBP4 is supported by our data. Herein, by employing the <italic>Hmga1</italic>-knockout mouse model, we provide compelling evidence for the identification of a novel biochemical pathway involving HMGA1 and RBP4, whose activation by the cAMP pathway may play an important role in maintaining glucose metabolism homeostasis <italic>in vivo</italic>, in both rodents and humans. The importance of HMGA1 in <italic>RBP4 </italic>gene transcription was substantiated in <italic>Hmga1</italic>-deficient mice, in which loss of HMGA1 expression considerably decreased <italic>RBP4 </italic>mRNA abundance and RBP4 protein production.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>RBP4 gene transcription is induced by HMGA1 and cAMP</title><p>We first performed experiments to see whether HMGA1 had a role in activating the mouse <italic>RBP4 </italic>gene promoter at the transcriptional level. To test this possibility, HepG2 human hepatoma cells and mouse Hepa1 hepatoma cells were cotransfected transiently with mouse <italic>RBP4</italic>-Luc reporter plasmid plus increasing amounts of the HMGA1 expression vector. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, overexpression of HMGA1 considerably increased <italic>RBP4</italic>-Luc activity in both cell types and this effect occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with these results, <italic>RBP4 </italic>mRNA abundance was increased in cells overexpressing HMGA1 and was reduced in cells pretreated with siRNA targeting HMGA1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), indicating that activation of the <italic>RBP4 </italic>gene requires HMGA1. These data were substantiated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, showing that binding of HMGA1 to the endogenous <italic>RBP4 </italic>locus was increased in whole, intact HepG2 and Hepa1 cells naturally expressing HMGA1, and was decreased in cells exposed to siRNA against HMGA1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Based on these results, in addition to previous observations indicating that cAMP, or agents which elevate intracellular cAMP, increase <italic>RBP </italic>transcript levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], we were interested to see whether a functional link could be established between cAMP, HMGA1, and RBP4. To this end, we first confirmed and extended the observation made by Jessen and Satre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] that <italic>RBP </italic>is induced by cAMP in Hepa1 cells. As measured by Northern blot analysis of total RNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), <italic>RBP4 </italic>mRNA increased &#x02248; 5-fold over the basal level in Hepa1 cells treated with 0.5 mM 8-bromo cAMP (Br-cAMP), a standard concentration for c-AMP induction experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <italic>RBP4 </italic>mRNA levels increased starting at 3 h, peaking at 24 h and then declining, suggesting a transient transcriptional stimulation. To establish whether HMGA1 was required for basal and cAMP-dependent <italic>RBP4 </italic>transcription, we transfected the HMGA1 expression vector in Hepa1 cells treated or not with Br-cAMP and RBP4 protein levels were analyzed 48 h later by Western blot. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, RBP4 protein expression was enhanced in cells overexpressing HMGA1 and even further in cells treated with cAMP, in which an increase in HMGA1 protein expression was simultaneously observed, suggesting that induction of RBP4 by cAMP may occur, at least in part, through activation of endogenous HMGA1 expression. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that RBP4 was reduced in cAMP treated cells in which endogenous levels of HMGA1 were specifically lowered by transfecting cells with HMGA1 antisense expression plasmid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, further experiments are needed to fully explain the role of cAMP on HMGA1 expression. The functional significance of HMGA1 in <italic>RBP4 </italic>gene expression was confirmed in transient transcription assays in Hepa1 (and differentiated 3T3-L1, data not shown) cells, in which overexpression of HMGA1 caused an increase in both basal and cAMP-induced Luc activity from the mouse <italic>RBP</italic>-Luc reporter plasmid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This effect was substantiated in HEK-293 cAMP-responsive cells, a cell line ideally suited for studying the effects of HMGA1 on transcription since it does not express appreciable levels of this protein. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, in support of the role that HMGA1 plays in the context of <italic>RBP4 </italic>gene, the direct effect of cAMP was less effective in promoting <italic>RBP4 </italic>transcription in HEK-293 cells expressing low levels of HMGA1, becoming considerably higher in cells with forced expression of HMGA1.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>RBP4 </italic>gene expression is induced by HMGA1</bold>. <bold>(Top) </bold>Mouse <italic>RBP4</italic>-Luc reporter vector (2 &#x003bc;g) was transfected into HepG2 and Hepa1 cells plus increasing amounts (0, 0.5, or 1 &#x003bc;g) of <italic>HMGA1 </italic>expression plasmid.

Under these conditions, glucagon-stimulated cAMP responses in terms of both <italic>Hmga1 </italic>and <italic>RBP4 </italic>mRNA expression were first analyzed in wild-type control mice. Consistent with our data in Hepa1 cells, <italic>Hmga1 </italic>and <italic>RBP4 </italic>mRNA levels significantly increased in liver and fat of normal mice after intraperitoneal injection of glucagon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Time course analyses revealed that the induction and accumulation of <italic>Hmga1 </italic>mRNA preceded the expression of <italic>RBP4 </italic>mRNA in both tissues. In liver, <italic>RBP4 </italic>mRNA appeared after that for <italic>Hmga1</italic>, peaked after 6 h following glucagon injection, and then remained at a plateau (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In fat, <italic>RBP4 </italic>mRNA appeared at 1 h after <italic>Hmga1 </italic>mRNA, peaked after 6 h of glucagon stimulation, and decreased smoothly thereafter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

Interestingly, when similar experiments were carried out in glucagon injected <italic>Hmga1</italic>-deficient mice, tissue expression of <italic>RBP4 </italic>mRNA was severely attenuated in liver and fat from heterozygous (<italic>Hmga1</italic><sup>+/-</sup>) and <italic>Hmga1</italic>-null (<italic>Hmga1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), thereby indicating that HMGA1 is indeed required for maximal induction of the <italic>RBP4 </italic>gene <italic>in vivo</italic>, in the whole organism, and that the glucagon/adenylate cyclase system regulates both <italic>HMGA1 </italic>and <italic>RBP4 </italic>gene and protein expression.

To support further the role of RBP4 in insulin hypersensitivity in <italic>Hmga1 </italic>mutants, we have determined the effect of RBP4 administration on the glucose fall induced by insulin in these genotypes during ITT. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, injection of human RBP4 in heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Hmga1 </italic>mutants caused a less dramatic fall in blood glucose levels, lessening the hypoglycemic response to intraperitoneal insulin observed in the saline-injected animals.

By directly regulating <italic>RBP4 </italic>gene transcription, HMGA1 enhances peripheral insulin sensitivity, ensuring glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. This, if on one hand might represent an adaptive mechanism to ameliorate insulin resistance in animals with a disadvantageous metabolic risk profile, on the other might indicate that the cAMP/HMGA1-mediated RBP4 expression during fasting (when glucagon peaks) may act physiologically to reduce insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, thereby contributing to the maintenance of euglycemia under this condition.

However, despite the severe decrease in insulin receptor signaling and insulin receptor production, the glucose-lowering effect of exogenous insulin was enhanced in <italic>Hmga1</italic>-deficient mice during ITT, and the glucose infusion rate necessary to maintain euglycemia was higher in mutant mice during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], supporting the existence of alternative pathways of insulin signaling promoting glucose uptake and disposal in certain adverse metabolic conditions such as those found in the <italic>Hmga1</italic>-knockout mouse. The existence of signaling pathways promoting glucose uptake and utilization in peripheral tissues through mechanisms that are independent of insulin has been postulated before, on the basis of experimental observations supporting the existence of molecular circuits/pathways that can compensate for the decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake <italic>in vivo</italic>, in both animal models and human patients with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, how these compensatory mechanisms are activated has remained hitherto largely undefined. As previously shown, consistent with the ubiquitous distribution of HMGA1, insulin receptor expression was also reduced in pancreatic tissue from <italic>Hmga1</italic>-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Loss of insulin secretion in response to glucose has been reported in IR&#x003b2; knockout mice with tissue-specific knockout of the insulin receptor in pancreatic beta cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. As in the IR&#x003b2; knockout mice, plasma insulin after glucose challenge was considerably reduced in <italic>Hmga1</italic>-mutant animals, in which the acute first-phase insulin secretory response was severely blunted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], indicating a glucose-induced insulin secretory defect. In addition, substantial abnormalities in pancreatic islet morphology and size have been described in <italic>Hmga1</italic>-knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], indicating that decreased insulin secretion in this genotype may also depend on reduced beta-cell mass. Thus, defects in both pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion and peripheral insulin action coexist simultaneously in this knockout mouse model of diabetes, in which activation of compensatory mechanisms to efficiently overcome these metabolic abnormalities may be of vital importance.</p><p>Downregulation of Glut4 in adipose tissue is a typical feature of insulin-resistant states, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It has been found that the decrease in Glut4 expression that occurs in the fatty tissue of obese animals and humans is accompanied by increased expression and secretion of the adipocyte-derived RBP4 fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], suggesting that RBP4 production is tightly regulated by adipose tissue glucose uptake. RBP4 has been recently implicated in systemic insulin sensitivity in rodents and humans, in which elevated serum RBP4 levels were associated with reduced expression of Glut4 in adipocytes, and correlated inversely with peripheral insulin sensitivity. However, based on current data, the role of RBP4 in insulin sensitivity in humans is still controversial and might be restricted to rodent models only. Interspecies differences are known to exist and discrepancies between humans and mice might emphasize the role of non-genetic environmental factors and genetic modifiers in determining the phenotypic variations in RBP4 and insulin sensitivity between humans and animal models. Our results in the present study clearly indicate that in <italic>Hmga1</italic>-knockout mice RBP4 levels are considerably decreased in serum and in whole liver and adipose tissue extracts, strictly linking HMGA1 and RBP4 expression. We propose that HMGA1 deficiency adversely affects RBP4 expression and this, in animals with a disadvantageous metabolic risk profile like that observed in the <italic>Hmga1</italic>-knockout mouse model, might reflect an adaptive mechanism to increase glucose uptake and glucose disposal. Consistent with the results obtained in <italic>Hmga1</italic>-deficient mice, RBP4 was considerably reduced in cells of both human (HepG2) and mouse (Hepa1) origin readily expressing RBP4, following perturbation of endogenous HMGA1 protein expression in cells treated with siRNA against HMGA1. Conversely, an increase in <italic>RBP4 </italic>mRNA abundance was observed in both cell lines following forced expression of HMGA1, consistently supporting a role for HMGA1 in the transcriptional activation of the <italic>RBP4 </italic>gene. These findings were substantiated further by ChIP analysis, showing that HMGA1 indeed binds to the <italic>RBP4 </italic>locus in intact living cells.</p><p>Signal transduction pathways which raise intracellular cAMP have been reported to have a potential role in the regulation of <italic>RBP4 </italic>gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain poorly understood, evidence exists supporting the notion that the regulation of <italic>RBP4 </italic>gene transcription via the cAMP signaling pathway may be physiologically relevant. One important physiological condition in which intracellular cAMP increases is in response to low glucose availability. In this metabolic setting, a concomitant predominance of circulating counter-regulatory hormones, in particular pancreatic glucagon acting via the cAMP pathway, induces glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver, which produce and release hepatic glucose in the blood. In this regard, the cAMP-element-binding protein (CREB) has been identified as a critical transcriptional checkpoint which, in response to cAMP, promotes hepatic glucose output through the synergistic activation of distinct transcriptional effector pathways, which include the PPAR gamma coactivator 1 (PGC1) and the NR4A orphan nuclear receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we report that systemic injection of glucagon to wild-type control mice caused an increase in <italic>RBP4 </italic>mRNA and protein expression, along with an increase of both intracellular cAMP and HMGA1 levels. Glucagon effects were attenuated in <italic>Hmga1</italic>-deficient mice, supporting a distinct role for HMGA1 in the regulation of <italic>RBP4 </italic>gene expression and functionally linking this two genes. As a consequence of the functional link between HMGA1 and RBP4, a significant increase in <italic>Glut4 </italic>mRNA and protein was observed in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissues from <italic>Hmga1</italic>-deficient mice compared with controls. An inverse relationship between RBP4 and Glut4 has been described previously, in the adipose-<italic>Glut4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mouse, in which the decrease in Glut4 expression that occurs in the fatty tissue of this mutant genotype is accompanied by increased expression and secretion of the fat-derived RBP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In our model, instead, <italic>RBP4 </italic>expression is genetically impaired due to the lack of HMGA1 and Glut4 is increased in both muscle and fat, suggesting that abnormalities in RBP4 and/or metabolites of the vitamin A metabolism may directly affect whole-body insulin action and peripheral insulin sensitivity. In support of this possibility, identification of regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms in the <italic>RBP4 </italic>gene associated with type 2 diabetes has been recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], while correlations of RBP4 with insulin resistance have been confirmed in experimental clinical approaches in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

Protein fractions were examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting, and desired fractions were pooled together, concentrated with an Amicon Centriprep-10 concentrator (Millipore), and stored at -80&#x000b0;C.</p><p>To determine whether elevation of RBP4 affected insulin hypersensitivity <italic>in vivo</italic>, in <italic>Hmga1</italic>-deficient mice, heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Hmga1 </italic>mutants, were intraperitoneally injected twice daily (at 12-h intervals) with 200 &#x003bc;g of purified human RBP4 (13 &#x003bc;g/g body weight per mouse) for 7 days.
