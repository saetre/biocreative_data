Here we describe the characterization of human and murine E2F8, a new member of the E2F family. Sequence analysis of E2F8 predicts the presence of two distinct E2F-related DNA binding domains suggesting that E2F8 and, the recently, identified E2F7 form a subgroup within the E2F family. We show that E2F transcription factors bind the E2F8 promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> and that expression of E2F8 is being induced at the G1/S transition. Purified recombinant E2F8 binds specifically to a consensus E2F-DNA-binding site indicating that E2F8, like E2F7, binds DNA without the requirement of co-factors such as DP1. E2F8 inhibits E2F-driven promoters suggesting that E2F8 is transcriptional repressor like E2F7. Ectopic expression of E2F8 in diploid human fibroblasts reduces expression of E2F-target genes and inhibits cell growth consistent with a role for repressing E2F transcriptional activity. Taken together, these data suggest that E2F8 has an important role in turning of the expression of E2F-target genes in the S-phase of the cell cycle.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The E2F family of transcription factors are downstream effectors of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) pathway and are essential for orchestrating the timely expression of a large number of genes required for cell-cycle progression and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). In the majority of human cancers, the control of E2F transcriptional regulation is deregulated and is caused either by direct mutational inactivation of the <italic>RB1</italic> gene or through aberrant expression of genes regulating pRB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>In G0/G1 of the cell cycle, the transcriptional activities of the E2Fs are restrained by members of pRB family, pRB, p107 and p130, and this suppression is dependent on the ability of these proteins to sequester and thereby repress E2F activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Several lines of evidence have shown that E2Fs are required for S-phase entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Overexpression of E2F is sufficient to induce quiescent cells to enter S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>) and, more recently, it was demonstrated that E2F1-3 triple knockout cells are defective for S-phase entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Furthermore, in <italic>Rb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse embryo fibroblasts the G1 phase is shorter than in wild-type cells.</p><p>Cell-cycle progression is driven by mitogenic growth signals, which result in the synthesis and accumulation of D-type cyclins. Associated cyclin-dependent kinases initiate the phosphorylation of the pRB family members, dissociating them from the E2F transcription factors. As a result, an auto-regulatory amplification loop of transcription is activated at the late G1/early S-phase of the cell-cycle resulting in increased transcriptional activity of E2F family members, which in turn activates the expression of a large number of genes involved in cell-cycle progression, proliferation and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The transcriptional activity of the E2Fs oscillates through the cell cycle and to terminate and exit S-phase a decrease in E2F activity is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian cells express at least seven members of the E2F family (E2F1&#x02013;7). In addition, several E2F isoforms are generated by alternative splicing for some of the E2F family members adding another layer of complexity to the functions of E2Fs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). The E2F family can be divided into four subgroups on the basis of their structure, affinity for members of the pRB family, complex formation with members of the DP family, transcriptional function and expression pattern. E2F1&#x02013;6 are characterized by the presence of two highly conserved domains necessary for sequence specific DNA binding and dimerization with DP proteins, respectively. E2F1&#x02013;3a are considered to be transcriptional activators and, when overexpressed, can drive quiescent cells into S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Their transcriptional repertoires are exclusively controlled by pRB and E2F1&#x02013;3a expression is induced at the G1/S-phase of the cell cycle and directs the expression E2F-regulated genes. In contrast, E2F3b, E2F4 and E2F5 occupy E2F-regulated promoters in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and interact with all three pRB family members, which repress transcription by recruitment of chromatin-remodelling complexes, histone- and DNA-modifying enzymes such HDAC and DNA methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). E2F4 and E2F5 lack nuclear localization signals and are excluded from the cell nucleus during S-phase, but relocalizes to the nucleus after complex formation with the pocket proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). The third group is represented by E2F6, which is also a repressor of transcription that forms a structurally and functionally separate group within the E2F family. E2F6 lacks a transcriptional activation domain and sequences necessary for complex formation with members of the pRB family. Instead, E2F6 represses transcription through interactions with the Polycomb group of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). The exact role of E2F6 in transcriptional regulation is presently unclear, but recent data suggest that E2F6 specifically down-regulates E2F-target genes activated at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). E2F6 also appears to play a role in development and differentiation. Accordingly, a mild homeotic phenotype has been reported for <italic>E2F6</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Recently, E2F7, a novel member of the E2F family was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). E2F7 is structurally unique in that it harbours a tandem repeat of E2F DNA-binding domains. Furthermore E2F7 interacts with DNA independently of DP proteins. E2F7b expression is restricted to the S-phase of the cell cycle and has been shown to repress a subset of E2F-regulated genes.</p><p>Here we describe the identification of a novel member of the E2F family, E2F8. E2F8 shows a high degree of resemblance to E2F7 and shares the unique structure of E2F7 by having two distinct domains exhibiting a high degree of similarity to the DNA-binding domain of the E2F family. We show that <italic>E2F8</italic> expression is cell-cycle regulated and is activated by E2Fs at G1/early S-phase of the cell cycle and that members of the E2F family occupy the E2F8 promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>. E2F8 binds consensus E2F sites in a DP-independent manner and represses transcription of E2F-regulated promoters. Ectopic expression of E2F8 inhibits cellular proliferation. Altogether, the restricted expression and repressive transcriptional function of E2F8 suggests a role for E2F8 in negative feedback loop repressing E2F-activated promoters. Our results extend and are consistent with two recent reports on the identification of mouse and human E2F8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), published while this manuscript was in preparation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The promoter reporter constructs encoding various promoters fused to the luciferase reporter gene and expression constructs used for transcriptional assays pGL3-6xE2F, pGL3-E2F1, pGL3-CDC6, pGL3-CyclinE1, pGAL-luc, pCMV-E2F1 and pCMV-E2F7, respectively, have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>cDNA cloning of human and murine <italic>E2F8</italic></title><p>The putative open reading frames (ORFs) of human and murine <italic>E2F8</italic> were amplified by PCR from HeLa cDNA and a ProQuest Mouse Embryo (day 8.5) cDNA library from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), respectively, using primers: 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032;.

Briefly, human osteosarcoma U2OS cells or human TIG3 fibroblasts were cross-linked by the addition of formaldehyde to 1% final concentration, the reaction was stopped by addition of glycine, cells washed in TBS and harvested into SDS buffer. Following centrifugation, cells were resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer and chromatin was sonicated to an average size of 250 &#x000b1; 750 bp.

When searching GenBank using the <italic>E2F7</italic> sequence as query, we noticed the existence of several human and murine expressed sequence tags and database accessions showing similarity to <italic>E2F7</italic>. Two accessions NM 024680 encoding <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> FLJ23311 protein and XM149937 encoding the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> RIKEN cDNA 4432406C08 gene, respectively, appeared to harbour full-length ORFs, since their respective start codons were preceded by in-frame stop codons. Amplification of these ORFs from HeLaS3 cDNA and a murine embryo cDNA library, respectively, resulted in single PCR products indicating no or a low abundance of alternative spliced transcripts in these tissues. Subsequent, cloning and sequencing of the PCR products resulted in consensus sequences identical to that of the FLJ23311 mRNA and RIKEN cDNA 4432406C08. The cloned transcripts, which we have designated <italic>E2F8</italic>, contained highly homologous ORFs capable of encoding proteins of 867 and 860 amino acids (identity 82.2%) with calculated molecular weights of 94&#x02009;272 and 93&#x02009;382 Da, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Alignment of human E2F7 and the human E2F8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) showed an overall identity of 31.9%, with the highest conservation around the unique repeats of the two E2F-like DNA-binding domains found in E2F7. Comparison of the putative DNA-binding domains of E2F8 with other E2F members demonstrates the close relationship to E2F7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis using a neighbour-joining (NJ) method of the human and murine E2F8 proteins based on either the full-length sequences or the sequences of the DNA-binding domains, respectively, suggest that these belong to the distinct subgroup of the E2F family presently represented by the two isoforms of E2F7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This subgroup is characterized by having two E2F-like DNA-binding domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and binds DNA independently of the DP proteins. In addition, none of the polypeptides encode the conserved sequences such as Cyclin A phosphorylation motifs, dimerization domains, pRB binding motif, marked box and transactivation domain present in the two other subgroups of the E2F family. The genomic organization of <italic>E2F8</italic> is similar to <italic>E2F7</italic> suggesting that they originate from a common ancestral gene. The human and murine <italic>E2F8</italic> genes are located on chromosome 11p15.1 and short arm of chromosome 7, respectively. Both the human and murine E2F8 genes are predicted to consist of 13 exons with the putative start ATGs located in the second exons (data not shown). Together with the sequence similarity, the genomic structure strongly supports that the human and murine E2F8 genes are true orthologues.</p><p>The expression of the putative ORFs of human and murine E2F8 were analysed by transient transfection of HeLa cells followed by western blotting analysis of cell lysates using a panel of expression vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Expression of E2F8 was detected using an anti-serum raised against the C-terminal of murine E2F8. In agreement with the predicted molecular weights, for both hE2F8 and mE2F8 major bands around 100 kDa were detected, which increased in size when the E2F8 was fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain or Herpes simplex VP16. In addition, a number of bands with relatively lower molecular weights were observed, which probably represents E2F8 degradation products. In general, we found E2F8 to be very prone to degradation. Although, we observed bands in untransfected HeLa cells with similar molecular weight as the E2F8 expression products after long exposure of the blots. The non-specific reactions of the anti-sera hampered a reliable identification of endogenous expressed E2F8. Thus, the endogenous protein levels of E2F8 appeared relatively low, which is in agreement with the observed <italic>E2F8</italic> mRNA levels as described in the following section. After transfection of U2OS cells with Ha- or myc-tagged E2F8 expression vectors and analysis by immuno-fluorescence microscopy, E2F8 exhibited localization to the nuclear compartment of the cells as judged by the overlapping staining with DAPI (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>E2F8 and E2F7 exhibit similar expression patterns</title><p>To determine the expression levels of E2F8, we screened cDNA from a panel of exponentially growing human cell lines by real-time qPCR for the expression of E2F8 and E2F7 transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The two genes exhibited a parallel expression pattern and were more abundantly expressed in transformed cell lines of carcinoma or sarcoma origin consistent with being an E2F-target gene. The E2F8 and E2F7 primer sets used for qPCR exhibited similar amplification efficiency when compared using E2F8 and E2F7 on DNA templates indicating that the relative mRNA expression levels of E2F8 are, in general, &#x0223c;5&#x02013;20% of the levels of E2F7.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>E2F8</italic> is an E2F-target gene</title><p>Several observations indicated that E2F8, in analogy to E2F7, could be an E2F-regulated gene: (i) the presence of relatively high levels of E2F8 expression in rapidly dividing cell lines; (ii) high level of expression in HeLaS3, where the pRB-E2F pathway is deregulated; and (iii) the clustering of putative E2F-binding sites around the putative transcription initiation site of the <italic>E2F8</italic> promoter. To examine whether <italic>E2F8</italic> is an E2F-target gene, we used U2OS cells stably expressing E2F1 fused to the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain (ER-E2F1), which has been characterized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Briefly, in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) ER-E2F1 is translocated from the cytosol to nucleus of the cells and E2F-regulated genes are induced. After 4 h of OHT induction in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (CHX), total RNA was isolated and the levels of <italic>E2F8</italic> transcripts were determined by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). An &#x0223c;10-fold up-regulation of <italic>E2F8</italic> mRNA levels was observed. The magnitude of induction was comparable with that of <italic>E2F7</italic>. Since the up-regulation of transcript levels was observed in the presence of CHX, the increase in <italic>E2F8</italic> transcript levels was independent of <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis indicating direct binding and activation of the promoter by ER-E2F1.</p><p>To gain further support for a role of the E2Fs in regulating E2F8 expression, ChIP experiments using specific antibodies to members of the E2F family were performed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, E2F1 and to a lesser extent E2F4 and E2F7 occupied the <italic>E2F8</italic> promoter. In contrast to E2F1, E2F4 and E2F7 are considered to be repressors of transcription, their presence at the <italic>E2F8</italic> promoter indicates that the promoter is regulated by both activating and repressing members of the E2F family. The <italic>CCNA2</italic> and <italic>E2F1</italic> promoters and &#x003b2;-actin gene were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. In addition, E2F3 was also found to occupy the <italic>E2F8</italic> promoter as determined by ChIP assays in human TIG3 fibroblasts (data not shown). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that <italic>E2F8</italic> transcription is directly regulated by members of the E2F family.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>E2F8</italic> transcription is cell-cycle regulated</title><p>The finding that <italic>E2F8</italic> is a direct E2F-target suggests that <italic>E2F8</italic> expression is cell-cycle regulated. To test this hypothesis, HeLaS3 cell were synchronized in early S-phase by a double thymidine block, while U2OS cells were synchronized to arrest in G2/M by a thymidine block followed by release into nocodazole-containing medium. The cells were released from the blocks and the DNA content of the cells was determined at different time points as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref> by FACS analysis. Total RNA was purified, reverse transcribed and expression of <italic>E2F8</italic>, <italic>E2F7</italic> and selected cyclin genes were quantitated by real-time PCR. For HeLaS3 cells, the relative level of <italic>E2F8</italic> peaked at the time of release, early S-phase, which coincided with, two other E2F targets, <italic>E2F7</italic> and Cyclin E1. As the cells progressed through S-phase, <italic>E2F8</italic> transcript levels dropped and finally increased again when the cells had gone through mitosis and started re-entering S-phase. The expression of Cyclin B1 was included as a control for the synchronization of the cells. For the U2OS cells, which were arrested at G2/M, relatively low levels of <italic>E2F8</italic> transcripts were detected at the time of release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, after mitosis and entry into the S-phase, a significant increase of <italic>E2F8</italic> expression was observed. We also found that <italic>E2F8</italic> expression is induced in human TIG3 fibroblasts after release from serum starvation (data not shown). Taken together, the combined cell synchronization data support the finding that <italic>E2F8</italic> is an E2F-target gene, which is growth- and cell-cycle regulated, and is induced at the G1&#x02013;S-phase transition of the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>E2F8 binds to consensus E2F sites</title><p>The presence of two putative E2F DNA-binding domains highly homologous to domains of E2F7 suggested that E2F8 is also capable of associating with the E2F DNA-binding consensus site. To determine whether E2F8 can bind directly to E2F consensus sites, we expressed His-tagged E2F8 in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus. Subsequently, recombinant His-tagged E2F8 was purified; fractions were analysed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and tested for site-specific DNA binding by EMSAs using a <sup>32</sup>P-labelled ds-oligonucleotide encoding the adenovirus E2 E2F-binding site as target. A major band revealed by Coomassie staining with the predicted molecular weight of his-E2F8 was observed in fractions 2&#x02013;5. This band was recognized by an E2F8 anti-serum when analysed by western blotting (data not shown) confirming the identity of the purified expression product. The purified fractions were tested by EMSA and gave rise to a slower migrating complex with a signal intensity paralleling the levels of E2F8 present in the fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The binding was efficiently competed by addition of increasing amounts of unlabelled E2F ds-oligonucleotide (Wt), while a mutation of the core GCGC sequence of the ds-oligonucleotide (Mt) abolished its inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Altogether, these data strongly suggest that E2F8 by itself binds directly to E2F consensus sites.</p></sec><sec><title>E2F8 is a repressor of E2F-activated transcription</title><p>To determine a role for E2F8 in E2F transcriptional regulation, we generated a fusion protein containing E2F8 fused to the yeast GAL4-DNA binding domain. The GAL4 DNA-binding domain targets E2F8 independently of its intrinsic DNA binding activity to GAL4 binding sites. To test its activity we transfected U2OS cells with a plasmid containing five Gal4 binding-sites fused to a luciferase reporter gene with the GAL4-E2F8 expression plasmid. A &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression vector was co-transfected and used for normalization of the data. The GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to E2F1 was included as a positive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). In addition, expression constructs encoding E2F8 or E2F8 fused to transcriptional activation domain, VP16, were tested for their ability to transactivate a reporter plasmid containing an array of six E2F sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In both assays no increase in luciferase activity was observed indicating that E2F8 lacks the capacity to function as a transcriptional activator. However, when E2F8 was fused to VP16, a concentration-dependent increase of luciferase activity comparable with E2F1 using the pGL3-6xE2F reporter was observed, demonstrating that E2F8 binds the promoter of the reporter gene. Together, these data support the idea that E2F8 is a repressor of transcription.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we measured the ability of E2F8 to inhibit E2F1-dependent transactivation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, E2F8 represses in a concentration-dependent manner, comparable with E2F7, the transactivation of a synthetic promoter construct and the E2F1 promoter by E2F1. As a control for specificity, E2F8 and E2F7 expression constructs were unable to repress transcription from the <italic>E2F1</italic> promoter construct having mutations in the E2F-binding sites. Also, the Cyclin E1 and CDC6 promoters, which are known targets for E2F regulation, were tested for E2F8-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Albeit the level of transcriptional down-regulation differed, all tested promoters were repressed proportional to the amount of input E2F8 expression vector. These results demonstrate that E2F8 can repress E2F1-activated transcription probably by competing or displacing activating E2Fs from promoter binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Ectopic expression of E2F8 inhibits cell proliferation</title><p>E2F1&#x02013;3 are required for S-phase entry and are key players in mediating transcriptional activation of genes involved in DNA synthesis and cell-cycle progression. We have shown previously that ectopic expression of E2F7 affects cell proliferation and given the homology between E2F7 and E2F8, we would predict that ectopic expression of E2F8 could inhibit cell proliferation. To test this hypothesis, human TIG3 fibroblasts were transduced by retroviruses carrying a puromycin resistance gene and the full-length E2F8 ORF or an E2F8 (E2F8mt) mutant carrying a double mutation in the DNA-binding domain. As a control, a retrovirus only harbouring the puromycin resistance gene was included. After, 7 days of puromycin selection, the cells were plated and cell growth was evaluated in a colony forming assay or monitored by a 3T3 protocol. Only few cell colonies were observed for E2F8 transduced cells when compared with E2F8 mt and the Puro control demonstrating that ectopic expression of E2F8 inhibits cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Accordingly, only modest growth, with a tendency of slightly increased growth after each passage, was observed in a 3T3 assay &#x0223c;2.5 doublings for E2F8 over a period of four cell passages compared with &#x0223c;10- to 15-fold for E2F8 mt or Puro, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). To analyse the inhibitory function of E2F8 in more detail, <italic>de novo</italic> DNA synthesis was determined by pulsing the transduced cells with BrdU and total DNA was stained with propidium iodide before FACS analysis. For both E2F8 mt and Puro transduced cells, a similar proportion of cells were present in the different phases of the cell cycle and all cells in S-phase also incorporated BrdU showing active DNA synthesis. In contrast, E2F8 transduced cells had an accumulation of cells in the S-phase of cell cycle and the major part of these were not incorporating BrdU indicating the absence or low level of DNA synthesis. The population of cells incorporating BrdU probably represents a subset of cells, which are expressing no or low levels of E2F8, since these become more abundant-dependent on the passage number. Also the expression of E2F8 slowly decreases after passage of the cells, probably because of the counter selection in growing cells (data not shown). The lack of DNA synthesis might be a consequence of down-regulation of E2F-target genes involved in DNA synthesis or cell-cycle control. Thus, to determine whether ectopic E2F8 expression affected the expression of E2F-target genes, the levels of Cyclin A2, Cyclin E1 and Cyclin B1 mRNA relative to &#x003b2;-actin were quantified by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). While transduction of cells with E2F8 mt resulted in a decrease compared with the Puro control, a major reduction was observed for all transcripts of E2F8-transduced cells indicating that E2F8 represses transcription of E2F-target genes. Together, the data suggests that ectopically expressed E2F8 directly binds the promoters and blocks transcription of E2F-target genes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The E2F family of transcription factors is essential for orchestrating the expression of cellular genes necessary for proliferation and cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Until recently, seven members of the mammalian E2F family have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). These members can be divided into four subgroups based on their phylogenetic relationship and function. In this report we describe the identification of yet another putative member of the E2F family, E2F8. Based on its unique structure, sequence homology and function, E2F8 appears to belong to the E2F subgroup of the E2F family currently represented by E2F7. A similar subfamily of transcription factors E2L1&#x02013;3 has been described recently in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> suggesting evolutionary conservation. The members of this subgroup are repressors of E2F-mediated transcription and are characterized by sharing a distinct structure different from the other E2Fs. It contains a tandem repeat of sequences showing high homology with the consensus E2F DNA-binding domain. Another feature of this subgroup is the ability to bind consensus E2F DNA-binding sites in the absence of DP co-factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>).</p><p>The structure of the DNA binding domains of E2F7 and, recently E2F8, has been predicted by computational modelling to consist of three &#x003b1;-helices and a &#x003b2;-sheet and forms a homodimeric winged helix structure similar to that of the E2F-DP heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Here we have shown that purified recombinant E2F8 binds E2F sites suggesting that E2F8 also binds DNA as a homodimer in the absence of co-factors. The possibility that a factor associating with E2F8 could potentially be present in insect cells and contributes to binding cannot be ruled out. Although, it seems very unlikely because of the vast overexpression of E2F8 in insect cells and no detectable E2F-binding activity was observed in mock-infected cells (data not shown).</p><p>Together with pocket proteins, the E2F family controls transcription of a variety of growth and cell-cycle related genes in the different phases of the cell cycle. In the present study, using different cell synchronization protocols, we demonstrate that E2F8 is an E2F-target gene and the peak of transcription is confined to the late G1/early S-phase of the cell cycle. The transcriptional kinetics of E2F8 parallels that of Cyclin E1 and E2F7, and basal levels are reached concomitant with the peak of Cyclin A2 (data not shown) indicating that the functional role of E2F8 is restricted to S-phase. ChIP analysis demonstrated that both activating and repressing members of the E2F family occupy the E2F8 promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> suggesting that the tight control of E2F8 expression in S-phase is mediated by E2Fs. Owing to the low levels of E2F8 expression, we were unable to detect endogenously expressed E2F8 with the available antibodies we currently have. However, as mentioned previously, our observations suggest that the E2F8 protein, such as E2F7b, has a short half-life and its expression is limited to S-phase. The short half-life may be explained by the presence of two or three &#x02018;KEN&#x02019; motifs present in E2F8, which are conserved in E2F7. Such motifs are present in substrates of the APC/C complex and target proteins for degradation upon exit of mitosis and in non-proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>E2F8 represses a variety of E2F-responsive promoters in transient transfection assays. Furthermore, ectopic expression of E2F8 causes down-regulation of E2F-target genes and cell-cycle arrest. In contrast, a DNA-binding domain mutant of E2F8 exhibits no cell-cycle arrest and impaired repression of E2F-target genes, suggesting that E2F8 binds to a variety of E2F-target genes and that repression is mediated by direct binding to E2F-dependent promoters. Of note, the ectopic expression of E2F8 ablates cell-cycle progression and DNA replication in a major proportion of cells in S-phase, which probably reflects the down-regulation of E2F-target genes required for DNA synthesis. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that, when overexpressed, E2F8 acts as a general repressor of E2F-activated transcription. Previously, E2F7 was shown to be involved in the regulation of a subset of E2F-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). When taking into consideration that endogenous E2F8-expression levels are 5- to 20-fold lower than E2F7 in the cell lines we have analysed, it would indicate that E2F8 has a more restricted role in gene regulation. Other E2Fs have been shown to interact with promoters in a combinatorial fashion, where activator E2Fs are dependent on an adjacent CCAAT sites that is bound by the NF-Y transcription factor and binding of a repressor E2Fs are dependent on an adjacent CHR element in certain promoters. In general, it has been proposed that combinatorial interactions involving E2F proteins provide a basis for the specificity of transcription control in the pRB/E2F pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Some recent data have provided some candidate target genes potentially modulated by E2F repressors. E2F6, which modulates transcription through the recruitment of Polycomb group genes, specifically appears to bind and repress E2F-activated genes at the G1/S transition during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Similarly, E2F7 occupies promoters and represses genes expressed early in the S-phase such as <italic>E2F1</italic>, <italic>CDC6</italic> and <italic>CCNE1</italic> while it does not bind to the promoters of <italic>CDC2</italic> and <italic>CCNA2</italic>. The common theme from these studies is that repression of early E2F targets might be necessary for the balanced and timely regulation of genes involved in S-phase traversal. Whether E2F8 regulates an overlapping or specific subset of genes in the G1/S transition or modulates a different repertoire of genes is, presently, unclear. A conclusive determination of E2F targets regulated by endogenous expressed E2F8 will require the development of ChIP grade E2F8 antibodies and a detailed analysis of E2F8 occupancy at E2F-target genes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Several of the E2Fs appear to have overlapping functions suggesting E2F7 and E2F8 also might have redundant functions. However, they show very little conservation outside the DNA-binding domains and only short stretches of motifs in the N- and C- termini are similar indicating specific functions of the two polypeptides. The molecular mechanism of repression for E2F7 and E2F8 has not been elucidated. We have evidence that E2F7 binds a repressor through specific motifs in the C-terminal (L. D. Stefano and K. Helin, unpublished data). These motifs are not present in E2F8 suggesting a different mechanism of gene repression and a distinct role in gene regulation. Experiments are in progress directed at understanding the biological function, identifying target genes and the mechanisms of repression of E2F8.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank members of the Helin laboratory for fruitful discussions.

(<bold>C</bold>) Ectopic expression of E2F8 in TIG3 fibroblasts inhibits DNA synthesis and causes S-phase accumulation. TIG3 fibroblast were transduced and selected as described above. 800&#x02009;000 stably transduced cells were plated in 10 cm dishes and after 3 days of incubation the cells were pulsed with BrdU, stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flowcytometry. The transduced gene is indicated in the top of each panel. The left panels are dot plot analysis of BrdU stained cells, while the right panels represent the corresponding histograms. (<bold>D</bold>) Ectopic expression of E2F8 represses E2F-target genes and Cyclin B1. TIG3 fibroblast were transduced and selected as described above. 800.000 stably transduced cells were plated in 10 cm dishes and, after 3 days of incubation the cells were harvested. Total RNA was extracted for qPCR analysis. After reverse transcription using random priming, the E2F8, Cyclin A2, Cyclin E1 and Cyclin B1 transcripts were quantified by qPCR (real-time PCR). The transcript levels were normalized relative to &#x003b2;-actin. Left panel shows relative Cyclin A2, Cyclin E1 and Cyclin B1 levels. The transduced gene is indicated below each bar in the histogram. Right panel shows the relative transcript levels of endogenous E2F8 compared with levels transduced by the retroviruses carrying E2F8 or E2Fmt, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gki855f8"/></fig></sec></back></article>
