The sequence around Thr<sup>172</sup> is highly conserved between the two catalytic subunit isoforms of AMPK and the 12 AMPK-related kinases, and LKB1 has been shown to act upstream of all of them. In the present paper we report that none of the AMPK-related kinases tested could be phosphorylated or activated in intact cells or cell-free assays by CaMKK&#x003b2;, although we did observe a slow phosphorylation and activation of BRSK1 (brain-specific kinase 1) by CaMKK&#x003b1;. Despite recent reports, we could not find any evidence that the &#x003b1; and/or &#x003b2; subunits of AMPK formed a stable complex with CaMKK&#x003b2;. We also showed that increasing AMP concentrations in HeLa cells (which lack LKB1) had no effect on basal AMPK phosphorylation, but enhanced the ability of agents that increase intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to activate AMPK. This is consistent with the effect of AMP on phosphorylation of Thr<sup>172</sup> being due to inhibition of dephosphorylation, and confirms that the effect of AMP is independent of the upstream kinase utilized.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)</kwd><kwd>AMPactivated protein kinase-related kinase (ARK)</kwd><kwd>Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulindependent protein kinase (CaMK)</kwd><kwd>Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase</kwd><kwd>AICAR, 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside</kwd><kwd>AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase</kwd><kwd>ARK, AMPK-related kinase</kwd><kwd>BRSK, brain-specific kinase</kwd><kwd>CaMK, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase</kwd><kwd>CaMKK, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase</kwd><kwd>FBS, foetal bovine serum</kwd><kwd>GFP, green fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>GST, glutathione transferase</kwd><kwd>HEK, human embryonic kidney</kwd><kwd>MARK, microtubule affinity-regulating kinase</kwd><kwd>MO25, mouse protein 25</kwd><kwd>NUAK, SNF1 (sucrose-non-fermenting kinase-1)-like kinase</kwd><kwd>SIK, salt-inducible kinase</kwd><kwd>STRAD, Ste20-related adaptor</kwd><kwd>TBS, Tris-buffered saline</kwd><kwd>UBA, ubiquitin-associated</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><ref-count count="50"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is an energy-sensing system involved in regulating energy balance at both the cellular and the whole-body levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The kinase occurs as heterotrimeric complexes composed of a catalytic &#x003b1; subunit and regulatory &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits, with each subunit existing in mammals as isoforms encoded by multiple genes (&#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2; &#x003b2;1, &#x003b2;2; &#x003b3;1, &#x003b3;2, &#x003b3;3). Metabolic stresses that inhibit ATP synthesis (e.g. hypoxia, hypoglycaemia) or that stimulate ATP consumption (e.g. muscle contraction) cause an increase in the cellular ADP/ATP ratio, which is amplified by adenylate kinase into an even larger increase in the AMP/ATP ratio. AMP and ATP bind antagonistically to two sites formed by the four tandem CBS (cystathionine &#x003b2;-synthase) motifs on the &#x003b3; subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The kinase is only active after phosphorylation of a critical threonine residue within the activation loop of the kinase domain (Thr<sup>172</sup> in rat &#x003b1;1/&#x003b1;2) by upstream kinases. The major upstream kinase in most cells was identified to be a complex between the tumour suppressor LKB1 and two accessory subunits, STRAD (Ste20-related adaptor) and MO25 (mouse protein 25) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. LKB1 appears to be constitutively active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and may therefore phosphorylate AMPK continually, but under basal conditions the phosphate appears to be immediately removed by protein phosphatases. However, binding of AMP to the AMPK &#x003b3; subunits inhibits dephosphorylation of Thr<sup>172</sup>, an effect that is antagonized by high concentrations of ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, binding of AMP (but not ATP) triggers a further allosteric activation of the phosphorylated kinase by up to 10-fold, with the combination of these two effects producing &#x0003e;1000-fold activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Both stimulatory effects appear to occur because AMP binding relieves the inhibitory effects of an auto-inhibitory domain on the &#x003b1; subunit, which binds to the kinase domain on the opposite side to the substrate-binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This represents a sensitive switch mechanism that produces a large activation of AMPK in response to a small increase in the cellular AMP/ATP ratio.</p><p>Some human tumour cells (e.g. HeLa cells) do not express LKB1, but AMPK can still be phosphorylated at Thr<sup>172</sup> and activated in such cells using Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophores. This led to the discovery that the CaMKKs [CaMK (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase) kinases], especially CaMKK&#x003b2;, could act as alternative upstream kinases that can phosphorylate Thr<sup>172</sup> on AMPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. CaMKK&#x003b1; and CaMKK&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] were originally discovered as CaMKs that acted upstream of CaMKI and CaMKIV. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>&#x02192;CaMKK&#x02192;AMPK pathway is triggered by a rise in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> without any requirement for an increase in AMP, and is responsible for AMPK activation in response to K<sup>+</sup>-induced depolarization in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], muscarinic activation in neuroblastoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], thrombin activation of endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], treatment of smooth muscle cells with vasoconstrictors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and stimulation of antigen receptors in T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The sequence around Thr<sup>172</sup> on the AMPK &#x003b1; subunits is highly conserved (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) in the kinase domain sequences of kinases [termed ARKs (AMPK-related kinases)], that lie on the same branch of the human kinome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. By studying phosphorylation in cell-free assays and in cells lacking LKB1, including LKB1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse embryo fibroblasts and HeLa cells, it was shown that at least 12 of these were also dependent on LKB1 for basal phosphorylation of the threonine residue equivalent to Thr<sup>172</sup>, and hence for basal activity. These include the brain-specific kinases BRSK1 and BRSK2 (also known as SAD-B and SAD-A), SIK (salt-inducible kinase) 1, SIK2 and SIK3 (also known as SIK, QIK and QSK respectively), NUAK [SNF1 (sucrose-non-fermenting kinase-1)-like kinase] 1 and NUAK2 (also known as ARK5 and SNARK), MARK (microtubule affinity-regulating kinase) 1, MARK2, MARK3 and MARK4, and the testis-specific kinase SNRK (SNF1-related kinase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we have addressed three questions regarding the regulation of AMPK and the ARKs by CaMKKs. First, it had not been established whether the ARKs are substrates for CaMKKs, as is AMPK itself. Secondly, it has recently been claimed that CaMKK&#x003b2; can form a complex with the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits of AMPK in the absence of a &#x003b3; subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], a hypothesis that we wished to confirm. Thirdly, if the effect of AMP on phosphorylation of Thr<sup>172</sup> on AMPK is due to inhibition of dephosphorylation we were puzzled as to why, in cells such as HeLa cells that express CaMKK&#x003b2; but lack LKB1, AMPK is not activated by treatments that increase intracellular AMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec><title>Materials and proteins</title><p>STO-609 was from Tocris Bioscience and calmodulin was from CN Biosciences.

To test this hypothesis, we initially studied whether overexpressed CaMKK&#x003b2; would co-precipitate with endogenous AMPK from extracts of HEK-293 cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>(A) shows that, although CaMKK&#x003b2; was readily detectable by Western blot analysis in the crude cell lysates, none was detected by Western blot analysis in immunoprecipitates made using anti-AMPK-&#x003b1;1/&#x003b1;2 antibodies (although we could readily detect the &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits of AMPK).

It has been previously shown that co-expression with &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits greatly increases expression of GST-tagged &#x003b1;1 in COS7 cells, most likely because the heterotrimeric complex is more stable and is degraded less rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Consistent with this, co-expression of GFP&#x02013;&#x003b1;1 with &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b3;1, but not &#x003b2;1 alone, led to a 3&#x02013;4-fold increase in its expression; co-expression with &#x003b3;1 together with GFP&#x02013;&#x003b1;1 also increased the expression of &#x003b2;1. When CaMKK&#x003b2; was expressed, the protein was expressed at equal levels irrespective of whether or not particular AMPK subunits had been co-expressed. If, as suggested by Anderson et al.

In fact, the opposite was observed: when GFP&#x02013;&#x003b1;1 and &#x003b2;1 were co-expressed with CaMKK&#x003b2;, their expression level was reduced (compare lane 7 with lane 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C).

This raised the question as to why drugs such as AICAR (5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside), which is converted into the AMP mimetic ZMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], or phenformin, which increases cellular AMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], do not activate AMPK in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], even though CaMKK&#x003b2; is expressed and is capable of phosphorylating Thr<sup>172</sup> in those cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. One explanation was that the activity of CaMKK&#x003b2; in cells with basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> is so low that the endogenous protein phosphatase activity is sufficient to cause net dephosphorylation of Thr<sup>172</sup>, even though dephosphorylation is being inhibited by AMP. To test this idea, we incubated HeLa cells with increasing concentrations of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore A23187 in the presence and absence of phenformin. As found previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], in the absence of A23187, phenformin did not give a significant stimulation of AMPK activity, phosphorylation of Thr<sup>172</sup> on the AMPK &#x003b1; subunits, or phosphorylation of the AMPK site on ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase). As expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], in the absence of phenformin, concentrations of A23187 up to 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M increasingly stimulated AMPK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), as well as phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> reveals the new result that the presence of phenformin sensitized the cells to A23187. Thus the presence of phenformin shifted the curve of AMPK phosphorylation and activation against A23187 concentration to the left. A stimulation of the activation of AMPK, and the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC by phenformin was particularly evident at 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M A23187.

The level of AMP in HeLa cells under basal conditions was too low to measure accurately, although it could be detected in cells treated with phenformin and A23187 (results not shown).

Phenformin and 2-deoxyglucose did not cause phosphorylation of ACC or AMPK, or activation of AMPK, in HeLa cells that had not been treated with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore, despite the fact that 2-deoxyglucose produced a large rise in ADP/ATP ratio (any small effect of phenformin on the ADP/ATP ratio was not significant). However, in cells treated with 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M A23187, both phenformin and 2-deoxyglucose significantly stimulated AMPK activity, and increased phosphorylation of ACC and AMPK, over and above the effect of A23187 alone, with the effect of phenformin being larger than that of 2-deoxyglucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B).

We have shown previously that HeLa cells lack LKB1 but express both CaMKK&#x003b1; and CaMKK&#x003b2;, although it was only when CaMKK&#x003b2; was knocked down using siRNA (small interfering RNA) that the phosphorylation and activation of AMPK in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophores was reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus it seems that neither CaMKK&#x003b1; nor CaMKK&#x003b2; are capable of activating any of the ARKs that are expressed in HeLa cells, i.e. SIK1 (SIK), SIK2 (QIK), SIK3 (QSK), NUAK2 (SNARK) or any of the MARKs. Similarly, overexpression of CaMKK&#x003b2; caused activation of AMPK in HeLa cells, but failed to activate any of the ARKs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>BRSK1 (SAD-B) and BRSK2 (SAD-A) are brain-specific kinases that are not expressed in HeLa cells. Fujimoto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] recently reported a search for proteins from rat brain extracts that interacted with the kinase domain of CaMKK&#x003b1;, and detected both the &#x003b1;1 subunit of AMPK and BRSK1 (SAD-B). They also reported that BRSK1 could be phosphorylated (at Thr<sup>189</sup>, equivalent to Thr<sup>172</sup> on AMPK-&#x003b1;1) and activated by both CaMKK&#x003b1; and CaMKK&#x003b2;, although the rate of phosphorylation was much lower with CaMKK&#x003b2; than CaMKK&#x003b1;. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> confirm that CaMKK&#x003b1; is capable of phosphorylating and activating BRSK1 in cell-free assays. However, in the present study neither BRSK1 nor BRSK2 was significantly phosphorylated by CaMKK&#x003b2;, although the concentration used was sufficient to fully activate AMPK. It should also be pointed out that the concentration of CaMKK&#x003b1; used to phosphorylate BRSK1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> was approx. 20-fold higher than that required to obtain a comparable level of phosphorylation of AMPK-&#x003b1;1 (results not shown). In addition, AMPK is itself a relatively poor substrate for CaMKK&#x003b1;, with CaMKK&#x003b1; being approx. 7-fold less active against AMPK than CaMKK&#x003b2; when the activities of the two CaMKKs were normalized using phosphorylation of CaMKI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus BRSK1 appears to be a poor substrate for CaMKK&#x003b1; and an even poorer subtrate for CaMKK&#x003b2;, and we propose that LKB1 is the major upstream kinase for BRSK1 and BRSK2 <italic>in vivo</italic>. In support of this are results of Barnes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], who knocked-out LKB1 in pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex by crossing mice harbouring a conditional &#x02018;floxed&#x02019; allele with mice expressing <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase from the <italic>Emx1</italic> promoter. This almost abolished phosphorylation of BRSK2 (SAD-A) and BRSK1 (SAD-B) at the threonine residues equivalent to Thr<sup>172</sup>, while not affecting phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr<sup>172</sup>. This finding can be explained if CaMKK&#x003b2; (or CaMKK&#x003b1;) provides an alternative upstream pathway for activation of AMPK, but not BRSK1 and BRSK2, in the cerebral cortex. Also in agreement with our results, Bright et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] reported that neither BRSK1 nor BRSK2 was activated in CCL13 cells overexpressing CaMKK&#x003b2;, while Uboha et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] reported that CaMKK partially purified from mouse cortex (isoform not specified) failed to phosphorylate MARK2 in cell-free assays.</p><p>Given that the sequences around the threonine residue in the activation loop are highly conserved between AMPK and the ARKs, it remains unclear why the latter should be phosphorylated and activated by LKB1 complexes, but not by CaMKK-&#x003b1; or -&#x003b2;. Our findings suggest that some feature of the structure of the ARKs, other than the primary sequence of the activation loop, may be required to determine this specificity. This is supported by previous studies showing that a peptide derived from CaMKIV was a very poor substrate for CaMKK&#x003b1; compared with CaMKIV itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], and that thermal denaturation of CaMKI or CaMKIV abolished their phosphorylation by CaMKK&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Thus the CaMKKs appear to recognize determinants on CaMKI and CaMKIV other than just the primary sequence of the activation loop.</p><p>Our findings have important implications regarding the regulation of the ARKs. None of them appears to be interacting with the regulatory &#x003b2; or &#x003b3; subunits of the AMPK complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and, consistent with this, those that are expressed in skeletal muscle (SIK2, SIK3, MARK2/3 and MARK4) are not phosphorylated or activated when AMPK is activated in muscle by contraction, AICAR or phenformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The results of the present study show that the ARKs, unlike AMPK itself, are not regulated by increases in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> via activation of CaMKK. That being the case, what are the upstream signals that regulate the ARKs? In most cases this remains unclear, although there is some information available in the case of SIK1. SIK1 was discovered as a protein kinase induced in the adrenal glands of rats fed a high-salt diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and is also induced at the transcriptional level by glucagon and forskolin in primary rat hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumour cells treated with adrenocorticotrophic hormone, SIK1 is phosphorylated at a C-terminal site by PKA (protein kinase A), resulting in its translocation to the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Thus SIK1 may be regulated by altered transcription and/or by altered subcellular localization rather than by altered phosphorylation by LKB1.</p><p>Anderson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] recently provided evidence suggesting that CaMKK&#x003b2; (also known as CaMKK2) can form a stable complex with the AMPK &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits. They expressed FLAG-tagged CaMKK&#x003b2; in HEK-293 cells and, using anti-FLAG antibodies, showed co-precipitation not only of calmodulin, but also of AMPK &#x003b1; subunits and ACC, the latter two detected using phosphospecific antibodies against Thr<sup>172</sup> (AMPK) and Ser<sup>79</sup> (ACC). These co-precipitation events appeared to be dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> because they were not observed in the presence of EDTA and EGTA. Anderson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] also detected in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates the &#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2, &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 subunits of AMPK, but not &#x003b3;1, although they could detect the latter in cell extracts. They therefore proposed that CaMKK&#x003b2; could replace the &#x003b3; subunit within the AMPK complex. The results of the present study do not support this concept. When CaMKK&#x003b2; was overexpressed in HEK-293 cells, we could not detect any AMPK-&#x003b1;, -&#x003b2; or -&#x003b3; subunits in an immunoprecipitate made using anti-CaMKK&#x003b2; antibodies, either with or without EDTA and EGTA in the lysis and immunoprecipitation buffers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). In the converse experiment (which was not reported by Anderson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]) we found that no CaMKK&#x003b2; was detected in an anti-AMPK-&#x003b1;1/&#x003b1;2 immunoprecipitate, although we could readily detect the &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits of AMPK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). This suggests to us that the AMPK subunits recovered by Anderson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] in their anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates may have been an artefact caused by the high level of FLAG&#x02013;CaMKK&#x003b2; expression in the cells.</p><p>We also addressed the same question in a different way, making use of previous findings that the &#x003b1; subunits of AMPK are unstable unless co-expressed with &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This phenomenon can be explained by recent structural studies showing that the C-terminal region of the &#x003b2; subunit forms extensive interactions with the C-terminal domain of &#x003b1; and with the N-terminal region of &#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. If these subunits do not find their interaction partners, they may be recognized as misfolded proteins and become degraded. We argued that, if the AMPK &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits can form a complex with CaMKK&#x003b2; in the absence of the &#x003b3; subunit, then co-expression with CaMKK&#x003b2; should stabilize the &#x003b1; subunit in the presence of a &#x003b2; subunit. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>(C) shows that this is not the case: in the presence of &#x003b2;1 the &#x003b3;1 subunit stabilizes the &#x003b1;1 subunit, but CaMKK&#x003b2; does not substitute for &#x003b3;1 in this respect. Rather than stabilizing the AMPK &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits, overexpression of CaMKK&#x003b2; decreased the level of expression of all three AMPK subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C), perhaps because the transfected DNA was competing for the available biosynthetic machinery.</p><p>Finally, the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> show that the two known mechanisms by which phosphorylation of AMPK is activated, i.e. inhibition of dephosphorylation by AMP and increased phosphorylation via activation of CaMKK&#x003b2; by Ca<sup>2+</sup> can, under the right circumstances, be synergistic. They also provide an explanation for our previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] that agents that cause increases in AMP (e.g. phenformin) or that are converted into an AMP mimetic (AICAR) do not increase phosphorylation and activation of AMPK in HeLa cells. The basal rate of phosphorylation of Thr<sup>172</sup> in these cells, which lack LKB1 and would only have the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent activity of CaMKK&#x003b2;, appears to be too low for any effect of increased AMP on dephosphorylation to become evident. However, if CaMKK&#x003b2; is activated using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore A23187 at sub-optimal concentration (3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M), the effect of a rise in AMP to inhibit dephosphorylation now becomes apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In agreement with our findings, Yu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] have recently reported that A23187 and AICAR act in an additive manner to inhibit cell proliferation and/or survival in HeLa cells.</p><p>A somewhat unexpected finding shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> was that, although treatment with 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M A23187 alone did not significantly increase the ADP/ATP ratio, when combined with 10&#x000a0;mM phenformin it caused a much larger increase in this ratio than that caused by phenformin alone. By contrast, 2-deoxyglucose treatment increased ADP/ATP, but there was no additional effect when it was added together with A23187. Phenformin is an inhibitor of complex I of the respiratory chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], thus potentially causing inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis, whereas A23187 is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore that causes release of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, potentially increasing ATP turnover due to activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps. Although 2-deoxyglucose is often described as an inhibitor of glycolysis, its major effect may be to accelerate ATP consumption, because it is rapidly phosphorylated within the cell to 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate. We propose that a combination of treatments that both inhibit ATP synthesis and accelerate ATP turnover (phenformin and A23187), as opposed to two different treatments that accelerate ATP turnover (2-deoxyglucose and A23187) may make it more difficult for the cells to maintain their energy status. The very large increase in AMPK activity in response to addition of both A23187 and phenformin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A) could be explained by an increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> coupled with a larger increase in AMP than that caused by 2-deoxyglucose. Whatever the explanation, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> show that treatments which elevate cellular AMP (phenformin and 2-deoxyglucose) can, under the right circumstances (elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>), cause increased phosphorylation and activation of AMPK even in cells lacking LKB1. Thus the effect of AMP on phosphorylation of AMPK is independent of the upstream kinase utilized.</p><p>Increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> tends to switch on many processes that consume ATP, such as operation of ion pumps or channels, interaction of motor proteins, and membrane trafficking and secretion. The ability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and AMP to additively activate AMPK to restore cellular energy balance may therefore have physiological relevance.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION</title><p>Sarah Fogarty designed and performed the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1&#x02013;5</xref>.
