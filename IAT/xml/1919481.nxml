Here, we determined the steady-state levels of these core transcription components and examined the consequences of purposeful elevation of h-mtTFB1 or h-mtTFB2 in HeLa cells. On a per molecule basis, we find an <bold>&#x0223c;</bold>6-fold excess of POLRMT to mtDNA and <bold>&#x0223c;</bold>3-fold more h-mtTFB2 than h-mtTFB1. We also estimate h-mtTFA at <bold>&#x0223c;</bold>50 molecules/mtDNA, a ratio predicted to support robust transcription, but not to coat mtDNA. Consistent with a role for h-mtTFB2 in transcription and transcription-primed replication, increased mitochondrial DNA and transcripts result from its over-expression. This is accompanied by increased translation rates of most, but not all mtDNA-encoded proteins. Over-expression of h-mtTFB1 did not significantly influence these parameters, but did result in increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, h-mtTFB1 mRNA and protein are elevated in response to h-mtTFB2 over-expression, suggesting the existence of a retrograde signal to the nucleus to coordinately regulate expression of these related factors. Altogether, our results provide a framework for understanding the regulation of human mitochondrial transcription <italic>in vivo</italic> and define distinct roles for h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 in mitochondrial biogenesis and gene expression that together likely fine-tune mitochondrial function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Mitochondria are multifunctional organelles in eukaryotic cells involved in numerous metabolic activities, the production of ATP, and regulation of apoptosis. Consistent with their bacterial ancestry and absolutely critical for their function, is the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) housed in the matrix of the organelle. In humans, the 16&#x02009;569-bp circular mtDNA molecule contains 37 genes encoding thirteen essential integral membrane proteins of the ATP-producing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, two rRNA subunits of the mitochondrial ribosomes, and 22 tRNAs required for mitochondrial translation in the matrix. Therefore, the vast majority of the &#x0223c;1500 proteins that localize and function in mitochondria are not mtDNA-encoded, but rather are products of nuclear genes that are imported into the organelles. An important consequence of this arrangement is that there must be coordination of nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression in order to maintain organelle homeostasis and to properly regulate mitochondrial activities. This is uniquely pertinent to the assembly of the OXPHOS system and mitochondrial ribosomes, which are composed of subunits encoded by both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. That is, the coordination of synthesis of subunits in mitochondria (the 13 OXPHOS subunits and two rRNAs) with the import of those from the cytoplasm (the &#x0223c;70 OXPHOS subunits and &#x0223c;80 ribosomal proteins) is presumably critical to regulate the biogenesis of these large complexes. In this context, it is also important to consider that all of the machinery required for transcription and replication of mtDNA is a subset of the nucleus-encoded factors that are targeted to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). How the relative amounts and altered expression of these key regulatory factors influence expression of mtDNA-encoded genes and subsequent assembly of the mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes and ribosomes is largely unknown.</p><p>The core protein components required for human mitochondrial transcription have recently been defined as a mixed three-component system comprising a T-odd bacteriophage-related mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT), the high mobility-group-box mitochondrial transcription factor A (h-mtTFA/TFAM), and two dual-function transcription factors (h-mtTFB1/TFB1M and h-mtTFB2/TFB2M) that are orthologs of an ancestral bacterial rRNA methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>). In terms of transcription, POLRMT/h-mtTFB1 and POLRMT/h-mtTFB2 complexes are each capable of initiation at the mitochondrial L-strand promoter (LSP) and H-strand promoter 1 (HSP1) in the presence of h-mtTFA, although POLRMT/h-mtTFB2 complexes are reported to be significantly more active than POLRMT/h-mtTFB1 complexes <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). However, at specific h-mtTFA: DNA ratios the activities of the two complexes are altered to differing degrees. This leaves open the likely possibility that the rates of transcription <italic>in vivo</italic> can be dictated by the relative concentrations of mtDNA and each of the transcription components in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Estimates of h-mtTFA abundance in cells of human and <italic>Xenopus</italic> have been reported by several groups, but with conflicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9">6&#x02013;9</xref>), and the relative or absolute amounts of POLRMT, h-mtTFA, h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 have not been systematically examined. Thus a basic definition of the mitochondrial transcription system <italic>in vivo</italic> is still lacking, a situation that limits our understanding of how mitochondrial gene expression is regulated.</p><p>As already mentioned, the recently identified h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 transcription factors are homologous to rRNA methyltransferases. Specifically, they are related to a large family of site-specific methyltransferases that catalyzes the N6-dimethylation of two adjacent adenine residues in a conserved stem-loop found in small subunit rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In bacteria this modification, while not essential, influences both stability and fidelity of ribosomes and is thought to modulate translational output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>). In the original report describing h-mtTFB1, this transcription factor was postulated to have rRNA methyltransferase activity based on its ability to bind the methyl-group donating co-factor <italic>s</italic>-adenosylmethionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Subsequent work showed that both h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 can functionally replace the homologous KsgA dimethyltransferase in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), demonstrating that both proteins have retained this enzymatic activity. Interestingly, in this assay, h-mtTFB2 has significantly lower activity than h-mtTFB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). This, coupled to their differing relative activity with regard to transcription output and the concentration of h-mtTFA, again suggests a potentially interesting regulatory scenario in which differential effects on mitochondrial transcription and ribosome biogenesis/function (via differential rRNA methylation) are mediated by the relative abundance or activity of h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Interestingly, other functions for members of this class of rRNA methyltransferases have been assigned that are independent of the catalytic activity. For example, the yeast Dim1p cytoplasmic rRNA methyltransferase plays a role in rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Likewise, we have shown that the transcription factor activity of h-mtTFB1 is unaffected by mutations that inactivate its rRNA methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Thus, whether h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 have additional roles beyond transcription and rRNA methylation remains a formal possibility.</p><p>To date, the only studies regarding the function of metazoan mtTFB transcription factors <italic>in vivo</italic> were performed on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins using cultured Schneider cells. Consistent with a role for dm-mtTFB2 in transcription and transcription-primed mtDNA replication, RNAi knock-down or over-expression results in decreased or increased steady-state levels of mitochondrial RNA and mtDNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In contrast, no effect on mtDNA copy number or the steady-state levels of mitochondrial transcripts is observed when expression of dm-mtTFB1 is knocked down or over-expressed in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). However, RNAi knock-down of dm-mtTFB1 does result in a reduction in the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis, indicating a role for this protein in regulating mitochondrial translation (perhaps via its rRNA methyltransferase activity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). These results demonstrate that the functions of dm-mtTFB1 and dm-mtTFB2 are not fully redundant <italic>in vivo</italic> and suggest that the primary role of dm-mtTFB2 is to regulate transcription and/or mtDNA copy number and that of dm-mtTFB1 is to modulate translation. However, it is important to note that these studies do not discount the possibility of partially overlapping functions for each factor in transcription and rRNA methylation that one might predict based on the fact that both h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 have retained both of these activities over the course of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Furthermore, given the significant differences between mammals and flies in general and with regard to mitochondrial genome organization and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>), it is important not to generalize any relationships described in this (or any other) model system without direct confirmation in human cells. Here, we describe our analysis of the human mitochondrial transcription system in HeLa cells that defines the relative steady-state levels of the entire human mitochondrial transcription machinery for the first time and elucidates novel properties and functions of h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 <italic>in vivo</italic> via their purposeful over-expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids for bacterial and human cell expression of h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2</title><p>Bacterial expression vectors for production of h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 in <italic>E. coli</italic> were created using pET21b (Promega). The h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 cDNAs were amplified using primers 5&#x02032;-AACATATGGCTGCCTCCGG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-AAGAGCTCGAGTCTGTAATTCTC-3&#x02032; or primers 5&#x02032;-AACATATGTGGATCCCAGTGG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GCGGCCGCCCTATCTTCCAGGGTTC-3&#x02032;, respectively, and the resulting PCR products were ligated into pGEMT-Easy (Promega). These plasmids were then digested with appropriate restriction enzymes for ligation in pET21b (<italic>Nde</italic>I and <italic>Xho</italic>I for h-mtTFB1 or <italic>Nde</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I for h-mtTFB2). To generate plasmids for over-expression in human cells, the h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 cDNAs were both cut from previously described vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) using EcoRV and NotI and ligated into pcDNA3.1 zeo (+) (Invitrogen) cut with the same enzymes. The vector used to express POLRMT in bacteria was pProEX-Htb (Invitrogen). A portion of the human cDNA encoding amino acids 41&#x02013;1250 and the stop codon was cloned into the BamH1 and XhoI of this vector via a BamH1&#x02013;Sal1 restriction fragment. Amino acids 1&#x02013;40 were deleted since they compose the mitochondrial localization sequence (MLS) that is predicted to be removed by proteases during import into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, in place of the MLS, there are 29 unnatural amino acids fused to POLRMT that include a initiator methionine, a His6 tag, a spacer of seven amino acids, a TEV protease cleavage site, and another spacer of six amino acids. The vector has an intact <italic>E. coli</italic> lacI<sup>q</sup> gene allowing POLRMT expression from the <italic>trc</italic> promoter to be regulated by addition of isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG; Sigma).</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of recombinant proteins</title><p>BL21-Codonplus&#x000ae; <italic>E. coli</italic> (Stratagene) were transformed with pET21b vectors containing either h-mtTFB1 or h-mtTFB2. For purification of h-mtTFB1, an overnight culture of bacteria was diluted into 1&#x02009;l of LB media and grown at 37&#x000b0;C until culture reached an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.8. IPTG was added to 1&#x02009;mM for induction of expression and the culture was allowed to incubate at room temperature with shaking for 24&#x02009;h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, then pellets were resuspended in 80&#x02009;ml of lysis buffer (50&#x02009;mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0; 0.3&#x02009;M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween-20 and 10&#x02009;mM imidazole). Cells were lysed by sonication and the suspension was cleared by centrifugation. The clarified lysate was applied to a BD-Talon column (BD Biosciences). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer and eluted with three column volumes of lysis buffer plus 150&#x02009;mM imidazole. Fractions were assayed for presence of mtTFB1 by SDS-PAGE followed by either coomassie staining or western blot. Peak fractions were combined, concentrated and dialyzed into storage buffer (20&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 0.5&#x02009;mM EDTA, 0.25&#x02009;M sucrose, 15% glycerol, 1&#x02009;mM DTT and 1&#x02009;mM PMSF). Protein concentration was determined with a protein assay kit from Bio-Rad and confirmed by SDS-PAGE and coomassie staining with comparison against a BSA standard curve. For purification of h-mtTFB2, the same procedure was followed for mtTFB1, except that the protein was found to be highly insoluble and present in the pellet after sonication. Pellets after sonication were resuspended in lysis buffer with the addition of 0.1% Triton, 5&#x02009;mM BME, 1&#x02009;mM PMSF and 6&#x02009;M guanidine-HCl. The solution was stirred overnight at 4&#x000b0;C then clarified by centrifugation. The protein solution was added to a Talon column as before, then washed with 10 column volumes of the pellet resuspension buffer. The column was eluted with three column volumes of the same buffer plus 200&#x02009;mM imidazole. Fractions were analyzed as above and peak fractions were collected. Concentrated samples were dialyzed extensively against storage buffer and protein concentration was determined. Purification of h-mtTFA was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), except the process was stopped after the BioRex-70 column (Bio-Rad). The expression and purification of POLRMT was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>HeLa cell growth and transfection</title><p>For transfection of HeLa cells (Clonetech) with h-mtTFB1 or h-mtTFB2 over-expression plasmids, cell were seeded at 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> per 10&#x02009;cm dish in DMEM (Sigma) plus 10% Bovine Growth Serum (Hyclone) and allowed to grow for 24&#x02009;h.

Cells were grown to confluence, subcultured into 6-cm dishes in growth media plus 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml Zeocin and grown for 48&#x02009;h. One dish for each clone was harvested and assayed for protein expression via western blot. Remaining plates were harvested and stored in growth media plus 10% DMSO at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

Our approach was to use immunoblotting to establish the levels of the mitochondrial transcription machinery on a total cell and mitochondrial basis. This method requires antibodies that are specific for their target, especially for homologous proteins that are very similar in size. Since h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 share a large degree of sequence similarity and are predicted to migrate similarly on polyacrylamide gels, it was unclear if antibodies we had generated would cross react with the paralogous protein and confound our analysis. Therefore, we first generated peptide antibodies against h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 (see Materials and Methods section) and determined their specificity by assessing reactivity toward purified full-length recombinant h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 by immunoblotting. We found that these antibodies were indeed highly specific for their targets showing no reactivity with the paralogous protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Having antibodies capable of specifically detecting each of the four human mitochondrial transcription proteins, as well as known amounts of corresponding recombinant proteins, allowed us to determine for the first time their relative abundance. We purified mitochondria from logarithmically growing HeLa cells and performed quantitative western blot analysis of POLRMT, h-mtTFA, h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 on known amounts of total mitochondrial protein. For each protein analyzed, multiple dilutions of total mitochondrial protein or total whole-cell lysate were probed in parallel with a dilution series of known amounts of recombinant protein to allow the amount of each transcription component relative to the total amount of mitochondrial lysate to be determined. Representative western blots and standard curves showing linearity of the assays employed are shown in Supplementary Figure S1. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>h-mtTFB2 is processed <italic>in vivo</italic> and its over-expression in HeLa cells results in a coordinated increase of h-mtTFB1, but not POLRMT or h-mtTFA.

The blot was probed as indicated using peptide antibodies that distinguish h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 (&#x003b1;-h-mtTFB1 and &#x003b1;-h-mtTFB2) and an antibody that recognizes HSP60 (&#x003b1;-HSP60) that was used as a mitochondrial loading control.

For whole-cell lysates, we were only able to accurately measure h-mtTFA levels and found 11.1 &#x000b1; 2.4&#x02009;fg of protein per cell (data not shown). Next, we determined the number of molecules/cell based on the amount of total mitochondrial protein isolated from 4.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells. We found there to be 25.2 &#x000b1; 2.51&#x02009;pg of mitochondrial protein per cell with recoveries of 75&#x02013;80% of total mitochondria for three separate experiments based on HSP60 and h-mtTFA immunoblots (data not shown). These measurements result in 2.52 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>, 1.35 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>, 4.29 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> and 3.12 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> molecules per cell for h-mtTFA, h-mtTFB1, h-mtTFB2 and POLRMT, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This amount of h-mtTFA from mitochondrial samples agreed well with our measurement in whole-cell lysates at 2.78 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> molecules per cell (data not shown). Finally, we also determined the mtDNA copy number in the cells to be 5010 &#x000b1; 386 using quantitative real-time PCR (Supplementary Figure S2). From these data, we calculated the relative levels of the four transcription proteins on a molecule/cell basis and as function of the number of mtDNA molecules/cell (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, there is &#x0223c;3-fold more h-mtTFB2 than h-mtTFB1 in these cells, which results in a close to 1:1 relationship between h-mtTFB2 and POLRMT (1.37:1), but an excess of POLRMT to h-mtTFB1 (2.31:1). Furthermore, our measurements place POLRMT at an &#x0223c;6-fold molar excess over the number of mtDNA molecules and between 42 and 58&#x02009;h-mtTFA molecules/mtDNA molecule in HeLa cells. Our h-mtTFA to mtDNA ratio is consistent with that observed by Wiesner and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), but more than 30-fold lower than that proposed by Kang and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). <table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Relative steady-state abundance of the mitochondrial transcription components in HeLa cells</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Molecules/cell</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Molecules/ mtDNA</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Molecules: h-mtTFA</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Molecules: h-mtTFB1</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Molecules: h-mtTFB2</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Molecules:POLRMT</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">h-mtTFA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.52 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> &#x000b1; 4.86 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.3 &#x000b1; 8.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.6 &#x000b1; 3.59:1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.87 &#x000b1; 1.13:1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.07 &#x000b1; 1.56:1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">h-mtTFB1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.35 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> &#x000b1; 4.17 &#x000d7; 10<sup>2</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.7 &#x000b1; .08</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:18.6 &#x000b1; 3.59</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:3.17 &#x000b1; .21</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:2.31 &#x000b1; .15</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">h-mtTFB2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.29 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> &#x000b1; 2.80 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.57 &#x000b1; .56</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:5.87 &#x000b1; 1.13</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.17 &#x000b1; 21.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:37 &#x000b1; .09:1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">POLRMT</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.12 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> &#x000b1; 1.99 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.23 &#x000b1; .39</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:8.07 &#x000b1; 1.56</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.31 &#x000b1; 15.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1:1.37 &#x000b1; .09</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec><title>h-mtTFB2 is cleaved upon import and its over-expression results in an increase in h-mtTFB1 levels</title><p>With a determination of relative levels of the mitochondrial transcription machinery in hand, we next set out to examine the consequence of altering the relative amounts of these proteins on mitochondrial gene expression and to determine if their expression levels are coordinately regulated. To do this, we created stable HeLa cell lines that over-express either h-mtTFB1 or h-mtTFB2. From our initial analysis of these lines, we immediately made two novel observations. First, the mobility of h-mtTFB2 isolated from cells was significantly faster than that of the corresponding recombinant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Since many matrix-localized mitochondrial proteins have an N-terminal localization sequence (MLS) that is often removed by proteases upon import, we hypothesized that this was the case for h-mtTFB2. Consistent with this, using SignalP (a MLS and cleavage site prediction program), a single high-probability mitochondrial peptidase cleavage site for h-mtTFB2 was found between amino acids 30 and 31 (data not shown). No such cleavage site was predicted for h-mtTFB1, consistent with no obvious change in mobility of this protein relative to its recombinant control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Furthermore, mapping amino acids 5&#x02013;22 onto a helical-wheel diagram reveals a pattern consistent with a putative amphipathic helix (data not shown), which is another common attribute of an MLS. Finally, using a peptide antibody (TFB2-1) that was made against amino acids 2&#x02013;20 of h-mtTFB2 (which are predicted to be removed by SignalP), we were unable to successfully detect endogenous h-mtTFB2 by western blotting (data not shown). However using the peptide antibody (TFB2-2) generated against amino acids 49&#x02013;70, which is used throughout this study, we readily detect endogenous h-mtTFB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Taken together, these data suggest that amino acids 1&#x02013;30 likely comprise a significant portion of the MLS for h-mtTFB2 and are removed upon import.</p><p>In addition to the increased mobility of h-mtTFB2 described above, we also found that in the cell lines that over-express h-mtTFB2, there was a corresponding increase in the steady-state level of h-mtTFB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, compare lanes 6, 7 and 8 to lane 4). However, the converse was not true. That is, there was no increase in h-mtTFB2 steady-state levels when h-mtTFB1 was over-expressed &#x0223c;10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, compare lane 5 to lane 4). We also analyzed the steady-state levels of the remaining transcription machinery in the face of h-mtTFB1 or h-mtTFB2 over-expression. No obvious changes in the amounts of POLRMT or h-mtTFA per mitochondrion were observed in either case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D).</p><p>To begin to determine the mechanism of increased h-mtTFB1 levels due to h-mtTFB2 over-expression we employed reverse transcriptase real-time PCR to measure the steady-state amounts of h-mtTFB1 mRNA. In the h-mtTFB2 over-expression cell lines, h-mtTFB1 mRNA was increased &#x0223c;2.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and Supplementary Figure S3), in good correspondence with the observed increase in h-mtTFB1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). As expected there was a large (&#x0223c;64-fold) increase in h-mtTFB1 mRNA in the h-mtTFB1 over-expression lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). However, this did not correspond with the only &#x0223c;10-fold over-expression of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms may limit h-mtTFB1 expression or accumulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Over-expression of h-mtTFB2, but not h-mtTFB1, increases the steady-state levels of mtDNA-encoded transcripts, OXPHOS subunits and mtDNA and enhances the rate of mitochondrial translation</title><p>To address how altered levels of h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 affect mitochondrial gene expression, we next examined the h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 over-expression HeLa cell lines for changes in the steady-state levels of mtDNA-encoded transcripts and proteins, as well as for alterations in mtDNA copy number. Northern analysis of the mitochondrial 16S and 12S rRNAs and of ND2 and ND6 transcripts (representing mRNAs transcribed from each strand of mtDNA) revealed a &#x0223c;2-fold increase in their steady-state levels in the h-mtTFB2 over-expression cell line, but no change in the h-mtTFB1 over-expression line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Similar results were obtained when immunoblots of the mtDNA-encoded COX1 and COX2 proteins was performed and mtDNA copy number was measured. That is, over-expression of h-mtTFB2, but not h-mtTFB1, led to a significant increase in the steady-state levels of COX1 and COX2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B) and a doubling of the mtDNA copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Altogether, these results are consistent with a role for h-mtTFB2 in transcription and in transcription-primed mtDNA replication. However, the fact that h-mtTFB1 is up-regulated in the h-mtTFB2 over-expression lines makes it difficult to assign these functions to h-mtTFB2 acting independently of h-mtTFB1. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Over-expression of h-mtTFB2 increases the steady-state levels of mtDNA-encoded transcripts and proteins, and doubles mtDNA copy number.

Interestingly, however, the labeling of specific products was not uniform (e.g. COX1, COX2 and ATP6), suggesting that increasing the amount of h-mtTFB2 and/or mitochondrial mRNAs is leading to increased translation of some mRNAs to the exclusion of others. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Analysis of mitochondrial translation rates and kasugamycin sensitivity in h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 over-expression HeLa cell lines.

We were somewhat surprised that over-expression of h-mtTFB1 did not influence mitochondrial translation rates given that it is more active as a rRNA methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and that its <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog has been implicated in translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). It remained a formal possibility that h-mtTFB1 is affecting mitochondrial ribosome function or biogenesis in manner that is not read out as an increase in the overall rate of translation. In bacteria, methylation of the small subunit rRNA by the h-mtTFB1 ortholog KsgA results in sensitivity to the aminoglycoside antibiotic kasugamycin and we have shown that h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 can functionally replace KsgA in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Furthermore, the human mitochondrial 12S rRNA and the bacterial 16S rRNA are highly conserved at the site that is methylated (a stem-loop at the 3&#x02032; end). We therefore determined whether over-expression of h-mtTFB1 alters the sensitivity of human mitochondrial ribosomes to kasugamycin. We found that over-expression of h-mtTFB1 resulted in a significant decrease in viability of HeLa cells grown in the presence of high concentrations of this drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Similar results were obtained in the h-mTFB2 over-expression line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). However, given that h-mtTFB1 is also up-regulated when h-mtTFB2 is over-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), whether this effect is due to h-mtTFB1 or h-mtTFB2 or perhaps both cannot be distinguished.</p></sec><sec><title>Over-expression of h-mtTFB1 or h-mtTFB2 increases mitochondrial biogenesis, but their coordinate up-regulation also results in increased membrane potential</title><p>Given that over-expression of h-mtTFB2 (and as a result also h-mtTFB1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) results in an increase in multiple mitochondrial gene expression parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), we next determined whether this signaled cells to increase overall mitochondrial biogenesis. In parallel, we also analyzed the h-mtTFB1 over-expression line. Surprisingly, we found that both cell lines exhibited a &#x0223c;50% increase in mitochondrial mass as measured by Mitotracker Green staining and FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Thus, despite the fact that over-expression of h-mtTFB1 does not increase mitochondrial gene expression in any manner examined thus far (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), remarkably, it does invoke a mitochondrial biogenesis response. The results of the Mitotracker Green staining were largely confirmed by immunoblots, where mitochondrial biogenesis was assayed as the ratio of the amount of the mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC to that of tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). We also analyzed the h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 over-expression cell lines for mitochondrial membrane potential using Mitotracker Red staining and FACS analysis. Here we observed an &#x0223c;80% increase in membrane potential in the h-mtTFB2 over-expression line, but no statistically significant change as the result of h-mtTFB1 over-expression alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). These results suggest the interesting possibility that the simultaneous up-regulation of both h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 (as is the case in the h-mtTFB2 over-expression lines) is required to fine-tune mitochondrial activity in accordance with changes in mitochondrial biogenesis and gene expression. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Analysis of mitochondrial biogenesis and membrane potential in h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 over-expression HeLa cell lines.

Specifically, we have determined for the first time the relative <italic>in vivo</italic> steady-state levels of the four core components of this system: the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase, POLRMT; the mtDNA binding transcription factor, h-mtTFA; and the two dual-function transcription factors/rRNA methyltransferases, h-mtTFB1 and mtTFB2. In addition, we have clearly demonstrated that the two h-mtTFB paralogs have unique attributes and distinct functions with regard to mitochondrial gene expression and biogenesis. We will discuss the primary findings and the main conclusion we reach based on the results of this study below.</p><p>The first goal of this study was to define the relative amounts of the human mitochondrial transcription machinery <italic>in vivo</italic>. Previously, groups have estimated the amounts of h-mtTFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>), but a simultaneous assessment of the entire core transcription system had not been described. We now have antibodies that recognize the four core human mitochondrial transcription components and, importantly, we generated peptide antibodies that are capable of distinguishing the two related h-mtTFB paralogs, h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Using these antibodies, we were able to detect each component in mitochondrial extracts containing known amounts of total mitochondrial protein by western blotting and compare these to the signals obtained from known amounts of cognate recombinant protein analyzed in parallel. Since we also quantified the total number of cells from which the extracts were derived and the copy number of mtDNA, we are able to express the results for each individual component as the number of molecules/cell or the number of molecules/molecule of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Our results revealed a number of novel and salient points about the relative abundance of the mitochondrial transcription system in HeLa cells (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). First, relative to the mtDNA copy number, which we found to be 5010 &#x000b1; 386 (Supplementary Figure S2), POLRMT is in &#x0223c;6-fold excess of the mtDNA on a per-molecule basis. In principle, this is sufficient to allow all templates to be engaged in transcription simultaneously. The second main conclusion that we reach is that there is roughly three times more h-mtTFB2 than h-mtTFB1 molecules/cell. This difference is perhaps most relevant when compared to the amount of POLRMT, from which it becomes clear that there is an excess of h-mtTFB2 to POLRMT (1.3:1), but a limiting amount of h-mtTFB1 relative to POLRMT (0.43:1). While the relevance of these differences is difficult to predict, it is noteworthy that for both h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 the levels relative to POLRMT are not too far removed from 1:1, which is consistent with the predicted optimal stoichiometry in the core transcription complexes for transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Finally, we arrive at a value of &#x0223c;25&#x02009;000 molecules of h-mtTFA per cell, which places it in &#x0223c;5&#x02013;18 fold excess of the other core transcription components (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Given that h-mtTFA has been postulated to have an mtDNA-packaging role in addition to its transcription factor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33 B34">31&#x02013;34</xref>), its abundance relative to mtDNA is important to discuss. Based on our measurement of mtDNA copy number, the ratio of h-mtTFA:mtDNA molecule we observe is 50 &#x000b1; 8:1. This value is in good agreement with that of 35:1 reported by Wiesner and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), but substantially lower than that proposed by Kang and colleagues, who suggest a ratio of &#x0223c;1700:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Kang and colleagues cite the ratio of mtTFA to mtDNA in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> at 2000:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) to support of their findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, ratios of <italic>X. laevis</italic> mtTFA (xl-mtTFA):mtDNA are greatly up-regulated during <italic>Xenopus oocyte</italic> maturation ranging from a resting immature oocyte level of &#x0223c;200:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) to the noted ratio of &#x0223c;2000:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), which occurs only in mature oocytes. Given that xl-mtTFA binds mtDNA as a tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), there is effectively &#x0223c;50 xl-mtTFA complexes per genome in immature oocytes, which we argue is a cell type that is more relevant for comparison to mammalian cell types than a mature oocyte, which has dramatically up-regulated mitochondria and mtDNA in preparation for fertilization and development. Finally, if h-mtTFA levels were indeed high enough to completely coat the mtDNA genome as suggested by Kang and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), this would seem incompatible with any significant transcriptional output based on <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Furthermore, it becomes difficult to explain why over-expression of h-mtTFA increases mitochondrial transcription and mtDNA copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) if, in fact, mtDNA is already fully saturated with h-mtTFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). It is noteworthy that we observe less than one-sixth the amount of h-mtTFA and five times more mtDNA per cell than Takamatsu <italic>et al</italic>. measured in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). These differences likely begin to account for the apparent overestimation of the mtTFA:mtDNA ratio by Kang and colleagues compared to that reported herein and by Wiesner and colleagues, which largely corroborate each other.</p><p>With the new knowledge of the relative levels of the human mitochondrial transcription system in HeLa cells, we went on to analyze the consequences of over-expressing each of the h-mtTFB paralogs on mitochondrial gene expression and biogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. We established stable HeLa cell lines that over-express h-mtTFB1 or h-mtTFB2 by &#x0223c;10-fold or up to &#x0223c;3-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Characterization of these lines by western blotting immediately revealed a salient difference between these two factors; that h-mtTFB2 is processed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Several additional lines of evidence strongly indicate that the processing of h-mtTFB2 is via cleavage by mitochondrial proteases upon import of the protein into mitochondria, including a strong predicted mitochondrial protease cleavage site between amino acids 30 and 31, the presence of a predicted amphipathic alpha helix (stereotypical of mitochondrial localization sequences) spanning amino acids 5&#x02013;22, and an inability to detect h-mtTFB2 with a peptide antibody that was directed against amino acids 2&#x02013;20, which would be removed by the predicted cleavage event (data not shown). No obvious mobility differences were observed between recombinant h-mtTFB1 and that isolated from cells. Furthermore, SignalP does not predict a mitochondrial cleavage site for h-mtTFB1 (data not shown). Thus, h-mtTFB2 and h-mtTFB1 are handled quite differently upon import, which is consistent with their distinct evolutionary history subsequent to the putative gene duplication event that created the two protein families early in eukaryotic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). It is also tempting to speculate that the use of different modes of import for these two transcription factors could provide a mechanism to control their relative levels in the organelle in response to different conditions.</p><p>A second important observation that came from the initial analysis of the h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 over-expression lines is that there is an increase in h-mtTFB1 when h-mtTFB2 is over-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). However, the converse was not true. That is, in the h-mtTFB1 over-expression line, there is no change in the steady-state amounts of h-mtTFB2 per mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Furthermore, there are no obvious changes in the levels of POLRMT or h-mtTFA per mitochondrion in either of the h-mtTFB factor over-expression lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). We conclude that there is some form of one-way communication between h-mtTFB2 and h-mtTFB1. The fact that this upregulation occurs, at least in part, via increased levels of the h-mtTFB1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), suggests that this involved a retrograde signal transduction mechanism from the mitochondria to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that this response is initiated via signals generated by alterations in mitochondrial transcriptional output or the amount of 12S rRNA methylation.</p><p>We next examined multiple mitochondrial parameters in the h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 over-expression cell lines. In the h-mtTFB2 over-expression cell lines (where it is important to keep in mind that there is also a compensatory increase in mtTFB1 as discussed above; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), there is a &#x0223c;2-fold increase in overall mitochondrial transcript levels as evidenced by northern analysis of the two rRNAs (12S and 16S) and two mRNAs (ND2 and ND6) encoded by mtDNA and representing transcripts derived from both strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). This was accompanied by a corresponding doubling of the mtDNA copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Given the documented roles for the h-mtTFB factors in directing transcription initiation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), these changes most likely represent an increase in the rate of mitochondrial transcription that is also driving a increase in transcription-primed mtDNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). However, it remains a formal possibility that the increase in steady-state levels of mitochondrial transcripts is due to enhanced RNA stability and/or similar rates of transcription from the increased number of mtDNA templates. Also evident in the h-mtTFB2 over-expression lines was an increased rate of mitochondrial translation of most, but not all mitochondrial gene products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) that, at least in the case of COX1 and COX2, results in significantly increased steady-state amounts of protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). However, the rates of mitochondrial translation were not uniform for all of the subunits. For example, there is apparently a reduced rate of translation of ATP6 and no apparent change in the rate of synthesis of ND3 or ND4L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Thus, artificially raising the levels of h-mtTFB2 (and in response, also h-mtTFB1) does increase mitochondrial gene expression and mtDNA replication, but may come at the cost of imbalanced relative rates of mitochondrial protein synthesis. We suspect that most of the described effects on mitochondrial gene expression just listed are driven primarily by the increased levels of h-mtTFB2 since no major changes in mtDNA copy number, transcript levels, translation rates or steady-state levels of COX1 and COX 2 were observed in the cell line in which h-mtTFB1 alone was over-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). However, it is also just as likely that up-regulation of both factors is necessary to coordinately mount all of the responses we observe.</p><p>The lack of a significant &#x02018;mitochondrial gene expression&#x02019; response in the h-mtTFB1 over-expression lines is somewhat surprising given the documented ability of this protein to activate transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). One potential reason for this may be explained via the relative levels of the transcription system we established in these cells. For example, the ratio of h-mtTFA to h-mtTFB1 required for optimal transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> is &#x0223c;1:2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Thus, the corresponding ratio we determined <italic>in vivo</italic> of 18:1 would likely not allow much of a contribution of h-mtTFB1 to the total transcriptional output. Furthermore, to reach the optimal ratio of 1:2 would require nearly 40-fold over-expression of h-mtTFB1. We were only able to increase h-mtTFB1 by &#x0223c;10-fold, which likely explains why no alterations in mitochondrial transcripts were observed in the h-mtTFB1 over-expression cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). In contrast, the ratio of h-mtTFA to h-mtTFB2 <italic>in vivo</italic> of 5:1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) is well within the range of 2:1&#x02013;40:1 that is optimal for mitochondrial transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Increasing this by &#x0223c;3-fold in the h-mtTFB2 over-expression cell line would keep this ratio within this optimal range, entirely consistent with our results. Whether the relative amounts of the transcription components vary in different cell or tissue types such that h-mtTFB1 also contributes to mitochondrial transcription remains an open question.</p><p>While over-expression of h-mtTFB1 does not show any major effects on the mitochondrial transcription and translation parameters we measured, it did result in increased sensitivity of HeLa cells to the aminoglycoside antibiotic kasugamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Sensitivity to this antibiotic in <italic>E. coli</italic> is modulated by dimethylation of two adenine residues in the 3&#x02032; terminal stem loop of the small subunit ribosomal RNA by KsgA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), the bacterial homolog of h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2. We have shown previously that h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 are able to methylate the homologous stem-loop in bacteria and restore sensitivity to kasugamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Thus, we interpret the ability of increased levels of h-mtTFB1 to sensitize HeLa cells to kasugamycin to indicate that h-mtTFB1 is increasing the number of methylated ribosomes that are targets for inhibition by the drug. This provides the first <italic>in vivo</italic> confirmation that h-mtTFB1 is likely the 12S rRNA methyltransferase in human mitochondria as we predicted from our earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a similar sensitivity to kasugamycin in the h-mtTFB2 over-expression lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). While this is most likely due to the fact that h-mtTFB1 is also up-regulated in this cell line, we cannot exclude the possibility that h-mtTFB2 is also contributing to the methylation of the 12S rRNA since it too possesses rRNA methyltransferase activity, albeit at a much lower level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In this regard it is interesting to note that others have shown that different methylation combinations on the <italic>E. coli</italic> 16S rRNA (adenines in the stem loop being monomethylated, dimethylated or mixed) result in different levels of aminoglycoside resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Thus, the idea that h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 might orchestrate different states of 12S rRNA methylation with different functional outcomes is an intriguing possibility.</p><p>Finally, we have elucidated a new role for h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 in mitochondrial biogenesis. Over-expression of h-mtTFB1 alone results in a &#x0223c;50% increase in mitochondrial membrane as judged by Mitotracker Green staining and confirmed by western analysis of a mitochondrial marker protein, porin (a.k.a. VDAC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, even in the absence of a direct effect on mitochondrial transcription or translation, increased h-mtTFB1 somehow signals a change in mitochondrial biogenesis. It will be of interest to determine the nature of this signal and whether it involves, for example, a sensing of the amount of ongoing mitochondrial ribosome assembly through the rRNA methylation status. A similar increase in mitochondrial biogenesis is observed in the h-mtTFB2 over-expression cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), in which both h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 are elevated. However, here, unlike h-mtTFB1 over-expression alone, it was accompanied by a significant (&#x0223c;80%) increase in mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Taken together, these results suggest that, while h-mtTFB1 can alone induce a mitochondrial biogenesis response, an increase in both h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 is needed to coordinate an increase in mitochondrial gene expression with the increase in mitochondrial mass. We propose that the lack of an increase in membrane potential in the h-mtTFB1 over-expression cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) is a result of a defect in this response that leads to more mitochondria with fewer OXPHOS complexes per mass of organelle.</p><p>This study provides the first analysis of the relative levels of the human mitochondrial transcription system and functional roles of the h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2 paralogs <italic>in vivo</italic>.
