Although phase variation has been shown to play important roles in many host&#x02013;pathogen interactions, the biological significance and the mechanism of Vpma oscillations remain largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that all six Vpma proteins are expressed in the type strain PG2 and all undergo phase variation at an unusually high frequency. Furthermore, targeted gene disruption of the <italic>xer1</italic> gene encoding a putative site-specific recombinase adjacent to the <italic>vpma</italic> locus was accomplished via homologous recombination using a replicon-based vector. Inactivation of <italic>xer1</italic> abolished further Vpma switching and the &#x02018;phase-locked&#x02019; mutants (PLMs) continued to steadily express only a single Vpma product. Complementation of the wild-type <italic>xer1</italic> gene in PLMs restored Vpma phase variation thereby proving that Xer1 is essential for <italic>vpma</italic> inversions. The study is not only instrumental in enhancing our ability to understand the role of Vpmas in <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> infections but also provides useful molecular approaches to study potential disease factors in other &#x02018;difficult-to-manipulate&#x02019; mycoplasmas.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Reversible high-frequency changes of bacterial cell surfaces via phase variation are thought to increase resistance against host defences or enhance survival under stressful environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Henderson <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">van der Woude and Baumler, 2004</xref>). Wall-less bacteria of the <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> genus include the smallest, self-replicating prokaryotes and have lost many biosynthetic pathways during their evolution which reflects their fastidious lifestyles. However, despite a reduced genome, many species possess large multigene families devoted to surface variation and are successful pathogens of immunocompetent hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Citti <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The presence of such elaborate phase-variable systems in these minimalist organisms highlights their significance in pathogenesis but their precise functions are rarely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Citti <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Denison <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The ruminant pathogen <italic>Mycoplasma agalactiae</italic> exhibits surface diversity through abundant and variable expression of surface lipoproteins (Vpmas) encoded by a multigene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Although genetic analysis has revealed the presence of six single-copy <italic>vpma</italic> genes (<italic>vpmaU&#x02013;Z</italic>) clustered in the type strain PG2, the expression and variability of only two Vpma proteins, namely VpmaU and VpmaY, have been established so far. Sequence analyses showed that each mature Vpma is composed of both unique and conserved amino acid regions that can be shared between two or more <italic>vpma</italic> gene products. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). The 5&#x02032; untranslated regions and those encoding the signal peptide are conserved within the <italic>vpma</italic> gene family and share a high identity to the equivalent regions of <italic>vsp</italic> genes forming a similar multigene phase-variable system in the bovine pathogen <italic>Mycoplasma bovis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Lysnyansky <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Both <italic>vsp</italic> and <italic>vpma</italic> genes contain repeated sequences, exhibit the same lipoprotein cleavage motif (AAKC) and encode similar short cytadherence epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Due to these similarities and the very close phylogenetic relationship between <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Askaa and Erno, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Pettersson <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>), it is likely that the <italic>vpma</italic> and <italic>vsp</italic> loci were inherited from a common ancestor. However, beyond the highly conserved 5&#x02032; untranslated and N-terminal regions, the <italic>vsp</italic> and <italic>vpma</italic> genes share no significant homology with each other and their respective coding sequences being very different from one another might have later evolved independently as two separate systems to accommodate different host specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, as both these ruminant pathogens induce similar clinical signs (mastitis, pneumoniae and arthritis) in their respective hosts, it is speculated that the two homologous systems, Vpmas and Vsps, might play similar roles during the disease process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Compared with the 13 <italic>vsp</italic> genes described in the <italic>vsp</italic> locus of <italic>M. bovis</italic> type strain PG45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Lysnyansky <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>), the <italic>vpma</italic> repertoire described in the type strain PG2 is much smaller and offers an opportunity to study the mechanism and pathogenicity potential of such multigene antigenic variations. The knowledge gained thereof might provide important clues to understand <italic>M. bovis</italic> infections which cause major economic losses worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Nicholas and Ayling, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The Vpma and Vsp systems, as well as the Vsa system of the murine pathogen <italic>Mycoplasma pulmonis</italic>, which also belongs to the same <italic>Mycoplasma hominis</italic> phylogenetic cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Pettersson <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>), represent remarkable examples in terms of the mechanism governing their phase variations. The mechanism governing Vpma, Vsp and Vsa phase variations is thought to be driven by site-specific DNA inversions which either link the ORF of a silent gene to a unique active promoter, as observed in <italic>vpma</italic> and <italic>vsp</italic> genes of <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Lysnyansky <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Flitman-Tene <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), respectively, or juxtapose a DNA sequence containing the promoter, ribosome binding site and first 714 nucleotides of the <italic>vsa</italic> coding region in front of the 3&#x02032; end of a previously silent <italic>vsa</italic> gene in <italic>M. pulmonis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bhugra <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Shen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Among mycoplasmas, another example where phase variation in a lipoprotein gene family has been described to be mediated by site-specific DNA inversions is the P35 or Mpl family of <italic>Mycoplasma penetrans</italic>. However, most of the 38 <italic>mpl</italic> genes are thought to be independently switched ON&#x02194;OFF by DNA inversions occurring in the adjacent invertible promoter sequences and not by juxtaposition of a single promoter sequence within the multigene locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Horino <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Another difference is the distribution of the <italic>mpl</italic> gene clusters at different chromosomal loci of <italic>M. penetrans,</italic> which is very similar to the phase-variable systems of certain <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species, where genes encoding capsular polysaccharides and surface glycoproteins are not only distributed throughout the chromosome, but are also similarly switched ON&#x02194;OFF by promoter inversions brought about by recombinases having a global action on several different loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Coyne <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Fletcher <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Roche-Hakansson <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The presence of sequences resembling recombinase genes, designated <italic>xer1</italic>, <italic>mbr</italic> and <italic>hvsR</italic>, showing high homology to the members of the large protein family of lambda integrases or tyrosine recombinases, has been documented in the vicinity of the <italic>vpma</italic>, <italic>vsp</italic> and <italic>vsa</italic> loci respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Ron <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). The Xer1 and Mbr recombinase sequences and their proposed recombination sites located in the 5&#x02032; untranslated regions of the genes found in their respective multigene loci share considerable homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Ron <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). On the other hand, HvsR shows less similarity to Mbr and Xer1, and its known target sites show no homology to the equivalent regions in the <italic>vsp</italic> and <italic>vpma</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Ron <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Sitaraman <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Among these recombinases, HvsR is the only one whose role in mediating site-specific rearrangements has been experimentally demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Sitaraman <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), whereas the role of Xer1 and Mbr in controlling similar DNA inversions is predictive and has yet to be proven.</p><p><italic>Mycoplasma pulmonis</italic> also harbours a family of phase-variable restriction and modification enzymes encoded by the variable <italic>hsd</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Dybvig <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>) that was also found to undergo DNA rearrangements regulated by HvsR. Interestingly, a similar <italic>hsd</italic> locus also exists in <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> but includes an integrase like gene (<italic>int</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Sirand-Pugnet <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). As <italic>M. pulmonis</italic> is phylogenetically related to <italic>M. agalactiae</italic>, the two phase-variable systems might have evolved from a common ancestor, leaving an intriguing possibility that <italic>vpma</italic>-specific recombinations might be controlled by the Int recombinase, either completely, or in addition to the predicted Xer1 recombinase encoded in the <italic>vpma</italic> locus. In this given scenario, the Xer1 recombinase, like HvsR, could also be predicted to have dual substrate specificity recognizing two distinct recombination sites, and catalyse DNA inversions at both the <italic>vpma</italic> and <italic>hsd</italic> loci of <italic>M. agalactiae.</italic></p><p>Another significant feature of the <italic>vpma</italic> gene locus is the presence of a homopolymeric tract of multiple thymidine residues immediately upstream of the &#x02212;10 region of the unique <italic>vpma</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Flitman-Tene <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Such homo- or heteropolymeric tracts are known to undergo frequent and reversible changes in the number of nucleotides via slipped-strand mispairing and lead to variation of cell surface proteins in many mycoplasma species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Citti <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). For instance, the insertion or deletion of nucleotides in the spacer region between the &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 region has been shown to turn ON or OFF the transcription of the <italic>vlp</italic>, <italic>maa2</italic> and <italic>vmm</italic> genes of <italic>Mycoplasma hyorhinis</italic>, <italic>Mycoplasma arthritidis</italic> and <italic>Mycoplasma mycoides</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Citti and Wise, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Washburn <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Persson <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Although site-specific DNA recombination has been proposed as the mechanism underlying Vpma phase variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), slipped-strand mispairing might also be operational in <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> and provide it with another mode of eliciting surface diversity by turning ON or OFF the single promoter present in the <italic>vpma</italic> locus.</p><p>The present work was undertaken to investigate the nature of molecular switches involved in Vpma antigenic variations, and to define the recombinase enzyme that controls the expression and variability of all or some <italic>vpma</italic> genes via site-specific DNA inversions within the <italic>vpma</italic> multigene locus. One main impediment in this task was the difficulty in isolating or distinguishing one Vpma variant from another. Therefore, our objectives towards understanding the Vpma system were first to develop specific serological reagents to individually monitor the expression and switching frequency of the six Vpma proteins of PG2, and second to construct &#x02018;phase-locked&#x02019; mutants (PLMs) of <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> that constitutively express only a single Vpma protein. Even though the involvement of the <italic>int</italic> gene (MAG5690) in regulating <italic>vpma</italic> inversions could not be ruled out, we first opted for disrupting the <italic>xer1</italic> gene due to its close proximity to the <italic>vpma</italic> locus that has been characterized as a pathogenicity island-like locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) and hence, is likely to carry its own recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Hacker <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). One strategy to inactivate the <italic>xer1</italic> gene in <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> could be to use transposon mutagenesis as done for inactivation of <italic>hvsR</italic> in <italic>M. pulmonis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Sitaraman <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). However, in order to avoid the possibility of mutant instability associated with transposon mutagenesis, we established a disruption strategy based on homologous recombination (HR). As targeted gene disruptions via HR using classical &#x02018;suicide vectors&#x02019; are a very rare phenomenon in mycoplasmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Dybvig and Woodard, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Dhandayuthapani <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Markham <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Burgos <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), we decided to use an <italic>M. agalactiae oriC</italic> plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chopra-Dewasthaly <italic>et al</italic>., 2005a</xref>) to introduce a partial <italic>xer1</italic> gene into PG2 to increase the likelihood of a <italic>xer1</italic> disruptive HR event. Such <italic>oriC</italic> vectors have been successfully used to obtain specific gene disruptants in two mollicutes so far, <italic>Spiroplasma citri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Duret <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>) and <italic>Mycoplasma capricolum</italic> ssp. <italic>capricolum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Janis <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In this study, disruption of <italic>xer1</italic> is demonstrated to abrogate subsequent DNA rearrangements within the <italic>vpma</italic> locus and lead to the generation of PLMs proving that <italic>xer1</italic> is essential for Vpma antigenic switches in <italic>M. agalactiae</italic>. Also, through the use of specific polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) raised against all six Vpma proteins we show that all six Vpmas are expressed within a population of <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> type strain PG2, that this expression is on the surface of the cells, and that all Vpmas exhibit an unexpectedly high frequency of phase variation which was underestimated in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Comparative sequence analyses of the <italic>vpma</italic> loci of the two PLMs with the published sequence of the clonal variant 55-5 further supports the role of Xer1 in the mechanisms of recombination.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>All six Vpma proteins are expressed in <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> type strain PG2 and show a remarkably high frequency of phase variation</title><p>In a previous study, expression and phase variation of only two out of the six <italic>vpma</italic> genes encoded by the PG2 type strain was demonstrated using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or VpmaU and VpmaY rabbit antisera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">2002</xref>). To further assess the expression profiles and antigenic variation of the entire PG2 <italic>vpma</italic> locus, sequences unique to each of the six <italic>vpma</italic> genes were individually expressed as MBP fusion proteins and used to raise Vpma-specific rabbit pAbs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). These antisera identified distinct products in PG2 when subjected to Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). For all Vpma proteins, the observed molecular weight was generally slightly higher than that calculated from their respective sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). As shown for other mycoplasma proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bhugra <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>), this might be due to the presence of repetitive motifs in each Vpma.

As attempts to disrupt the <italic>xer1</italic> gene via HR using a suicide (non-replicative) vector repeatedly failed, an alternate strategy was developed. For this purpose, an internal portion of <italic>xer1</italic> was cloned into the replicative <italic>M. agalactiae oriC</italic> vector pMM21-7 that carries the <italic>tetM</italic> gene for tetracycline resistance (Tet<sup>R</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chopra-Dewasthaly <italic>et al</italic>., 2005a</xref>). The resulting plasmid pR3 was expected to replicate in PG2 thereby increasing the occurrence of otherwise rare HR events. To enrich for rare <italic>xer1</italic> disruptions, the mixture of transformants was passaged in selective media at least five times, followed by two to five passages in non-selective media. The presence of <italic>xer1</italic> disruptants in the transformed population was assessed by a PCR assay designed specifically to detect a 2.0 kb amplicon corresponding to pR3 integration at the <italic>xer1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). PCR-positive transformant mixture passages were freshly grown and subjected to colony immunoblot analyses using pAb &#x003b1;-U. If Xer1 was the enzyme that indeed catalysed <italic>vpma</italic> gene inversions, its disruption was anticipated to abrogate Vpma phase variation and to result in a non-sectored phenotype when immunostained with a particular anti-Vpma pAb. Consequently, non-sectored VpmaU colonies were then picked and screened again by PCR to detect <italic>xer1</italic> disruption. PCR-positive clones were then subjected to three successive rounds of colony purification by colony immunoblot staining and passaging in liquid medium to obtain a rigorously clonal culture expressing VpmaU referred to as PLMU. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref> (row 2, column 1), the PLMU mutant gave a homogenously positive colony staining phenotype with pAb &#x003b1;-U and showed no negative or sectorial immunostaining. Further phenotypic verification of the selected PLMU clone was performed by subjecting it to colony immunostaining with the other five Vpma-specific antisera, namely &#x003b1;-V, &#x003b1;-Y, &#x003b1;-Z, &#x003b1;-X and &#x003b1;-W, producing a negative phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>, row 2, columns 2&#x02013;6) thereby proving the unavailability of the corresponding epitopes on its cell surface.</p><p>Southern blot hybridization using a <italic>xer1</italic>-specific probe demonstrated that the integration of plasmid pR3 did in fact occur by HR at the chromosomal <italic>xer1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). The chromosomal <italic>xer1</italic> is carried in wild-type (wt) <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> PG2 on a fragment of 13 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) (depicted as G in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>) and known to contain the 9.6 kb <italic>vpma</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Sirand-Pugnet <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>). As the disruption plasmid, pR3, contains a unique ClaI site, plasmid integration via a single HR event at the chromosomal <italic>xer1</italic> locus was expected to result in duplication of the partial <italic>xer1</italic> sequence that would be segregated onto two ClaI fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). As predicted, the 13 kb fragment is shown to be absent in the <italic>xer1</italic> disruptant (PLM), and instead, displays two hybridization signals corresponding to (i) a 3.7 kb fragment carrying the plasmid <italic>oriC</italic> region and part of the C-terminal coding region of <italic>xer1</italic> (depicted as &#x00394;XERA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>), and (ii) a 18.9 kb fragment carrying the <italic>bla</italic> and <italic>tetM</italic> plasmid sequences, and the N-terminal region of <italic>xer1</italic>, followed by the <italic>vpma</italic> genes (depicted as &#x00394;XERB in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>).

Disruption of <italic>xer1</italic> in PLMY was further confirmed by Southern blot analysis as described above. Like PLMU, PLMY was phenotypically and genotypically stable even after several <italic>in vitro</italic> passages (data not shown). Western blot analysis using the whole-cell extracts of PLMY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>) supported the results of colony immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). PLMY showed a specific product of &#x0223c;39 kDa with pAb &#x003b1;-Y as expected and was negative with all other pAbs, except with pAb &#x003b1;-Z which revealed a very faint band corresponding to the presence of VpmaZ in this mutant, although to a very low extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). However, no positive staining pattern was observed during colony immunoblot analysis of PLMY using &#x003b1;-Z antisera, probably due to the very low expression level of VpmaZ.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence analyses of the <italic>vpma</italic> gene loci of PLMU and PLMY: gene organization and Rho-independent terminator structures</title><p>In order to precisely define the configuration of the <italic>vpma</italic> loci in the PLMY and PLMU mutants, their ClaI-digested genomic DNA were, respectively, self-ligated and used to transform <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DH10B. Tetracycline- and ampicillin-resistant transformants were isolated and subjected to restriction and PCR analyses (data not shown). Two 18.9 kb recombinant plasmids, designated as pPLMU and pPLMY, carrying the <italic>vpma</italic> loci (8.6 kb) of PLMU and PLMY, respectively, were isolated for further examination.</p><p>DNA sequencing of the pPLMY <italic>vpma</italic> locus revealed a <italic>vpma</italic> gene organization similar to that found in the clone 55-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>), which is known to express VpmaY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), and whose entire genome was recently sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Sirand-Pugnet <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). In pPLMY, as the <italic>vpmaZ</italic> gene is located downstream of <italic>vpmaY</italic> and in the same transcriptional orientation, a low level of &#x02018;read-through&#x02019; could explain the presence of VpmaZ as background expression in PLMY. In pPLMU, <italic>vpmaZ</italic> is placed downstream of the transcribed <italic>vpmaU</italic> gene, but in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>) and thus, PLMU exhibits the sole expression of VpmaU. In an earlier study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Glew <italic>et al</italic>. (2002)</xref>, Northern blot analyses indicated the presence of a single 1.6 kb <italic>vpmaY</italic>-mRNA in clone 55-5 and a single 1 kb <italic>vpmaU</italic>-mRNA in clonal variant 55-7 that expressed the VpmaU protein. The length of the detected <italic>vpmaY</italic> transcript in 55-5 suggests the presence of a termination structure immediately before the <italic>vpmaU</italic> gene. Likewise, a termination structure must be present shortly after <italic>vpmaU</italic> based on the data pertaining to 55-7. Using the individual Vpma-specific pAbs, we could detect a very low amount of VpmaZ protein in PLMY corresponding to the <italic>vpmaY</italic> gene located downstream of <italic>vpmaY</italic> thereby suggesting a transcriptional control of termination. As mycoplasmas are known to lack the Rho protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">de Hoon <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), we searched for putative Rho-independent transcriptional terminators in the intergenic regions of the <italic>vpma</italic> loci that are characterized by an inverted repeat followed by a stretch of thymidine residues in the primary DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Nudler and Gottesman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">de Hoon <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). As described in <italic>Experimental procedures</italic>, we used mathematical models based on (i) the Gibbs free energy (&#x02212;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic>) of stem-loop formation in the RNA and (ii) the properties of the thymidine stretch in the primary DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">de Hoon <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) to detect putative terminator structures in the <italic>vpma</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). <italic>In silico</italic> results indicated the presence of such a structure 1560 bp downstream of the <italic>vpmaY</italic> transcription start that is in perfect agreement with the mRNA length detected by Northern blot analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Glew <italic>et al</italic>. (2002)</xref>. Similarly, a very strong termination structure was detected just 40 bp downstream of the stop-codon of the <italic>vpmaU</italic> gene and 970 bp downstream of the transcriptional start of the <italic>vpmaU</italic> gene and correlates well with the earlier mRNA studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Further analysis of other <italic>vpma</italic> genes also revealed the presence of Rho-independent terminator structures between 40 and 80 nucleotides downstream of the respective stop-codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Although no terminator was found immediately downstream of the <italic>xer1</italic> gene, a strong termination signal was detected just downstream of the tRNA-lys (anti-CTT) gene suggesting the

Although the presence of the <italic>xer1</italic> gene at different chromosomal loci of several gentamicin-resistant (Gent<sup>R</sup>) PLM clones was clearly evident by PCR and Southern analysis (data not shown), it failed to provide functional complementation in terms of restoring Vpma phase variation.</p><p>As an alternative strategy, <italic>xer1</italic> along with its putative promoter was cloned in an <italic>oriC</italic> vector carrying the Gent<sup>R</sup> selection marker to generate the complementation plasmid p21-7Gxer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>), which was transformed into the Tet<sup>R</sup> mutants PLMU and PLMY.

Similar genotypic and phenotypic analyses were also performed with <italic>xer1</italic>-complemented PLMY (data not shown) and the results confirmed that Xer1 is also essential for PLMY regaining Vpma phase variation.

Several genetic mechanisms of pathogenic mycoplasmas have been described which enable them to change their antigenic repertoire with an unusually high frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Citti <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Three members of the <italic>M. hominis</italic> cluster, <italic>M. agalactiae</italic>, <italic>M. bovis</italic> and <italic>M. pulmonis</italic>, have developed similar mechanisms of mediating phase variation in their respective <italic>vpma</italic>, <italic>vsp</italic> and <italic>vsa</italic> gene families, where site-specific DNA rearrangements place alternative silent genes downstream of DNA sequences that contain single unique promoters. <italic>M. penetrans</italic>, belonging to the <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> cluster, also exhibits phase variation via site-specific DNA inversions in the <italic>mpl</italic> multigene family that consists of 38 genes. However, the expression of these genes is proposed to be independently switched ON&#x02194;OFF by adjacent invertible promoter sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Horino <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Two ORFs (MYPE8180 and MYPE2900), located within the vicinity of the <italic>mpl</italic> genes, have been suggested as candidates for mediating <italic>mpl</italic> recombinatorial events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Horino <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). These recombinases display significant similarities with the Xer1, Mbr and HvsR recombinases of the <italic>vpma</italic>, <italic>vsp</italic> and <italic>vsa</italic> loci respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chambaud <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Ron <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Sirand-Pugnet <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). In the same phylogenetic <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> group, <italic>Ureaplasma parvum</italic> encodes three recombinases (UU222, UU145 and UU529), whose functions have not been proven, but are also closely related to Xer1, Mbr and HvsR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Glass <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Despite the existing similarity between these recombinases, genes of the respective phase-variable systems do not display any homology to each other, except for the signal sequences of <italic>vsp</italic> and <italic>vpma</italic> genes belonging to two closely related <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species. This might have been the result of adaptive evolution, either to colonize different host species or to perform different functions during the disease process.</p><p>Although the Vpma, Vsp and Vsa antigenic variation systems have been well studied at the DNA level, phenotypically, these proteins have only been observed using immunoblot analysis employing mAbs that recognize more than one member of the same multigene family. For instance, mAb 7.1-2 recognizes all the proteins of the Vsa family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Gumulak-Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>), whereas mAb 1E5 and mAb 3B3 recognize several proteins of the Vsp and Vpma family respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bergonier <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Lysnyansky <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). The switching frequencies calculated on the basis of results obtained with such mAbs are expected to underestimate the rate of variation of these proteins. The calculation of the switching frequency of variable proteins is based on the evaluation of the progeny of a clonal variant which at first expresses only one distinct protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Rosengarten and Wise, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). The phenotype of the progeny of this clonal variant can then be tested for the expression (+) or non-expression (&#x02212;) of the respective protein via colony immunoblots. By using pAbs specific to each of the six individual Vpma proteins, the switching frequency was observed to be much higher than the earlier estimated frequency of 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> per cell per generation based on the results obtained with <italic>M. agalactiae</italic>-specific mAb 3B3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). In the present study we show that mAb 3B3 also recognizes VpmaX and VpmaW (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>), in addition to the already reported VpmaY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Glew <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Rather than expressing a (+) or (&#x02212;) phenotype for a specific Vpma protein, a vast majority of PG2 colonies exhibited a highly sectored phenotype with these monospecific pAbs, and made it impossible to denote a numerical value for Vpma switching frequency using standard methods. Extrapolating these results to the parallel system of Vsp proteins in <italic>M. bovis</italic>, it is likely that the Vsp switching frequency is also much higher than the earlier reported frequency of 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> per cell per generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Lysnyansky <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>).</p><p>In a recent study, the role of Vsa phase variations was investigated in an animal experiment by PCR using the <italic>M. pulmonis</italic> strain CT-AD as inoculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Denison <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Although this study provided useful information regarding the avoidance of the host immune system through Vsa phase variation in <italic>M. pulmonis</italic>, similar studies would be impossible using wt <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> strains due to the extremely high frequency of Vpma switching. Phase-variable lipoproteins are abundantly expressed in mycoplasmas but their precise biological significance remains speculative. PLMs could serve as important tools in comprehending the relevance of phase variation of mycoplasma lipoprotein families during <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> pathogenicity studies.</p><p>Disruption of the <italic>xer1</italic> gene led to a Vpma &#x02018;phase-locked&#x02019; phenotype in <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> proving that Xer1 recombinase is indeed responsible for the site-specific recombinations occurring within the <italic>vpma</italic> gene locus. The results also demonstrate that the homopolymeric T-tract found upstream of the unique <italic>vpma</italic> promoter does not play any role in generating variation via slipped-strand mispairing as none of the several independently screened PLMY and PLMU colonies ever showed a negative phenotype where the respective VpmaY or VpmaU protein was not expressed (data not shown).</p><p>In this study, we have described the presence of Rho-independent terminator structures in the <italic>vpma</italic> locus and have further strengthened the theory of the monocistronic organization of the <italic>vpma</italic> genes. Nevertheless, the hypothesis of a single Vpma protein being expressed exclusively in all clones at all times does not seem to be totally foolproof. The coexpression of VpmaZ in PLMY is not surprising as the terminator of the <italic>vpmaY</italic> gene seems to be the weakest terminator found in the <italic>vpma</italic> locus (lowest <italic>d</italic> value) and the observed &#x02018;read-through&#x02019; could be a logical consequence of intermediate termination efficiency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p>In mycoplasmas, the organization of terminator structures has been proposed to be composed of weaker stem-loop structures but very T-rich T-stretches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">de Hoon <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The obtained values for the stem-loops and the number of T's in the T-stretch correlate nicely between the terminators found in the <italic>vpma</italic> locus of <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> and in the predicted terminators for <italic>Mycoplasma synoviae</italic>, which represents the nearest related mycoplasma species investigated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">de Hoon <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p>Sequence analysis of the <italic>vpma</italic> loci of PLMY, PLMU and clone 55-5 revealed that sequences most distant to the <italic>xer1</italic> gene remained completely unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>, blocks D and E) whereas the <italic>xer1</italic> proximal sequences were rearranged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>, blocks A&#x02013;C). Although this might be just a coincidence, it could, as well, be speculated that the Xer1 recombinase functions preferentially <italic>in cis</italic> as witnessed for certain transposases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Altenbuchner and Schmitt, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">McFall, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Adams <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), and this would explain the observed predominance of VpmaU, VpmaY and VpmaZ in the PG2 population (data not shown). The failure of <italic>xer1</italic> complementation by transposition may also support the hypothesis that Xer1 acts in a <italic>cis</italic>-like fashion, with RS site preference inversely proportional to the distance of the <italic>xer1</italic> gene from its target RS sequence. Attempts to restore phase variation in PLMs by transposition, using a transposon containing a wt <italic>xer1</italic> gene with its own putative promoter, were not successful, even when analysed in many different mutants that represented insertions at different chromosomal loci. Thus, the proximity of the <italic>xer1</italic> gene to the <italic>vpma</italic> locus might be an important factor for its functional activity. However, the introduction of the <italic>xer1</italic> gene via a multiple copy <italic>oriC</italic> plasmid restored phase variation, which may be due to the overproduction of the Xer1 protein that compensates for the necessity of <italic>xer1</italic> gene to be located adjacent to the <italic>vpma</italic> locus.</p><p>Although complementation of the wt <italic>xer1</italic> gene restored phase variation, we cannot totally rule out the involvement of other factors, including global regulatory proteins, in controlling <italic>vpma</italic> gene inversions as observed in other cases of bacterial phase variation involving gene inversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Henderson <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). It would be interesting to know if Vpma phase variation events are random and then selected by environmental factors, or are regulated by the pathogen through other, as yet, unidentified factors and regulators that might be operating only inside the host. Taking into consideration the work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Sitaraman <italic>et al</italic>. (2002)</xref> where HvsR was shown to control the <italic>vsa,</italic> as well as the <italic>hsd</italic> phase-variable loci, it would be interesting to know if the Xer1 recombinase of <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> plays any role in regulating the <italic>hsd</italic> locus in this species, especially as an integrase-like <italic>int</italic> gene (MAG5690) is present within its <italic>hsd</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Sirand-Pugnet <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p><p>This study demonstrates for the first time that all six <italic>vpma</italic> genes of the <italic>vpma</italic> multigene family are expressed on the cell surface of variants comprising the <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> type strain PG2. To our knowledge, this has not been shown for all members of the <italic>vsa</italic> and <italic>vsp</italic> multigene families of <italic>M. pulmonis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic>, respectively, which are close phylogenetic relatives of <italic>M. agalactiae</italic>. For instance, in a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Denison <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref>, 94% of the randomly checked clones from the CT-AD strain of <italic>M. pulmonis</italic> were found to express VsaG and 6% VsaH, whereas the other five Vsa proteins were probably expressed, if at all, at levels too low to be detected by the applied PCR analysis. The anti-Vpma pAbs developed in this study will serve as important reagents to specifically monitor the expression of each individual Vpma product during future <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Additionally, they could also help to assess the potential of Vpmas to be used as serological tools for early detection of infected animals. In general, mycoplasma lipoproteins are strongly immunogenic in their natural hosts and despite their intrinsic variability they are known to induce an early and lasting humoral immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Citti <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Hence these Vpma-specific antisera have the potential to be developed into efficient disease markers for the control and eradication of <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> infections.</p><p>To sum up, this study is a significant step in mycoplasma genetics as it describes the first targeted gene inactivation through HR in <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> and provides novel insights into the mechanisms of antigenic variation in <italic>M. agalactiae</italic>. Generation of PLMs offers a novel concept in elucidating the role of mycoplasma phase-variable lipoproteins in host&#x02013;pathogen interactions. Overall, the findings of this study are anticipated to improve our understanding of the mechanisms which enable mycoplasmas to cause chronic and difficult-to-eradicate infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p>This study was carried out on <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> type strain PG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Solsona <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>) grown at 37&#x000b0;C in modified Aluotto and SP-4 medium supplemented with penicillin, pyruvate and phenol red as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Chopra-Dewasthaly <italic>et al</italic>., 2005b</xref>).
