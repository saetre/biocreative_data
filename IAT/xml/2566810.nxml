Toll-like receptors (TLRs) also provide co-stimulation, but the requirement for TLRs to generate T-cell independent and T-cell dependent antigen specific antibody responses is debated. Little is known about the role of B-cell expressed TLRs in inducing antigen-specific antibodies to antigens that also activate TLR signaling. We found that mice lacking functional TLR4 or its adaptor molecule MyD88 harbored significantly less IgG3 natural antibodies to LPS, and required higher amounts of LPS to induce anti-LPS IgG3. <italic>In vitro</italic>, BCR and TLR4 signaling synergized, lowering the threshold for production of T-cell independent IgG3 and IL-10. Moreover, BCR and TLR4 directly associate through the transmembrane domain of TLR4. Thus, <italic>in vivo</italic>, BCR/TLR synergism could facilitate the induction of IgG3 antibodies against microbial antigens that engage both innate and adaptive B-cell receptors. Vaccines might exploit BCR/TLR synergism to rapidly induce antigen-specific antibodies before significant T-cell responses arise.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibodies perform a broad array of functions dictated by the constant region of their heavy chain.

In this work we analyzed the contribution of TLR4 to the induction of mouse IgG antibodies to LPS. We found that IgG antibodies to LPS are induced by the synergistic interaction of low concentrations of LPS with TLR4 and the BCR. This synergism results from the association of BCR and TLR4 molecules in a B-cell membrane complex mediated by the TLR4 transmembrane domain. This mechanism might be therapeutically exploited for the induction of antigen-specific antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Natural IgG antibodies to LPS are not detected in mice lacking a functional TLR4</title><p>IgM and IgG antibodies to self and non-self antigens can be induced by immunization, however some antibodies also arise naturally in the absence of known immunization or overt clinical disease; these antibodies have been termed natural antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003509-Coutinho1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

The control exerted by TLR4 in the induction of anti-LPS IgG is the result of synergism between TLR4 and BCR signaling pathways triggered with limiting amounts of LPS in the absence of T-cell help. This synergistic interaction manifested three characteristics: A) It was constrained by the specificity of the TLR involved; inactivating mutations in TLR4 did not decrease the induction of antibodies to a TLR2 ligand. B) It was shown to be MyD88-dependent; synergism was not observed in MyD88-deficient mice. C) It was mediated by interactions that depended on the transmembrane domain of TLR4 and the BCR. Taken together, our results show that synergism between TLR4 and the BCR lowers the threshold for IgG3 production by B cells expressing an LPS-reactive BCR. Note that the control exerted by TLR4 in the induction of anti-LPS IgG3 might operate at the level of the class-switch recombination (CSR) to IgG3 and/or the somatic hypermutation (SHM) of LPS-specific antibodies. Both CSR and SHM are mediated by the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003509-Honjo1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, and AID expression levels have been shown to be regulated by TLR signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003509-Han1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003509-Ueda1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.

Accordingly, natural IgG3 (and to a lesser extent natural IgG1) antibodies to LPS could only be detected in animals harboring a functional TLR4/MyD88 pathway. TLR-dependency, however, was restricted to control of production of IgG3 antigen specific antibodies, since we detected no association between anti-LPS IgM levels and the presence of a functional TLR4/MyD88 pathway. It has been recently reported that MyD88-dependent signaling in B cells is required for the generation of IgM and IgG1 antibodies to the TLR5 ligand flagellin, while MyD88 signaling in non-B cells might be needed for the generation of specific IgG3 antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003509-Pasare1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Co-signaling seems to depend on physical interaction, either direct or indirect, in the case of TLR4/BCR, but may be independent of physical association in the case of TLR9.

Thus, TLR9 and BCR may associate in subcellular compartments although the fact that the TLR4/BCR association mapped to the TLR4 TM domain in our study, suggests that this interaction with the BCR, whether directly or through additional partners, may be unique to TLR4. The TLR4 TM domain is highly conserved across species (80&#x00025; homology between mouse and human), but there is little sequence similarity between TM domains of different TLR family members. The structural motifs that mediate the BCR/TLR4 interaction are therefore likely to be absent from other TLR TM domains. Thus, the synergism of the BCR with TLR4 seems to operate following rules different from those governing the crosstalk with other TLRs.</p><p>Conversely, intermolecular associations seem to play a central role in the regulation of TLR4-dependent signal transduction and the response to LPS.

Although the synergistic signal may be achieved by surface co-ligation of the BCR and TLR4 in the absence of an association of the receptors, the intimate relationship we describe enhances the sensitivity to the signal, allowing IgG3 antibodies to arise in a setting of very low circulating levels of LPS. Sub-mitogenic levels of LPS might also impact upon other functions of B-cells through BCR-TLR4 synergy, such as antigen uptake and presentation to T-cells and antibody somatic mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003509-Pasare1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003509-Kinoshita1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The control of the induction of specific IgG3 antibodies triggered by limiting amounts of LPS might be clinically important. IgG3 antibodies contribute to the control of viral and bacterial infections through opsonization, complement fixation, and FcR mediated activation of neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003509-Abbas1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. IgG3 anti-LPS antibodies have also been described to sequester LPS in the circulation thereby preventing or reducing its toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003509-Gianotti1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Although other mechanisms might also be involved, a lack of TLR4-BCR synergism may contribute to the increased susceptibility to <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection in TLR4 deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003509-Hopkins1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003509-Hopkins2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, and to the increased risk of gram-negative infections in humans carrying inactivating TLR4 polymorphisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003509-Agnese1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the synergistic signaling between the BCR and innate receptors may be a general property of B-cell physiology important for the generation of microbe-specific antibodies in the early stages of an immune response when antigen specific T cell help is not yet available. These synergistic interactions are potential targets for the design of new vaccines aimed at exploiting the innate-adaptive cross-talk to provide fast and effective protective immunity against pathogens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>NOD/LtJ, C3HeB/FeJ and C3H/HeJ mice (Jackson Laboratories, Maine, USA) were bred and maintained in the spf animal facility of the Weizmann Institute of Science.

A 400 bp DNA fragment surrounding the ScrF1 restriction site (200 bp on each side) located 25 bp downstream of the point mutation was amplified using the upstream primer <named-content content-type="gene">ACCTGATACTTATTGCTGGCT</named-content> and the reverse primer <named-content content-type="gene">GCTAAGAAGGCGATACAATTC</named-content>. PCR products were cleaned, digested with ScrF1 (New England Biolabs, MA, USA), and separated on 3&#x00025; agarose gels (Cambrex Bio Science Rockland Inc,, Rockland, ME, USA). The CCT&#x02192;CAT mutation causes a loss of a ScrF1 endonuclease site and therefore DNA samples homozygous for the mutation are digested at only one site and yield two products of equal length (200 bp). Homozygous wt PCR products are cut at two sites and yield two visible bands of equal intensity, one 200 bp in length and the other 175 bp. It follows that 75&#x00025; of the products from DNA of heterozygote samples is 200 bp in length and 25&#x00025; is 175 bp.
