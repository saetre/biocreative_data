Although total levels of desmosome proteins were unaffected, DP border fluorescence was severely decreased compared with control siRNA-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>) and restored by a silencing-resistant PKP2 (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). In addition, DP particles aligned in a striking filamentous pattern in A431 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), colocalizing extensively with keratin intermediate filaments (IFs; not depicted). DP particles also decorated the IF network in PKP2-deficient SCC9 cells, which appeared partially retracted, with fewer filaments extending to the membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Similar results were obtained with three individual siRNAs (unpublished data), which supports the specificity of the response. DP distribution was frequently observed to be more linear in A431 than in SCC9 cells, likely reflecting a difference in keratin IF network organization in these lines. In A431 cells, IF appeared to be organized in straight radial cables compared with a more sinuous, intersecting network of bundles in SCC9s (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> and not depicted).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>PKP2 is required for proper assembly of DP into desmosomes.</bold> (A and B) Impaired DP border localization in PKP2-deficient cultures.

To enhance the temporal resolution of analysis, A431 DP-GFP cells were transfected with PKP2 siRNA, and live cell imaging of cells coming into contact after scratch wounding was performed. DP border fluorescence appeared within minutes of cell&#x02013;cell contact in both control and PKP2 siRNA-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>; Videos 1&#x02013;3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712133/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712133/DC1</ext-link>). However, at 20&#x02013;30 min, a striking accumulation of DP in an IF-like filamentous pattern was observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>, top; and Videos 1 and 3). This time frame corresponds to DP appearance in the cytoplasm as small particles or dots in control cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>, bottom; and Video 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Godsel et al., 2005</xref>). DP filamentous accumulation also correlates temporally with the point at which the border fluorescence intensity in PKP2 knockdown cells falls off relative to controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Although in certain cells a beads-on-a-string type of pattern was observed before the beginning of the experiment (Videos 1 and 3), DP fluorescence intensity along these tracks increased in response to cell&#x02013;cell contact. These results suggest that PKP2 is required for continued accumulation of DP at borders and the maturation of junctions during desmosome assembly, possibly by regulating DP's cytoplasmic localization.</p></sec><sec><title>DPser2849 and PKC activity are required for proper DP border localization</title><p>The filamentous distribution of DP observed in PKP2-deficient cells was reminiscent of that exhibited by a phosphorylation-deficient point mutant, DP<sup>S2849G</sup>, which tends to be sequestered along IF and exhibits delayed assembly kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Godsel et al., 2005</xref>). Ser2849 falls within a PKA/PKC consensus phosphorylation site in the C terminus of the DP IF-binding domain. Mutation at this site has been shown to enhance DP interactions with IF 10-fold in yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stappenbeck et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Meng et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Fontao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Godsel et al., 2005</xref>).

To test whether PKC&#x003b1; is required for DP assembly into borders, we infected cells with retrovirus-encoded PKC&#x003b1; small hairpin RNA and performed a calcium switch.

Lysates from cells transfected with PKP2 siRNA were probed with phospho-specific antibodies against known PKC substrates. Relative levels of phosphorylated myristoylated alanine-rich PKC substrate (MARCKS) and adducin were increased by &#x0003e;70-fold and threefold, respectively, in PKP2 siRNA-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). MARCKS phosphorylation was increased in PKP2-deficient cells even when cultured in low calcium (unpublished data), which suggests that cell&#x02013;cell contact is not required for PKP2 regulation of PKC signaling. However, PKC&#x003b1; phosphorylation at Thr638 was not consistently increased (unpublished data), which suggests that total cellular levels of PKC activity are not affected by PKP2 knockdown. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that PKP2 serves as a scaffold that recruits PKC locally to control the proper assembly and behavior of DP precursors, and that in its absence, PKC is free to phosphorylate other substrates. Consistent with this idea, PKP2 and the PKP2 head domain but not the central armadillo repeats coprecipitated with PKC&#x003b1;-FLAG (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Endogenous DP also coprecipitated with PKC&#x003b1;, raising the possibility that the three proteins form a cytoplasmic complex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Importantly, the level of DP that coprecipitated with PKC&#x003b1; in PKP2-deficient cells was reduced by 95%, which is consistent with the idea that PKP2, directly or indirectly, serves as a scaffold for PKC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>PKP2 regulates PKC signaling.</bold> (A) Enhanced PKC substrate phosphorylation during PKP2 knockdown.

This observation suggests that hyperactivation of PKC leads to an increased probability that DP will be properly phosphorylated by PKC, facilitating its incorporation into desmosomes.

The data are consistent with a model whereby cell contact triggers a signal (possibly PKC activation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">van Hengel et al., 1997</xref>), and PKP2, either directly or in conjunction with other scaffolding proteins, is required for communicating this signal by recruiting activated PKC to DP, which in turn phosphorylates DP at Ser2849. Although the molecular mechanism is not yet known, it seems possible that the observed reduction in affinity for IF exhibited by phosphorylated DP may be caused by alterations in the conformation of adjacent regions making up the IF-binding domain. A more dynamic association with IF may be necessary for ultimately promoting plaque precursor assembly while maintaining precursors locally concentrated near the cortex for proper delivery to junctions.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for role of PKP2 in PKC-regulated DP assembly.</bold> (A) Wild type. PKP2 recruits PKC to DP cytoplasmic complexes, where phosphorylation of DP at Ser2849 modulates its interaction with IF and allows DP assembly into cell&#x02013;cell junctions. (B) PKP2 deficiency. PKC is no longer recruited to DP complexes and is free to phosphorylate other substrates, leading to aberrant accumulation of DP along IF and impaired DP assembly.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1810605f05"></graphic></fig><p>Somewhat surprisingly, although PKP2 appears at borders earlier than DP during the assembly process (unpublished data), the loss of PKP2 did not completely abrogate DP clustering at cell borders during assembly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), which suggests that its initial accumulation does not require PKP2. PG and/or PKP3 may partially compensate for the loss of PKP2 and stabilize DP near the membrane, particularly in tissues where PKP2 is not the primary PKP expressed. However, as the nonmembrane-bound assembly competent dots that appear in the cytoplasm after cell contact contain PKP2 but not PKP3 or PG, the role of PKP2 at this intermediate stage may be more critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Godsel et al., 2005</xref>). DP border intensity is reduced at steady state in all cultured cell types tested, which suggests that compensatory mechanisms are insufficient for proper maturation and/or stability of junctions.</p><p>Our data are consistent with observations performed in PKP2-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grossmann et al., 2004</xref>). The authors reported a loss of DP from cell&#x02013;cell junctions and the presence of cytoplasmic DP-containing aggregates that were intimately associated with desmin IF of the cardiac muscle. Along with the fact that Ser2849 phosphorylation also regulates DP&#x02013;desmin IF interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lapouge et al., 2006</xref>), these observations support a similar role for PKP2 in other cell types. It was proposed that mechanical defects caused by loss of junctional integrity underlie the observed cardiac rupture and embryonic lethality in PKP2 knockout mice and may also contribute to human cardiac arrhythmias associated with PKP2 mutations. The relative contributions of PKPs in different cell contexts may be different, as patients with PKP2 mutations and prominent heart defects have not been reported to exhibit loss of keratinocyte adhesion.</p><p>In addition to promoting junction assembly and maintenance by locally harnessing PKC activity, the observation that PKP2 prevents aberrant phosphorylation of PKC substrates suggests that it may have broader cellular functions. Such global changes in the distribution of active PKC could contribute to disease pathogenesis in patients with PKP2 deficiency. The PKC substrates investigated in this report and others are actin-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Larsson, 2006</xref>). Thus, this PKP2&#x02013;PKC signaling pathway could also contribute to actin remodeling that is important for desmosome assembly, an idea that is consistent with our previous observation that DP translocation is actin dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Godsel et al., 2005</xref>). Coupled with recently ascribed roles for p120<sup>ctn</sup> and p0071 in actomyosin contraction signaling and regulation of Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hatzfeld, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wolf et al., 2006</xref>), the possibility that PKP2 scaffolds PKC suggests an emerging common function for these armadillo proteins in locally coordinating signals that direct cytoskeletal remodeling and regulate junction dynamics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>DNA constructs</title><p>DP-GFP and DP<sup>S2849G</sup>-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Godsel et al., 2005</xref>) and PKP2-FLAG, PKP2-H-FLAG, and PKP2-A-FLAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chen et al., 2002</xref>) have been described previously.
