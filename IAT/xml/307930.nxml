The arrangement of hnRNP proteins on pre-mRNAs is likely to be unique for each RNA and may be determined by the different RNA-binding preferences of each of these proteins. hnRNP F (M(r) = 53 kD, pI = 6.1) and hnRNP H (M(r) = 56 kD, pI = 6.7-7.1) are abundant components of immunopurified hnRNP complexes and they have distinct nucleic acid binding properties. Unlike other hnRNP proteins which display a varying range of affinities for different ribonucleotidehomopolymers and ssDNA, hnRNP F and hnRNP H bind only to poly(rG) in vitro. hnRNP F and hnRNP H were purified from HeLa cells by poly(rG) affinity chromatography and oligonucleotides derived from peptide sequences were used to isolate a cDNA encoding hnRNP F. The predicted amino acid sequence of hnRNP F revealed a novel protein with three repeated domains related to the RNP consensus sequence RNA-binding domain. Monoclonal antibodies produced against bacterially expressed hnRNP F were specific for both hnRNP F and hnRNP H and recognized related proteins in divergent organisms, including in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. hnRNP F and hnRNP H are thus highly related immunologically and they share identical peptides. Interestingly, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that hnRNP F and hnRNP H are concentrated in discrete regions of the nucleoplasm, in contrast to the general nucleoplasmic distribution of previously characterized hnRNP proteins. The unique RNA-binding properties, amino acid sequence and distinct intranuclear localization of hnRNP F and hnRNP H make them novel hnRNP proteins that are likely to be important for the processing of RNAs containing guanosine-rich sequences.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0179-a" xlink:role="1061"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0180-a" xlink:role="1062"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0182-a" xlink:role="1064"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0183-a" xlink:role="1065"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0183-b" xlink:role="1065"/></fig><fig id="F6"><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0183-c" xlink:role="1065"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0177.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1059"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0178.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1060"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0179.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1061"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0180.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1062"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0181.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1063"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0182.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1064"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0183.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1065"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0184.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1066"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0185.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1067"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
