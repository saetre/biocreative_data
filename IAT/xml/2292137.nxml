One of the most important clinical features of Werner syndrome patients are the premature onset and accelerated atherosclerosis process. Studies carried out on polymorphic <italic>WRN </italic>locus have shown that the alleles 1367R and 1074L confer protection for cardiovascular disease. Given that the levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) were found to be significantly increased in Werner syndrome patients, is quiet possible that <italic>PAI-1 </italic>expression could be under regulation of WRN helicase. Therefore the purpose of this work was to evaluate the role of <italic>WRN </italic>polymorphism in modulating the expression of <italic>PAI-1</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In order to accomplish our aim, an array of primary cultured fibroblasts from normal adult donors was genotyped for polymorphisms of both the <italic>WRN </italic>and <italic>PAI-1 </italic>loci. In addition, steady state levels of <italic>WRN </italic>and <italic>PAI-1 </italic>were measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays in such cultures. To search for the potential relationship between the lack of WRN protein and <italic>PAI-1 </italic>expression, heterozygous cultures of fibroblasts (1367RC/1074LF; <italic>WRN </italic>genotype) were treated with a molecule of interference RNA against <italic>WRN </italic>messenger RNA (mRNA).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that, carriers of 1367R and 1074L alleles of <italic>WRN </italic>shown to have low amounts of PAI-1 in plasma (7.56 &#x000b1; 5.02), as compared with carriers of 1367C and 1074F alleles (16.09 &#x000b1; 6.03). Moreover, fibroblasts from carriers with these alleles had low expression levels of <italic>PAI-1 </italic>mRNA. The treatment of heterozygous primary fibroblast cultures (1367RC/1074LF; <italic>WRN </italic>genotype) with iRNA against <italic>WRN </italic>mRNA caused <italic>PAI-1 </italic>overexpression. Treatment with normal PAI-1 inducers (TGF&#x003b2;, TNF&#x003b1;, or insulin) in these cultures and from those with genotypes 1367CC/1074FF and 1367RR/1074FL resulted in a genotype-dependent <italic>PAI-1 </italic>expression level.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that polymorphisms in the <italic>WRN </italic>gene might have a significant role regulating PAI-1 levels in healthy individuals and "normal states" as well as acute or chronic stress, obesity, aging, acute inflammation, among others, where characteristic high levels of insulin, TNF &#x003b1; and TGF&#x003b2;, could favor PAI-1 high levels in carriers with polymorphic variants (C and F alleles), beyond the levels reached by carriers with other alleles (R and L alleles).</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Werner syndrome (WS) is caused by the inheritance of two copies of null mutations in the <italic>WRN </italic>locus located at chromosome 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. <italic>WRN </italic>product is a helicase involved in DNA replication and proofreading processes; its mutations eliminate WRN protein function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], mostly affecting DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. WS is characterized by premature onset and accelerated progression of age-related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. From these, vascular pathologies that include atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, medial calcinosis, and calcification of heart valves are the major WS pathological components. Indeed, myocardial infarction (and cancer) is the most frequent cause of death in WS patients, which occurs at a median age of 48 years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. One of the first evidences that links WRN to the atherosclerosis process during normal aging involves the well known <italic>WRN </italic>polymorphisms: C1367R (refSNP ID: rs1346044) and L1074F (refSNP ID: rs2725362). From these studies it was suggested that variant 1367C is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, whereas variant 1074F is linked to coronary stenosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover, it has been suggested that 1367R allele of the <italic>WRN </italic>gene protects against the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesize that WRN protein could be relevant for the regulation of the atherosclerosis process, even in humans without WS. To verify this hypothesis at the molecular level, we studied the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) in sub-epithelial fibroblasts from humans with differential <italic>WRN </italic>polymorphisms C1367R and L1074F. We focused on PAI-1 because: a) PAI-1 plays a key role in fibrinolysis, thereby modulating the rate of atherogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and, b) <italic>PAI-1 </italic>overexpression has been observed both in plasma and fibroblasts from WS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. To accomplish this objective, an array of primary cultured fibroblasts from healthy Mexican adults was genotyped for polymorphism at the <italic>WRN </italic>locus. Moreover, a semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was used to measure the basal level of <italic>PAI-1 </italic>mRNA and the changes elicited by physiological PAI-1-inducers (TNF&#x003b1;, TGF&#x003b2;, or insulin) when the expression of <italic>WRN </italic>from heterozygous 1367CR/1074LF- fibroblasts was blocked by a molecule of interference RNA (iRNA). We also studied the effect of inducers on fibroblasts with different genotypes. We found that <italic>WRN </italic>polymorphisms have a significant contribution to determine levels of <italic>PAI-1 </italic>expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Protocol design was approved by the Ethical Committee from University of Colima (No. 2006/54); this protocol is in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.</p><p>One hundred and fifty healthy non-smoking Mexican male subjects were recruited by advertisement.

This molecular finding is in agreement with previous observations showing that WS patients, lacking WRN protein action, exhibit high PAI-1 levels in plasma and their fibroblasts overexpress <italic>PAI-1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It is accepted that WS patients have premature and accelerated progression of age-related disorders that resemble those during normal aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Thus, the WRN-dependent <italic>PAI-1 </italic>expression reported here is also in agreement with the fact that both fibroblasts from elderly people or fibroblasts in replicative senescence overexpress <italic>PAI-1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], in parallel with a reduction of <italic>WRN </italic>mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>We do not know whether WRN affects <italic>PAI-1 </italic>expression by inhibiting its RNA production or by blocking some signaling pathway. We favor the former mechanism because the transcription efficacy in cells from WS individuals is reduced to 40&#x02013;60% as compared with the rate of transcription in cells from normal subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], suggesting that WRN is implicated in regulating transcription process. Further investigation is needed to clarify the precise relationship between WRN helicase and <italic>PAI-1 </italic>mRNA.</p><p>The polymorphisms studied here are located in the C-terminal region of WRN which contains exonuclease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], helicase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and transactivation activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], besides the nuclear localization signal. This region serves as a binding site for interacting proteins and DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The C1367R polymorphism is close to the sequence coding the nuclear localization signal and adds a basic amino acid in this region (coded by the R allele), which it has been suggested that enhances the strength of the nuclear localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In other hand, the L1074F polymorphism is close to the DNA-binding domain and introduces an aliphatic amino acid (coded by the L allele) which might influence the transcription efficiency or the interaction with DNA or other factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In this context, our results show that <italic>WRN </italic>genetic background seems to influence the level of <italic>PAI-1 </italic>expression because fibroblasts from carriers with 1367RR/1074LL <italic>WRN </italic>genotype expressed the lowest <italic>PAI-1 </italic>mRNA levels, whereas fibroblasts from those carriers with 1367CC/1074FF genotype expressed the highest ones. In agreement with <italic>PAI-1 </italic>mRNA data, it was found that the levels of PAI-1 in plasma had a variability that was according to <italic>WRN </italic>polymorphisms. This variation was independent of inflammation as long as participants showed normal values of fibrinogen, WBC and CRP among other inflammation markers. Taken together, these findings show that polymorphisms in <italic>WRN </italic>gene differentially contribute to the levels of <italic>PAI-1 </italic>expression, a regulation that was experimentally revealed upon the disruption of the <italic>WRN </italic>expression. Therefore, in healthy individuals WRN may have clinical significance because polymorphic variants (C and F alleles) may be prone to increased risk of atherosclerosis due to their higher PAI-1 levels.</p><p>In this study we also found that TNF&#x003b1;, TGF&#x003b2;, or insulin produced a further <italic>PAI-1 </italic>expression even so <italic>WRN </italic>knocked down enhanced it already. This additive effect was quite expected due to <italic>PAI-1 </italic>expression was negatively and positively regulated by WRN and the PAI-1-inducers, respectively. The agonist-dependent enhancement of <italic>PAI-1 </italic>overexpression was also affected by <italic>WRN </italic>polymorphisms. That is, polymorphic variants (C and F alleles) promoting higher PAI-1 levels in plasma and <italic>PAI-1 </italic>mRNA also supported a large overexpression of <italic>PAI-1 </italic>by insulin, TNF&#x003b1; and TGF&#x003b2;. <italic>WRN </italic>polymorphisms may also have relevant clinical significance for "normal states" such as stress, obesity, aging or acute inflammation, because they are characterized by high levels of insulin, TNF&#x003b1;, TGF&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Therefore, carriers with some polymorphic variants (C and F alleles) will favour PAI-1 higher levels than those reached by carriers with other alleles (R and L alleles). Thus, C and F polymorphic variants may imply and enhanced risk of suffering various diseases, such as atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], wound healing failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], among others.</p><p>The WRN-dependent regulation of <italic>PAI-1 </italic>expression described in fibroblasts opens an avenue to address whether a similar effect occurs in other cellular types that have a greater impact in the systemic amount of PAI-1, such as vascular smooth muscle, macrophages and endothelial cells. This potential widespread up-regulation of <italic>PAI-1 </italic>expression could be quite relevant for atherosclerosis because it begins as a response to endothelial injury, and one of the earlier events consist of fibroblasts proliferation and differentiation at the level of the intimal connective tissue. In this layer of the vascular wall, PAI-1 acts as an inhibitor of the extracellular matrix degradation and it has been shown that PAI-1 is a critical mediador of intimal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the up-regulation of <italic>PAI-1 </italic>from fibroblasts may play an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of fibrosis during the atherosclerosis process. Further work is required analyzing intracellular signalling and promoter regions implicated in the <italic>PAI-1 </italic>up-regulation WRN-dependent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that in fibroblasts the WRN protein down-regulates <italic>PAI-1 </italic>expression and after knocking down <italic>WRN </italic>gene, <italic>PAI-1 </italic>expression is enhanced. Our results suggest that polymorphisms in <italic>WRN </italic>gene significantly contribute to regulate the levels of <italic>PAI-1 </italic>expression. In consequence, <italic>WRN </italic>polymorphisms may have a relevant clinical significance in healthy individuals. Since, polymorphic variants (C and F alleles) favor higher PAI-1 levels and also overexpress <italic>PAI-1 </italic>in response to insulin, TNF&#x003b1; and TGF&#x003b2;; it may imply an enhanced risk of suffering various conditions, such as atherosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, wound healing failure, among other diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>EC conceived the study, participated in its design, and performed the recruitment of subjects, establishment of primary cultures, <italic>WRN </italic>and <italic>PAI-1 </italic>genotyping, and RT-PCR assays, as well as carried out the immunoassays and drafted the manuscript.
