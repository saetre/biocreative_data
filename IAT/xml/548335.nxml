Interaction between hSsu72 and pRb was observed in transfected mammalian cells and involved multiple domains in pRb; however, so far, mutual effects of these two factors could not be demonstrated. Like the yeast counterpart, mammalian Ssu72 associates with TFIIB and the yeast cleavage/polyadenylation factor Pta1, and exhibits intrinsic phosphatase activity. Mammals contain a single <italic>ssu72</italic> gene and a few pseudogenes. During mouse embryogenesis, <italic>ssu72</italic> was highly expressed in the nervous system and intestine; high expression in the nervous system persisted in adult mice and was also readily observed in multiple human tumor cell lines. Both endogenous and ectopically expressed mammalian Ssu72 proteins resided primarily in the cytoplasm and only partly in the nucleus. Interestingly, fusion to a strong nuclear localization signal conferred nuclear localization only in a fraction of transfected cells, suggesting active tethering in the cytoplasm. Suppression of <italic>ssu72</italic> expression in mammalian cells by siRNA did not reduce proliferation/survival, and its over-expression did not affect transcription of candidate genes in transient reporter assays. Despite high conservation, <italic>hssu72</italic> was unable to rescue an <italic>ssu72</italic> lethal mutation in yeast. Together, our results highlight conserved and mammalian specific characteristics of mammalian <italic>ssu72</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Transcription by RNA polymerase II is coupled to RNA processing, including capping, splicing and cleavage/polyadenylation. The C-terminal repeat (CTD) of RNA pol II orchestrates both processes by recruiting RNA processing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Indeed, CTD directly binds polyadenylation factors and its truncation inhibits transcript cleavage <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). For instance, the cleavage-polyadenylation-specificity-factor (CPSF) is recruited to the promoter by interaction with TFIID. After transcription starts, CPSF dissociates from TFIID and becomes associated with CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The CTD undergoes cyclic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation allowing transcription initiation and re-initiation by RNA pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Recent evidence implicates a novel yeast factor, Ssu72, in both CTD dephosphorylation and RNA processing/termination.</p><p>Yeast Ssu72 was initially identified by Hampsey's group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) in a screen for suppressors of <italic>sua7-1</italic>, a cold-sensitive mutation in yeast TFIIB, hence Ssu72 (<underline>S</underline>uppressor of <underline>su</underline>a<underline>7</underline>-1 clone <underline>2</underline>). The sua7-1 mutation shifts transcription start site selection downstream at the ADH1 promoter; the <italic>ssu72</italic> mutation combined with <italic>sua7</italic>-1 induces further shift downstream. A null mutation in <italic>ssu72</italic> is lethal. A screen for suppressors of a temperature-sensitive <italic>ssu72</italic> strain identified <italic>Rpb2</italic>, the second largest subunit of RNA pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Accordingly, biochemical analysis revealed direct Ssu72&#x02013;Rbp2 and Ssu72&#x02013;TFIIB physical interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Mutation in <italic>ssu72</italic> disrupts the expression of a subset of yeast genes, such as <italic>CYC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Similar repression was observed when the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter, fused to a reporter gene, was expressed in mutant <italic>ssu72</italic> cells in transient transfection experiments, indicating that Ssu72 affects promoter strength directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>A genetic screen for factors that can rescue a temperature-sensitive <italic>ssu72</italic> strain identified Fcp1, the only known RNA pol II CTD phosphatase, and consistent with this, Ssu72 harbors intrinsic phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Recent analysis revealed that Ssu72 dephosphorylates Ser-5 in the CTD of RNA pol II, and together with Fcp1, which targets Ser-2, regenerates initiation competent hypo-phosphorylated RNA pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). The yeast Ssu72 also has a phosphatase-independent function. Large-scale analysis of protein complexes in yeast identified Ssu72 as a component of a cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Ssu72 interacts directly with the Pta1 subunit of CPF and is implicated in transcript cleavage and termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, pRb, controls cell proliferation, survival and differentiation and its inactivation contributes to the progression of most human malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). pRb exerts diverse biological effects by interacting with over 100 proteins, most of which are involved in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). So far, pRb was documented to employ three mechanisms of transcription repression. First, pRb directly interacts and quenches the <italic>trans</italic>-activation domain of transcription activators, such as E2Fs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Second, once bound to an activator on promoter DNA, pRb recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs), via LxCxE motifs in these proteins, and further silences gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Third, pRb binds components of the pre-initiation complex, such as TAFII250, and may directly affect its assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). In addition to transcriptional repression, pRb also binds tissue-specific differentiation factors, such as myogenin, C/EBP and CBFA1, and positively participates in the transcriptional activation of lineage-specific markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). In a screen for mammary- and prostate gland-specific cDNA libraries for pRb-binding factors, we here describe the identification and characterization of hSsu72, a human homolog of yeast Ssu72.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>Details on the construction of the following plasmids are available upon request.

For the dark field phase, identical exposure time and digital processing were used for sense and anti-sense probes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Identification of human Ssu72 following a yeast interactive screen with a pRb bait</title><p>In an effort to identify mammary and prostate gland-specific pRb-binding factors, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens with pRb as bait. Previous analysis had shown that when ectopically expressed in yeast, human pRb is highly phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). We therefore used as bait a constitutively active pRb allele, Rb&#x00394;K11, in which phosphorylation is inhibited by mutations in 11 of the 16 Ser/Thr phospho-acceptor sites in pRb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). This has allowed us to perform yeast two-hybrid screens at relatively high concentrations of the His3 antagonist, 3-AT. The initial screen was carried out in the presence of 20 mM 3-AT. A total of 200 clones isolated after 6 days of incubation were collected and re-examined on plates containing 35 mM 3-AT. Approximately 40% survived and were selected for DNA isolation and shuttling into bacteria. Plasmid DNA from unique clones, identified by PCR analysis and restriction enzyme digestion, was purified and subjected to a second round of screens with Rb&#x00394;K11 and Rb&#x00394;22, a non-functional allele of pRb, as baits. In the second screen, we used both the His3 and LacZ reporters to score for positive clones.</p><p>Our initial screen of a mammary gland library identified multiple factors that were all previously shown to interact with pRb, including HSP70, Id2 and cyclin D1 (data not shown). Screening of a prostate library identified additional factors, four of which represented full- or near full-length human homologs of the yeast <italic>ssu72</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). When re-transformed into yeast cells and tested on His- plates or by the lacZ reporter assay, the human <italic>ssu72</italic> cDNA clones interacted with pRb&#x00394;K11 as well as wild-type pRb, but only weakly with the pocket-mutant pRb&#x00394;22 (data not shown).</p><p>The interaction between pRb and hSsu72 was confirmed <italic>in vitro</italic> and in transfected cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Interestingly, human Ssu72 contains an LxCxE motif frequently found in pRb-binding factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). However, interaction between the two factors was independent of the LxCxE motif in hSsu72 or the LxCxE-binding motif in pRb but rather involved multiple domains in pRb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B&#x02013;E</xref>). Despite numerous experiments, we have been so far unable to identify a context in which a mutual effect between pRb and hSsu72 could be demonstrated (see below and Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>Mammalian hSsu72 associates with TFIIB and yeast Pta1</title><p>We first tested whether hSsu72 is biochemically conserved by investigating its ability to interact with known binding partners of its yeast counterpart. Yeast Ssu72 was initially identified via its genetic interaction with yTFIIB; it was subsequently shown to associate with GST-yTFIIB in pull-down experiments with <italic>in vitro</italic> labeled Ssu72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, GST-pull down assays with total protein lysates of COS7 cells revealed that endogenous mammalian TFIIB was co-precipitated in the presence of GST-hSsu72 but not GST alone.</p><p>A second major binding partner for Ssu72 in yeast is Pta1, a subunit of the yeast cleavage and polyadenylation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Myc-hSsu72 was ectopically expressed in mammalian cells and lysates were mixed with GST-Pta1 or GST alone. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, Myc-hSsu72 co-sedimented in the presence of GST-Pta1 but not GST. The interaction of hSsu72 with GST-Pta1 appeared to be as efficient as the interaction with GST-pRb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, the phylogenetic conservation of Ssu72 is sufficient to allow not only intra-species binding to TFIIB but also inter-species interaction with the yeast factor Pta1.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction with pRb, TFIIB or yeast Pta1 does not alter hSsu72 intrinsic phosphatase activity</title><p>To confirm that human Ssu72 exhibits protein phosphatase (PPase) activity, we tested purified GST- and Hat-tagged-hSsu72 fusion proteins in phosphatase assays using pNPP as a substrate. Phosphatase activity was observed within 20&#x02013;30 min under standard phosphatase conditions (100 mM citrate, pH 6.5) as well as binding conditions (containing 0.5% NP-40) (see Supplementary Material, Figure SD.1A; data not shown). A single point mutation, converting Cystein 12 to Serine [GST-hSsu72:C12S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>)] in the phosphatase domain (V<underline>C</underline>SSNQNRS), or deletion of the entire domain (GST-hSsu72:113&#x02013;194) completely abolished phosphatase activity (Figure SD.1A). Addition of GST-hTFIIB, GST-Pta1 or GST-Rb did not affect hSsu72 phosphatase activity compared with GST alone (Supplementary Material, Figure SD.1B). Consistent with this, deletion of the phosphatase domain (amino acids 1&#x02013;12) in Hat-hSsu72 did not abolish interaction with TFIIB, Pta1 or pRb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that these factors do not interact with hSsu72 via its PPase domain.</p></sec><sec><title>Human and mouse genomes encode single <italic>ssu72</italic> genes</title><p>BLAST searches of mammalian NCBI EST databases revealed a single expressed <italic>ssu72</italic> cDNA sequence per species (data not shown). Accordingly, only a single locus for <italic>ssu72</italic> was found in the human genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Located on chromosome 1p36, it spans approximately 32 kb and its coding region is divided into five exons. We also identified eight intronless <italic>ssu72</italic>-related sequences, which likely represent pseudogenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Typically, these pseudogenes display 75&#x02013;85% identity with human <italic>ssu72</italic>, have different Kozak translation initiation sequence and can be divided into three groups according to location and similarity to one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). <italic>In silico</italic> analysis of expressed sequence tag databases failed to detect <italic>ssu72</italic>-pseudogene sequences, suggesting that none of them is expressed.</p><p>BLAT searches of mouse genomic sequences also revealed a single functional <italic>ssu72</italic> gene, located on chromosome 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The overall organization into five exons and the intron/exon boundaries in the human and mouse <italic>ssu72</italic> genes are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; data not shown). Two partial sequences with homology to <italic>ssu72</italic> are also present in the mouse genome. These sequences are clearly non-functional as they are severely truncated/mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, the intronless homologs of <italic>ssu72</italic> likely represent non-functional pseudogenes; each mammalian genome, just like yeast, appears to contain a single functional <italic>ssu72</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of the <italic>ssu72</italic> transcripts and Ssu72 protein</title><p>To assess the expression of human <italic>ssu72</italic>, we performed northern blot analysis on RNA extracted from multiple mammalian tumor cell lines. These included human cervical carcinoma cells (C33A), SV40 transformed monkey kidney cells (COS7); human cervical epithelial adenocarcinoma (HeLa); human T lymphocytes (J-45); human transformed kidney cells (293); and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7). A doublet of different relative intensity was detected in all cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The lower transcript was predominant in the J-45 lymphocytes, whereas the upper transcript was more abundant in the other cell types, in particularly the two kidney-derived cells 293 and COS7. The nature of these different transcripts, which may originate from alternative splicing or promoter usage, is unknown. Northern blots performed in parallel with the <italic>hssu72-NI-1</italic> pseudogene probe produced only low levels of signals possibly due to cross hybridization with <italic>hssu72</italic> (data not shown).</p><p>To identify endogenous hSsu72, we raised rabbit polyclonal antibodies against full-length GST-hSsu72 (see Materials and Methods). Specificity of the hSsu72 sera was verified in a series of competition experiments with transfected 2HA-tagged hSsu72, which migrates slower than endogenous Ssu72 on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, in the presence or absence of GST or GST-hSsu72 as competitors. In addition, as described below (Figure SD-2), <italic>ssu72</italic> siRNA specifically knocked down the expression of Ssu72 as determined by immunoblotting with these antibodies. To assess the expression of Ssu72, we performed western blot analysis on the same cell panel described above. A single band of &#x0223c;30 kDa corresponding to endogenous Ssu72 was observed in all the cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Ssu72 resides primarily in the cytoplasm and partly in nucleus</title><p>To determine the subcellular localization of Ssu72, we performed nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation of COS7 cells followed by western blotting. As control, we transfected the cells with Myc-luciferase as a cytoplasmic marker and Myc-Stra13 as a nuclear marker. While the two markers localized exclusively in the cytoplasm and nuclear fractions, respectively, endogenous Ssu72 was found in both fractions but predominantly in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Ectopically expressed untagged and Myc-tagged hSsu72 isoforms also localized primarily in the cytoplasm of transfected cells, as was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Notably, the yeast proteomic nuclear localization project also assigned cytoplasmic &#x0003e; nuclear localization to the yeast Ssu72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>).</p><p>In an attempt to identify a discrete region in hSsu72 involved in the regulation of subcellular localization, we created a series of in-frame deletions spanning the entire hSsu72 polypeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). All the deletion mutants localized primarily in the cytoplasm like full-length hSsu72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Also, Leptomycin B, an inhibitor of the nuclear export receptor, CRM1, did not induce obvious nuclear accumulation of transfected Myc-hSsu72 (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular localization of hSsu72 fused to a strong nuclear localization signal</title><p>We next asked whether fusing a strong NLS such as the SV40 large Tag, PPKKKRKV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>), to the N-terminus of hSsu72 would confer nuclear localization. The resulting protein, NLS-hSsu72, was localized exclusively in the nucleus in &#x0223c;45%, exclusively in the cytoplasm in &#x0223c;45%, and throughout the cell in &#x0223c;10% of transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>; data not shown). Remarkably, when the NLS was fused in frame to the series of internal deletion mutants, it invariably induced complete nuclear localization in all the transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Thus, regulation of hSsu72 subcellular localization requires the integrity of the protein entire amino acid sequence and can be conferred at least in part by fusion to a strong NLS.</p></sec><sec><title>Mouse <italic>ssu72</italic> is dynamically regulated during embryonic development</title><p>The widespread expression of <italic>ssu72</italic> in multiple cell lines, our findings that it appears to represent a unique gene in mammals and the known function of the yeast Ssu72 in transcription/RNA processing suggest that it is likely a &#x02018;housekeeping&#x02019; gene invariably expressed in all tissues. To directly examine this conjecture, we cloned the mouse <italic>ssu72</italic> gene and performed northern blot analysis on multiple adult tissues. A single hybridizing band was detected in the various tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Strikingly, <italic>mssu72</italic> was expressed at low level in most tissues but highly in the brain, suggesting that the gene may be dynamically regulated.</p><p>To further pursue mouse <italic>ssu72</italic> gene expression, we performed radioactive <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analysis during embryogenesis. At embryonic (E) day 10.5, low level of mouse <italic>ssu72</italic> transcripts was detected throughout the embryo with relative accumulation in spinal cord and brain folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Thereafter, mouse <italic>ssu72</italic> expression was further induced in the developing nervous system and gut. At E13.5, high expression was observed throughout the CNS both in the ventricular (mitotic) and marginal (post mitotic) zones, in the PNS in dorsal root (DRG) and trigeminal (TG) ganglia, and the developing gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). During fetal development, expression in the CNS and PNS persisted, and expression in the intestine was further induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D&#x02013;F</xref>). Expression in the intestine was observed throughout the mucosal villi, which contains epithelial cells and other cell types. Thus, in both the nervous system and gut, <italic>ssu72</italic> appears to be expressed in both proliferating and non-proliferating cells. High <italic>ssu72</italic> expression was also detected in the lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In contrast, other tissues such as liver, lung, bone, cardiac and skeletal muscles exhibited no detectable expression of <italic>ssu72</italic>. These results strongly implicate mouse <italic>ssu72</italic> in the development of a subset of tissues including the nervous system and intestine.</p></sec><sec><title>Ssu72 is dispensable for growth and proliferation in COS7 cells</title><p>As <italic>ssu72</italic> loss-of-function mutations result in lethality in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), we next wished to determine whether the gene is essential for growth or viability in mammals. We employed siRNA technology to knockdown <italic>ssu72</italic> expression in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). A dramatic inhibition of Ssu72 expression in COS7 cells was attained with two different siRNA pairs targeted to distinct regions in the N-terminus of the Ssu72 coding region (see Supplementary Material, Figure SD-2). Inhibition was often observed after two successive transfections, but maximal and reliable effects were obtained after three transfections. Less efficient inhibition of Ssu72 expression was obtained in HeLa cells, probably reflecting reduced transfection efficiency (data not shown), hence subsequent analysis was performed only on COS7 cells. Despite the dramatic inhibition of Ssu72 protein expression, the morphology and total number of cells were unaffected as determined by microscopic examination and trypan blue exclusion assays (Figure SD-2; data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). The levels of dead cells were low and similar in both siRNA-treated and control cultures (data not shown). Furthermore, no difference in proliferation or viability was observed by the MTT assay, performed 6 and 18 h post siRNA treatment (Figure SD-2). We conclude that Ssu72 is dispensable at least in certain mammalian cells in culture or that dramatically reduced levels of Ssu72 suffice for cell survival/proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>Over-expression of native, nuclear- or DNA-targeted hSsu72 exerts minimal effects on transcriptional activity of candidate promoters</title><p>To test whether hSsu72 can alter gene expression in mammalian cells, we performed transient luciferase (luc) reporter assays in the absence or presence of transfected hSsu72. As we have not yet identified transcriptional targets regulated by Ssu72, several candidate promoters were tested. Over-expression of hSsu72 or NLS-hSsu72 had no effect on human RbP.luc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) and (CACGTG)<sub>2</sub>SV40.luc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) (Supplementary Material, Figure SD-3). Three other promoters: cyclinEP.luc, p107P.luc and DHFRP.luc were also not responsive (data not shown). We also created a translational fusion of hSsu72 with the DNA-binding domain of Lex (Lex-Myc-NLS-hSsu72) and tested its effect on X4G2.luciferase, a synthetic minimal promoter containing binding sites for GAL4 and Lex. Again, no significant effect was observed when Lex-Myc-NLS-hSsu72 was transfected in the presence or absence of GAL-Rb (repressor) or GAL-myc (activator) (data not shown). These results suggest that like in yeast, hSsu72 may target specific promoters, yet to be defined in mammals, or that the high expression of the endogenous protein renders the transfection of additional nuclear hSsu72 inconsequential.</p></sec><sec><title>Mammalian <italic>ssu72</italic> is unable to functionally complement its homolog in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic></title><p>The conservation between human and yeast Ssu72 in primary sequence, binding partners, phosphatase activity and subcellular localization on the one hand, but dynamic regulation and non-essential function in COS7 cells on the other, prompted us to ask whether <italic>hssu72</italic> could functionally complement an <italic>ssu72</italic> mutation in yeast. To test this possibility, we used yeast RF79977, a diploid strain with one <italic>ssu72</italic> allele inactivated by insertion of a <italic>neo<sup>R</sup></italic> marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Sporulation of RF79977 transformants for pRS316-<italic>yssu72</italic>, a CEN+ vector carrying the yeast <italic>ssu72</italic> genomic locus spanning the promoter and coding regions, resulted in the recovery of four viable spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Upon replica plating into G418 containing plates to select for the endogenous <italic>ssu72</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>:<italic>neo<sup>R</sup></italic> allele, two spores survived (data not shown), indicating complementation of the <italic>ssu72</italic> defect. In contrast, transformants for the human <italic>ssu72</italic> gene induced from a galactose responsive promoter (pYES-<italic>hssu72</italic>) or the parental vectors pYES and pRS316 gave rise to only two viable spores per tetrad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). None of these clones survived when replica plated onto G418-plates, indicating that they contained the yeast wt <italic>ssu72</italic> allele. Western blot analysis confirmed that Myc-tagged and untagged human <italic>ssu72</italic> alleles were highly expressed in the RF79977 yeast transformants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Thus, under these conditions, human <italic>ssu72</italic> was unable to complement the loss of its homolog in yeast.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We here describe the molecular identification of a human homolog of Ssu72 as a novel partner for pRb. We also show that hSsu72 interacts with TFIIB and yeast Pta1. The interaction of pRb with hSsu72 may represent a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation. Notably, BRCA1 associates with the polyadenylation factor CstF-50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>), suggesting common regulation of RNA processing by tumor suppressors. Interaction of pRb with hSsu72 involves multiple domains but is independent of the LxCxE-binding domain. This suggests a model in which pRb may concomitantly repress certain transcriptional activators by masking their <italic>trans</italic>-activation domain, recruit chromatin modifying enzymes via the LxCxE-binding domain and sequester hSsu72, thereby inhibiting spurious transcription activation/RNA processing. Interestingly, the B subdomain of pRb shares sequences similarities with the C-terminal domain of TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). Thus, pRb may mimic TFIIB and inhibit its interaction with hSsu72. However, in multiple assays including reporter assays and co-localization in co-transfection experiments, Saos-2 cell suppression assays, phosphatase inhibition assays and protein-interference experiments, we were unable to demonstrate any effect of pRb on hSsu72 activity or <italic>vice versa</italic>. Identification of hSsu72 responsive genes may allow us to test the effect of pRb on this protein.</p><p>An insight into where Ssu72 may be critical has emerged from our <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analysis. During embryogenesis, mouse <italic>ssu72</italic> is highly expressed only during neurogenesis and gut development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Notably, the expression pattern of mouse <italic>ssu72</italic> in the nervous system overlaps the expression pattern of Rb during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). Inactivation of several PIC-associated factors, including mTAFII105, dTAFII80, TAFII30 and mTRF2 results in tissue-specific defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). For example, gene-disruption reveals that TAFII105 is specifically required in ovarian development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). The generation of a mouse knockout model for <italic>ssu72</italic> may identify tissues such as the nervous system and intestine where Ssu72 may play a non-redundant role. Such knockout mice may facilitate the identification of target genes for Ssu72 and allow further investigation into the combined effects of pRb and Ssu72 on transcription and RNA processing.</p><p>The phylogenetic conservation among Ssu72 gene products is remarkable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Nonetheless, whereas Ssu72 is essential in yeast, siRNA mediated suppression of its expression in COS7 cells resulted in no obvious effect on proliferation or viability under our experimental conditions (Figures SD-2). Inactivation of mammalian Ssu72 may inhibit the expression of only a subset of genes without compromising cell growth. Alternatively, it may play redundant roles with functionally, though not structurally, related genes. This possibility is supported by the observation that the Fcp1 phosphatase can rescue the <italic>ssu72</italic> lethal mutation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). In addition, a recently identified novel RNA polymerase II C-terminal Ser-5 phosphatase, SCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>), may also play a redundant role with Ssu72. In certain cell types, Fcp1, SCP or other phosphatases may be expressed at sufficient levels to substitute for Ssu72 when the latter is absent or experimentally knockdown as in our siRNA experiments.</p><p>Despite the conservation in sequence, biological partners and biochemical functions, the human Ssu72 failed to complement an <italic>ssu72</italic> mutation in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Perhaps, only certain regions of hSsu72 cannot function in yeast. Indeed, while the first two-thirds of Ssu72 are highly conserved, the C-terminus is diverged across species. In particular, there are eight amino acids in the C-terminus of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, which are not found in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> or <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; data not shown). Swapping of the human 30 amino acid at the C-terminus with the yeast C-terminal 45 amino acid or a series of N-to-C and C-to-N human-yeast Ssu72 hybrids may identify functionally conserved/non-conserved regions across these species. Interestingly, human TFIIB, which is also phylogenetically conserved, fails to complement yeast TFIIB mutant; swapping analysis revealed only a small non-conserved subdomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>).</p><p>We found that both endogenous and ectopically expressed mammalian Ssu72 resided primarily in the cytoplasm and to a lesser extent in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Since there is no obvious NLS in Ssu72, it is possible that it translocates into the nucleus by a &#x02018;piggyback&#x02019; mechanism. However, in preliminary results, we have found that co-transfection with pRb or Myc-Pta1 did not confer obvious nuclear localization upon hSsu72 (data not shown). Alternatively, due to its small size, Ssu72 may freely diffuse into the nucleus and be actively exported into the cytoplasm. Although we found no change in subcellular localization of hSsu72 in response to the Crm1 inhibitor Leptomycin B (data not shown), we cannot rule out the possibility that Ssu72 is regulated by nuclear export via other exportins. Indeed, CRM1-independent nuclear export signals have been mapped in various proteins, such as VHL and the RNA processing factors hnRNPA1, hnRNP K and Hur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). Usually, cytoplasmic proteins readily translocate into the nucleus when fused to strong NLSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). In contrast, fusion of hSsu72 to a strong NLS induced nuclear localization in 45% of transfected cells, whereas in the rest NLS-hSsu72 localized in the cytoplasm or throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The retention of NLS-hSsu72 in the cytoplasm of 45&#x02013;55% of transfected cells suggests the existence of an active mechanism that tethers hSsu72 in the cytosol.</p><p>The partial nuclear localization of Ssu72 combined with its interaction with nuclear factors, such as pRb and TFIIB, suggest a nuclear function to this protein. Certain signals, yet to be discovered, may induce complete translocation of Ssu72 into the nucleus and lead to robust activation or repression of gene expression. Alternatively, Ssu72 may exert two independent functions: transcription/RNA processing in the nucleus and as yet to be defined activity in the cytoplasm. In this regards, it is interesting to note that the closest mammalian homolog of Pta1, albeit with very weak similarity, is symplekin, a dual residence protein that localizes in the nucleus as well as in tight junctions, adherens junctions or desmosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). In the nucleus, it is involved in 3&#x02032; end processing, bringing CPSF and CStF to the same complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). Further studies will determine whether Ssu72 has a &#x02018;cytoplasmic function&#x02019; and whether its activities in both compartments are orchestrated in the course of specific biological processes, such as neuronal and gut development.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_33_2_464__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_33_2_464__1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_33_2_464__2.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_33_2_464__3.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_33_2_464__Supplementary_data.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Dr Charlie Boone for advice with the yeast complementation analysis.

(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of hSsu72 clones recovered from the yeast two-hybrid screen with Rb&#x00394;K11 as bait. The approximate size of clone no. 113 was deduced from fragment size; the exact size of the other clones was determined by DNA sequencing. (<bold>B</bold>) Sequence alignment and amino acid conservation in human, mouse and yeast Ssu72 proteins. The human and mouse proteins are almost identical with the exception of the two indicated conserved substitutions. Red denotes identical residues; orange, similar; black, non-conserved. Note that the N-terminus is generally more conserved than the C-terminus. The PPase domain and the putative LxCxE are indicated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gki171f1"/></fig><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Interaction of pRb and hSsu72 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. (<bold>A</bold>) COS7 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Myc-tagged pRb, Myc-Rb&#x00394;22&#x00394;C and/or Flag-tagged Ssu72 as indicated. Four percent of protein lysates were analyzed directly by western blotting (lanes 1&#x02013;5). The remaining lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies, washed extensively and immunoblotted with anti-Flag antibodies to reveal co-immunoprecipitated Flag-Ssu72. Ssu72 was co-sedimented only in the presence of pRb (lane 9) but not Rb&#x00394;&#x00394;22&#x00394;c (lane 10) or in the absence of Rb (lane 8). Asterisk in both panels denotes uncharacterized proteins. IP, immunoprecipitation; IB, immunoblot. (<bold>B&#x02013;C</bold>) GST-pull down experiments demonstrating that interaction of pRb and hSsu72 is not mediated by the LxCxE-binding site in pRb (B&#x02013;C) or the LxCxE motif in Ssu72 (C). In GST-RbLxCxEmut, the LxCxE-binding domain is disrupted by I753A, N757A and M761A substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>). hSsu72 LxCxE contains a <underline>L</underline>T<bold><underline>C</underline></bold>E<underline>E</underline> to <underline>L</underline>T<bold><underline>G</underline></bold>E<underline>E</underline> substitution. Similar substitution of the central cystein in the LxCxE motifs in adenovirus E1A and human HSP75 completely disrupted the interaction of these proteins with pRb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>). The indicated proteins were expressed in COS7 cells by transfecting the corresponding expression vectors. Lysates were mixed with the indicated GST-fusion proteins, extensively washed and immunoblotted with antibodies reactive to HA, Flag or large Tag, which is constitutively expressed in COS7 cells. Note that interaction of pRb with HDAC and Tag but not Ssu72 is disrupted by mutations in the LxCxE-binding domain in pRb. (<bold>D</bold>) Schematic representation of the GST-Rb fusion protein and various deletion mutants used in the following panel. (<bold>E</bold>) GST-pull down experiments of the indicated GST-Rb fusion proteins with transfected HA-hSsu72 or endogenous Tag in COS7 cells. Deletions in the A or B regions (GST-Rb&#x00394;A and (GST-Rb&#x00394;22) or C-terminal domain (GST-Rb&#x00394;C), reduce but did not completely inhibit binding to hSsu72; double deletions of exon 22 and in the C-terminus (GST-Rb&#x00394;C&#x00394;22) abrogated pRb- hSsu72 interaction. Coomassie staining of the GST-fusion proteins is shown.

GST-hSsu72 but not GST efficiently precipitated endogenous TFIIB. (<bold>B</bold>) Interaction of hSsu72 with yeast Pta1. COS7 cells transfected with pcDNA3-Myc-Ssu72 or vector alone were lysed and mixed with GST-Rb or GST-Pta1 proteins, washed extensively and immunoblotted with antibodies reactive to a Myc-specific epitope.
