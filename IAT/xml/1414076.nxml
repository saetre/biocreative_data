Large deletions of MSYq are associated with sperm head defects for which <italic>Ssty </italic>deficiency has been presumed to be responsible.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In a search for further candidate genes associated with these defects we analyzed changes in the testis transcriptome resulting from MSYq deletions, using testis cDNA microarrays. This approach, aided by accumulating mouse MSYq sequence information, identified transcripts derived from two further spermatid-expressed multicopy MSYq gene families; like <italic>Ssty</italic>, each of these new MSYq gene families has multicopy relatives on the X chromosome. The <italic>Sly </italic>family encodes a protein with homology to the chromatin-associated proteins XLR and XMR that are encoded by the X chromosomal relatives. The second MSYq gene family was identified because the transcripts hybridized to a microarrayed X chromosome-encoded testis cDNA. The X loci ('<italic>Astx</italic>') encoding this cDNA had 92-94% sequence identity to over 100 putative Y loci ('<italic>Asty</italic>') across exons and introns; only low level <italic>Asty </italic>transcription was detected. More strongly transcribed recombinant loci were identified that included <italic>Asty </italic>exons 2-4 preceded by <italic>Ssty1 </italic>exons 1, 2 and part of exon 3. Transcription from the <italic>Ssty1 </italic>promotor generated spermatid-specific transcripts that, in addition to the variable inclusion of <italic>Ssty1 </italic>and <italic>Asty </italic>exons, included additional exons because of the serendipitous presence of splice sites further downstream.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We identified further MSYq-encoded transcripts expressed in spermatids and deriving from multicopy Y genes, deficiency of which may underlie the defects in sperm development associated with MSYq deletions.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The mammalian Y chromosome seems predisposed to accumulating multiple copies of genes that play a role in spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Determining the precise functions of such multicopy genes is inherently difficult. In humans and mouse, indications as to function have so far derived from the analysis of naturally occurring deletion mutants. In the mouse, deletions in MSYq (the Y chromosome long arm, excluding the pseudo-autosomal region) affect sperm development (spermiogenesis) and function, with the severity of the sperm defects being correlated with the extent of the deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Mouse MSYq appears to be composed predominantly of highly repeated DNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and when the present project was initiated the only known MSYq encoded testis transcripts derived from the complex multicopy <italic>Ssty </italic>gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This gene family, with two distinct subfamilies, namely <italic>Ssty1 </italic>and <italic>Ssty2</italic>, is expressed in the testis during spermiogenesis and, in the absence of other candidates, it had been postulated that <italic>Ssty </italic>deficiency is responsible for the defective sperm development in MSYq deficient mice.</p><p>In this study we utilized custom-made testis cDNA microarrays to identify further Y encoded testis transcripts that are absent or reduced in level as a consequence of MSYq deficiencies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identifying MSYq encoded testis transcripts by microarray analysis</title><p>Three MSYq-deficient mouse models were used in this study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>): XY<sup>RIII</sup>qdel, with deletion of about two-thirds of MSYq; XY<sup><italic>Tdym</italic>1</sup>qdel<italic>Sry</italic>, with deletion of about nine tenths of MSYq; and X<italic>Sxr</italic><sup><italic>a</italic></sup>Y* <sup>X</sup>, in which the only Y specific sequences are provided by the Y short arm derived sex-reversal factor <italic>Sxr</italic><sup><italic>a</italic></sup>, and thus lack all of MSYq. These models are hereafter abbreviated as 2/3MSYq<sup>-</sup>, 9/10MSYq<sup>- </sup>and MSYq<sup>-</sup>.</p><p>To analyze the testis transcriptomes of these MSYq deficient mice we used microarrayed testis cDNA clones enriched for cDNAs deriving from spermatogenic cells (see Materials and methods, below). Total testis RNA from each of the MSYq-deficient mice (labeled with the fluorochrome Cy3) and from matched controls (labeled with Cy5) was hybridized to the array; four technical replicates were obtained for each model. The initial raw data were filtered to select only clones for which fluorescence intensity data were available from at least two of the technical replicates for each model. After this filtering, 14,681 clones remained from the complete set. As expected, scatter plots of these filtered data show that expression of the vast majority of clones is unchanged between the MSYq deficient and control mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>).</p><p>For transcripts encoded by single or multiple copy Y genes mapping to MSYq, substantially reduced levels should occur in one or more of the deletion models. In order to focus on potential MSYq encoded transcripts we restricted our analysis to clones exhibiting a twofold or greater reduction in fluorescence intensity relative to control and a <italic>t</italic> test probability of under 1% for the comparison between the replicates for the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence intensities. Twenty-three clones were identified as substantially reduced by these criteria in one or more of the MSYq deletion models. BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) comparisons were used to identify matching cDNAs (if previously identified) and/or the chromosomal locations of the encoding sequences. Sixteen of the 23 proved to be <italic>Ssty </italic>cDNA clones, thus demonstrating the efficacy of the strategy. Of the remaining seven clones, five proved to be Y encoded <italic>Sly </italic>cDNAs (see below), one was X encoded and one was autosomally encoded (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a, b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Sly </italic>transcription is reduced in proportion to the extent of MSYq deficiency</title><p>All five of the additional Y encoded clones were found to have homology to regions of the cDNA clone BC049626 previously identified in a large-scale cDNA sequencing project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] (Additional data file 1). This cDNA clone initially had no chromosomal assignment, but it was subsequently ascribed to a gene, <italic>Sly</italic>, that maps to MSYq (MGI:2687328; Mouse Chromosome Y Mapping Project [Jessica E Alfoldi, Helen Skaletsky, Steve Rozen and David C Page at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA, and the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center, St. Louis, MO, USA]). <italic>Sly </italic>is a member of a multicopy family, and in December 2004 a total of 65 <italic>Sly </italic>family members were predicted based on the Y sequence data. There is a related multicopy X gene family that includes <italic>Xmr </italic>and <italic>Xlr </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>To confirm the downregulation of the <italic>Sly </italic>transcript in the MSYq deletion mice, we probed a northern blot of total testis RNA from the three MSYq deficient models and their controls with microarray clone MTnH-K10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>) and subsequently with the full BC049626 cDNA (not shown). The hybridization with both probes revealed high transcript levels in the control testes, a clear reduction in 2/3MSYq<sup>- </sup>testes, and further marked reductions in 9/10MSYq<sup>- </sup>and MSYq<sup>- </sup>testes. The reductions as estimated by phosphorimager analysis with clone MTnH-K10 (with the microarray estimates in brackets) were as follows: 2/3MSYq<sup>-</sup>, 47% (37%); 9/10MSYq<sup>-</sup>, 81% (84%); and MSYq<sup>-</sup>, 83% (91%). Because <italic>Sly </italic>has substantial homology to <italic>Xmr</italic>, which is also strongly transcribed in the testis, we considered that the remaining hybridization in the two models with severe MSYq deficiency could be due to cross-hybridization with <italic>Xmr </italic>transcripts. We therefore designed primers for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that distinguished between the two transcripts and used these to amplify template from testis cDNAs derived from the three MSYq deficient models and controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). A 266 base-pair (bp) product was amplified from all samples, and sequencing confirmed that this derived from <italic>Xmr</italic>. A 227 bp product was also amplified from the control, 2/3MSYq<sup>- </sup>and 9/10MSYq<sup>- </sup>testes (although clearly reduced), but there was no amplified product from MSYq<sup>- </sup>testes. Sequencing of this 227 bp product from 2/3MSYq<sup>- </sup>and 9/10MSYq<sup>- </sup>testes confirmed that it derived from <italic>Sly</italic>. Thus, only MSYq<sup>- </sup>completely lacks <italic>Sly </italic>transcripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of another family of Y encoded testis transcripts reduced in MSYq deficient mice</title><p>In December 2004, a BLAST analysis of the array clone 8832_f_22 against the mouse genome registered 41 hits on the mouse X chromosome and 710 hits on the mouse Y chromosome. The arrayed cDNA clone was apparently X encoded, there being eight putative loci (for example, gi:4640881, 3118-6344) with four exons that would encode matching cDNAs; the remaining nine hits were from incomplete loci or short sequence fragments. To investigate the coding potential of the Y sequences identified in the initial analysis, a further BLAST analysis was carried out with a complete X locus, and this identified 123 putative Y chromosomal loci (for example, gi:33667254, 73667-76894) that retain the same intron/exon structure as the X loci, and with 92-94% sequence identity across exons and introns.</p><p>The arrayed X encoded cDNA clone shared homology with three previously identified testis cDNA clones - two apparently X encoded (CF198098, AK076884) and one Y encoded (AK016790) - and a BLAST of mouse expressed sequence tags (ESTs) identified further related testis transcripts together with others derived from small intestine, aorta and eight cell embryos. The testis cDNAs and ESTs are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>. The arrayed X encoded cDNA, together with the two exactly matching transcripts BF019211 and CF198098, derive from purified spermatocyte cDNA libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Of the Y encoded testis transcripts, EST AV265093 matches only a short stretch of exon 4 and the two remaining transcripts, namely AK016790 and BY716467, show only segments of homology to the arrayed clone. Nevertheless, amplification from testis cDNA with an <italic>Asty </italic>exon 1/exon 4 primer pair generated products of 437 bp and 622 bp, and sequencing confirmed that these derived from Y chromosomal loci, the smaller product lacking exon 3. We refer to the similar X and Y loci encoding these X and Y transcripts as <italic>Astx </italic>and <italic>Asty </italic>(Amplified spermatogenic transcripts X encoded/Y encoded), respectively (for <italic>Astx </italic>and <italic>Asty </italic>transcript sequences, see Additional data file 2).</p><p>Intriguingly, the Y encoded transcripts AK016790 and BY716467, in addition to the sequence matching <italic>Astx</italic>/<italic>Asty </italic>exons 2 and 3 (and part of the intervening intron), proved to have exonic sequence matching <italic>Ssty1 </italic>exon 1 and part of exon 3, together with further sequence matching another testis cDNA AK015935 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). BLAST searches identified 'recombinant' Y genomic loci (comprising partial <italic>Ssty1 </italic>and <italic>Asty </italic>loci followed by sequence that includes exons matching AK015935) that could encode these transcripts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>, Additional data file 3). We refer to these loci as <italic>Asty</italic>(rec).</p><p>The close homology between <italic>Astx </italic>and <italic>Asty </italic>suggested that the arrayed <italic>Astx </italic>cDNA clone would cross-hybridize with <italic>Asty </italic>and <italic>Asty</italic>(rec) RNAs. We designed primers from <italic>Astx</italic>/<italic>Asty </italic>exon 4 for RT-PCR that we thought should specifically amplify either <italic>Astx </italic>or <italic>Asty</italic>, but further analysis (see below) identified <italic>Asty</italic>(rec) transcripts that also include exon 4. RT-PCR analysis using these primers showed that <italic>Asty </italic>and/or <italic>Asty</italic>(rec), rather than <italic>Astx </italic>transcripts, are reduced in MSYq deficient mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). Probing the northern blot of total testis RNA from the three MSYq deficient models and their controls with an <italic>Asty </italic>exon 4 probe revealed a transcript of about 1 kilobase (kb), together with other larger transcripts with sizes ranging up to more than 9.5 kb. All bands exhibited progressive reduction in intensity with increasing MSYq deficiency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>), and thus we are confident that it is not due to cross-hybridization to <italic>Astx</italic>. The size for the two transcripts identified by RT-PCR is of course unknown. However, given that the microarrayed <italic>Astx </italic>cDNA is 1.5 kb, it is reasonable to assume that the two <italic>Asty </italic>transcripts should be approximately 1.3 kb (lacking exon 3) and 1.5 kb; faint bands approximating these sizes are present. In further attempts to determine the origins of these multiple sized transcripts we probed the blot with a probe matching part of exon 6 of the <italic>Asty</italic>(rec) transcript AK016790 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>) and found that the bands of about 7.5 kb and above hybridized to this probe (not shown). Thus, there are transcripts derived from the 'recombinant' loci that also include <italic>Asty </italic>exon 4. Because the recombinant loci lack <italic>Asty </italic>exon 1 we then probed the blot with an <italic>Asty </italic>probe from exon 1, but no convincing hybridization was obtained. We conclude that the transcripts detected by the exon 4 probe that dose with the extent of the MSYq deletions derive predominantly from the <italic>Asty</italic>(rec) loci.</p></sec><sec><title>Multiple copies of <italic>Sly </italic>and <italic>Asty </italic>are present on MSYq</title><p>We next used the microarrayed <italic>Sly </italic>clone MTnH-K10 and the <italic>Asty </italic>exon 4 probe to hybridize to Southern blots of DNA samples from the MSYq deficient and control mice. The <italic>Sly </italic>probe revealed multiple hybridizing bands in control males that were reduced in intensity in 2/3MSYq<sup>- </sup>males and exhibited no detectable hybridization in 9/10MSYq<sup>- </sup>or MSYq<sup>- </sup>males, or in females (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a, c</xref>). However, after long exposure of a further blot that included DNA from XX and XO females, multiple bands were detected in 9/10MSYq<sup>- </sup>and MSYq<sup>- </sup>males that were also present in XX and XO females (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5e</xref>). In the females the band intensities dosed with the number of X chromosomes and thus presumably were due to cross-hybridization with <italic>Xlr</italic>/<italic>Xmr</italic>. However, at least three bands that are absent from females were retained in 9/10MSYq<sup>- </sup>males, but were absent from MSYq<sup>- </sup>males. Furthermore, a genomic PCR for the first <italic>Sly </italic>intron amplified from 9/10MSYq<sup>- </sup>but not from MSYq<sup>- </sup>DNA. This is consistent with the finding of <italic>Sly </italic>transcripts by RT-PCR in 9/10MSYq<sup>- </sup>males but not in MSYq<sup>- </sup>males. The <italic>Asty </italic>exon 4 probe also detected multiple hybridizing bands in the control males that reduced in intensity in the 2/3MSYq<sup>- </sup>males (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). There was a faintly hybridizing band in females, presumably due to cross-hybridization with <italic>Astx</italic>. The blot with all three MSYq deficient DNAs exhibited no hybridizing bands in 9/10MSYq<sup>- </sup>and MSYq<sup>- </sup>that were of the sizes of the four predominant Y-specific bands seen in the controls, but there was some unexplained intense hybridization at the level of the presumed <italic>Astx </italic>band and above.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Sly</italic>, <italic>Asty </italic>and <italic>Asty</italic>(rec) are expressed in the testis during spermiogenesis</title><p>Probing a multiple mouse tissue polyA northern blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>) with <italic>Sly </italic>clone MtnH-K10 indicated that <italic>Sly </italic>transcription is restricted to the testis, but the <italic>Asty </italic>exon 4 probe also detected transcripts in heart, consistent with there being a Y encoded EST from aorta (CA584558). In northern blots of RNAs from 12.5 days postpartum (dpp) to 30.5 dpp testes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>), <italic>Sly </italic>and <italic>Asty/Asty</italic>(rec) transcripts were first detectable at 20.5 dpp, suggesting they are restricted to spermatid stages. To confirm spermatid expression we used the same probes for RNA <italic>in situ </italic>on testis sections, and for <italic>Sly </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c, d</xref>) high level spermatid specific expression was confirmed. For <italic>Asty</italic>/<italic>Asty</italic>(rec) hybridization was at a level not markedly above background, but it did appear to locate to round spermatids, particularly with respect to hybridization within the nucleus; however, there was a similar localization to round spermatids in the sense control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6e</xref>). We then found that the previously described transcript BU936708 derives from Y 'loci' that transcribe through <italic>Asty </italic>loci in the antisense orientation and include antisense sequence from <italic>Asty </italic>exon 4 (Additional data file 3); this transcript will hybridize to the sense control probe. Thus, we suspect that the round spermatid nuclear localization with the antisense probe does reflect the presence of <italic>Asty</italic>/<italic>Asty</italic>(rec) transcripts. However, it is apparent from the northern analysis and <italic>in situ </italic>analysis that <italic>Asty</italic>/<italic>Asty</italic>(rec) transcripts are much less abundant than those of <italic>Sly</italic>, which is consistent with there being five <italic>Sly </italic>clones but no <italic>Asty</italic>/<italic>Asty</italic>(rec) clones on the testis cDNA microarray.</p><p>Because we believe the transcripts detected by the <italic>Asty </italic>exon 4 probe derive predominantly from the <italic>Asty</italic>(rec) loci that are almost certainly driven by the spermatid specific <italic>Ssty1 </italic>promotor, we made attempts to determine whether true <italic>Asty </italic>transcripts are also spermatid specific. For this we used an <italic>Asty </italic>exon 1-4 primer pair (previously used to provide evidence for <italic>Asty </italic>transcripts) to amplify testis cDNA samples from 1.5 dpp to adult. Transcripts were weakly detected by these primers at 14.5 and 18.5 dpp, but the predominant expression was at 22.5 dpp onward when there were transcripts of two sizes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6f</xref>).</p><p>We know these primers can also amplify <italic>Astx </italic>transcripts, and so we sequenced cloned RT-PCR products to confirm their identity. This confirmed the presence of the two previously identified <italic>Asty </italic>transcripts (one of which lacks exon 3). The longer transcript was detected from 14.5 dpp onward, and the shorter transcript from 22.5 dpp onward. Because spermatids first appear at about 20 dpp, we conclude that the shorter <italic>Asty </italic>isoform appears to be spermatid specific, but that the longer one is not spermatid specific.</p></sec><sec><title>The protein encoding potential of <italic>Sly </italic>and <italic>Asty </italic>family members and their X relatives</title><p>Of the 65 loci of the <italic>Sly </italic>gene family, 34 have retained coding potential for a protein that is related to three previously described chromatin associated nuclear proteins: XLR and XMR, which are encoded by members of a complex multicopy X gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and the autosomally encoded SYCP3 protein, via a conserved COR1 region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a, b</xref>). The putative SLY protein is most similar to XMR (amino acid identities: XMR 48%, XLR 46% and SCP3 30%), but within the COR1 region it is most similar to XLR (amino acid identities: XLR 79%, XMR 50% and SCP3 37%).</p><p>All eight <italic>Astx </italic>loci have a modest open reading frame (ORF) in exon 4, six of which would encode a protein of 106 amino acids and two would encode a protein with a carboxyl-terminal extension to 122 amino acids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a</xref>). Surprisingly, given the greater than 92% sequence identity of the <italic>Asty </italic>and <italic>Astx </italic>loci, this exon 4 ORF is not conserved in any of the putative <italic>Asty </italic>loci so far identified. There are six <italic>Asty </italic>loci with an ORF in exon 1 that could encode proteins of 116 or 120 amino acids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8b</xref>). However, the <italic>Asty </italic>sequence we obtained by RT-PCR from testis cDNA (Additional data file 2) did not match the sequence of this subset of loci with an exon 1 ORF; thus, it appears likely that the Y-linked members of this family no longer produce a functional protein. Assessing whether any of the novel <italic>Asty</italic>(rec) transcripts have significant protein encoding potential will require detailed characterization of this complex family of transcripts.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The objective of the present study was to try to establish whether members of the <italic>Ssty </italic>gene family are the only Y genes present on MSYq that are expressed in the testis during sperm development. Our strategy was to use testis cDNA microarrays to identify transcripts that are reduced or absent in the testes of mice with MSYq deficiencies, and then to determine their chromosomal assignments. This strategy led to the identification of further testis transcripts unrelated to <italic>Ssty</italic>, which proved also to be encoded by multicopy Y loci on MSYq and expressed in spermatids.</p><p>The first of these, <italic>Sly </italic>(<italic>Sycp3</italic>-like Y-linked; MGI:2687328) is most closely related to the multicopy <italic>Xlr</italic>/<italic>Xmr </italic>gene family, which is located on the X chromosome. It had previously been reported, based on Southern blot evidence, that multiple <italic>Xlr </italic>related sequences are present on the X and Y chromosomes, but it was concluded that most if not all of these <italic>Xlr </italic>related sequences were likely to represent nontranscribed pseudogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, another X linked family member, namely <italic>Xmr</italic>, was subsequently described that is specifically expressed in the testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and our present findings establish that <italic>Sly </italic>transcripts, encoded by multiple loci on MSYq, are also abundantly expressed in the testis in spermatids.</p><p>The XLR protein is a thymocyte nuclear protein that has been shown to colocalize with SATB1, a protein that binds to AT-rich sequences at the base of chromatin loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. XMR is a testis specific nuclear protein that concentrates in the sex body of pachytene spermatocytes as the chromatin begins to condense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. SYCP3 is an autosomally encoded protein that is part of the synaptonemal complex of chromosomes in meiosis. XLR, XMR and SYCP3, together with the putative FAM9 proteins encoded by the human X chromosome, have been grouped into a superfamily (InterPro accession number IPR006888, PFAM accession number PF04803) because they all share a conserved Cor1 domain. The Cor1 domain of the putative SLY protein is very similar (79% identity) to that of XLR, and we already have preliminary evidence that an SLY protein is produced; we predict that this SLY protein will also associate with chromatin loops.</p><p>Because SYCP3 is a fundamental component of the synaptonemal complex during meiosis, it is not surprising that it has been identified in a wide range of vertebrates. A comparison of mammalian Cor1 domain proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) indicates that <italic>Sycp3 </italic>is the ancestral gene and that some time before the divergence of human and mouse lineages the gene came onto the X chromosome and became multicopy; these copies then evolved rapidly and independently. At some point after the divergence of mouse and rat, one of the X copies was brought on to the Y chromosome, creating a new X-Y homologous subfamily. This subfamily subsequently became massively amplified in copy number on both the X and Y chromosomes. Like <italic>Sly</italic>, <italic>Xmr </italic>and its close relatives are highly expressed in spermatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and our recent finding that a major transcriptional consequence of MSYq deficiency is the upregulation of a number of spermatid-expressed X genes, including <italic>Xmr</italic>, leads us to suspect that amplification of <italic>Xmr </italic>and <italic>Sly </italic>is a result of 'genomic conflict' between sex linked meiotic drivers and suppressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The second MSYq encoded spermatid transcript, <italic>Asty</italic>, is also encoded by a multicopy Y gene. <italic>Asty </italic>has a very high degree of homology (92-94% identity across exons and introns) to a multicopy X gene (<italic>Astx</italic>), suggesting that it may be a recent arrival on the mouse Y chromosome. Intriguingly, BLAST searches with the microarrayed <italic>Astx </italic>clone sequence failed to detect similar sequences in the human genome, but in the rat there were four X-linked sequences matching the last third of the mouse <italic>Astx</italic>/<italic>Asty </italic>loci. Future analysis of these putative rat loci, in particular to determine whether related sequences are present on the rat Y chromosome, may help to delineate the evolutionary history of this gene family. In addition to these <italic>Asty </italic>loci, we have identified novel 'recombinant' loci, apparently driven by the <italic>Ssty1 </italic>promotor, that incorporate a subset of <italic>Ssty1 </italic>and <italic>Asty </italic>exons, and through alternative splicing and serendipitous splicing of more downstream sequences they have the potential to produce a range of novel transcripts in addition to the previously described transcripts AK016790 and AK015935.</p><p>Because all eight copies of <italic>Astx </italic>have retained a similar ORF in exon 4, it is reasonable to predict that they encode a protein. Interestingly, none of the more than 100 putative <italic>Asty </italic>loci have retained the <italic>Astx </italic>exon 4 ORF, despite the greater than 92% sequence identity of these loci. Six copies of <italic>Asty </italic>do have protein encoding potential in exon 1; however, the only <italic>Asty </italic>transcripts we have thus far identified do not derive from this subset of loci with exon 1 protein encoding potential. Overall, this evidence suggests that <italic>Astx </italic>is probably translated and that <italic>Asty </italic>is not. This does not, however, rule out a functional role for <italic>Asty</italic>, or indeed the more strongly transcribed <italic>Asty</italic>(rec), in sperm differentiation, especially given the increasing literature on functional RNAs. A particularly pertinent example in the present context is provided by the Stellate/suppressor of Stellate system in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, in which transcripts encoded by multicopy loci on the Y regulate expression of a protein expressed in spermatids and encoded by related multicopy loci on the X chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], via an antisense/small interfering RNA mechanism. It has been postulated that these RNA mediated regulatory interactions between multiple X and Y loci in <italic>Drosophila </italic>arose as a consequence of a past postmeiotic genomic conflict [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and there are clear parallels with the regulatory interactions we have uncovered between MSYq-encoded loci and spermatid-expressed X genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In this regard it is important that we have established that <italic>Astx </italic>transcripts are present in spermatids (Additional data file 4) as well as being expressed in spermatocytes (BF019211, CF198098).</p><p>The identification of additional MSYq encoded, spermatid expressed transcripts provides alternatives to <italic>Ssty </italic>deficiency as to the cause of the abnormalities in sperm shape associated with MSYq deficiencies. Three features suggest that <italic>Sly </italic>deficiency is the more likely cause. First, and importantly, retention of one or more transcribed <italic>Sly </italic>copies in 9/10MSYq<sup>- </sup>males (in contrast to <italic>Asty </italic>and <italic>Ssty </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]) provides a potential explanation for the less severe sperm abnormalities in these males, as compared with MSYq<sup>- </sup>males that completely lack <italic>Sly</italic>. Second, <italic>Sly </italic>is predicted to encode a chromatin associated protein, and the related proteins encoded by <italic>Xlr </italic>and <italic>Xmr </italic>are expressed at sites of chromatin restructuring. Thus, it is reasonable to suppose that <italic>Sly </italic>deficiency might affect sperm head shape by disturbing chromatin organization in the nucleus. Third, <italic>Sly </italic>is the most strongly transcribed in spermatids. On the other hand, we consider the sex ratio distortion seen in 2/3MSYq<sup>- </sup>males to be a consequence of disturbing the balance between sex-linked meiotic drivers and suppressors involved in X-Y gene conflict [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and because this balance may have been achieved by MSYq encoded proteins or RNAs, or both, all MSYq gene families remain plausible candidates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The highly repetitive nature of the mouse Y chromosome long arm presents formidable challenges for the determination of its functional gene content. Our strategy of using expression array data to highlight transcriptionally active loci among the sea of partial and degenerate gene copies has proved successful in identifying further MSYq encoded transcripts, deficiency of which may contribute to the abnormal sperm head development and function seen in males with MSYq deficiencies. This type of approach is likely to form an important component of future functional analysis of mammalian Y chromosomes and other repetitive chromosomal regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>All mice were produced on a random bred albino MF1 strain (NIMR colony) background.

Total RNA was isolated using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, Dorset, UK) and cleaned using RNEasy columns (Qiagen, Crawley, West Sussex, UK), in accordance with to the manufacturers' protocols. Microarray hybridizations and analysis were carried out as described by Ellis and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], except that microarray data normalization was based on the global median signal for Cy3 and Cy5 channels rather than on a panel of control genes. This form of normalization is valid because the majority of genes do not vary between the mutant and control samples for any of the models (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Briefly, 10 &#x003bc;g total RNA was fluorescently labeled using an indirect protocol, and the test and control samples were allowed to co-hybridize to the array. Four technical replicate slides were obtained for each test/control comparison. Cy3 was used to label the test (mutant) sample and Cy5 the control (normal) sample in all cases. Fluorescence intensities provide measures of the relative abundance for each hybridizing testis transcript for each genotype, whereas Cy3/Cy5 ratios for individual clones provide a measure of the levels in each of the MSYq deficient models relative to their matched controls.</p><p>The arrayed clones consisted of two subtracted adult mouse testis libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], six testis cell type separated libraries (IMAGE clone plate numbers 8825-8830, 8831-8836, 8846-8850, 9339-9342, 13869-13871, 13872-13874 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]), and appropriate controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. From sequence analysis performed to date, the combined gene set included cDNAs derived from more than 4,000 genes, often represented by multiple clones, enriched for cDNAs deriving from spermatogenic cells.
