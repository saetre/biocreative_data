Still, its effects on T helper (Th) cell&#x02013;mediated immunity, critical for allergic and autoimmune diseases, are elusive. We provide evidence that endogenously produced activin-A suppresses antigen-specific Th2 responses and protects against airway hyperresponsiveness and allergic airway disease in mice. Importantly, we reveal that activin-A exerts suppressive function through induction of antigen-specific regulatory T cells that suppress Th2 responses in vitro and upon transfer in vivo. In fact, activin-A also suppresses Th1-driven responses, pointing to a broader immunoregulatory function. Blockade of interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor &#x003b2;1 reverses activin-A&#x02013;induced suppression. Remarkably, transfer of activin-A&#x02013;induced antigen-specific regulatory T cells confers protection against allergic airway disease. This beneficial effect is associated with dramatically decreased maturation of draining lymph node dendritic cells. Therapeutic administration of recombinant activin-A during pulmonary allergen challenge suppresses Th2 responses and protects from allergic disease. Finally, we demonstrate that immune cells infiltrating the lungs from individuals with active allergic asthma, and thus nonregulated inflammatory response, exhibit significantly decreased expression of activin-A's responsive elements. Our results uncover activin-A as a novel suppressive factor for Th immunity and a critical controller of allergic airway disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Immune responses by differentiated effector Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell subsets provide protection against pathogens but can also lead to chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, or allergy if not tightly controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reiner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steinman, 2007</xref>). Critical controllers of these responses are immunosuppressive cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;1, and regulatory T lymphocytes.

Although most studies have focused on the role of activin-A in developmental and fibrotic processes, certain reports demonstrate elevated levels of this cytokine in immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ota et al., 2003</xref>) and inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hubner et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dohi et al., 2005</xref>). Activin-A is also increased in the sera of individuals with allergic asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karagiannidis et al., 2006</xref>), and in the lung and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of mice during acute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosendahl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hardy et al., 2006</xref>) and chronic allergic airway inflammation and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Le et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, activin-A is induced in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karagiannidis et al., 2006</xref>) and mouse effector Th2 lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogawa et al., 2006</xref>), which are key players in allergic responses. However, whether activin-A has enhancing or suppressive actions during Th immune responses and subsequent disease remains unclear.</p><p>Certain studies indicate that recombinant activin-A (r-activin-A) reduces in vitro nonspecific proliferation of human Th (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karagiannidis et al., 2006</xref>) and mouse B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Werner and Alzheimer, 2006</xref>), and inhibits certain functions of human natural killer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robson et al., 2009</xref>). In other reports, r-activin-A attenuates in vitro endotoxin-induced maturation and phagocytosis of mouse macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>) and CD40 ligand&#x02013;dependent cytokine and chemokine release by human monocytes and DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Robson et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, a few reports have suggested that activin-A has proinflammatory effects, i.e., during in vivo endotoxin administration and allergen challenge in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hardy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones et al., 2007</xref>). Collectively, these studies indicate a dual nature of this cytokine, a characteristic feature of certain immune mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Veldhoen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zenewicz et al., 2008</xref>). Of note, our previous studies revealed a dual role for another cytokine, osteopontin, in allergic airway inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xanthou et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we have investigated the in vivo role of activin-A in Th-mediated immune responses and, more specifically, during Th2-associated allergic airway inflammation. We demonstrate that antibody-mediated depletion of activin-A during pulmonary allergen challenge resulted in significant exacerbation of Th2-mediated allergic airway disease, indicating that endogenous activin-A is suppressive. In fact, our findings reveal that activin-A induces the generation of antigen-specific regulatory T cells that suppress both primary and effector Th responses in vitro and upon adoptive transfer in vivo. Functional in vitro analysis shows that activin-A&#x02013;mediated suppressive effects on Th responses are dependent on both IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;1. Importantly, activin-A&#x02013;induced antigen-specific regulatory T cells transfer protection against allergic airway disease correlated with decreased DC maturation. Collectively, our data reveal that activin-A can suppress Th responses and represents a critical therapeutic target for allergic asthma.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Depletion of activin-A during allergen challenge in the airways enhances Th2 allergic responses and exacerbates asthmatic disease</title><p>We initially investigated the in vivo role of activin-A in Th-mediated responses and, more specifically, in Th2-associated allergic airway inflammation, as activin-A is expressed during Th2-driven allergic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosendahl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hardy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karagiannidis et al., 2006</xref>).

This was shown by significantly increased total numbers of BAL-infiltrating cells and eosinophils, a hallmark of allergic airway disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Humbles et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2004</xref>), as compared with Ig treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). More importantly, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to increasing doses of inhaled methacholine, a clinical measurement of the asthmatic phenotype, was also significantly worsened in mice treated with anti&#x02013;activin-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). PBS/alum-sensitized and OVA-challenged mice (alum controls) exhibited lower AHR responses in comparison to the other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Moreover, pulmonary inflammation and mucus secretion were significantly increased in mice treated with anti&#x02013;activin-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). The increase in eosinophilic infiltration, observed upon activin-A depletion at challenge, was accompanied by significantly increased expression of the eosinophil-specific chemokine CCL11 in lung homogenates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the effects of in vivo neutralization of activin-A on OVA-specific Th2-mediated effector responses by measuring Th cell proliferation and cytokine release in the supernatants of draining LN (DLN) cell cultures stimulated ex vivo with OVA. There was significantly increased OVA-specific Th cell proliferation and significantly increased production of the Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10 in stimulation cultures of DLN cells from mice treated with anti&#x02013;activin-A, as compared with Ig controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). IFN-&#x003b3; levels in culture supernatants were also significantly increased, possibly resulting from the overall enhanced inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). In support, we observed significantly increased lung and BAL levels of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10 concomitant with decreased production of IL-12 and IL-17, cytokines considered protective when overexpressed in the lungs of allergic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Walter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schnyder-Candrian et al., 2006</xref>) upon activin-A depletion in vivo (not depicted). OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 (Th2 isotypes) serum concentrations were significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>), whereas OVA-specific IgG2a (Th1 isotype) levels were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p><p>No differences were observed in the recruitment of effector T1/ST2<sup>+</sup> Th2 cells among CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cells in the DLNs and lungs between anti&#x02013;activin-A&#x02013; and Ig-treated mice (unpublished data). In support, levels of the Th2 cell&#x02013;recruiting chemokines CCL17 and CCL22 were not significantly altered between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). This suggested that the overall increase in Th2-mediated allergic responses upon in vivo activin-A depletion was not caused by increased Th2 effector cell trafficking but rather by an enhanced effector function of Th2 cells. To address this, we examined the effects of DLN cells obtained from anti&#x02013;activin-A&#x02013;treated mice (or Ig controls) on responses of co-cultured OVA-specific T cell receptor transgenic Th cells from DO11.10 mice (recognized by expression of the clonotypic receptor by the antibody KJ1-26 and hereafter referred to as KJ1-26<sup>+</sup>) to the OVA<sub>323-339</sub> peptide. Indeed, DLN cells from anti&#x02013;activin-A&#x02013;treated mice lead to significantly increased proliferation of KJ1-26<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T responders to the OVA<sub>323-339</sub> peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). These data further support decreased immune regulation upon blockade of endogenously produced activin-A in vivo. Overall, antibody-mediated depletion of activin-A during pulmonary allergen challenge enhanced allergen-specific Th2 responses and exacerbated allergic airway disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Activin-A suppresses antigen-specific primary and effector Th2 responses</title><p>Effector Th2 cell&#x02013;mediated responses are essential for the development of allergic airway inflammation and asthmatic disease. Thus, we hypothesized that activin-A protects against allergic airway inflammation through suppression of antigen-specific Th2 effector responses. To examine this, we isolated OVA-primed Th2 effector cells from DLNs of allergic mice (sensitized with OVA/alum and challenged with OVA) and restimulated them ex vivo with OVA in the presence of r-activin-A or PBS (control). Indeed, r-activin-A treatment suppressed responses of OVA-primed Th2 effector cells, as shown by significantly decreased OVA-specific proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>) and significantly decreased concentrations of supernatant Th2 cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Similar to what was observed for IL-4 and IL-13, r-activin-A significantly decreased IL-10 production because, in this setting of Th2 effector responses, IL-10 operates mainly as a Th2 cytokine. In support, using the reverse approach, we demonstrated that blockade of either endogenously expressed activin-A or its critical signaling receptor, activin-like kinase (ALK) 4, resulted in significantly increased levels of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10, and enhanced Th2 cell proliferation, as compared with Ig treatment (not depicted).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Activin-A suppresses antigen-specific primary and effector Th2 responses.</bold> (A) DLN cells were harvested from OVA/alum-immunized and OVA-challenged BALB/c mice, and proliferation was measured after ex vivo OVA restimulation in the presence of PBS (designated as control) or r-activin-A (*, P = 0.0121).

We isolated LN KJ1-26<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and stimulated them in vitro with antigen in the presence of r-activin-A. Treatment with r-activin-A resulted in significantly decreased OVA-induced proliferation of KJ1-26<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). In addition, IL-4 levels were decreased during r-activin-A treatment as compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The suppressive effect of r-activin-A was accompanied by significantly increased production of IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Similarly, r-activin-A also significantly suppressed the robust proliferative responses of KJ1-26<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to the OVA<sub>323-339</sub> peptide and induced increased production of IL-10 (not depicted). We and other investigators have found that activin-A is produced during primary Th responses (50&#x02013;500 pg/ml in Th stimulation cultures; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogawa et al., 2006</xref>). As anticipated, addition of a neutralizing antibody to block endogenously produced activin-A resulted in significantly increased proliferation of KJ1-26<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during OVA-driven stimulation, concomitant with decreased IL-10 levels, as compared with Ig treatment (a two- and fourfold increase, respectively). Similar results were obtained when ALK4 was blocked (a two- and threefold increase, respectively), indicating that the suppressive effects of activin-A were mainly mediated by ALK4. Hence, activin-A suppresses both primary and effector antigen-specific Th2 responses in vitro and renders Th2 effector cells hyporesponsive to immunization in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Activin-A induces the generation of regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that are suppressive in vitro and in vivo</title><p>Subsequently, we investigated whether activin-A&#x02013;mediated Th suppression is associated with induction of T cells with regulatory/suppressive function.

However, we observed increased activin-A expression in lung biopsies from individuals with mild asthma as compared with healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>, left). Activin-A expression was mainly localized in bronchial epithelial cells and subepithelial inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>, bottom left). A significant increase in the percentage of activin-A<sup>+</sup> bronchial epithelial cells, as well as in the numbers of activin-A<sup>+</sup> subepithelial cells, was observed in lung biopsies from asthmatics as compared with healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>).

Additionally, the levels of Act-RIIA were significantly decreased, both in bronchial epithelial cells and in subepithelial inflammatory cells, in the lungs of asthmatics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). Similarly, we detected decreased expression of Act-RIIB in the lungs of asthmatics (unpublished data). Thus, although activin-A is increased in asthmatic lungs, the expression of its receptors in infiltrating immune cells is markedly reduced, suggesting a down-regulation of its signaling pathway that may lead to reduced suppression of the allergic inflammatory response.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Decreased expression of activin-A's signaling components in allergic asthma.</bold> (A) Representative photomicrographs showing expression of activin-A and ALK4 in bronchial biopsies from healthy individuals and asthmatics.

In the present study, our findings reveal that activin-A is a suppressive cytokine for Th-mediated immunity. In fact, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that activin-A induces the generation of antigen-specific regulatory T cells that suppress responses by effector Th2 cells and, more importantly, transfer protection against Th2-associated allergic airway disease in vivo. Notably, we show that activin-A&#x02013;induced regulation also affects Th1-driven responses, pointing to a broader immunosuppressive role for this cytokine.</p><p>Initially, our findings demonstrated that antibody-mediated depletion of activin-A during the clinically relevant phase of pulmonary allergen challenge resulted in significant exacerbation of Th2-mediated allergic airway disease (including increased AHR, BAL eosinophilia, Th2 cytokine and chemokine secretion, and OVA-specific systemic Th2 and antibody responses). Importantly, blockade of activin-A during OVA challenge resulted in a rapid (only after three daily doses of anti&#x02013;activin-A) exacerbation of all cardinal features of the asthmatic disease. This indicated that endogenously produced activin-A is protective against allergic Th2 cell&#x02013;mediated responses in the lung. In support, we found that DLN cells from anti&#x02013;activin-A&#x02013;treated mice cultured with KJ1-26<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells induced significantly heightened proliferative responses of the latter cells, pointing to decreased immune regulation. This was also evident by the significantly increased levels of Th2 cytokines. Concomitant up-regulation of IL-10 in these cultures can be explained either by the amplified Th2-mediated response or by the activation of regulatory mechanisms that are struggling to control the enhanced inflammation. We cannot exclude the possibility of an activin-A&#x02013;mediated effect on lung epithelial and smooth muscle cells as well. Nevertheless, r-activin-A treatment of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells rendered them suppressive, as they inhibited Th2 effector cell responses when adoptively transferred in vivo. This latter experimental approach uncovered the effects of r-activin-A on immune cells only. In another study, activin-A neutralization in vivo by a mouse monoclonal antibody resulted in decreased antigen-specific IgE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ogawa et al., 2008</xref>). The observed differences could be caused by the fact that the investigators of the latter study used a different experimental protocol that involved several OVA/alum immunizations and a single challenge, whereas they depleted activin-A not only during challenge but at both phases of the allergic response. Alternatively, or in conjunction, these differences may be, at least partly, caused by the use of different activin-A neutralizing antibodies. For example, it is possible that these antibodies blocked distinct activin-A epitopes, leading to different receptor-mediated responses. Nevertheless, in support of the suppressive effects of endogenous activin-A on IgE responses, we showed that systemic administration of r-activin-A into allergic mice right before pulmonary OVA challenge induced a striking (more than threefold) decrease in OVA-specific IgE levels. This was accompanied by significantly suppressed Th2 systemic responses and protection against allergic airway disease. Collectively, our data reveal that administration of r-activin-A can be an effective therapeutic protocol for Th2-driven experimental asthma.</p><p>In a different study, local (pulmonary) administration of follistatin, an inhibitor of activin-A, during allergic airway inflammation decreased Th2 cytokines and mucus production, pointing to proinflammatory effects of activin-A locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hardy et al., 2006</xref>). The different findings between our studies and the aforementioned ones may be, at least partly, caused by the use of distinct activin-A inhibitors. We administered a specific anti&#x02013;activin-A neutralizing antibody, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hardy et al. (2006)</xref> administered follistatin, an approach that does not directly address the effects of activin-A, as follistatin neutralizes all activins and certain bone morphogenetic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vale et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harrison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xia and Schneyer, 2009</xref>). Moreover, considering that other activins and bone morphogenetic proteins are also induced in the lungs of mice and humans with asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosendahl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosendahl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kariyawasam et al., 2008</xref>), it is plausible that the observed differences are also related to other follistatin functions, such as the inhibition of these proteins.</p><p>Activin-A may also exert distinct in vivo effects depending on the route of administration or the site of overexpression. In fact, in contrast to the suppressive effects of systemic activin-A administration on allergic disease, we have showed that local (pulmonary) administration of r-activin-A enhances Th2 effector responses and exacerbates certain disease features (unpublished data). These findings point to proinflammatory effects of excessive amounts of activin-A locally, a feature shared by several cytokines, including immunoregulatory ones. For example, TGF-&#x003b2;1 blockade locally prevents the onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Veldhoen et al., 2006</xref>), and overexpression in the brain results in more severe EAE, pointing to a proinflammatory role for this cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wyss-Coray et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luo et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, TGF-&#x003b2;1 neutralization systemically exacerbates EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Veldhoen et al., 2006</xref>), and systemic (i.p.) TGF-&#x003b2;1 administration protects from disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johns et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuruvilla et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johns and Sriram, 1993</xref>). TGF-&#x003b2;1 acts similarly in models of rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brandes et al., 1991</xref>). Dual effects depending on the route of administration have been also described for IL-10 in models of pneumococcal meningitis and endotoxin-induced uveitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosenbaum and Angell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koedel et al., 1996</xref>). Collectively, our studies and those by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hardy et al. (2006)</xref> emphasize the complex roles of activin-A in the regulation of the immune response.</p><p>Importantly, our data reveal that activin-A's immunosuppressive effects were associated with induction of antigen-specific regulatory T cells. Strikingly, these activin-A&#x02013;induced suppressor T cells inhibited the robust response of KJ1-26<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to the OVA<sub>323-339</sub> peptide in vitro and suppressed responses of other untreated Th cells upon adoptive cotransfer in vivo. Activin-A&#x02013;induced regulatory T cells were CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. A very recent study demonstrated that TGF-&#x003b2;1&#x02013;induced conversion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells into CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro could be further enhanced if activin-A was added in the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huber et al., 2009</xref>). However, activin-A was not essential for TGF-&#x003b2;1&#x02013;induced Foxp3 expression, as neutralization by follistatin or anti&#x02013;activin-A antibody had no effect on CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers. Moreover, the presence of low levels of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in activin-A&#x02013;treated cultures was essential for Foxp3 induction, supporting the notion that activin-A alone does not induce considerable Foxp3 expression.</p><p>Notably, activin-A induced the generation of a population of CD4<sup>+</sup>IL-10<sup>+</sup> T cells, possibly representing Tr1-like T regulatory cells. In support, activin-A treatment increased IL-10 levels in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell cultures. Moreover, our in vitro blocking studies revealed that enhanced IL-10 production represents one of the mechanisms of activin-A&#x02013;induced Th suppression. However, IL-10 levels were unaltered or even decreased during activin-A&#x02013;mediated suppression of secondary Th2 effector responses. This should not come as a surprise, because, in this setting, IL-10 (along with IL-4 and IL-13) acts predominantly as part of the effector Th2 cytokine profile and its levels follow the general Th2 cell suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wills-Karp, 1999</xref>).</p><p>In addition, activin-A may induce other suppressive Th cell populations. This possibility explains our finding that blocking of IL-10 did not completely reverse the suppressive function of activin-A&#x02013;induced regulatory Th cells. Furthermore, TGF-&#x003b2;1 blockade also partially reversed activin-A&#x02013;mediated Th suppression. Overall, it is conceivable that activin-A induces both IL-10&#x02013;producing regulatory T cells and other non&#x02013;IL-10&#x02013;producing suppressor T cells. The chemokine CXCL12 was recently found to inhibit EAE in a similar fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meiron et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our present studies also revealed that activin-A&#x02013;induced regulatory T cells can confer protection against AHR and allergic airway disease after adoptive transfer in vivo. In addition, activin-A&#x02013;induced regulatory T cells suppress Th2 effector responses and, of clinical relevance, decrease allergen-specific IgE. Besides naturally occurring or inducible Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells, several studies have shown the existence of antigen-specific Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> suppressor T cells that are of critical importance, as they confer protection against immune-mediated diseases, i.e., in experimental models of multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roncarolo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shevach, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sakaguchi and Powrie, 2007</xref>). Hence, the emergence of factors, such as activin-A, that induce suppressor T cells protective against Th-linked diseases is of critical therapeutic importance.</p><p>Interestingly, the suppressive effects of activin-A&#x02013;treated T cells were associated with a striking decrease of DC maturation in lung DLNs. Thus, it is plausible that activin-A also suppresses Th responses through regulation of DC function. In fact, activin-A induces in vitro a dramatic reduction on both MHC class II and CD86 co-stimulatory molecule expression on mouse CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs (unpublished data). In support, recent studies using human DCs have shown that activin-A prevents cytokine-induced HLA-DR up-regulation and promotes a tolerance-inducing DC phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Segerer et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We were initially surprised that bronchial epithelial and infiltrating subepithelial cells in lung biopsies from asthmatic individuals exhibited enhanced activin-A expression. Our findings, as well as those from other studies, also revealed increased activin-A expression by Th2 cells and in the lungs of allergic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosendahl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hardy et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karagiannidis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogawa et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, it is not unusual to have increased expression of immunosuppressive mediators during active inflammatory conditions. For example, TGF-&#x003b2;1 is increased in the lungs of asthmatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chakir et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Flood-Page et al., 2003</xref>), whereas up-regulation of &#x003b1;B-crystallin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ousman et al., 2007</xref>) and osteopontin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xanthou et al., 2007</xref>) is observed in multiple sclerosis and asthma, respectively. Importantly, the increase in activin-A was counterbalanced by decreased expression of activin-A's receptors, ALK4 and Act-RIIA and -RIIB, in infiltrating mononuclear cells of asthmatics. This is indicative of reduced activin-A signaling in infiltrating leukocytes, pointing to decreased immunoregulation. In support, blockade of ALK4 significantly enhanced Th2 responses in our experiments. Thus, activin-A up-regulation in the allergen-challenged lung may be part of an inherent protective mechanism, as also suggested by the exacerbation of allergic airway disease upon activin-A neutralization before challenge. Finally, adoptive transfers of regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells in sensitized mice not only protected from allergic airway disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kearley et al., 2005</xref>) but also resulted in significant increase in lung activin-A levels (unpublished data).</p><p>Although both activin-A and TGF-&#x003b2;1 belong to the same family of cytokines, it would be unjust to have them considered as redundant during inflammatory processes, as also suggested by several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ogawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Werner and Alzheimer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Le et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ogawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robson et al., 2009</xref>). In fact, our experiments reveal that in vivo blockade of activin-A resulted in significant exacerbation of allergic airway disease despite the presence of endogenous TGF-&#x003b2;1. Moreover, we demonstrate that activin-A and TGF-&#x003b2;1 induce different regulatory T cell subsets, indicating that these two cytokines may also operate through distinct suppressive mechanisms. These findings suggest that, at least in our experimental settings, activin-A has a distinct (to TGF-&#x003b2;1) role.</p><p>Our findings introduce activin-A as a new member in the team of immune response regulation factors. Moreover, its implicit protective role in acute allergic airway disease places activin-A as a therapeutic target for allergic asthma. The role of activin-A in several facets of regulatory T cell biology, including generation, maintenance, and function, is of great importance and remains to be further elucidated. Finally, considering its suppressive effects on Th1-driven responses, an involvement of activin-A in the regulation of autoimmunity is highly probable and merits closer examination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>BALB/c, BALB/c-<italic>Rag-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, and OVA-specific T cell receptor transgenic DO11.10 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.

For intracellular Foxp3 staining, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were stimulated with 2 &#x000b5;g/ml anti-CD3, 2 &#x000b5;g/ml anti-CD28, and 20 U/ml rIL-2 for 3 d. Cells were washed and stained with conjugated antibodies to CD4, CD3, and Foxp3 according to the manufacturer's instructions (eBioscience). Sorted (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup>) T cells from DO11.10 mice stimulated with OVA<sub>323-339</sub> peptide&#x02013;loaded bone marrow&#x02013;derived DCs were also used.

In others, DLN cells from OVA/alum&#x02013;sensitized BALB/c mice were stimulated ex vivo with OVA for 4 d and rested in rIL-2 for 6 d before FoxP3 staining. To perform the FACS analysis, we used a cytometer (Cytomics FC 500; Beckman Coulter). Cell death was determined by flow cytometry using annexin V/PI staining (BD).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Dr. P.
