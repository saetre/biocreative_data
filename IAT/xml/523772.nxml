Menadione, which generates free radicals, also induces these mRNAs. Deletion mutagenesis revealed that a region between -42 and -153 in the mouse MT-I promoter was essential for induction of a CAT reporter gene. A multimer of a 16 bp sequence (-101 to -86) that includes an antioxidant response element and overlapping adenovirus major late transcription factor binding site elevated basal expression and allowed induction by H2O2 when inserted upstream of a minimal promoter. However, deletion of this region (-100 to -89) from the intact MT-I promoter (-153) did not completely eliminate response. Multiple copies of a metal response element also permitted response to H2O2. These results suggest that induction of MT-I gene transcription by H2O2 is mediated by at least two different elements within the proximal MT-I gene promoter and suggest a previously undescribed function of the MRE. Induction of MT gene transcription by ROS and the subsequent scavenging of ROS by the MT peptide is reminiscent of the metal regulatory loop and is consistent with the hypothesized protective functions of MT.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0164-a" xlink:role="5018"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0164-b" xlink:role="5018"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0165-a" xlink:role="5019"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0165-b" xlink:role="5019"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0166-a" xlink:role="5020"/></fig><fig id="F6"><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0166-b" xlink:role="5020"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0162.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5016"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0163.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5017"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0164.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5018"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0165.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5019"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5020"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5021"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5022"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5023"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
