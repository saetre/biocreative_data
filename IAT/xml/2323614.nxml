Efficient and safe methods of DNA delivery need to be found for medical application. Here we report a new monopolar system of non-viral electro-gene transfer into the thymus <italic>in vivo</italic> that consists of the local application of electrical pulses after the introduction of the DNA. We assessed the proof of concept of this approach by correcting ZAP-70 deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in mice. The thymic electro-gene transfer of the pCMV-ZAP-70-IRES-EGFP vector in these mice resulted in rapid T cell differentiation in the thymus with mature lymphocytes detected by three weeks in secondary lymphoid organs. Moreover, this system resulted in the generation of long-term functional T lymphocytes. Peripheral reconstituted T cells displayed a diversified T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, and were responsive to alloantigens <italic>in vivo</italic>. This process applied to the thymus could represent a simplified and effective alternative for gene therapy of T cell immunodeficiencies.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The thymus is the primary site of generation of functional T lymphocytes. After maturation, T cells are released into the bloodstream and lymph fluid and then migrate to secondary lymphoid organs, mainly the spleen and lymph nodes. T lymphocytes play a crucial role in adaptative immune responses by recognizing antigens derived from pathogens or tumor cells. Adaptative immune responses may be impaired in several ways, including the natural mutations characterized by blocks in T cell development that have been described in mice and humans. These disorders are known collectively as SCIDs, because the clinical consequence is a devastating predisposition to infections and cancers. At least 9 different forms of human SCIDs have now been recognized and can be grouped according to genes involved such as &#x003b3;c, ADA, Artemis, ZAP-70, JAK-3, IL7R&#x003b1;, CD45, RAG-1 and RAG-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Fischer1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Gene therapy appears to be an appealing treatment by inserting corrective transgenes into abnormal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Fischer2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Recombinant viruses are effective vectors for transferring genes into haematopoietic precursors. However, the main limitations reside in the possible development of opportunist cancers and in the potential toxicity in peripheral lymphocytes of the gene expression system controlled by retroviral long terminal repeats (LTRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Kohn1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Gene therapy thus requires more efficient alternative therapeutic methods, using non-viral vectors in conjunction with an effective and safe physical process. Applying an electric field to cells and tissues significantly increases DNA uptake and gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Gehl1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Electroporation is usually performed by locally injecting DNA to the site of interest followed by the application of an electrical field. <italic>In vivo</italic>, electroporation has been already performed on several tissues, notably muscle and liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Prudhomme1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. However, to our knowledge the thymus has never been electrotransfected. Therefore, <italic>in vivo</italic> electroporation of thymus appears to be a promising method to circumvent severe immunodeficiencies. Classical processes are aggressive using bipolar and even multipolar electrodes, often involving incisions, and the success of gene transfer may be compromised by aggressive surgical procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Gehl1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here, we describe a new method of electroporation without any incision, using a monopolar device to target the thymus <italic>in vivo</italic>. We stably electro-gene transferred thymocytes during their maturation in the thymus. We found the corresponding mature transfected T lymphocytes correctly localized in T zones of lymph nodes and spleen one month following treatment. We evaluated the usefulness of this approach to treat thymus-linked SCIDs using a murine model of ZAP-70 deficiency. ZAP-70 is a protein tyrosine kinase crucially involved in T cell differentiation. Its absence results in a SCID phenotype with a block at the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> double-positive early stage of differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Kadlecek1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. ZAP-70 gene transfer by <italic>in vivo</italic> thymic electroporation in ZAP-70<sup>-/-</sup> mice results in the reconstitution of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> single-positive thymocytes and the long-term detection of a high number of peripheral T lymphocytes displaying a diversified TCR repertoire and normal functional properties.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A simple procedure to electroporate the thymus <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>The target organ is the mouse thymus. To transfect this deep organ directly <italic>in vivo</italic> without surgical intervention, we developed an electroporation procedure based on a monopolar device using a single needle as anode to inject the plasmid DNA and apply the electric field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002059-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The needle size was calibrated according to the animal size and thymus localization. On an anaesthetized mouse, a crocodile clip corresponding to the cathode, establishes skin contact on the paw opposite to the injection site. We introduced the needle between the first and the second rib keeping the angle of the needle at 45&#x000b0; from the longitudinal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002059-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, inset). Thereafter, a volume of 10 &#x000b5;l of highly concentrated plasmid DNA was slowly injected in one thymic lobe and the current was immediately delivered. The second lobe was then treated in the same way. This technique allows electrotransfection of the thymus without affecting vital proximal organs such as the heart and lung, since all mice survived the intervention. Impact points on each thymic lobe were observed following electroporation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002059.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Therefore, we established a safe simple procedure to electroporate the thymus <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><fig id="pone-0002059-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002059.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Monopolar electroporation of the thymus in anaesthetized mice.</title><p>(A) Bold dotted lines indicate the angle of axis legs.

Maximal gene expression 24 hours after electroporation was achieved at 300 V. The amount of luciferase was increased 30-fold compared to the control condition (0 V).

We observed a complete absence of luciferase expression at 0 and 600 V. In contrast, at 300 V the luciferase expression was still detected although decreased five fold relative to 24 hours post-electroporation. This decrease can be partly explained by two physiological processes of the thymus. Firstly, the T cell maturation in the thymus takes about one month and mature T lymphocytes then migrate towards secondary lymphoid organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Berzins1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Secondly, approximately 90&#x00025; of thymocytes are eliminated by apoptosis during selection mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Palmer1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Detailed observation of thymic sections revealed no necrosis or any sign of tissue damage near the injection site, suggesting that the procedure was well tolerated (data not shown). As expected, sections of the non-injected thymus exhibited no EGFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002059-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

The use of electric pulses to delive<italic>r in vivo</italic> therapeutic molecules to organs has seen rapid development over the last few years and represents an increasingly attractive non-viral method. The exponential increase in number of publications on the subject over the last 10 years testifies to this interest. By using bibliographic resources, using electroporation and gene therapy as key words, we found that electrotransfer has been applied to all easily accessible organs and also to internal organs when combined with surgery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Favard1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

To correct immunodeficiencies linked to natural mutations, transducing the therapeutic gene with a retroviral vector into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has provided a proof of concept for gene therapy.

The classical procedure is simplified for two reasons: first, a single electrified needle is used to inject the plasmid and apply the electrical field, and second no surgical intervention is required. The method is also simpler and more economical than viral approaches. It allows the reduction of risks because only DNA is electrotransferred into the thymus. The electrical parameters that we defined lead to the targeting of thymocytes at various stages of differentiation. It has been shown that dividing cells are highly transfectable compared to quiescent ones, suggesting that DNA enters the nucleus upon the disassembly of the nuclear envelope during mitosis. Therefore, synchronizing the electrotransfer protocol with mitosis has been shown to improve gene delivery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Golzio1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. In our case, we do not need to synchronize since thymocytes are continuously in cell cycle. This biological process increases the efficiency of thymocyte electroporation within the thymus. Thus, these encouraging results led us to investigate the usefulness of this method for correcting T cell combined immunodeficiencies as proof of concept.</p><p>The efficacy of this approach is in large part due to the reconstitution of a SCID phenotype where thymocyte development is blocked at the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> double-positive stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Kadlecek1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. We demonstrated that a direct electroporation of the ZAP-70 gene into thymi of ZAP-70<sup>-/-</sup> mice allows effective and rapid T cell reconstitution. Only two weeks later, CD4 and CD8 SP thymocyte differentiation occurred and significant numbers of T lymphocytes were present in the spleen and lymph nodes. Then, this non-viral approach achieved with nonsurgical intervention resulted in a significantly enhanced T cell reconstitution due to the direct targeting of the thymus. This observation is consistent with two recent studies which showed that intrathymic injection of either a ZAP-70 expressing lentiviral vector or WT HSCs enhances the kinetics of reconstitution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Adjali1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Adjali2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The efficacy of reconstitution by our method is also characterized in periphery by the detection of significant numbers of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes that exhibit a diverse TCR repertoire. The TCR repertoire observed in the reconstituted mice is characterized by a large pool of both alha and beta chains, although some discrete differences in the uses of V regions are observed in comparison to wild type mice. For instance in 10 months old reconstituted mice, V&#x003b1;1 and V&#x003b1;5 were not detected, and V&#x003b2;11 appeared under represented. The balance of the V uses in the repertoire is regulated during the ontogeny of the thymus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Pasqual1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Hamrouni1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In as much as the transfection is carried out in young adult mice, thus later than the first steps of TCR alpha rearrangement in the thymus of wild type mice, the difference observed in the use of V genes in reconstituted mice may reflect changes in the regulation of TCR rearrangement and expression. Whatever the relative frequencies of the various V, the high degree of junctional variability at the CDR3 provides enough diversity to restore a fully functional TCR repertoire. Obviously in this model where thymocyte development is blocked at the DP stage, only transfected T lymphocytes can migrate and be functional at the periphery. Over the long-term, a peripheral partially diversified TCR repertoire was sufficient to provide functional T cells that mount <italic>in vivo</italic> immune responses to skin allografts and this response is specific to the alloantigens encountered (data not shown). Moreover, we monitored the persistence of long-lived T cells in periphery more than sixteen months after thymic electroporation and verified that both CD8 and CD4 T cells respond properly to an OVA DNA vaccine. Our data suggest that T cells persist for long periods in the periphery after their reconstitution by electro-gene transfer.</p><p>It is also important to note that the electroporation does not impair a normal immune response, as shown by this study and as well as by previous work on <italic>in vivo</italic> electroporation of splenic T lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002059-Tupin1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

In each profile, the peaks corresponding to the reading frame are indicated. In WT, the spectral distribution of the sizes is representative of polyclonal composition of the TCR Valpha1 transcripts. In ZAP-70 deficient mice, no TCR transcripts are found in the spleen, whereas a few peaks of TCR Valpha1 transcripts are detected in the thymus, which are issued from non productive transcription known to take place in these mice. After electroporation of ZAP-70 plasmid (ZAP-70-/- 300 V), TCR transcripts bearing 1&#x003b1;V are detected in the thymus as well as in the spleen. The spectral distributions of the CDR3 sizes are, and on the one hand, similar in the thymus and the spleen of ZAP-70-/- 300 V electroporated mice, and on the other similar for WT and ZAP-70-/- 300 V electroporated mice.
