Identification of novel, tissue-specific STAT5 regulated genes would advance the ability to combat diseases due to aberrant STAT5 signaling. In the present work a library of human STAT5 bound genomic elements was created and validated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of several STAT5 responsive genomic regulatory elements identified, one was located within the first intron of the human <italic>BCL10 </italic>gene. Chromatin immuno-precipitation reactions confirmed constitutive <italic>in vivo </italic>STAT5 binding to this intronic fragment in various human lymphoid tumor cell lines. Interestingly, non-phosphorylated STAT5 was found in the nuclei of Kit225 and YT cells in the absence of cytokine stimulation that paralleled constitutive NF&#x003ba;B activation. Inhibition of the hyperactive JAK3/STAT5 pathway in MT-2 cells via the Mannich-base, NC1153, diminished the constitutive <italic>in vivo </italic>occupancy of BCL10-SBR by STAT5, reduced NF&#x003ba;B activity and BCL10 protein expression in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, depletion of STAT5 via selective antisense oligonucleotide treatment similarly resulted in decreased BCL10 mRNA and protein expression, cellular viability and impaired NF&#x003ba;B activity independent of IL-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results suggest that the NF&#x003ba;B regulator BCL10 is an IL-2-independent STAT5 target gene. These findings proffer a model in which un-activated STAT5 can regulate pathways critical for lymphoid cell survival and inhibitors that disrupt STAT5 function independent of tyrosine phosphorylation may be therapeutically effective in treating certain leukemias/lymphomas.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The family of mammalian Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) molecules is composed of 7 members (STAT1&#x02013;4, 5A, 5B and 6) which mediates a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation and survival (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). Current dogma suggests that STATs are latent factors residing in the cytosol that only become activated following ligand binding to receptors that initially results in the recruitment and activation of Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs). JAKs then phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor that serve as docking sites for SH2 domain-containing STATs and other signaling molecules. STATs subsequently become tyrosine phosphorylated by JAKs or other tyrosine kinases, disengage from the receptor, form dimers via phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interactions, and translocate to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Mammalian STATs can be classified based in parts on their function in promoting various cellular processes. For example, STATs 2, 4 and 6 are critical for the immune system to promote viral defense and Th1 versus Th2 differentiation, respectively. Conversely, STATs 1, 3, 5A and 5B are generally utilized by cytokines and growth factors that promote cellular growth, proliferation or death (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). The members of this second group are associated with cancer formation, including STAT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Intriguingly, STAT3 and STAT5 promote cell survival through shared target genes, including <italic>Bcl-x </italic>and <italic>Pim-1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Mice devoid of <italic>Stat5a </italic>and <italic>Stat5b </italic>genes have further established these proteins as important regulators of T-cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Interestingly, IL-2 induced T cell proliferation was markedly affected only when both <italic>Stat5a </italic>and <italic>Stat5b </italic>genes were inactivated suggesting that they play redundant roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In addition to lymphocytes, STAT5A and STAT5B act as major survival factors for several cell types including mammary epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and human prostate cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Cancer cells from certain lymphomas and leukemias also display hyper tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 as a result of chromosomal translocations, deregulated tyrosine kinases or viral transformation as reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Chromatin immuno-precipitation has been a widely utilized method to study direct transcription factor-DNA interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and for identifying transcription factor binding sites in unknown target genes by cloning captured DNA material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] generated from a genome-wide library that ultimately can be sequenced and located. Alternatively, captured DNA material can be hybridized to microarrays representing (i) CpG rich regions of a genome that are contained in a significant portion of promoter elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] or (ii) non-coding regions within whole chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Both of these aforementioned methods have shed new light onto the biological function, location and kinetics of transcription factor/DNA binding dependent gene expression.</p><p>The present study was designed to identify genome-wide immune specific STAT5 regulated genes. This approach has shown promise in identifying STAT5 target genes in mouse pro-B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and human prolactin treated T47-D breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A library of STAT5-bound genomic fragments was created by cloning and sequencing chromatin immuno-precipitated DNA fragments from the human lymphoma cell line, YT. One of these sequences was identified within an intronic element of the <italic>BCL10 </italic>gene. We showed that STAT5 constitutively occupied this region <italic>in vivo </italic>in multiple human lymphoid cell lines. Intriguingly, non-phosphorylated STAT5 was present in the nuclei of lymphoid cells that paralleled constitutively active NF&#x003ba;B. Disrupting JAK3 activity diminished the <italic>in vivo </italic>binding of STAT5 to BCL10-SBR in MT-2 cells, reduced NF&#x003ba;B activity and BCL10 protein expression. Furthermore, specific STAT5 depletion correlated with decreased NF&#x003ba;B DNA-binding, cell viability and BCL10 protein expression in both the presence and absence of IL-2. Taken together, these findings indicate a novel cross-talk mechanism between the STAT5 and NF&#x003ba;B pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Generation of a library encoding STAT5 Binding Regions</title><p>Since STAT5 is critical for maintaining lymphoid cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], we sought to identify putative target genes that could be responsible for this phenotype. In the present work a lymphoma-specific library of IL-2-induced STAT5 bound genomic elements was generated by cloning chromatin immuno-precipitated genomic sites directly occupied by STAT5 as described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and in the Methods.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>(A) Generation of a library encoding STAT5-responsive genomic elements by ChIP-cloning</bold>.

Next, STAT5 was immuno-precipitated with antibodies raised against the N-terminus (recognizes both STAT5A and STAT5B, lanes c-d) or the C-terminus of either STAT5A (lane e) or STAT5B (lane f), or normal rabbit serum as control IgG (lane g), separated by SDS-PAGE, and subsequently Western blotted with monoclonal anti-STAT5 antibody. Whole cell lysate (1% of IP) was also loaded to demonstrate equal input material for immuno-precipitation (lanes a-b). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, all three antibodies were competent to bind STAT5 (indicated by arrow to the right) from fixed cells as compared to the control (lane g). To confirm successful capture of genomic elements known to be occupied by STAT5, qPCR reactions were performed with primers designed to the region harboring a known STAT5 binding site within the human <italic>IL2RA </italic>enhancer (Positive Regulatory Region PRR III; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Data presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> indicated that STAT5 antibody successfully enriched PRR III as compared to control IgG (nrs).</p><p>Next, a library containing STAT5 bound genomic fragments was created by amplification and cloning ChIP-ed DNA material as described in the Methods. The colonies were tested for the presence of inserts by direct PCR amplification using vector specific M13 primers (representative colonies shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) prior to sequencing. One hundred and nineteen clones were sequenced and the genomic locations analyzed with nearby gene mapping (CEAS) as described in the Methods. Genomic allocation of the clones is depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> demonstrating the majority of the identified sequences were found in intronic (38%) and enhancer (51%) regions. These data are in agreement with earlier findings that binding sites of transcription factors are not restricted to promoter regions, rather, a significant portion of these sites are present in introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Validation of putative STAT5 binding genomic regions by EMSA-cold competition assays</title><p>To confirm that clones encoding the sequenced genomic elements (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) can be bound by STAT5, inserts from randomly selected colonies were amplified (from 52 clones, 10 representatives shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, upper panel) and used in 30&#x02013;50-fold molar excess as cold competitors in EMSA assays employing [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled probe corresponding to the STAT5 binding site in the <italic>&#x003b2;-casein </italic>gene promoter and nuclear extracts from IL-2 stimulated YT cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lower panel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The results were quantitated by comparing the band intensities of the cold competition EMSA reactions to the control reaction (as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> graph). Of 52 validated clones, 24 fragments caused greater than 50% decrease in STAT5 DNA-binding intensity to the radioactively labeled probe. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> summarizes the genomic location of the 20 validated clones located within 300 kb of coding sequences as performed by CEAS (four genomic segments were further than 300 kb from any coding regions).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>(A) Validation of the STAT5 genomic library by cold competition EMSA analysis</bold>.

DNA-binding was expressed as % of control (a reaction without cold competitor (-)) as shown in the graph. The PCR amplicon surrounding the STAT5 binding site in the enhancer of the human <italic>CISH </italic>gene was used as a positive control. (B) <bold>Validation of STAT5 binding to BCL10-SBR</bold>.

The <italic>BCL10 </italic>gene is located on chromosome 1 and is composed of four exons and three introns. The STAT5 binding region was confined to the second intron, proximal to the 5' end of the third exon which we designated as the BCL10-STAT5 Binding Region (BCL10-SBR). To confirm this finding, PCR amplified BCL10-SBR was used as a cold competitor in EMSA assays as described above. Data from two independent experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) showed that BCL10-SBR reduced STAT5 binding to the radioactively labeled probe greater than 80% suggesting that this element was bound by STAT5 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The genomic region surrounding the STAT5 binding site in the human CISH promoter was also amplified and used as a positive control. BCL10 is an adapter molecule implicated in antigen receptor-mediated NF&#x003ba;B signaling by linking to the I&#x003ba;B kinase complex.

However, IL-2-induced enrichment of the STAT5-responsive PRR III showed that STAT5 was able to bind DNA in a tyrosine-phosphorylation dependent manner as well in these cell lines. Earlier studies with STAT1 indicated that non-phosphorylated STAT1 had unique genomic binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Based on these results it may be logical to assume that non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated (cytokine independent and dependent, respectively) STAT5 might have unique target sites, different binding characteristics, and perhaps binding partners.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>STAT5 constitutively occupies BCL10-SBR <italic>in vivo </italic>in Kit225, MT2 and Hut102 cells</bold>.

However, new evidence suggests that STAT proteins traffic to the nucleus and regulate gene expression independent of tyrosine phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Indeed, data presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> indicated that STAT5 can bind to BCL10-SBR in a constitutive manner in three cell types tested in the absence of IL-2. To confirm this hypothesis, nuclear and cytosolic proteins were isolated from Kit225 (lanes a-j) and YT cells (lanes k-t) stimulated with IL-2 for the times indicated, equal amounts (10 &#x003bc;g) of proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with PY-STAT5 antibody (specifically recognizes phosphorylated Y694 and 699 for STAT5A and B, respectively) followed by re-probing the membrane for total STAT5. Antibodies to Lamin A/C (nuclear marker) and JAK3 (cytosolic marker) were employed to confirm the purity of the extraction. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, non-phosphorylated STAT5 was present in the cell nuclei in the absence of IL-2 stimulation. However, IL-2 was able to induce accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 in the nuclear fraction. These data suggest that the presence of STAT5 in the nuclei is not dependent on its tyrosine phosphorylation status. To further demonstrate that non-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 can localize to the nuclear compartment in lymphoid cells, wild type (wt) or Y694F mutant of mSTAT5A (unable to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]) were N-terminally FLAG-tagged and over-expressed in YT cells as described in the Methods. Next, nuclear extracts were prepared from cells over-expressing vector alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lane a), wt (lanes b-c) or Y694F mSTAT5A (lanes d-e) stimulated with medium (-) or IL-2 (+) for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C as indicated. Nuclear extracts were immuno-precipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies then Western blotted with antibodies to PY (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, upper lane), STAT5 (middle lane) or FLAG (lower lane). While wt mSTAT5A was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon IL-2 stimulation, the Y694F mutant was not. However, both wt and Y694F mSTAT5A were constitutively present in the cell nuclei suggesting that STAT5 nuclear localization can occur in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. To confirm that YT cells over-expressing Y694F mSTAT5A retained the ability to respond to IL-2, as well as to demonstrate that STAT5 nuclear presence was not due to contamination with cytosolic proteins, whole nuclear extracts isolated above were Western blotted with PY-STAT5 then re-blotted with antibodies to STAT5, Lamin A/C (a nuclear marker) followed by &#x003b2;-actin (cytosolic marker) as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>.

However, interesting new evidence suggests that nuclear-localized non-tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs can regulate gene expression.

EMSA analysis was performed with either a [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled NF&#x003ba;B (lower panel) or STAT5 (upper panel) probe and 5 &#x003bc;g nuclear extracts from YT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, lanes b-d), Kit225 (lanes e-g) cells or na&#x000ef;ve (lanes h-j) and activated (lanes k-m) human PBMCs stimulated with medium (-) or IL-2 (+) for 30 min.

Although the precise regulation of STAT5 by JAK3 is not yet fully understood, it has been shown that phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3 can increase the expression of non-phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, it was hypothesized that non-phosphorylated STAT5 function could partially be affected by the inhibition of phosphorylated STAT5. First, the activation status of the JAK3/STAT5 pathway was tested in MT-2 cells treated with ascending amounts of NC1153 for 24 h as indicated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, lanes c-e) by Western blotting. Constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 was diminished by NC1153 in a dose dependent manner as compared to non-treated (NT, lane a) or vehicle treated (DMSO, lane b) samples. Equal loading was confirmed by re-probing the membrane with antibodies to STAT5 and GAPDH. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 was similarly decreased upon NC1153 treatment (data not shown). Next, <italic>in vivo </italic>binding of STAT5 to PRR III and BCL10-SBR were assessed by ChIP assays and qPCR. As presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, the occupancy of these regions by STAT5 was reduced in a dose dependent manner upon NC1153 (expressed as fold change of STAT5 binding over background (IgG control)). Lastly, the functional effect of JAK3 blockade on the expression of BCL10 protein and the activation status of NF&#x003ba;B was assessed. Since BCL10 is a known regulator of NF&#x003ba;B signaling in lymphoid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] that is a critical pathway for mediating survival of activated B- and T-cells, it was reasonable to assume that STAT5 depletion mediated decrease of BCL10 expression might lead to diminished constitutive NF&#x003ba;B activation. For this assay, MT-2 cells were treated with DMSO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, lane a) or ascending concentrations of NC1153 for 48 h as indicated (lanes b-d), then harvested and Western blotted with antibodies to phospho-p65/NF&#x003ba;B, p65/NF&#x003ba;B and BCL10. Indeed, data presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref> demonstrated that phosphorylation of p65 NF&#x003ba;B on Ser536, an indicator of its enhanced transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], was decreased in parallel to BCL10 protein expression upon NC1153 treatment. Equal loading was confirmed by re-probing the membrane with GAPDH (lower panel). It should be noted that some reduction in the level of total p65 resulted from the treatments with higher concentrations of NC1153 that could be due to decreased cellular viability at this time point. However, the lowest dose of NC1153 (10 &#x003bc;M) did not affect total p65 but reduced its Ser536 phosphorylation as well as BCL10 levels confirming that these reductions were not due to non-specific treatment effects.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>JAK3/STAT5 blockade inhibits constitutive STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and BCL10/NF&#x003ba;B activity in MT-2 cells</bold>.

These data suggest that STAT5 regulates constitutive NF&#x003ba;B signaling in an IL-2-independent manner in Kit225 cells.</p><p>In summary, our results demonstrate that STAT5 mediated BCL10 expression occurs in the absence or presence of cytokine stimulation and STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, these data indicate that STAT5 and NF&#x003ba;B pathways are interconnected and critical for regulating lymphoid/leukemic cancer cell proliferation/survival genes. The functional relevance of these findings is that therapeutic strategies that seek to disrupt cancer disease progression by blocking STAT tyrosine phosphorylation status alone may not prove effective and may be tumor or cell type dependent. Indeed, targeted disruption of tyrosine and non-tyrosine phosphorylated forms of STAT5 may both be required.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and treatment</title><p>The human lymphoma cell lines YT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and Hut102 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], the human T-cell line MT-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and leukemia cell line Kit225 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and penicillin-streptomycin (50 IU/ml and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml, respectively).
