Patients with ischemic heart disease have elevated plasma levels of endothelin-1 and angiotensin II and show increased vascular tone. The aim of the present study was to examine the endothelin and angiotensin II receptor expression in subcutaneous arteries from patients with different degrees of ischemic heart disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Subcutaneous arteries were obtained, by biopsy from the abdomen, from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery because of ischemic heart disease (n = 15), patients with angina pectoris without established myocardial infarction (n = 15) and matched cardiovascular healthy controls (n = 15). Endothelin type A (ET<sub>A</sub>) and type B (ET<sub>B</sub>), and angiotensin type 1 (AT<sub>1</sub>) and type 2 (AT<sub>2</sub>) receptors expression and function were examined using immunohistochemistry, Western blot and <italic>in vitro </italic>pharmacology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>ET<sub>A </sub>and, to a lesser extent, ET<sub>B </sub>receptor staining was observed in the healthy vascular smooth muscle cells. The level of ET<sub>B </sub>receptor expression was higher in patients undergoing CABG surgery (250% &#x000b1; 23%; P &#x0003c; 0.05) and in the patients with angina pectoris (199% &#x000b1; 6%; P &#x0003c; 0.05), than in the healthy controls (100% &#x000b1; 28%). The data was confirmed by Western blotting. Arteries from CABG patients showed increased vasoconstriction upon administration of the selective ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist sarafotoxin S6c, compared to healthy controls (P &#x0003c; 0.05). No such difference was found for the ET<sub>A </sub>receptors. AT<sub>1 </sub>and, to a lesser extent, AT<sub>2 </sub>receptor immunostaining was seen in the vascular smooth muscle cells. The level of AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor expression was higher in both the angina pectoris (128% &#x000b1; 25%; P &#x0003c; 0.05) and in the CABG patients (203% &#x000b1; 41%; P &#x0003c; 0.05), as compared to the healthy controls (100% &#x000b1; 25%). The increased AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor expression was confirmed by Western blotting. Myograph experiment did however not show any change in vasoconstriction to angiotensin II in CABG patients compared to healthy controls (P = n.s).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results demonstrate, for the first time, upregulation of ET<sub>B </sub>and AT<sub>1 </sub>receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells in ischemic heart disease. These receptors may play a role in the pathophysiology of ischemic heart disease and could provide important targets for pharmaceutical interventions.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The renin-angiotensin and the endothelin systems are essential in vascular homeostasis and may become maladaptive in cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Angiotensin II and endothelin-1 are formed in the endothelium and induce potent vasoconstriction and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The continuous production of endothelin-1 and angiotensin II in the endothelium is important for the control of vessel tone and changes in the endothelin- and renin-angiotensin-systems can give rise to dysfunctional vessels such as those seen in patients with cardiovascular risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Endothelin-1 and angiotensin II have therefore been suggested to play a role in the development if cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], chronic heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Endothelin-1 mediates its effects through two distinct G-protein coupled receptors; the endothelin type A (ET<sub>A</sub>) and type B (ET<sub>B</sub>) receptors. During physiologic conditions, the ET<sub>A </sub>receptor is the dominant receptor subtype expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and mediates contraction, while the ET<sub>B </sub>receptor is primarily located on endothelial cells and mediates vasodilatation via the release of nitric oxide and prostaglandins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. ET<sub>B </sub>receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells have however been observed to be upregulated during pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and congestive heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Endothelin receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells are both mitogenic, leading to atherosclerosis and can induce strong vasoconstriction, resulting in elevated vascular tone that contributes to the development of ischemic cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Two angiotensin II receptors have been identified in man, AT<sub>1 </sub>and AT<sub>2 </sub>receptors, which are members of the G-protein coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor family. The vascular effects of angiotensin II are primarily mediated by AT<sub>1 </sub>receptors located on smooth muscle cells which induce vasoconstriction and mitogenesis. Conversely, AT<sub>2 </sub>receptors are located on endothelial cells and are known to induce vasodilatation, inhibit cell growth and stimulate apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. AT<sub>2 </sub>receptors have been shown, although to a lesser extent, in vascular smooth muscle cells. Angiotensin II acts, apart from being a potent vasoconstrictor also as a growth factor that regulates cell growth, differentiation and fibrosis, as well as being implicated in the pathology of heart failure, hypertension and atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In vivo studies on the effects of endothelin-1 and angiotensin II in the human peripheral vasculature have previously mainly been performed using a forearm blood flow model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first <italic>in vitro </italic>study using peripheral vascular tissue samples isolated from patients with different degrees of cardiovascular disease. The peripheral vasculature is contributing significantly to total peripheral resistance leading to our use of small peripheral arteries and arterioles, obtained from the subcutaneous tissue in patients. Patients with angina pectoris without established myocardial infarction, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery because of ischemic heart disease and cardiovascular healthy controls, were included in the study. The expressions of endothelin ET<sub>A </sub>and ET<sub>B</sub>, and angiotensin AT<sub>1 </sub>and AT<sub>2 </sub>receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells were studied by using immunohistochemistry, Western blot and <italic>in vitro </italic>pharmacology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>The project was approved by the Ethics Committee of Lund University in Sweden (LU Dnr: 308/2004) and conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) (n = 10). These patients underwent elective CABG because of stabile ischemic heart disease confirmed by angiography revealing coronary disease in three arteries.

For the control group and the patient with angina pectoris, this was done during local anaesthesia (2 ml, 1% Xylocain; AstraZeneca, Sweden). For the patients undergoing CABG surgery the biopsy was taken under general anaesthesia during the initiation of surgery. A subcutaneous tissue (1 cm<sup>3</sup>), containing small arteries, was removed from the abdomen. The tissue was frozen in ice-cold isopentane and stored at -80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>The biopsies were stored at -80&#x000b0;C prior to sectioning into 8-<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m-thick slices in a calibrated Microm HM500M cryostat (Microm).

The subjects had the same clinical characteristics as those for immunohistochemistry (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Vessels were placed in saline buffer on ice, transported to the laboratory and subsequently analyzed for their contractile properties in a myograph recording their isometric tension. The vessels were cut into 1-mm-long cylindrical segments and mounted on two L-shaped metal prongs, unilaterally a force displacement transducer continuously recorded the isometric tension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Mounted vessel segments were immersed in vessel baths at 37&#x000b0;C containing a bicarbonate based buffer solution; NaCl (119 mM), NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>(15 mM), KCl (4.6 mM), CaCl<sub>2 </sub>(1.5 mM), MgCl (1.2 mM), NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>(1.2 mM), and glucose (5.5 mM). The buffer was continuously aerated with oxygen enriched with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>resulting in pH 7.4. Initially vessels were stretched to a resting tone of 2 mN and was then allowed to stabilize at this tension for 1 h. Contractile capacity of each arterial vessel segment was controlled by exposure to a potassium rich (63.5 mM) buffer solution. Concentration-response curves were obtained by cumulative application of endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist, sarafotoxin 6c at increasing concentrations (10<sup>-11</sup>-10<sup>-6 </sup>mM), ET-1 (AnaSpec, San Jose, CA) in the concentration range 10<sup>-14 </sup>to 10<sup>-7 </sup>M and angiotensin II in the concentration range 10<sup>-12 </sup>to 10<sup>-6 </sup>M. Before the application of angiotensin II, the arteries were pretreated with the AT<sub>2 </sub>receptor antagonist PD-123319 (10<sup>-5.5 </sup>M) for 30 min. After washout, the vessels returned to baseline and endothelin-1 was then added at increasing concentrations (10<sup>-11</sup>-10<sup>-6 </sup>mM) when endothelin ET<sub>B</sub>receptors were desensitized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] facilitating endothelin-1 to act solely on the endothelin ET<sub>A </sub>receptors.

The protein concentrations were determined using the protein assay reagents (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until immunoblotting assay. The protein homogenates were diluted 7:2:1(v/v) with 5&#x000d7; LDS Sample Buffer and 10&#x000d7; DTT Reducer (PAGEgel, Inc. San Diego, CA, USA). A total of 40-50 &#x003bc;g of protein was boiled for 5 min and separated by 4-12% SDS Ready Gels (PAGEgel, Inc., USA) for 120 min at 100 v, and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) at 100 v for 60 min. The membrane was then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma) and 5% non-fat dried milk, and incubated with sheep anti-ET<sub>B </sub>(Enzo Life Sciences Inc., Farmingdale, NY, USA), rabbit anti-AT<sub>1 </sub>(Abcam plc., Cambridge, UK), or rabbit anti-&#x003b2;-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Boston, MA, USA) polyclonal primary antibodies diluted 1:200-500 overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, followed by incubation with anti-sheep (Abcam plc., UK) or anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) IgG, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1: 5000 for 1 h at room temperature. The probed proteins were developed by LumiSensor Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate kit (GenScript Corp., Piscataway, NJ, USA). To detect multiple signals using a single membrane, the membrane was incubated for 5-15 min at room temperature with restored plus Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL. USA). The membranes were visualized using a Fujifilm LAS-1000 Luminiscent Image Analyzer (Stamford, CT, USA.).

The levels of ET<sub>B </sub>receptor expression are even higher in arteries from patients undergoing CABG surgery. We hypothesize that there is a progressive upregulation of this receptor subtype that may correlate with the degree of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Upregulated ET<sub>B </sub>receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells have previously been shown in diabetes, hypertension and in human atherosclerotic coronary arteries and in atherosclerotic plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Plasma levels of ET-1 are elevated in patients with ischemic heart disease and in heart failure; it has been suggested as a prognostic marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The circulating ET-1 levels are further increased in patients undergoing CABG surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This increased activity in the endothelin system may contribute to smooth muscle cell proliferation, vasoconstriction and decreased perfusion in atherosclerotic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, CABG patients had significantly increased pro-BNP levels indicating some degree of heart failure, a condition associated with increased ET<sub>B </sub>receptor mediated systemic vasoconstriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The elevated endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>contraction in the present study, also verified by Western blot, indicates that the increased levels of contractile endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptors on the vascular smooth muscle cells could play an important role in ischemic heart disease since ET<sub>B </sub>receptor activation in healthy controls did not induce any contractions at all.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanisms underlying the upregulation of ET<sub>B </sub>receptors</title><p>The mechanism underlying the increased ET<sub>B </sub>receptor expression is not known, but could depend on increased transcription of ET<sub>B </sub>receptor mRNA triggered by some of the many humeral factors that are increased in ischemic heart disease. Upregulation of ET<sub>B </sub>receptors is known to rely on increased transcription and subsequent translation of receptor mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the human genome, the 5'-flanking region of the genes encoding the endothelin receptors contain several regulatory elements, like GATA-motifs and E-boxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This indicates that the genes might be activated by for example inflammatory components. Indeed, the presence of interleukin-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; may enhance the upregulation of vascular ET<sub>B </sub>receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In agreement, the patients with ischemic heart disease had higher plasma levels of C reactive protein. Atherosclerosis is known to induce a proinflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and this may in part regulate endothelin receptor expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Angiotensin II receptor expression</title><p>In the present study, the levels of AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor expression were higher in subcutaneous arteries from patients with ischemic heart disease than in the healthy controls as verified by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The levels of expression were even higher in arteries from patients undergoing CABG surgery. The plasma level of angiotensin II is known to be elevated in different heart conditions, such as heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], hypercholesterolemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and hyperglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We have found, herein, that this may be associated with enhanced expression of vascular angiotensin II receptors. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and mitogen of coronary artery smooth muscle cells. The stimulation of AT<sub>1 </sub>receptors results in progression of atherosclerotic lesions, inflammation and plaque rupture. Increased expression of AT<sub>1 </sub>receptors might make the vasculature prone to develop spasm and atherosclerotic plaques, and thus further increase peripheral vascular resistance and reduce lumen. However, we did not observe any enhanced contraction of angiotensin II mediated via AT<sub>1 </sub>receptors as a result of an increased expression in the myograph experiments. One explanation to this could be the increased use of AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor antagonists in patients undergoing CABG, thus blocking the AT<sub>1 </sub>receptors. It is important, however, not to forget that AT<sub>1 </sub>receptors apart from their contractile properties also possess other abilities such as regulating cell growth, differentiation and fibrosis which are important in the pathology of heart failure, hypertension and atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanisms underlying the upregulation of AT<sub>1 </sub>receptors</title><p>The mechanisms underlying the upregulation of AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor expression in patients with ischemic heart disease cannot be deduced from the present study. Inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1 and IL-6, may upregulate AT<sub>1 </sub>receptors and enhance angiotensin II stimulated vessel hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In the present study, the observed plasma levels of C reactive protein was elevated in patients with ischemic heart disease. It has previously been shown that high levels of C reactive protein correlate with high levels of AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Increased AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor expression has therefore been associated with vascular inflammation. C reactive protein is known to independently predict risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral artery disease and sudden cardiac death even among apparently healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical perspective</title><p>Both ET-1 and angiotensin II have strong impact on cardiovascular diseases as discussed above; herein we will discuss their involvements in other situations: CABG surgery is hampered by deleterious vasospasm in arterial grafts. It has been suggested that impaired vasomotor function may contribute to this vasospasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Plasma levels of ET-1 and angiotensin II are elevated during CABG surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Both endothelin and angiotensin II receptors have been shown to mediate strong vasoconstrictor effects in bypass grafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Many measures have been undertaken to control the vessel tone during surgery, including dilating the vessels with potent vasodilators such as papaverine, sodium nitroprusside and nifedipine, or mechanically distending the vessels with saline. It might be important to consider endothelin and angiotensin II receptor antagonists for this indication especially since the present results show increased levels of endothelin and angiotensin II receptor expression in patients undergoing CABG surgery.</p><p>Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor antagonists are frequently being used to prevent the development of target organ damage in atherosclerotic disease and in hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Whether endothelin receptor antagonists will become part of the therapeutic armamentarium in ischemic heart disease remains unclear, and none of these agents is currently being developed for this indication. However, the mixed endothelin blocker Bosentan is used in treatment of pulmonary hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and other non-selective ET receptor antagonists have been shown to inhibit the development of atherosclerosis in experimental models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. New endothelin antagonists devoid of side effects and perhaps specific for either of the receptor subtypes are discussed in treatment of vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], or alternative inhibitors of the endothelin converting enzymes that generate endothelin-1 may in the future become available to block the endothelin system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The present study has demonstrated increased expression of ET<sub>B </sub>and AT<sub>1 </sub>receptors in patients with ischemic heart disease. However, the patients have confounding factors. The systolic blood pressure was higher in patients with ischemic heart disease compared to the healthy controls. Furthermore, the prevalence of medication with statins, beta blockers, ACEI, and AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor antagonists was common in patients with ischemic heart disease while they were non-existing in our healthy controls. The effect of these confounding factors on the endothelin and angiotensin II receptor expression cannot be concluded from the present study.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study clearly shows that patients with ischemic heart disease have upregulated ET<sub>B </sub>and AT<sub>1 </sub>receptors in the smooth muscle cells of peripheral resistance arteries. The level of ET<sub>B </sub>and AT<sub>1 </sub>expression correlates with the degree of ischemic heart disease, being highest in the patients undergoing CABG surgery. There was no difference in the expression of ET<sub>A </sub>or AT<sub>2 </sub>receptors between the study groups. The changes in ET<sub>B </sub>and AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor expression may be signs of remodeling of the vasculature, which is characteristic of ongoing ischemic heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ID planned and executed the immunofluorescence experiments, analyzed the data, preformed the surgical procedure and wrote the manuscript.
