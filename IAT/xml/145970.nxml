We also show that monoclonal antibodies raised against synthetic hnRNP-M peptides can directly inhibit in vitro splicing. Furthermore, stressing cells at 45 degrees C for 10 min is sufficient to abolish the splicing capacity of subsequently prepared nuclear extracts which, interestingly, do not contain the hnRNP-M proteins any more. Taken together, our data suggest that these proteins are involved in splicing as well as in early stress-induced splicing arrest. Further in situ hybridization assays located the hnRNP-M encoding gene on human chromosome 19.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
