A key enzyme that counteracts Cdk during budding yeast mitotic exit is the Cdc14 phosphatase. Cdc14 is inactive for much of the cell cycle, sequestered by its inhibitor Net1 in the nucleolus. At anaphase onset, separase-dependent down-regulation of PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> allows phosphorylation of Net1 and consequent Cdc14 release. How separase causes PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> down-regulation is not known. Here, we show that two Cdc55-interacting proteins, Zds1 and Zds2, contribute to timely Cdc14 activation during mitotic exit. Zds1 and Zds2 are required downstream of separase to facilitate nucleolar Cdc14 release. Ectopic Zds1 expression in turn is sufficient to down-regulate PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> and promote Net1 phosphorylation. These findings identify Zds1 and Zds2 as new components of the mitotic exit machinery, involved in activation of the Cdc14 phosphatase at anaphase onset. Our results suggest that these proteins may act as separase-regulated PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> inhibitors.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: APC, anaphase-promoting complex; MEN, mitotic exit network; PAK, p21-activated kinase; PP2A, type 2A protein phosphatase.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Complexes between cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) govern the progression through the cell division cycle in all eukaryotes. Entry into mitosis occurs when cyclin B/Cdk (Clb2/Cdk in budding yeast) reaches a peak of kinase activity. This leads to formation of the mitotic spindle, condensation of the chromosomes, and their alignment on the spindle. Successful bipolar attachment of the chromosomes releases an inhibitory mitotic checkpoint signal, allowing the activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) by its coactivator Cdc20 (APC<sup>Cdc20</sup>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peters, 2006</xref>). APC<sup>Cdc20</sup> is a ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates securin, an inhibitor of the protease separase. Ubiquitinated securin is targeted for degradation by the proteasome, thus freeing separase. Sister chromatid separation, and thereby anaphase onset, is now triggered when separase cleaves the Scc1 subunit of the chromosomal cohesin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>). At this time, APC<sup>Cdc20</sup> also targets mitotic cyclins for degradation to down-regulate mitotic Cdk activity. However, APC<sup>Cdc20</sup> is not sufficient for complete cyclin destruction and Cdk inactivation. In addition, activation of the mitotic phosphatase Cdc14 is essential to promote exit from mitosis (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stegmeier and Amon, 2004</xref>). Cdc14 contributes to the down-regulation of Cdk activity by dephosphorylating and thereby activating a second coactivator of the APC, Cdh1, which completes the destruction of mitotic cyclins, as well as the Cdk inhibitor Sic1. Cdc14 furthermore directly counteracts Cdk activity by dephosphorylating mitotic Cdk targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Visintin et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>For much of the cell cycle, Cdc14 is kept inactive in the nucleolus by binding to its nucleolar inhibitor Net1 (also called Cfi1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Visintin et al., 1999</xref>). During anaphase, mitotic kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Net1 releases active Cdc14. Phosphorylated Net1 shows reduced affinity for, and looses its ability to inhibit Cdc14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yoshida and Toh-e, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azzam et al., 2004</xref>). Two complementary regulatory pathways are essential for Cdc14 release from the nucleolus. During early anaphase, separase initiates Net1 phosphorylation and Cdc14 release in conjunction with a series of proteins, Slk19, Spo12, and Fob1. The action of these proteins has been summarized as the Cdc fourteen early anaphase release (FEAR) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stegmeier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azzam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Queralt et al., 2006</xref>). Initial Cdc14 release is promoted by Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azzam et al., 2004</xref>), which is counteracted in metaphase by the type 2A protein phosphatase (PP2A) in conjunction with its Cdc55 activatory subunit (PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Queralt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yellman and Burke, 2006</xref>). Separase-dependent PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> down-regulation at anaphase onset allows Net1 phosphorylation and Cdc14 release. PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> down-regulation, declining Cdk activity, and released Cdc14 now activate a G protein&#x02013;coupled kinase signaling cascade, the mitotic exit network (MEN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaspersen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). The MEN maintains Cdc14 active during the later stages of anaphase when mitotic Cdk activity declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaspersen and Morgan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stegmeier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Queralt et al., 2006</xref>). Kinases of the MEN, including Polo kinase, may act to sustain Net1 phosphorylation at this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yoshida and Toh-e, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Visintin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>PP2A is a family of widely conserved protein serine/threonine phosphatases, with roles in a multitude of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stark, 1996</xref>). They function as a trimeric complex, a catalytic subunit (in budding yeast one of the two closely related proteins Pph21 or Pph22), a scaffold subunit (Tpd3 in budding yeast), and a regulatory subunit (one of the three Rts1, Rts3, or Cdc55). With PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup>, we refer to a complex consisting of Pph21 or Pph22, Tpd3, and Cdc55. The mechanistic basis for separase-dependent PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> down-regulation at anaphase onset is not known. Recently Zds1 and Zds2, two sequence paralogues in budding yeast, have been identified as putative interactors of Cdc55 by large-scale affinity purification analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gavin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krogan et al., 2006</xref>). Zds1 and Zds2 (zillion different screens) have also been isolated in numerous genetic screens, relating to regulators of the Cdc42 GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi and Pringle, 1996</xref>), the RNA polymerase II mediator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 1996</xref>), sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heo et al., 1999</xref>), chromatin silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roy and Runge, 2000</xref>), cell wall integrity signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Griffioen et al., 2003</xref>), cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zanelli and Valentini, 2005</xref>), and other cellular processes. Contributions of Zds1 and Zds2 to cell cycle progression have been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi and Pringle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mizunuma et al., 1998</xref>). Both Zds1 and separase have been found to act as high copy suppressors of the <italic>cdc28-1N</italic> mutation, suggesting a possible functional link between the two proteins, although the mechanism by which either Zds1 or separase act in <italic>cdc28-1N</italic> suppression has not yet been elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones et al., 2000</xref>). The molecular function of Zds1 and Zds2 thus remains poorly understood. No sequence motifs have been detected in their primary amino acid sequence that could yield hints as to their activity. Orthologues of Zds1 and Zds2 can be found in most ascomycetes, with the strongest similarity between them confined to a C-terminal &#x0201c;Zds1 C&#x0201d; motif.</p><p>Here, we confirm a physical interaction of Zds1 and Zds2 with PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup>, and show that Zds1 and Zds2 are required for timely nucleolar release of Cdc14 in early anaphase. Separase-induced Cdc14 activation requires Zds1 and Zds2, and ectopic Zds1 expression in metaphase down-regulates PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> and releases Cdc14 in a Net1 phosphorylation-dependent reaction. This implies that Zds1 and Zds2 act downstream of separase to initiate Cdc14 activation at anaphase onset, and suggests that Zds1 and Zds2 may exert their biological function as PP2A regulators.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Zds1 and Zds2 interact with PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup></title><p>We have previously shown that separase activation at anaphase onset causes down-regulation of the PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> phosphatase to facilitate Net1 phosphorylation and Cdc14 release. Separase and PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> physically interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Queralt et al., 2006</xref>). However, PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> is present in cells in stoichiometric excess over separase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>), making a mechanism of direct PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> inhibition by separase binding unlikely. This suggests that additional factors are involved downstream of separase in PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> regulation. High throughput affinity purification of budding yeast protein complexes has detected interactions between the subunits of the PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> complex and both Zds1 and Zds2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gavin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krogan et al., 2006</xref>). This prompted us to confirm a possible interaction between Zds1, Zds2, and PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup>, and ask whether the interaction occurs in a cell cycle&#x02013;regulated manner. We arrested cells in metaphase by depletion of the APC coactivator Cdc20 under the control of the galactose-inducible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter, and released them into synchronous anaphase progression by reintroduction of Cdc20. In immunoprecipitates of Zds1 from metaphase-arrested cells, we detected Cdc55 as well as the PP2A scaffold subunit, Tpd3 by Western blotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This suggests that Zds1 and PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> interact at this stage in the cell cycle. We were unable to analyze coprecipitation of the catalytic subunit Pph21/Pph22, as epitope tags at either terminus of these proteins interfere with PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> function (unpublished data). Tpd3 is the limiting subunit for PP2A holocomplex assembly, and Cdc55 is thought to associate with a preassembled Tpd3-Pph21/Pph22 dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hombauer et al., 2007</xref>). It is therefore likely that also Pph21 or Pph22 subunits are present in the Zds1-PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> complex.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Zds1 and Zds2 interact with PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup>.</bold> Cell extracts were prepared from strains Y2541 (<italic>MAT</italic>a <italic>GAL-CDC20 HA<sub>3</sub>-CDC55</italic>), Y3131 (as Y2541, but also <italic>ZDS1-Pk<sub>9</sub></italic>), and Y3200 (as Y2541, but also <italic>ZDS2-Pk<sub>9</sub></italic>), which were synchronized at the metaphase to anaphase transition, and coimmunoprecipitation of subunits of the PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> complex with Zds1 and Zds2 was analyzed by Western blotting.

This indicates that the interaction between Zds1 and PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> is constitutive throughout progression through mitosis and mitotic exit. We also analyzed the interaction between Zds2 and PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> in similar immunoprecipitation experiments. Zds1 and Zds2 share 37.5% sequence identity, concentrated in 6 regions of homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi and Pringle, 1996</xref>). The two paralogues show largely similar, but not identical, behavior in the reported genetic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roy and Runge, 2000</xref>). Again, coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated interaction of Zds2 with Cdc55 and Tpd3 in metaphase as well as during synchronous progression through anaphase and mitotic exit (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This suggests that both Zds1 and Zds2 interact with PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> throughout mitosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Zds1 and Zds2 are required for Cdc14 nucleolar release in early anaphase</title><p>The interaction with Zds1 and Zds2 in mitosis opened the possibility that these proteins are involved in down-regulation of PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> phosphatase activity and nucleolar release of Cdc14. To test this possibility, we constructed single and double deletion mutants of the <italic>ZDS1</italic> and <italic>ZDS2</italic> genes and analyzed cell cycle progression and Cdc14 release after synchronous release of these strain from &#x003b1;-factor block in G1. For comparison, we included a <italic>spo12&#x00394;</italic> strain, in which Cdc14 nucleolar release is delayed due to the Spo12 requirement for Cdc14 early anaphase release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stegmeier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). <italic>zds2&#x00394;</italic> cells showed kinetics of cell cycle progression, and Cdc14 release at the time of anaphase onset, indistinguishable from the wild-type control. In contrast, in <italic>zds1&#x00394;</italic> cells, Cdc14 release from the nucleolus was retarded by 10 min relative to the onset of spindle elongation, similar to the delay observed in <italic>spo12&#x00394;</italic> cells. In <italic>zds1&#x00394; zds2&#x00394;</italic> double-mutant cells, Cdc14 release was also delayed relative to anaphase onset. The difference in timing was more difficult to establish, as <italic>zds1&#x00394; zds2&#x00394;</italic> cells entered anaphase with a delay, and less synchronously, compared with the control.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Delayed Cdc14 nucleolar release in the absence of Zds1 and Zds2.</bold> (A) Analysis of mitotic progression in the absence of Zds1 and Zds2.

FACS analysis of DNA content was used to monitor cell cycle progression. Cdc14 nucleolar release and anaphase spindle elongation was analyzed by in situ immunofluorescence. At least 100 cells were scored at each time point. Photographs are shown of cells in early anaphase with a spindle length of 3&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;m. Bar, 5 &#x003bc;m.

Thus, both Zds1 and Zds2 participate in timely Cdc14 activation in early anaphase.

We therefore also asked whether ectopic expression of Zds1 or Zds2 is sufficient to activate Cdc14. We arrested cells in metaphase by depletion of Cdc20, and induced ectopic Zds1 or Zds2 expression under control of the galactose-inducible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Both Zds1 and Zds2 induction led to Cdc14 nucleolar release. Even though similar expression constructs were used for both paralogues, Zds1 accumulated more rapidly and to higher levels after induction. We do not know the reason for this difference. Correlating with its faster accumulation, Cdc14 release occurred earlier after induction of Zds1 expression, compared with Zds2 expression. At later time points, Cdc14 was efficiently released also in cells expressing Zds2. Cells expressing Zds1 or Zds2 remained arrested in mitosis despite the activation of Cdc14. This can be explained by the observation that Cdc14 activation is not sufficient to promote mitotic exit if not Cdk activity is down-regulated at the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Queralt et al., 2006</xref>). We conclude that ectopic expression of either Zds1 or Zds2 in metaphase-arrested cells is sufficient to cause nucleolar release of Cdc14. Because of its greater efficiency in this setting, we will use expression of Zds1 in most of the following experiments.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Zds1 promotes Cdc14 nucleolar release by Net1 phosphorylation.</bold> (A) Ectopic expression of Zds1 and Zds2 promote Cdc14 nucleolar release.

At the time of Zds1 accumulation, slower migrating forms of Net1 became detectable by Western blotting, indicative of phosphorylation. To test whether indeed Net1 phosphorylation was responsible for Cdc14 release, we repeated the experiment in a strain carrying the <italic>net1-6Cdk</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azzam et al., 2004</xref>). In this strain, 6 Cdk consensus recognition sites within the regulatory Net1 N terminus have been made nonphosphorylatable by site-directed mutagenesis.

The increasing Cdk activity at this time phosphorylates Net1 without being counteracted by PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> activity, and thus without having to await PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> down-regulation at anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Queralt et al., 2006</xref>).

Molecular size analysis of separase in protein extracts from both budding and fission yeast has shown separase to exist as part of large protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Funabiki et al., 1996</xref>; and unpublished data). These results suggest that PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup>, Zds1, and likely also Zds2, form part of these complexes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Mitotic exit encompasses an ordered series of events, leading from chromosome segregation during anaphase to completion of cell division by cytokinesis. The budding yeast Cdc14 phosphatase is a key regulator of these events. Cdc14 is kept inactive in the nucleolus for much of the cell cycle, but is released from there during mitotic exit to contribute to Cdk down-regulation and dephosphorylation of numerous Cdk substrates. Initial models for Cdc14 activation in anaphase suggested that anaphase spindle elongation brings the spindle pole&#x02013;bound MEN GTPase Tem1 in contact with its activator Lte1 at the bud cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>). In this way Cdc14 would be activated, and mitotic exit events initiated, once anaphase is complete. Meanwhile, it has become clear that Cdc14 is already activated at the onset of anaphase, and that release of separase from its inhibitor securin plays a crucial role in Cdc14 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stegmeier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Queralt et al., 2006</xref>). The early activated Cdc14 makes crucial contributions to successful anaphase progression. It leads to relocation of Fin1 and the aurora B kinase complex to the spindle midzone, stabilizes the dynamic behavior of mitotic spindle microtubules, and is required for condensation and resolution of the late-segregating rDNA locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pereira and Schiebel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">D'Amours et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sullivan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Higuchi and Uhlmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Woodbury and Morgan, 2007</xref>). It thus appears that the &#x0201c;mitotic exit&#x0201d; machinery orchestrates both, progression through faithful anaphase, then followed by mitotic exit and cytokinesis. How the ordering of anaphase and subsequent mitotic exit events is achieved by a common set of regulators remains an important open question.</p><p>In this study, we address the question of how separase causes Cdc14 activation at anaphase onset. We have previously shown that separase-dependent PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> down-regulation at anaphase onset allows Cdk-dependent phosphorylation of the nucleolar Cdc14 inhibitor Net1, thus promoting Cdc14 release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Queralt et al., 2006</xref>). The mechanistic basis for separase-dependent PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> down-regulation remained to be elucidated. Separase and PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> interact, and this interaction might be enhanced, or it may change its quality, as securin is degraded at anaphase onset. A model by which separase binding to PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> directly inhibits its phosphatase activity nevertheless appears unlikely, as PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> is present in a large stoichiometric excess over separase. Separase would thus only be able to regulate a small fraction of PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> directly, while overall PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> activity is reduced by approximately half during anaphase. This suggests that a catalytic step must be involved downstream of separase, and therefore that additional factors are likely required to convey separase-dependent down-regulation of the phosphatase. The observation of a direct interaction of Zds1 and Zds2 with PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> prompted us to analyze the contribution of these two proteins to mitotic exit regulation.</p><p>Our analysis revealed that Zds1 and Zds2 are required for timely Cdc14 activation during anaphase. Ectopic Zds1 expression in turn is sufficient to trigger PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> down-regulation, Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation, and Cdc14 nucleolar release. Furthermore, we found that Zds1 physically interacts with separase. These observations open the possibility that separase acts through Zds1 and Zds2 to cause PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> down-regulation at anaphase onset. This notion is further supported by the similarity in requirements for Cdc14 activation by ectopic expression of either separase or Zds1. In both cases, Cdc14 nucleolar release depends on Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation. Consistent with this requirement, ectopic expression of Zds1, like that of separase, leads to Cdc14 activation in mitotic cells, but not cells arrested in G1 or S phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003</xref>; and unpublished data). The mechanism by which Zds1 and Zds2 impinge on PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> activity, and how this mechanism is in turn controlled by separase, remain important questions for future studies. It is noteworthy that, like separase, Zds1 and Zds2 are relatively low abundant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, it does not appear likely that Zds1 and Zds2 act as direct inhibitory components of the PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> complex. Instead, they might be involved in regulating the status of posttranslational modifications or in controlling conformational changes in the PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> holoenzyme that impinge on its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hombauer et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Zds1 and Zds2 have been found as high copy modulators of a large variety of cellular processes. These include cell cycle regulation, cell polarity establishment, and chromatin silencing, among others. These processes are known, or are conceivable, to be influenced by PP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Evans and Stark, 1997</xref>). The pleiotropic effect of Zds1 and Zds2 on cell physiology may therefore stem from the multitude of processes that are influenced by PP2A. If this possibility holds true, Zds1 and Zds2 might emerge as PP2A regulators not only during mitotic exit, but in a variety of cellular settings. Recently, fission yeast zds1 has been identified and characterised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yakura et al., 2006</xref>). Like its budding yeast orthologue, it has been found to contribute to a variety of cellular processes, including sexual differentiation, cell wall integrity, and cell morphology. This spectrum of activities again overlaps with the physiological roles described for PP2A in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kinoshita et al., 1996</xref>). It will now be of interest to elucidate the mechanism by which separase, together with Zds1 and Zds2, regulate PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> activity to promote progression through anaphase and out of mitosis. This may serve as a paradigm for PP2A regulation by Zds1 and Zds2 also in other contexts. Finally, a contribution of mammalian separase to Cdk down-regulation and progression through meiotic cell division has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gorr et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kudo et al., 2006</xref>). Although some of the downstream effectors in mammalian cells may differ from those in budding yeast, an understanding of the nonproteolytic function of separase during mitotic exit in the yeast model may yield insight that will also help to elucidate the function of human separase in cell cycle progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains, plasmids, and cell cycle synchronization procedures</title><p>All strains were derivatives of W303.

YIplac204-GAL1-ZDS2 was created by inserting <italic>GAL1-3Flag</italic> into YIplac204, and adding a fragment containing the <italic>ZDS2</italic> open reading frame originating from plasmid M2655 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 1996</xref>). For N-terminal tagging of endogenous <italic>CDC55</italic>, 500 base pairs of the <italic>CDC55</italic> promoter, and in a second reaction the first 178 base pairs of the <italic>CDC55</italic> open reading frame, were amplified by PCR using genomic DNA as the template. The fragments were introduced into plasmid pRS306 and three tandem HA epitopes inserted between promoter and open reading frame. The plasmid was integrated at the <italic>CDC55</italic> locus after linearization with Msc I. Ectopic expression of separase in cells arrested in metaphase by Cdc20 depletion was as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>). Ectopic expression of Zds1 and Zds2 followed the same protocol. Cell synchronization using &#x003b1;-factor, and metaphase arrest by Cdc20 depletion and release into synchronous anaphase by Cdc20 reinduction, were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uhlmann et al., 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation and PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> phosphatase assay</title><p>Protein extracts were prepared after spheroplast lysis as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uhlmann et al., 1999</xref>). For immunoprecipitation, the clarified extracts were precleared with protein A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), incubated with antibody, and immunocomplexes adsorbed to magnetic protein A dynabeads (Invitrogen). Beads were washed in extraction buffer and boiled with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. For the phosphatase assays, <sup>32</sup>P-phosphorylated histone H1 and Net1(1&#x02013;600) were prepared as substrates as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Queralt et al., 2006</xref>). PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> was immunopurified from cell extracts via N-terminally HA epitope-tagged Cdc55 as above, and the dynabeads were washed with phosphatase buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mg/ml BSA [Sigma-Aldrich], and 0.1% &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol). Reaction mix (1 &#x003bc;g <sup>32</sup>P-phospho-histone H1, or 0.5 &#x003bc;g <sup>32</sup>P-phospho-Net1[1&#x02013;600], in 50 &#x003bc;l phosphatase buffer) was added to the beads, followed by incubation at 30&#x000b0;C for 20 min. Reactions were terminated on ice, protein was precipitated with 16% trichloroacetic acid, and acid-soluble <sup>32</sup>P-phosphate was quantified in a scintillation counter. Cdc55 recovered on the beads was quantified by Western blotting using an IRdye 800 coupled secondary antibody and the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).</p></sec><sec><title>Other techniques</title><p>Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were &#x003b1;-Pk clone SV5-Pk1 (AbD Serotec), &#x003b1;-HA clone 12CA5 (Roche), &#x003b1;-myc clone 9E10, &#x003b1;-FLAG clone M2 (Sigma-Aldrich), &#x003b1;-Tpd3 (a gift from E.

Antibodies used for indirect immunofluorescence were &#x003b1;-Pk clone SV5-Pk1 and anti-&#x003b1;-tubulin clone YOL1/34. Secondary antibodies were Cy3 labeled goat &#x003b1;-mouse antibody (GE Healthcare) to visualize Pk-epitope tagged Cdc14, and affinity-purified fluorescein-conjugated donkey &#x003b1;-rat antibody (Millipore) to visualize tubulin. Stained cells were mounted in Fluoroguard (Bio-Rad Laboratories), containing 0.1 &#x003bc;g/ml DAPI. Cells were imaged at room temperature using an Axioplan 2 imaging microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) equipped with a 100x (NA 1.45) Plan-Neofluar objective and an ORCA-ER camera (Hamamatsu Photonics). Anaphase spindle length measurements were conducted with the quantitative analysis tools of the Volocity software (Improvision), which was used for image acquisition. Brightness and contrast of the images were adjusted using Photoshop (Adobe).</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows that Zds1-induced Cdc14 release depends on Cdk activity.
