To address the potential role of miRNA in epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, we identified miR-125a-5p as a downstream target, using an miRNA array. We further demonstrated that miR-125a-5p inhibited migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Moreover, miR-125a-5p regulated the expression of several downstream genes of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. Importantly, examination of lung cancer samples revealed a significant correlation of miR-125a-5p repression with lung carcinogenesis. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence that miR-125a-5p, an epidermal growth factor-signaling-regulated miRNA, may function as a metastatic suppressor.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>epidermal growth factor receptor</kwd><kwd>lung neoplasm</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>miR-125a</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer death in the USA, with a mortality of approximately 85% for all stages, according to population statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, it is the most common cancer both in incidence rate and in death rate in developing countries such as China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>]. Clinical data have shown that most lung cancer patients eventually suffer relapse and/or metastasis after complete excision of the cancer, even if they were at stage IA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>]. Despite the progress that has been made in recent decades, the mechanism of lung cancer development, including relapse and metastasis, is not fully understood.</p><p>Growth factor signal transduction pathways play key roles in various physiological and pathological processes, encompassing metabolism, growth, proliferation, stress, development, and apoptosis. Abnormalities in these signaling pathways lead to various developmental disorders and diseases. In severe cases, aberrant growth factor signaling may even give rise to tumors. Among these pathways, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling appears to be particularly important for epithelial malignancies, including lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]. However, despite the clinical importance, the underlying molecular mechanism by which EGFR signaling regulates lung cancer development remains poorly understood.</p><p>Recent studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are extensively involved in various signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>]. MicroRNAs are a class of small, noncoding RNAs that play important roles in different biological processes. Interestingly, since Calin <italic>et al.</italic> first reported that miR-15 and miR-16 are deleted or downregulated in the majority (approximately 68%) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>], accumulating evidence has implicated miRNA in human cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>]. Additionally, altered expression of miRNA has been shown to mediate tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>]. However, the relationship between miRNA and EGFR signaling remains largely elusive.</p><p>Here, we set out to characterize the regulation of miRNA expression by EGFR activation, using microarray analysis. We further determined that miR-125a-5p could negatively regulate lung cancer cell migration and invasion <italic>in vitro</italic>, and that this was frequently decreased in lung cancer patients. Our data strongly implicate miR-125a-5p as a potential inhibitor of tumor metastasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Repression of miR-125a-5p in response to EGFR activation in lung cancer cells</title><p>It has been well established that EGFR signaling plays a crucial role in lung tumorigenesis. Interestingly, accumulating evidence has now implicated miRNA in the formation and malignant progression of human cancer. To examine the potential relationship between EGFR signaling and miRNA, we first performed miRNA expression profiling after epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation using the miRHuman_10.0_070802 miRNA array, which contains 711 probes. Through comparison of RNA prepared from a combination of three lung cells, A549, PC9, and H1299, before or after EGF stimulation, our profiling analysis revealed 39 miRNAs with significantly different expression levels (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). To further determine the requirement for EGFR signaling in the expression of miRNA listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, we blocked EGFR signaling with gefitinib. Gefitinib is an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase that competes with ATP for binding to the intracellular kinase domain, preventing receptor activation and the engagement of downstream signaling transducers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]. Thus, it has been widely used to interfere with EGFR signaling. Consistent with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>], PC9 cells, which express a mutant EGFR and have been extensively explored before, were more sensitive to gefitinib. Thus, a low concentration of gefitinib could abolish the phosphorylation of EGFR, extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)1/2 and Akt after EGF stimulation. However, H1299 and A549 cells expressed wild-type EGFR, and were less sensitive to gefitinib. Only a high concentration of gefitinib could decrease the phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK1/2, and Akt after EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). Accordingly, our miRNA array analysis showed that, among the 39 miRNAs listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, five miRNAs, inducing let-7i, miR-24, miR-25, miR-29b, and miR-125a-5p, could be reversed by gefitinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>MicroRNA array analysis

After culture, angiogenesis was assessed with tube formation assays. Consistent with its potential tumor-suppressing role, we found that knockdown of miR-125a-5p significantly enhanced the tube formation efficiency of ECV304 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B,C</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based cell cycle profiling and apoptosis analysis. However, miR-125a-5p antisense did not influence apoptosis or the cell cycle of PC9 cells (data not shown). Taken together, our results demonstrated that miR-125a-5p played an inhibitory role in lung cancer metastasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Decreased miR-125a-5p expression in a subset of human lung cancers</title><p>To gain further insights into the role of miR-125a-5p in lung carcinogenesis and to examine the clinical relevance of our findings, we investigated the expression of miR-125a-5p in a panel of lung cancer patient samples together with paired counterpart normal tissues. With the criterion of a 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup> value change of no less than 2 between the malignant and normal groups, we found that 33.33% (5/15) of lung cancer samples showed significantly decreased expression of miR-125a-5p by real-time RT-PCR. Thus, our results suggested that downregulation of miR-125a-5p might contribute, at least partially, to lung cancer development in human patients.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The EGFR signal transduction pathway regulates essential cellular functions, and appears to play a central role in the etiology and progression of numerous epithelial malignancies, including lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]. Moreover, the function of EGFR mutations in survival of lung cancer patients and clinical respones to gefitinib has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. Thus, the identification and characterization of potential factors that regulate EGFR pathways are critical to our understanding of lung cancer development and progression.</p><p>Emerging evidence has revealed the profound role of various miRNAs in regulating cancer development. Different miRNAs have been implicated in the formation of neoplasms, malignant progression, and metastasis. To examine the potential miRNA targets of EGFR signaling, we used the miRHuman_10.0_070802 miRNA array, and identified miR-125a-5p as being regulated by EGFR activation. To examine the cellular function of miR-125a-5p, we employed comprehensive <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches to establish the inhibitory role of miR-125a-5p in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, cell motility, and invasion. It is also of great interest and importance to note that about one-third of the human lung cancer samples that we examined revealed significant downregulation of miR-125a-5p expression. Consistent with our findings, miR-125a-5p has also been reported to be downregulated in breast cancer biopsy specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>]. Further investigations will be performed to determine whether miR-125a-5p expression is clinically correlated with lung cancer metastasis. Interestingly, the present results, which showed miR-125a-5p negatively regulating cancer cell metastasis, are consistent with our previous work, which suggested that miR-125a-5p is negatively correlated with lung cancer metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>]. Together, the findings presented here strongly suggest that miR-125a-5p may function as a tumor suppressor.</p><p>Except for let-7i, miR-24, miR-25, miR-29b, and miR-125a-5p, our miRNA array analysis also indicated another 42 miRNAs with significant differences by comparing miRNA expression before and after gefitinib treatment (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Interestingly, among them, some miRNAs, such as miR-16, miR-143, miR-200b, and miR-205, were shown to be involved in human cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>].</p><p>In view of our findings here and the results of Scott <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>], showing that miR-125a blocked ERK1/2 and Akt signaling in breast cancer cells, we will determine whether miR-125a-5p regulates the phosphorylation of Akt and/or ERK1/2 in lung cancer cells, and whether miR-125a-5p downregulates ErbB2 and ErbB3 in lung cancer cells, because the present work only focused on the functional analysis of miR-125-a-5p.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified miR-125a-5p, an EGFR-regulated miRNA, as a potential tumor metastasis suppressor. Our results further substantiated the role of miRNA in tumorigenesis, and revealed the possibility of using miRNAs as potential therapeutic targets to specifically suppress oncogenic signaling pathways that go awry in human cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Cells and cultures</title><p>The human lung cancer cell line A549 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and maintained in Ham&#x02019;s F12K medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology and Services Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China).
