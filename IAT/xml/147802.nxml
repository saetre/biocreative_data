RAP-PCR fingerprints were converted to probes for human cDNA clones arrayed as Escherichia coli colonies on nylon membranes. Each array contained 18 432 cDNA clones from the IMAGE consortium. Hybridization to approximately 1000 cDNA clones was detected using each RAP-PCR probe. Different RAP-PCR fingerprints gave hybridization patterns having very little overlap (&#x0003c;3%) with each other or with hybridization patterns from total cDNA probes. Consequently, repeated application of RAP-PCR probes allows a greater fraction of the message population to be screened on this type of array than can be achieved with a radiolabeled total cDNA probe. This method was applied to RNA from HaCaT keratinocytes treated with epidermal growth factor. Two RAP-PCR probes detected hybridization to 2000 clones, from which 22 candidate differentially expressed genes were observed. Differential expression was tested for 15 of these clones using RT-PCR and 13 were confirmed. The use of this cDNA array to analyze RAP-PCR fingerprints allowed for an increase in detection of 10-20-fold over the conventional denaturing polyacrylamide gel approach to RAP-PCR or differential display. Throughput is vastly improved by the reduction in cloning and sequencing afforded by the use of arrays. Also, repeated cloning and sequencing of the same gene or of genes already known to be regulated in the system of interest is minimized. The procedure we describe uses inexpensive arrays of plasmid clones spotted as E.coli colonies to detect differential expression, but these reduced complexity probes should also prove useful on arrays of PCR-amplified fragments and on oligonucleotide chips.
