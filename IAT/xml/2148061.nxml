In addition, there are changes in the expression of most p63 targets. Inactivation of C/EBP&#x003b4; leads to gene expression modifications, in part due to the concomitant repression of &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1;.

This class of proteins activate and repress genes as a result of binding to promoters and enhancer regions. Six isoforms can be found as a result of different transcription initiation sites and alternative splicing. p63 proteins contain -TA- or lack -&#x00394;N- a transcriptional activation domain at the N-terminal, and the sterile alpha motif -SAM- domain, presumably a protein-protein interaction module. The resulting proteins have dissimilar transcriptional properties and, as a result, different biological behaviour. The paramount importance of p63 in development has been broadly illustrated by genetic experiments in different organisms. Mice lacking p63 die soon after birth with severe defects in limb, craniofacial and skin development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The major isoform present in keratinocytes and other epithelia -&#x00394;Np63&#x003b1;- is essential for ectodermal development in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In humans, several syndromes showing abnormalities in limbs, skin and annexes are caused by mutations in the p63 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In general, therefore, p63 is essential for the biology of multilayered epithelia.</p><p>Several TFs have an established role in keratinocytes programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], but few of them have so far been linked to p63 regulation. This topic is quite relevant since renewal of stem cells and ongoing active terminal differentiation most likely requires the progressive fine tuning of transctriptional programs, unlikely to be masterminded by a single TF.</p><p>C/EBPs are a family of six B-Zip TFs that activate and repress transcription under different differentiation and growth arrest conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; are required for differentiation of adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Inactivation of C/EBP&#x003b5; in KO mice leads to lack of natural killer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. C/EBP&#x003b4; KO has a mammary phenotype, with an alteration in the involution of the mammary glands upon lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Adipocyte differentiation is also impaired in cells that lack C/EBP&#x003b4; when cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>, similarly to C/EBP&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>By inactivating p63 in HaCat and primary cells, it was possible to investigate the roles of p63 in keratinocytes, notably the importance for differentiation and cell adhesion programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. At the same time, however, p63 plays a major role in maintaining the proliferative potential of stem cells of the multilayered epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Through the use of RNAi inactivation coupled to gene expression profiling, as well as ChIP on chip experiments, several labs have recently identified hundreds of p63 targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Specifically, C/EBP&#x003b4; emerged in the RNAi profiling of human HaCaT cells and primary keratinocytes as a target of p63 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This prompted us to validate it and characterize the p63-C/EBP&#x003b4; connections by RT-PCR, ChIPs and immunofluorescence in human keratinocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Validation of C/EBP&#x003b4; as a target of p63</title><p>We performed RNAi inactivation of p63 in human HaCaT cells followed by gene expression profiling with the Affymetrix platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]; one of the genes that was specifically increased under these conditions was C/EBP&#x003b4;. This gene was similarly found to be affected in primary keratinocytes in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We confirmed this data by performing RT-PCR to examine the mRNA levels of C/EBP&#x003b4;, as well as two other members of the family. Upon p63 inactivation, a strong increase was specifically obeserved for C/EBP&#x003b4;, but not for C/EBP&#x003b1;, while C/EBP&#x003b2; showed a modest increase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). &#x003b2;-actin, an invariant mRNA, was used to normalize samples. &#x00394;Np63 was decreased, as expected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The pattern was also seen after RNAi inactivation of p63 in primary human keratinocytes (KCs, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, Lower Panel). In this setting, we also checked the protein levels of C/EBP&#x003b4; by immunofluorescence: Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> shows that under normal growth conditions, KCs are weakly but uniformly stained with anti-p63 and anti-C/EBP&#x003b4; antibodies; removal of p63 by RNAi transfections (Central Panels) lead to a substantial increase in the C/EBP&#x003b4; staining (Left and Merge Panels). To ascertain whether C/EBP&#x003b4; repression is a primary event, we perfomed ChIP assays, using multiple anti-p63 and control (anti-Flag and anti-NF-Y) antibodies. The anti-p63 antibody we produced and purified recognize all isoforms of p63 [See Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] for details]. Scanning the human C/EBP&#x003b4; upstream region, we identified a cluster of potential p53/p63 binding sites around 1 Kb upstream from the transcriptional start site. These sites are in a cluster that is conserved with the mouse sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, Lower Panel). ChIP analysis with HaCaT and primary KC chromatin showed strong positivity with the two p63 antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Because HaCaT cells contain two p53 alleles mutated in the DNA-binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], hence generating proteins presumably incapable of DNA-binding, only in primary cells did we include an antibody against p53: p53 was as positive as p63, an indication that both proteins are bound to the C/EBP&#x003b4; promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). As a control, we amplified a region of the human &#x003b1;-globin gene, which was devoid of any binding with any of the binding analyzed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, Upper Panel). We conclude that C/EBP&#x003b4; is under direct regulation of p63 in human keratinocytes.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Validation of C/EBP&#x003b4; as a target of p63</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

As a first step to shed light on this, we wished to know whether it is regulated during differentiation models of human keratinocytes. HaCaT cells can be differentiated upon withdrawal of serum and calcium addition: the cells stop growing, alter their morphology, and express several markers of suprabasal keratinocytes. We checked the levels of C/EBPs by RT-PCR analysis at two times following the differentiation stimulus: early -3 hours- and late, 3 days. The results are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, Upper Panels: the Keratin 1 -cK1- marker was increased, a very modest increase of C/EBP&#x003b4;, and no change of C/EBP&#x003b2; or C/EBP&#x003b1; was scored; the invariant histone-like NF-YB was used as an internal control. An increase in C/EBP&#x003b4; protein level was seen in Western blots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, Lower Panels) p63 was checked and showed a concomitant reduction. Protein levels were normalized with NF-YB and laminB. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that C/EBP&#x003b4; is increased after differentiation, in contrast to C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). cK1 was used to monitor differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Similar experiments with KCs showed a greater increase of C/EBP&#x003b4; at the mRNA level in RT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) and at the protein level in immunofluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). mRNA levels of cK14 decreased after differentiation, as expected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). We conclude from these data that C/EBP&#x003b4; is subject to regulation during differentiation of HaCat cells and primary human keratinocytes, suggesting that it might play a role in the process.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Regulation of C/EBP&#x003b4; in HaCaT and primary keratinocytes</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

To verify whether this is the case, we evaluated human skin sections of healthy individuals by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, double staining with p63 and C/EBP&#x003b4; antibodies. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows representative immunofluorescence images from two sections. Consistent with previous reports, p63 is strictly confined to nuclei of epidermis and abundant in the basal layer, with expression progressively fading in spinous cells and absent in the granular and corneum strata. C/EBP&#x003b4; staining is absent in the derma and confined to keratinocytes: it is nuclear and maximal in the granular layer and overlappping with p63 in the spinous layer (Yellow staining in the Merge Panel). Interestingly, C/EBP&#x003b4; also shows co-staining in some, but not all, cells of the basal compartment of interfollicular skin (Indicated by arrows in the Merge Panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Parallel staining with secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were essentially negative, ensuring that the signals observed above are specific. In conclusion, C/EBP&#x003b4; is keratinocyte-restricted and clearly regulated in human skin, reinforcing the idea that it is involved in regulating genes during differentiation of keratinocytes. Furthermore, the expression patterns suggest that p63 and C/EBP&#x003b4; may influence their reciprocal levels by transcriptionally regulating each other.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Regulation of C/EBP&#x003b4; in human skin</bold>.

Analysis was performed by Immunofluorescence Confocal microscopy. Arrows in the merge Panel indicate nuclear staining of cells that are positive for both antibodies, in the basal layer. Yellow signals in the spinous layer refer to cells co-expressing the two factors. B, basal layer; S, spinous layer; G, granulous layer; C, corneum stratum.

RT-PCR analysis of p63 isoforms is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> (Left Panels). &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1;, the only detectable isoform in mock transfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], increases at 24 hours; surprisingly, &#x00394;Np63&#x003b2; and &#x00394;Np63&#x003b3; were strongly induced at the same time point. None of the TA isoforms were initially detectable, but they became apparent after 48 hours. In parallel, we inactivated C/EBP&#x003b4; by siRNA interference in the same cellular setting, using three different oligonucleotides: Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> (Right Panels) shows that using two of these siRNAs the endogenous C/EBP&#x003b4; drops to low levels in RT-PCR analysis; oligo 2 was then used for further analysis of the p63 isoforms upon C/EBP&#x003b4; removal. &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; indeed decreased dramatically, while none of the other isoforms was expressed, confirming the role of C/EBP&#x003b4; in &#x00394;N regulation. These data indicate that the &#x00394;N -and TA- p63 promoters are potentially under control of C/EBP&#x003b4; in keratinocytes.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>C/EBP&#x003b4; is bound to and regulates the &#x00394;Np63 promoter</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

ChIP analysis of the upstream regions of &#x00394;Np63 with the indicated antibodies, using chromatin from primary KCs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-8-85-4"/></fig><p>To test this, we searched for C/EBP sites by using different algorithms in the human &#x00394;Np63 promoter, and found a consensus of two juxtaposed boxes at -2400, in a region that shows considerable homology in the mouse gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). This led us to verify the activation of the &#x00394;Np63 promoter using Luciferase constructs of different lengths, from -3000 to -200 relative to the transcriptional Start Site. As the promoter is known to be dependent from NF-Y, a ubiquitous activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we included it in our cotransfections assays as a positive control. These experiments were performed in U2OS, which provide a background that is free of the possible dominant self-regulating activity of p63 on its own promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We found that NF-Y and C/EBP&#x003b4; singularly activated the -3000 contruct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Remarkably, addition of the two TFs together yielded a clear cooperative effect. However, shorter constructs (-1300, -400 and -200) did not show any significant increase upon C/EBP&#x003b4; overexpression, while still retaining some NF-Y inducibility, most likely due to core promoter CCAAT boxes detailed in Refs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The decrease in NF-Y inducibility with respect of the -3000 construct is probably due to a functional CCAAT box binding NF-Y in this region (See ChIP below). The simplest explanation for these results is that the -2400 C/EBP sites are vital for induction. To confirm that the activation observed is a primary phenomenon, we performed scanning ChIPs analysis on different regions of the C/EBP&#x003b4; promoter in human KCs; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> shows that C/EBP&#x003b4; and NF-Y are found in the upstream region, in at least three different positions. Note that predicted and actual sites do not always ovelap (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that (i) C/EBP&#x003b4; binds and activates the &#x00394;Np63 promoter in keratinocytes, (ii) point at the -2400 binding sites as important for regulation, (iii) confirm that NF-Y is a <italic>bona fide </italic>activator of the &#x00394;Np63 promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Consequences of C/EBP&#x003b4; overexpression/inactivation on expression of p63 targets</title><p>The finding that C/EBP&#x003b4; regulates p63 prompted us to ascertain whether it would affect the expression of some of p63 targets recently identified, in overexpression and RNAi inactivation experiments in human primary keratinocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We also analyzed by RT-PCR markers of differentiation, such as cK1 and cK14, and Desmocollin (DSC) 1 and 3, important for keratinocyte biology and presumptive C/EBP&#x003b4; targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. C/EBP&#x003b4; overexpression lead to variations in all genes tested, with the exception of cK14. PCNA, a marker of cell proliferation and itself a p63 target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] decreased modestly after 48 hours, suggesting a slowdown, but not a stop in proliferation. DSC1, but not DSC3, was activated by C/EBP&#x003b4; overexpression. Essentially all p63 targets identified in our recent screenings varied in expression, some decreasing, others increasing. Interestingly, some of these genes showed a response at 24 hours, others -EGF-R, c-Jun, E- and T-cadherin- a delayed one.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression and functional inactivation of C/EBP&#x003b4; in primary KCs</bold>.

In most cases, there is a perfect match with overexpression: genes that are activated, 24 or 48 hours after C/EBP&#x003b4; transfections are down-regulated by RNAi, consistent with a positive role of C/EBP&#x003b4; in their regulation. The exception is ESR, whose undetectable levels could not be further decreased by C/EBP&#x003b4; inactivation. The genes that are repressed in overexpression are increased by RNAi, except EGF-R and Desmocollin 3, in which a dominant role of p63 can be envisaged. In summary, the C/EBP&#x003b4; RNAi and overexpression experiments are consistent with this TF being important for the expression of many p63 targets.</p></sec><sec><title>p63 targets are bound by C/EBP&#x003b4; <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To verify whether the effect of C/EBP&#x003b4; on expression of the p63 targets analyzed above is a primary event, we performed ChIP analysis with an anti-C/EBP&#x003b4; antibody in primary KCs and in HaCaT cells. The regions analyzed were the same that showed p63 binding [Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>]. Essentially all targets are bound by C/EBP&#x003b4;, both in HaCaT and in primary KCs, the only exception being Zeb1. Except c-Jun and ETAR, these regions contain one or more C/EBP consensus sequences, as defined by analyzing the common sites derived by the use of the CONSITE, rVISTA and CUSTOM algorithms used in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; some are in core promoters, others in upstream locations. The pattern of p63 is somewhat similar, with one target -ETAR- absent in primary KCs. NF-Y sites are found in expected locations, except for E-cadherin, which was shown to be a positive promoter for NF-Y. Note that NF-Y binding on C/EBP&#x003b4; in primary keratinocytes differs in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> (not present) and 6 (present). Individual variations might account for these discrepancies, as we have also noticed differences in positivity in p63 among keratinocytes derived from individual donors with respect of some of the targets [S.B. M.A.V., R.M. unpublished observation]. These exceptions notwithstanding, we conclude that the majority of p63 targets are bound by C/EBP&#x003b4; <italic>in vivo </italic>in primary and immortalized keratinocytes.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>C/EBP&#x003b4; binds to p63 targets</bold>.

We checked their expression levels by RT-PCR analysis in primary keratinocytes induced to differentiate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The process was monitored as in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> with cK1 and cK14 -the former increasing, the latter decreasing- and normalized with GAPDH and NF-YB RNAs. All genes showed remarkable changes. In particular, the coregulated JunB and c-jun varied, while JunD did not. In keeping with the increase in C/EBP&#x003b4; levels after differentiation, activated genes -TGF&#x003b2;-RII, T-Cad, JunB- showed a positive variation, irrespective of p63 expression (See Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Other genes behaved dissimilarly with respect to C/EBP&#x003b4;: E-Cadherin and EGF-R, which are repressed, increased considerably upon differentiation. We conclude that all coregulated targets tested change during differentiation, but this complex process, as in the case of p63, cannot be fully recapitulated through variations generated by a single TF.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Regulation of C/EBP&#x003b4; targets during differentiation</bold>.

In specific pathways of response to external stimuli, one, or a few, TFs play a dominant role in this response. Matters are far more complex in multi-cellular systems involving terminal differentiation and the specification of exquisite features. What emerged is the concept of "master" regulators, whose role is to confer cell identity and to drive gene regulation programs accordingly. In the muscle system, for example, some of these masters -MyoD, Myogenin, MEF2- were identified and their gene regulation programs studied: they apparently show a preference for fellow TFs genes. A robust hierarchical cascade of specific programs is adjusted in such multisteps and multi-functions programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Interestingly, this network is not restricted to TFs exquisitely expressed in muscle, since ubiquitous, or near ubiquitous TFs are an integral part of the network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Similarly, the recent identification of hundreds of p63 targets in various cell types [Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]] highlighted links with TFs that are known, or likely, to play an important role in skin biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The direct cross-talk between p63 and C/EBP&#x003b4;, originally emerging from p63 RNAi screenings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] is confirmed by ChIP and C/EBP&#x003b4; RNAi experiments. The decrease in &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; by inactivation of C/EBP&#x003b4; strongly argues in favour of an activating role of C/EBP&#x003b4; on &#x00394;Np63 transcription, confirmed by overexpression; reporter constructs experiments and ChIPs point at important upstream sites at -2.4 Kb. Interestingly, the synergistic activation observed with NF-Y is a further argument in favour of the physiologic role of this particular member of the C/EBP family in &#x00394;N p63 regulation: NF-Y, itself a poor activator, acts primarily in conjunction with a neighbouring TF [Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]]. In the MHC Class II promoters, for example, only the relevant RFX-5, and not other RFXs, is capable to synergize with NF-Y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>An intriguing finding is the differential regulation of p63 splicing isoforms in keratinocytes upon C/EBP&#x003b4; overexpression. Normally, these cells express exclusively &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; and it is currently unclear whether TA isoforms are induced upon differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>, since different results were reported [Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]]. Overexpression of C/EBP&#x003b4; led to the appearance of &#x00394;N&#x003b2; and &#x003b3;, and -later- of the TA isoforms. Thus, C/EBP&#x003b4; acts not only to support the activity of the &#x00394;N promoter in general, but, directly or indirectly, to impinge on an isoform switch that modifies the p63 portfolio. &#x00394;Np63&#x003b2; and &#x003b3; induction was also observed upon activation and differentiation of cells of the corneal limbus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and a role of TA isofoms in differentiation has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The switch could have a far reaching effect on expression of p63 targes, particularly in the upper epidermal layers, since the &#x00394;N and TA isoforms have often quite dissimilar transcriptional effects.</p><p>How modification of the splicing is accomplished is unclear, at the moment; it has become recently evident, however, that regulation of transcription and RNA processing are highly coordinated events and that specific transcription factors -and cofactors- are known to play a role in pre-mRNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Interestingly, one of the cofactors involved is CARM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], an arginine methyltransferase which modifies other factors promoting exon-skipping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. CARM1 is activated by &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and it was shown to be involved in other differentiation systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that p63 regulators, such as C/EBP&#x003b4;, impact on factors loaded on the &#x00394;N promoter and travel along the gene with PolII complexes to adjust splicing events.</p><p>Our results indicate that many, perhaps most of the p63 targets are coregulated by C/EBP&#x003b4;. An intersection between C/EBPs and p53 family members was noticed before. Typical p53-induced pro-apoptotic targets are not activated in the absence of C/EBP&#x003b4; in KO mammary cells and anti-apoptotic genes are not repressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The two factors are apparently engaged in a positive feed-back loop, with many genes commonly controlled: Cyclin D1, Bfl1, SGP2, Gas1, Bak and IGFBP5. In addition, expression of C/EBP&#x003b4; is induced upon Vitamin D treatment in prostate cells, leading to a dramatic arrest in clonal expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], presumably through VDR, another p63 target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Given the pivotal role of p63 in prostate development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], the interplay between p63 and C/EBP&#x003b4; could be both direct and indirect, through VDR. Note that the overlap between p53 and p63 targets in the skin is large, but not absolute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>HaCaT cells are an epithelial line derived from the back of adult human skin that spontaneusly underwent immortalization in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]; they exhibit normal differentiation and have provided a valuable tool for studying regulation of keratinization in human cells. The interpretation of data concerning p63 in HaCaT is often complicated by the presence of two mutated p53 alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], which are known to impinge on the p63 pathways. This is apparently ot the case for C/EBP&#x003b4;, but for other p63 targets we are analyzing, there are dramatic differences in regulation between HaCat and KCs (S.B., R.M, in preparation). In light of the overlap between the targets of the two TFs, this implies that a mutated p53 might subvert the tumor suppressive and pro-differentiation role of C/EBP&#x003b4;.</p><p>Based on current knowledge derived mostly from RNAi experiments, a tentative view of the influence of p63 and C/EBP&#x003b4; is presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. The picture is complicated by the effect of p63 inactivation through C/EBP&#x003b4; RNAi and by the differential role of TAp63 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] activated at late time points. With two exceptions, EGF-R and DSC3, all genes show a consistent behaviour in overexpression and RNAi. Genes that are repressed by p63, ETAR, AIM2, T-Cadherin, JunB, and should be up-regulated by p63 decrease, are rather decreased, an indication that they are mostly rely on C/EBP&#x003b4;. Some of these -AIM2, T-Cadherin, JunB- limit growth. A role of C/EBP&#x003b4; as a tumor suppressor was established by the finding that knock-out MEFs show genomic instability, impaired contact inhibition and reduced serum dependance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. For the p63-repressed c-Jun, up-regulation by C/EBP&#x003b4; could either be because of removal of p63 or repression by C/EBP&#x003b4;, as indicated by overexpression at late time points. As for genes activated by &#x00394;Np63, such as EGF-R, TGF&#x003b2;-RII and E-cadherin, the latters could be under joint control; EGF-R, which drops after C/EBP&#x003b4; and p63 RNAi, could decrease after C/EBP&#x003b4; overexpression at 48 hours through the increase of TAp63 isoforms, shown to be strong repressors of the EGF-R promoter. This would be consistent with a growth control and pro-differentiative role of both TAp63 and C/EBP&#x003b4;. Similarly, removal of the repressive &#x00394;Np63 [See Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]] by C/EBP&#x003b4; RNAi is consistent with an increase in PCNA mRNA and with a small, late decrease in overexpression. In conclusion, it is clear that coregulation of p63/p53 and C/EBP&#x003b4; is part of a larger program that controls cell-cycle progression and differentiation. To reconstruct the network, it will now be necessary to obtain unbiased information about the panel of C/EBP&#x003b4; targets in keratinocytes, through the use of RNAi and ChIP on chip technology.</p><p>C/EBP&#x003b4; belongs to a family of TFs important for several differentiation pathways, including adipocytes, liver and haematopoietic lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Specifically, it has been associated to the early phases of adipocyte differentiation, together with C/EBP&#x003b2;. It is induced upon several environmental changes that lead to growth arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and serum withdrawal in mammary cells and lung epithelia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Overexpression leads to growth arrest in mammary and prostate epithelial cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. The growth arrest features are common to other C/EBPs [Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]]. Our findings that C/EBP&#x003b4; is up-regulated during cell-cycle exit and differentiation of immortalized HaCaT and primary keratinocytes, and the decrease in expression of PCNA, a proliferative marker, are in agreement with these results.</p><p>Nothing is known about C/EBP&#x003b4; expression during epidermal development of mouse skin. Despite careful examination, the available antibodies are unable to stain mouse cells in immunofluorescence analysis [B.T, R.M., unpublished]. In humans, little variation of expression of C/EBP&#x003b4; was detected in the different phases of maturation of skin annexes, the hair follicle and the sebaceous gland, unlike other members of the family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. At the opposite, we observe here that C/EBP&#x003b4; staining is not uniform in human interfollicular skin, suggesting that the reciprocal interplay with p63 is complex. Co-expression is seen in selected basal cells, which is in line with the activating role of C/EBP&#x003b4; on the &#x00394;N promoter; in other cells of the same layer, strongly positive for p63, C/EBP&#x003b4; fades: this is also consistent with the negative role of p63 on C/EBP&#x003b4; expression. There is a coexpression and a balance in the spinous layer, and in the upper granular layer, with cells exiting from a proliferation status and terminally differentiating, C/EBP&#x003b4; is prominent. In transfection assays, Desmocollin 3, which is expressed in basal cells, is transactivated by C/EBP&#x003b4; and C/EBP&#x003b2;, the suprabasal Desmocollin 1 by C/EBP&#x003b4; and C/EBP&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We confirm that both these genes require C/EBP&#x003b4; expression, as determined by RNAi experiments. Thus our results are consistent with C/EBP&#x003b4; playing a dual role in skin differentiation, both in very early and late stages. In the former, it could limit, through its growth suppressive properties the growth potential of early progenitors. In the later stages, it may coordinate cell-cycle exit and induce differentiation markers. Our observations could now be extended in other systems, notably in the mammary gland and in prostate, in which both TFs have been singularly been shown to play key roles.</p><p>One caveat to the C/EBP&#x003b4; role in skin is the fact that KO mice have no apparent alterations. However, this might be due to redundancy with C/EBP&#x003b2;: it was reported that C/EBP&#x003b2; is expressed in the cytoplasm of basal keratinocytes and becomes nuclear in the spinous layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. C/EBP&#x003b2; KO mice have skin hyperplasia with downplay of keratin 1 and 10 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] and C/EBP&#x003b2; is important for keratinocyte survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Of particular significance are the data recently reported by the group of Vinson on a transgenic model expressing a dominant negative C/EBP -termed A-C/EBP- in basal keratinocytes: these mice have hyperplasia of the basal epidermis and increased apoptosis of the upper layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. p53 and pro-apoptotic markers are induced and C/EBP&#x003b2; dramatically reduced; as A-C/EBP is not C/EBP&#x003b2;-specific, C/EBP&#x003b4; might contribute to the observed phenotype. Given the well known complexity within this family, through homo- and heterodimerizations, production of dominant negatives through the use of internal AUG within C/EBP&#x003b2;, much work lies ahead to establish their role in the different layers of epidermis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We identified a direct and mutual link between p63 and a member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors, C/EBP&#x003b4;. The following relevant findings are the reported: (i) C/EBP&#x003b4; expression is confined to keratinocytes and it is up-regulated in cells committed to differentiation; it is increased in <italic>in vitro </italic>differentiation systems, both of HaCaT and primary keratinocytes. (ii) C/EBP&#x003b4; activates transcription of the &#x00394;Np63 promoter, and it appears to be part of the mechanisms that control p63 splicing. (iii) It is involved in regulation of other p63 targets regulated during differentiation, as verified by RNAi, overexpression and ChIP assays. We therefore suggest that the mutual link between these TFs is important for the correct differentiation of keratinocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells and culture conditions</title><p>First passage primary human keratinocytes -KCs- were derived from breast of healthy individuals and grown on a feeder-layer of lethally irradiated 3T3 cells in DMEM F12 added of Insulin (5 &#x003bc;g/ml), EGF-R (10 ng/ml) hydrocortisone (0.4 &#x003bc;g/ml), T3 (2 nM), Cholera toxin (0.1 nM) and transferrin (5 &#x003bc;g/ml).
