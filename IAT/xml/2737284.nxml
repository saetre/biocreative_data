Most protein kinases have regulatory domains located C-terminal and/or N-terminal to the kinase domain. Despite the differences in their substrate specificities, the kinase domain of Ser/Thr- and Tyr- kinases is highly conserved and composed of two lobes with an overall length of roughly 275 amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006981-Knighton1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

These motifs in combination with the overall catalytic domain sequence can be used to identify genes in genomes that encode protein kinases by various approaches such as sequence alignments and hidden Markov model searches.

To test whether the translocation of STK35 to actin stress fibers could be observed in endothelial cells, we transfected endothelial cells with EGFP-STK35 plasmid alone or together with mRFP-CLP36 plasmid. In cells transfected with EGFP-STK35 only, we found the EGFP-STK35 protein predominantly nuclear with a faint cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006981-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Unexpectedly, the coexpression of EGFP-STK35 and mRFP-CLP36 did not lead to translocation of STK35 to the cytoplasm and stress fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006981-g001">Figure 1B1 and 1B2</xref>) as reported previously. Moreover, we could not observe the presence of CLP36 in EGFP-STK35 immunoprecipitates from endothelial cells (data not shown). These data suggest that CLP36 interaction with STK35 does not occur ubiquitously.

A fragment of the expected size for STK35 (273 bp) was amplified with STK35 specific primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006981.s004">Table S1</xref>) in all cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006981-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The correct sequence for STK35 fragment was confirmed by DNA-sequencing of the amplified product. Hence, endothelial, HeLa, and HEK cells express a transcript for STK35. By quantitative RT-PCR, we found that STK35 is equally expressed in these cell types (data not shown). To exclude a false positive amplification of possible DNA contamination of the isolated RNA, the primers for STK35 were designed to bind exactly at the exon-intron boundaries. No additional amplification of a genomic fragment of STK35 including the intron (13.3 kbp) was obtained in addition to the fragment derived from the STK35 mRNA transcript. In order to obtain further information about the expression profile of STK35 in human tissues and cell lines, we searched the Unigene database for Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) of STK35. 217 ESTs were found for the human STK35 gene, which are present in most of the tissues such as testis, ovary, skin, brain, heart, liver, and eye. To analyze the relative expression of STK35 RNA in various human tissues, we obtained the gene expression profile of STK35 from the SymAtlas database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://symatlas.gnf.org">http://symatlas.gnf.org</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006981-Su1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

The primer pairs correspond to different exons to ensure the amplification from mature RNA. (B) Endothelial cells (EC) were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding different constructs of EGFP-STK35. Cell lysates of transfected or untransfected EC were immunoblotted with goat anti-STK35 antibody, or with mouse anti-EGFP as expression control. The detected bands correspond to the size of the fusion proteins (EGFP-STK35_&#x00394;72-400: 35 kDa; EGFP-STK35_&#x00394;1-6: 66 kDa; EGFP-STK35:72 kDa. The construct lacking the C-terminal part (EGFP-STK35_&#x00394;72-400) was not recognized by anti.STK35 antibody. Note the additional band at 58 kDa in all lanes blotted with the anti-STK35-antibody (arrow). (C) Nuclei of EC, HEK and HeLa cells were isolated, and lysates were immunoblotted with goat anti-STK35 antibody or goat IgG as control. The bands detected by the antibody could not be found with the goat IgG control. In EC, HEK and HeLa nuclear lysates and in the whole cell lysate of EGFP-STK35 transfected cells a band of 58 kDa could be detected. In EGFP-STK35 (72 kDa) transfected cells, additional band of 72 kDa was detected. EC were transfected with pooled STK35L1 siRNA or control siRNA. After 24 to 72 hours of transfection, cell lysates were examined by western blotting with anti-STK35 antibody. After 72 hours, expression of 58 kDa band of STK35 protein was reduced by 80&#x00025;.

To test the specificity of the antibody, cell lysates of untransfected and endothelial cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding for EGFP-tagged STK35 proteins were used as negative and positive controls respectively. The antibody recognized the over-expressed proteins (&#x0223c;72 kDa for EGFP-STK35) and a prominent band at about 58 kDa specifically whereas the pre-immune serum of the same rabbit did not detect these bands (data not shown). Importantly, we could not observe in transfected and non-transfected cells a band at 44.6 kDa, the theoretical calculated molecular weight of endogenous STK35. During the course of the study a commercial polyclonal goat anti-STK35 peptide antibody against the C-terminal amino acid sequence (ELETRMDQVTCAA) of STK35 became available. This antibody recognized the EGFP-STK35 fusion proteins which contain the C-terminal part of the protein specifically (EGFP-STK35, EGFP-STK35&#x00394;1-63) but not a truncated construct lacking this sequence (EGFP-STK35&#x00394;72-400) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006981-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The blot incubated with mouse anti-EGFP antibody clearly showed a band of this truncated construct confirming its expression in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006981-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Beside the detection of the EGFP-tagged STK35 proteins, again a band of 58 kDa was specifically recognized by the goat anti-STK35 antibody but not by the anti-EGFP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006981-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This indicates that this 58 kDa band could represent endogenous STK35 protein.</p><p>To analyze further, nuclear lysates of endothelial, HEK and HeLa cells were prepared. A prominent band at 58 kDa was recognized by the anti-STK35 antibody in nuclear extracts of HEK, HeLa and endothelial cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006981-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) and macrophages (data not shown). In HeLa cells two additional bands at about 52 kDa and 48 kDa were detected. The control blot probed with goat IgG did not show any bands. The theoretical molecular weight of STK35 (44.6 kDa) is significantly less than the molecular weight of the endogenous protein (58 kDa) recognized by these two different antibodies. Posttranslational modification as explanation for such a large mobility shift from 45 kDa to 58 kDa seemed to us unlikely. Moreover, overexpressed EGFP-tagged STK35 would be expected to undergo the same posttranslational modifications as endogenous STK35 in endothelial cells but this was not the case: the detected molecular weight of this tagged protein corresponded exactly to its calculated molecular weight. We also examined the possibilities of longer <italic>STK35</italic> gene splice variants from data set of Ensembl and NCBI human build. However, no splice variants co-relation can be established. Therefore, we undertook a careful genome analysis of the STK35 locus.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Identification of STK35 protein coding region in different genomes</title><p>To identify the open reading frame of the STK35 gene, we analyzed the genomic sequence of the STK35 locus in different genomes from different representative species of vertebrate phyla using various gene structure prediction tools. First we used the ElDorado tool of Genomatix GmbH (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genomatix.de/">http://www.genomatix.de/</ext-link>). We used STK35 cDNA (NM_080836) sequence for complete analysis of the STK35 locus in human genome. The STK35 gene is located on chromosome 20 subregion p13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006981-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The chromosomal region NC_000020 between 2.013.772 and 2.063.771 (50.000 bp) was analyzed. Three transcription start regions (TSR_2.030.439&#x02013;484, TSR_2.030.648&#x02013;690 and TSR_2.031.306&#x02013;335) were found based on CAGE (Cap-analysis gene expression) tags profile. CAGE is a high-throughput method to measure expression levels of a gene and is an essential resource for profiling transcriptional starting sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006981-Kawaji1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006981-Shiraki1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The transcription start region TSR_2.030.439&#x02013;484 was 1035 bp upstream of the previously defined STK35 start codon. This region was highly conserved among mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006981-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We investigated this region for coding sequences manually and by using different gene prediction software such as FGENESH (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.softberry.com">www.softberry.com</ext-link>). We identified a start codon surrounded by a Kozak consensus sequence and an open reading frame encoding a protein of 534 amino acids instead of the 401 amino acids predicted earlier for STK35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006981-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>). The theoretical molecular weight of the predicted protein was 58 kDa which matched completely the molecular weight of the endogenous protein on the immunoblots. Furthermore, we found that the new STK35 gene has 3 coding exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006981-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The newly identified STK35 gene structure is maintained from fish to mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006981-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

This corroborates that <italic>STK35L1</italic> homologs do not share orthology with other serine threonine kinases.</p><fig id="pone-0006981-g012" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006981.g012</object-id><label>Figure 12</label><caption><title>Variable exon-intron organization of <italic>STK35L1</italic> homologs and their ancestor gene from <italic>Ciona</italic>.</title><p>Exons are depicted by boxes and introns by broken lines and labeled with their indicated sizes (bp).

The newly identified sequence of <italic>STK35</italic> gene codes for a protein of 534 amino acids which was termed as STK35L1. By western blot analysis of endothelial cell lysates using two different specific polyclonal anti-STK35 antibodies, we found that STK35L1 was expressed in all mammalian cells studied. By using the siRNA approach, we could confirm that the 58 kDa protein is endogenously expressed STK35L1 protein. In contrast, no evidence for the expression of STK35 was obtained by western blotting using the antibodies directed against the C-terminal peptide of STK35.</p><p>Endogenous STK35L1 was found to be localized in the nucleus. Moreover, EGFP-STK35L1 was also localized in the nucleolus suggesting a role in gene regulation. A previous report suggested that STK35 may have role in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement as the interaction of the co-transfected STK35 and CLP36 proteins led to relocalization of Clik1 from the nucleus to actin stress fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006981-Krupa1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In endothelial cells, this result could not be confirmed. Recent studies suggest that STK35 could play a role in various diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006981-Capra1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006981-Hourani1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006981-Prudencio1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The identification of the full protein coding gene sequence is obviously crucial for the determination of the biological function of the kinase. Therefore, we analyzed the <italic>STK35</italic> locus in human genome by using various approaches. Based on CAGE tags, we found three transcription start regions within a conserved region of 1035 bp upstream of the previously defined STK35 start codon. CAGE is a high-throughput method to measure expression levels by counting large amounts of sequenced capped 5&#x02032; ends of transcripts, termed CAGE tags <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006981-Kawaji1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006981-Shiraki1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. CAGE tags are an essential resource for profiling transcriptional starting sites and can be used for profiling gene expressions by counting CAGE tags associated with genes. By analyzing the transcription start region TSR_2.030.439&#x02013;484 we found a start codon AUG surrounded by a Kozak sequence upstream 990 bp of the previously published start codon. The translation initiation sites in eukaryotic mRNAs are reached via a scanning mechanism which predicts that translation should start at the AUG codon nearest the 5&#x02032; end of the mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006981-Kozak1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. So translation initiation from the previously known start codon which is present in the middle of the second exon is most unlikely. Indeed, this novel open reading frame coded for a protein of 58 kDa, exactly the size of the protein band recognized by the antibody on immunoblot. Moreover, RT-PCR analysis confirmed the presence of the 58 kDa transcript of STK35L1 in endothelial cells. Three orthologous sets of STK35L1 homologs were identified based on syntenic and gene structure pattern data. STK35L1 is conserved in vertebrates. An exception was chicken that had a truncated mRNA starting at the third exon translating only for a partial kinase domain. The present version of the <italic>Gallus</italic> genomic sequence is unable to solve this issue; it can be only clarified with further improvement of genomic assembly of chicken.</p><p><italic>STK35L2</italic> gene is present in all vertebrates in conserved micro-environment without any exceptions. One of the most exciting outcomes of the present analysis is the identification of a third member in this family as <italic>STK35L3</italic>. Its orthologs are found from fish to marsupial mammal. However, this gene is lost in placental mammals after divergence of marsupial and placental mammals at &#x0223c;173&#x02013;190 MY ago. Placental mammals have a conserved syntenic organization, but no <italic>STK35L3</italic> gene. It gives a hint that this gene was lost due to positive selection and might be involved in physiology related to laying eggs or egg development.</p><p>The three sets of STK35L1 homologs have independent gene structure patterns, further supporting their orthologous status. Any other known ser/thr kinase family member does not share these patterns of exon-intron organization. An ancestor of the <italic>STK35L1</italic> is identified in two <italic>Ciona</italic> species that are the closest living relatives of vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006981-Delsuc1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, in our analysis we do not find any evidence to support the presence of <italic>STK35</italic> in sea urchin. Furthermore, no genuine homologs of STK35L1 in worms, flies, echinoderms and lancelets were found even though these groups of invertebrate models possess easily identifiable ser/thr kinases. Thus, it is most likely that the <italic>STK35L1</italic> homologs evolved before the divergence of the vertebrate lineage/<italic>Ciona</italic> lineage about 550 MY ago.</p><p>Furthermore, this comprehensive study will provide a platform to further analyze the functional role and regulation of the STK35L1 kinase, and gene transcription in various physiological and patho-physiological conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p>Oligonucleotides and siRNAs were synthesized from MWG Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany).
