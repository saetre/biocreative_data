Although the vast majority of Scp160p sequence consists of 14 closely spaced KH domains, comparative sequence analyses also demonstrate the presence of a potential nuclear localization sequence located between KH domains 3 and 4, as well as a 110 amino acid non-KH N-terminal region that includes a potential nuclear export sequence (NES). As a step toward investigating the structure&#x0002f;function relationships of Scp160p, we generated two truncated alleles, FLAG.<italic>SCP160&#x00394;N1</italic>, encoding a protein product that lacks the first 74 amino acids, including the potential NES, and FLAG.<italic>SCP160&#x00394;C1</italic>, encoding a protein product that lacks the final KH domain (KH14).

Recent studies in a variety of experimental systems have identified large numbers of RNA-binding proteins, many of which have been conserved across broad expanses of evolutionary time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c2">2</xref>). Nonetheless, the precise biological roles and structure&#x0002f;function relationships for many of these proteins remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c2">2</xref>). We report here a significant step toward uncovering the structure&#x0002f;function relationships of Scp160p, a 160 kDa RNA-binding protein from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>First identified in 1995, Scp160p was originally hypothesized to function in the maintenance of ploidy in yeast, due in large part to the null phenotype, which includes abnormal cell size and shape, increased DNA content and aberrant segregation of genetic markers through meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c3">3</xref>). Biochemical studies from our laboratory and others quickly challenged this hypothesis, however, demonstrating that Scp160p binds selectively <italic>in vitro</italic> to ribohomopolymers and to rRNA, but not to tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c4">4</xref>), and that it associates <italic>in vivo</italic> with a specific subset of mRNAs and other proteins to form large mRNP complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c8">8</xref>). Some of these mRNPs remain free in the cytosol, but most co-fractionate with soluble or membrane-bound polyribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c8">8</xref>). In addition, loss or mutation of <italic>EAP1</italic>, which encodes an eIF4E binding protein involved in both translation initiation and spindle pole body function, is synthetically lethal in combination with loss of <italic>SCP160</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c8">8</xref>). Finally, Gou <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c9">9</xref>) recently identified Scp160p as a potential effector of G&#x003b1;-mediated signal transduction in yeast, although the mechanism and the extent of this function remain unclear. Combined, these data implicate Scp160p for a role in mediating the post-transcriptional regulation of specific mRNAs, as well as the function of specific mRNP proteins. The <italic>scp160</italic>-null phenotype may therefore reflect the downstream effects of aberrant expression or function of Scp160p's target mRNAs and proteins, rather than a direct role of Scp160p in many distinct cellular processes.</p><p>Although little direct structural information regarding Scp160p has been reported, sequence alignment studies have revealed the presence of 14 predicted hnRNP K homology, or KH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c11">11</xref>). KH domains, each spanning about 70 amino acids in length, and including a conserved pattern of hydrophobic residues, an invariant Gly-X-X-Gly segment, and a variable loop, are one of the most common motifs found in the RNA-binding proteins of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c12">12</xref>). Of the 14 KH domains in Scp160p, seven [&#x00023;2, 8&#x02013;12 &#x00026; 14] are classical, containing the Gly-X-X-Gly sequence, and seven [&#x00023;1, 3&#x02013;7 &#x00026; 13] are divergent, with insertions or deletions interrupting the Gly-X-X-Gly sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c4">4</xref>). Recently, Baum <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c13">13</xref>) probed the significance of the final four KH domains of Scp160p by testing the functionality of alleles missing either KH domains 13 and14 or 11&#x02013;14. Consistent with the results reported here, both truncated proteins failed to associate with polyribosomes in yeast.</p><p>In large part because of its KH domains, Scp160p demonstrates significant sequence homology (&#x0223c;23% amino acid sequence identity and &#x0223c;40% similarity) to a growing family of multiple KH-domain proteins collectively known as vigilins. First identified in chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c14">14</xref>), vigilin homologs have now been reported in species ranging from <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> (Genpept &#x00023;7899383) to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c15">15</xref>). Although all vigilins appear to bind nucleic acid, the nature and specificity of the ligands, as well as the proposed cellular functions, remain diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c24">24</xref>). Whether these disparities represent true evolutionary divergence, or the vagaries of different experimental systems and approaches, remains unclear.</p><p>In addition to its many KH domains, Scp160p also contains a potential nuclear localization sequence (NLS) positioned between KH domains 3 and 4, and a 110 amino acid non-KH domain N-terminal region including a potential nuclear export sequence (NES; amino acids 52&#x02013;61) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c10">10</xref>). Neither the NLS nor the NES has been functionally confirmed. Nonetheless, the potential presence of both an NLS and an NES raises the possibility that Scp160p may be a nuclear&#x0002f;cytoplasmic shuttle protein, as has been seen for a number of other KH domain RNA-binding proteins [e.g. FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c25">25</xref>)]. Other than the 110 amino acid N-terminal region, the largest stretch of non-KH domain sequence in Scp160p is 8 amino acids.</p><p>As a step toward elucidating the structure&#x0002f;function relationships of Scp160p, we have generated two truncated alleles, <italic>FLAG.SCP160&#x00394;N1</italic>, whose protein product lacks the first 74 amino acids, including the putative NES, and <italic>FLAG.SCP160&#x00394;C1</italic>, whose protein product lacks the final KH domain (KH14), and expressed both proteins in yeast. Our results demonstrate that the N-truncated protein, expressed as a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fusion, continues to localize to the cytoplasm, with no apparent nuclear accumulation. Considering that the putative NLS remains intact in this truncated protein, which now lacks an NES, these results clearly challenge the assumption that wild-type Scp160p is a nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttle protein.</p><p>Size fractionation studies demonstrate that the N-truncated protein remains competent to form RNPs of normal size, although the C-truncated protein does not. Interestingly, polyribosome association is severely compromised in both, with the N-truncated protein demonstrating no detectable polyribosome association, and the C-truncated protein demonstrating a biphasic distribution with only a small fraction remaining associated with polyribosomes. Perhaps most important, both truncated alleles appear only marginally functional, as measured by the inability of each to complement <italic>scp160&#x0002f;eap1</italic> synthetic lethality in a tester strain. Together, these data further implicate polyribosome association as an essential component of Scp160p function, and underscore the vital roles of both the KH and non-KH domain sequences in Scp160p.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and manipulation</title><p>All yeast manipulations were performed according to standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c26">26</xref>).

This manipulation resulted in loss of the first 74 codons from the <italic>SCP160</italic> open reading frame (ORF), with the concomitant substitution of sequences encoding a starting methionine followed by a FLAG epitope (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys). The PstI restriction site immediately upstream of the ORF had been introduced by prior manipulation of the wild-type sequence. Strains of yeast expressing either FLAG-tagged wild-type Scp160p or FLAG-tagged Scp160&#x00394;N1p in place of the wild-type protein were generated by two-step gene replacement, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c26">26</xref>).

The GFP-tagged alleles (JF2140 and JF2592, respectively) were confirmed by DNA sequencing, linearized with BstEII, and integrated into the <italic>SCP160</italic> locus for expression. Strains expressing GFP-tagged isoforms of Scp160p were further confirmed by western-blot analysis using an affinity-purified anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (SIGMA G1544) at 0.1 &#x003bc;g&#x0002f;ml, as recommended by the manufacturer. Yeast expressing FLAG-Scp160p.GFP or FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p.GFP were used for microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f2">2</xref>), but not for any of the other experiments reported here.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction and expression of the <italic>SCP160&#x00394;C1</italic> allele</title><p>The <italic>FLAG.SCP160&#x00394;C1</italic> allele was generated initially using one-step gene replacement in the haploid strain JFy4493, which already encoded a FLAG-tag at the N-terminus of <italic>SCP160</italic>. In brief, the C-terminus of this allele was modified by insertion of a PCR-amplified kan<sup>MX</sup> cassette flanked by the appropriate <italic>SCP160</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c26">26</xref>).

All 14 KH domains (shaded squares, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f1">1</xref>A), as well as the potential NLS(filled inverted triangles, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f1">1</xref>A), remained intact in <italic>FLAG.SCP160&#x00394;N1</italic>.</p><p>Western-blot analysis of yeast expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type Scp160p, FLAG-tagged Scp160&#x00394;N1p, or FLAG-tagged Scp160&#x00394;C1p demonstrated comparable levels of protein, although as expected, the migration patterns of both truncated proteins differed slightly from that of the full-length protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f1">1</xref>B, filled arrow). Yeast expressing native, untagged Scp160p served as a negative control, and an &#x0223c;100 kDa cross-reacting band of unknown identity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f1">1</xref>B, open arrow) served as a convenient internal control for the loading of lanes.</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular localization of FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p</title><p>To explore the subcellular localization of FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p, we generated a C-terminally GFP-tagged isoform, and integrated the corresponding allele into the normal genomic locus, as described previously for the wild-type allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c6">6</xref>).

Hoescht staining of these cells confirmed the position of the nucleus, and the corresponding DIC images revealed the overall outline of each cell (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f2">2</xref>). Like their wild-type counterparts, yeast expressing the truncated FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p.GFP fusion protein showed GFP signal that was predominantly, if not completely cytoplasmic. No evidence of nuclear accumulation of the truncated protein was seen, suggesting that the potential NES in the deleted region is not normally responsible for the cytoplasmic localization of the full-length protein. These data therefore further suggest that wild-type Scp160p may not normally shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of yeast.</p></sec><sec><title>FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p remains competent to form large RNPs in yeast, but FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;C1p does not</title><p>To probe the biochemical interactions of Scp160&#x00394;N1p and Scp160&#x00394;C1p, as compared with wild-type Scp160p, yeast expressing FLAG-tagged isoforms of all three proteins were grown to mid-log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> &#x0223c;1.0), lysed and the supernatants size-fractionated by S-300 size-exclusion column chromatography. The resultant fractions were subjected to western-blot analysis using the anti-FLAG monoclonal M2 as the primary antibody. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f3">3</xref> (upper two panels), the majority of signal representing both the wild-type and N-truncated Scp160p proteins migrated at or near the void volume of the column, indicating that both proteins exist as components of large complexes (&#x02265;1300 kDa). As we have reported previously for wild-type Scp160p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c6">6</xref>), pre-treatment of each lysate with RNase prior to size-fractionation reduced the apparent size of each protein to &#x0223c;500 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f3">3</xref>, bottom two panels), which is consistent with the previously demonstrated migration of purified native Scp160p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c5">5</xref>). Interestingly, the C-truncated protein migrated as the smaller size even in the context of untreated lysates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f3">3</xref>, third panel), demonstrating that this protein did not remain competent to form normal RNP complexes.</p><p>As a next step to probe the composition of the FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p containing RNP complexes, we applied a previously described anti-FLAG affinity purification procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c8">8</xref>) to isolate these complexes from yeast also expressing HA-tagged Bfr1p. Prior studies identified Bfr1p as one of many proteins that co-purify with Scp160p-containing mRNP complexes in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c6">6</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f4">4</xref> (upper panels), and as reported previously for full-length FLAG.Scp160p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c6">6</xref>), HA.Bfr1p co-purified with FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p. Also like its wild-type counterpart, the association between FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p and HA-Bfr1p was sensitive to RNase pre-treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f4">4</xref>, middle set of panels). Finally, no HA-Bfr1p signal was detected following the mock-isolation of complexes from yeast expressing HA-tagged Bfr1p in conjunction with native, untagged Scp160p, demonstrating the specificity of the isolation procedure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f4">4</xref>, lower panels). These data demonstrate that the FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p protein retained the ability to form at least a subset of its normal macromolecular interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Both FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p and FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;C1p are severely compromised in their ability to associate with polyribosomes</title><p>To probe the ability of each truncated protein to associate with polyribosomes, soluble cell lysates were size-fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c6">6</xref>). Lysates from yeast expressing the FLAG-tagged wild-type protein were analyzed in parallel as a control. By their nature, sucrose gradients enable separation of much larger complexes than do S300 columns, allowing the distinction of free RNPs from ribosomal subunits, monosomes and polysomes, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f5">5</xref>. Western-blot analyses of the fractions from these gradients (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f5">5</xref>) demonstrated that although the wild-type FLAG.Scp160p protein localized predominantly to the bottom of the gradient, co-fractionating as expected with polyribosomes, the FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p protein localized predominantly to the lighter fractions. Furthermore, the FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;C1p protein localized predominantly to the very top of the gradient, although a small amount of this protein continued to co-fractionate with polyribosomes.</p><p>Differential centrifugation of cell lysates to separate soluble from membrane-associated pools also demonstrated a notable distinction between the full-length and truncated Scp160p proteins. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c27">27</xref>), wild-type FLAG.Scp160p localized predominantly to the membrane pellet, while both the FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p and FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;C1p proteins were almost evenly distributed between the soluble and membrane-associated fractions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f6">6</xref>A and B). This significant shift of both the FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p and FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;C1p signals from the membrane-associated pool to the soluble pool is fully consistent with our previous observation that treatments which disrupt Scp160p association with polyribosomes also shift signal from the membrane-associated pellet to the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c6">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> function of both truncated <italic>FLAG.SCP160&#x00394;N1</italic> and <italic>FLAG.SCP160&#x00394;C1</italic> alleles is severely compromised</title><p>To assess functional capacity of both the <italic>FLAG.SCP160&#x00394;N1</italic> and <italic>FLAG.SCP160&#x00394;C1</italic> alleles <italic>in vivo</italic>, we quantified the ability of each to complement <italic>scp160&#x0002f;eap1</italic> synthetic lethality in a double null tester strain, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c8">8</xref>). In brief, plasmid-borne copies of each truncated <italic>SCP160</italic> allele were introduced into yeast genomically null for both <italic>scp160</italic> and <italic>eap1</italic>, covered by a <italic>URA3</italic> maintenance plasmid encoding wild-type <italic>SCP160</italic>. Following growth for a fixed number of generations in the absence of uracil selection, transformants were plated to medium with and without 5FOA. The fraction of cells that could grow in the presence of 5FOA, which kills only <italic>URA3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, versus in its absence, served as an indicator of how many cells had lost their <italic>URA3</italic> plasmid. Yeast transformed with either empty plasmid backbone, or plasmid carrying a second wild-type copy of <italic>SCP160</italic>, served as negative and positive controls, respectively. For comparison, the degree of <italic>URA3</italic> plasmid loss in each strain was scaled relative to that seen in the corresponding positive control, which was set to 100%. The final values calculated, therefore, no longer directly reflected plasmid retention or loss, but rather indicated how effectively, relative to the wild-type allele, the test sequence in question could enable cells to remain viable despite loss of their <italic>URA3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup><italic>SCP160</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> maintenance plasmid. Since this maintenance plasmid was the same in all strains, issues of plasmid replication efficiency or distribution, independent of <italic>SCP160</italic> sequence, should have been cancelled out. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh812tb2">2</xref>, according to this procedure, the <italic>FLAG.SCP160&#x00394;N1</italic> allele retained &#x0003c;10% wild-type function, and the corresponding <italic>FLAG.SCP160&#x00394;C1</italic> allele retained &#x0003c;5% wild-type function.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The experiments presented here were designed to ask three questions: (i) is the N-terminal region of Scp160p, including the potential NES, responsible for the cytoplasmic localization of Scp160p; (ii) is the non-KH domain N-terminal region important for Scp160p macromolecular interaction or function; and (iii) is the final KH domain important for Scp160p macromolecular interaction or function? In effect, we have compared the relative functional contributions of KH and non-KH domain sequences in <italic>SCP160</italic>. Our results clearly demonstrate that the N-terminal region and NES are not required for cytoplasmic localization of Scp160p, or for assembly of Scp160p into RNPs, although this region is required for association of Scp160p with polyribosomes. In contrast, the final KH domain is required for both RNP assembly and association of Scp160p with polyribosomes. Perhaps most important, both the non-KH domain N-terminus and the C-terminal KH domain are essential for function of Scp160p <italic>in vivo</italic>. Together, these data underscore the importance of both KH and non-KH domain sequences in Scp160p, and further implicate polyribosome association as a key component of Scp160p function.</p><sec><title>Subcellular localization</title><p>All studies reported to date addressing the subcellular localization of Scp160p have placed the protein firmly in the cytoplasm, with enrichment around the nuclear envelope&#x0002f;ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c27">27</xref>). Nonetheless, the identification of both putative NLS and NES sequences in Scp160p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c10">10</xref>) raised the possibility that Scp160p might be a nuclear&#x0002f;cytoplasmic shuttle protein with a steady-state distribution favoring the cytoplasm. The results presented here, demonstrating that loss of the putative NES does not result in nuclear accumulation of the truncated Scp160p, clearly challenge this hypothesis, and further suggest that the remaining putative NLS also may be non-functional. Where in the cell, and at what stage of complex assembly the Scp160p protein finds and associates with its target mRNAs, therefore remains an open question, although presumably these interactions occur within the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec><title>Macromolecular interactions</title><p>The data presented here demonstrate that the FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p truncated protein was able to form a subset of its normal biochemical interactions, including association with HA-Bfr1p and assembly into RNPs, although it was severely compromised in its ability to associate with polyribosomes. Whether these data reflect a direct versus indirect role of the N-terminal sequence in polyribosome association remains unclear, as does whether the full N-terminal region is required for polyribosome association, versus a smaller sub-domain. Furthermore, beyond the presence of Bfr1p, the precise nature and composition of the RNP complexes formed by FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p remains to be explored. At minimum, however, the fact that at least some normal biochemical interactions involving FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p remain intact implies that the truncated protein is not globally misfolded. The observation that RNP formation and polyribosome association can be uncoupled further implies that polyribosome association is not an obligate first step in the process of Scp160p mRNP formation.</p><p>The data presented here also demonstrate that the FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;C1p truncated protein is compromised with regard to both RNP formation and polyribosome association. This result is striking for at least three reasons. First, it demonstrates either that Scp160p requires all 14 KH domains to function properly, or else that KH14 is special in some way. This is a testable hypothesis that is currently under investigation. Second, although Baum <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh812c13">13</xref>) also reported recently that deletion of the final two KH domains from Scp160p disrupted polyribosome association, those authors concluded that sequences within KH13 were essential for this process, and never checked the impact of KH14-loss alone. Our results clearly demonstrate that the loss of KH14 alone is sufficient to disrupt Scp160p-polyribosome association, although the mechanism of that impact remains unclear. While the possibility of partial or global unfolding of the C-truncated protein cannot formally be excluded, the fact that this protein remains largely soluble (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f6">6</xref>) and is detected in lysates at levels comparable to that of the wild-type protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh812f1">1</xref>B), argues against this possibility. Finally, these results demonstrate that although the N-terminus may be essential for polyribosome association of Scp160p, it is not sufficient.</p></sec><sec><title>Function <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>One of the most important observations reported here is that both the <italic>FLAG.SCP160&#x00394;N1</italic> and <italic>FLAG.SCP160&#x00394;C1</italic> were significantly compromised with regard to function <italic>in vivo</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh812tb2">2</xref>). These data demonstrate that although the non-KH domain sequences in Scp160p may be minimal, they are not insignificant. These data further demonstrate that despite the presence of 13 other KH domains, KH14 is essential. Finally, as mentioned earlier, these data implicate polyribosome association as an essential component of Scp160p function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh812f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Expression of FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;N1p and FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;C1p in yeast.
