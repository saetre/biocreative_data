It is located at the subunit interface, in proximity to the decoding center and its structure, which has been solved by X-ray crystallography for thermophilic bacteria, consists of a six &#x003b1;-helix bundle with a &#x003b2;-hairpin between helices 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c2">2</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c3">3</xref>). Mutagenesis studies have been used to define which amino acid residues in S7 are involved in its interaction with rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c5">5</xref>) and it was found that several regions play an important role in S7 binding, including its N-terminal region, the &#x003b2;-hairpin, &#x003b1;-helix 4 and loops 2 and 5, connecting &#x003b1;-helices 1 and 2, and 4 and 5, respectively. In <italic>E.coli</italic>, the expression levels of most ribosomal proteins are regulated autogenously by primary binding proteins, which exert a feedback control at the translational level by binding to a specific site of their operon mRNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c7">7</xref>). S7 is one of these translational repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c8">8</xref>). It is encoded by the <italic>str</italic> operon, which also codes for ribosomal protein S12, and elongation factors G and Tu. Overexpression of S7 interferes with bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c9">9</xref>), an effect which is assumed to result from repression of translation of the <italic>str</italic> operon mRNA upon S7 binding, causing an imbalance between rRNA transcription and ribosomal protein and elongation factor translation. The binding site of S7 in the lower half of the 3&#x02032; major domain of 16S rRNA was delineated to a short fragment comprising two multibranch loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c10">10</xref>), whereas its binding site on its mRNA is contained in an irregular hairpin structure located in the intercistronic region between the first cistron coding for S12 and the second cistron coding for S7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c11">11</xref>). Although these binding sites appear to have a very different secondary structure, they contain two identical sequence elements (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke177f1">1</xref>). In 16S rRNA, one of these elements is located in loop A, at the junction between helices 30 and 41, and the other element is located in loop B, proximal to helix 43. Protection by S7 against hydroxyl radical attack, crosslinking studies and mutational and chemical probing of the S7 binding site (13&#x02013;15, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c16">16</xref>) previously suggested that these two elements correspond to recognition features for S7 on 16S rRNA. The recent crystal structures of the bacterial 30S subunit at 3.0 and 3.3 &#x000c5; resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c18">18</xref>) confirmed this suggestion, in showing that these two elements contact specific amino acid residues in protein S7. The element in loop A of 16S rRNA interacts with residues in loop 2 and loop 5 of protein S7, whereas the element in loop B&#x000a0;of 16S rRNA interacts with residues in the N-terminal region, in loop 2, in the &#x003b2;-hairpin and in &#x003b1;-helix 4 of protein S7. The binding of S7 to its mRNA is much less characterized than its binding to 16S rRNA, but it could be hypothesized that the two elements that are common to 16S rRNA and the <italic>str&#x000a0;</italic>mRNA also constitute the recognition signals for S7 on its mRNA.</p><p> In this study we have compared the effect of various deletion and point mutations in <italic>E.coli </italic>S7 on its binding to its own mRNA and to 16S rRNA. We also investigated the effect of mutations in S7 on its capacity to interfere with cell growth, allowing a direct comparison between the binding affinity of the repressor for its mRNA and its <italic>in vivo </italic>effectiveness. Our results suggest that S7 uses the same features to recognize its binding site on its mRNA and on 16S rRNA, and demonstrate a direct relationship between the capacity of the protein to bind its mRNA and its ability to interfere with cell growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of plasmids and expression of S7 and its mutant derivatives</title><p>Plasmid pET-21a(&#x0002b;)-S7, which codes for <italic>E.coli </italic>K12 S7 under control of a T7 promoter, and its derivatives coding for various S7 deletion and point mutants were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c5">5</xref>).

Plasmid pcDNA3.1&#x0002f;Hygro(&#x0002b;) (Invitrogen), which allows <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription of a cloned DNA sequence with the T7 RNA polymerase, was used for the cloning of the intercistronic S12&#x02013;S7 region of the <italic>str</italic> operon, extending on the S12 and S7 coding sequences. Genomic DNA was obtained from <italic>E.coli</italic> K12A19 following a standard procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c19">19</xref>), and we PCR amplified the sequence corresponding to bases &#x02013;160 to &#x0002b;71 (the first base of S7 initiation codon on the <italic>str</italic> mRNA corresponds to position 1). The forward primer (&#x00023;1) was 5&#x02032;-GCGCG<bold>GCTAGC</bold>CTCCGGCGTTAAAGACCGTAAGC-3&#x02032; and the reverse primer (&#x00023;2)&#x000a0;5&#x02032;-GCGCG<bold>TTCGAA</bold>CCAGCAGTTCTGATCCGAACTTCG-3&#x02032; (bold letters in the sequences correspond to <italic>Nhe</italic>I and <italic>Hin</italic>dIII restriction sites, respectively). These sites were used for the cloning of the PCR fragment containing the S12&#x02013;S7 intercistronic region into pcDNA3.1&#x0002f;Hygro(&#x0002b;), generating pcDNA3.1&#x0002f;Hygro(&#x0002b;)-S12ICRS7. PCR was carried out using the Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) in a Robocycler<sup>TM</sup> 40 (Stratagene) under the following conditions: 4 min of denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C, 28 cycles of 1 min at 94&#x000b0;C, 1 min at 58&#x000b0;C and 1&#x000a0;min at 72&#x000b0;C, followed by a final extension step of 5 min at 72&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA preparation and nitrocellulose filter binding assays</title><p>The <sup>32</sup>P-labeled fragment of the <italic>str </italic>operon used for binding studies was obtained by run-off transcription in the presence of &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;UTP of plasmid pcDNA3.1&#x0002f;Hygro(&#x0002b;)-S12ICRS7 linearized with <italic>Hin</italic>dIII.

When the optical density at 600 nm was 0.05, IPTG was added to the cell culture to a final concentration of 0.75 mM and cell growth was monitored at 37&#x000b0;C by measuring the optical density at 600 nm every 20 min. Cell doubling time was calculated using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>To identify amino acid residues critical for the binding of S7 to 16S rRNA, a set of four deletion and 12 single amino acid substitution mutants had been previously generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c5">5</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke177f2">2</xref>), and circular dichroism spectra had indicated that the mutant proteins did not suffer major structural perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c5">5</xref>). The same mutants were investigated for their capacity to interact with the <italic>str</italic> mRNA fragment encompassing the S7 binding site in a high-ionic-strength buffer &#x0005b;20 mM Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub>, 350 mM KOAc&#x0005d;. With this buffer, the maximal retention efficiency was ~35&#x00025; for the complex between the <italic>str </italic>mRNA fragment and wild-type S7, but was &#x0003c;20&#x00025; in a buffer containing chloride instead of acetate anions. We therefore selected the acetate buffer for studying the interaction between S7 mutants and the <italic>str </italic>mRNA fragment. The apparent association constant (<italic>K</italic>&#x02032;<sub>a</sub>) of&#x000a0;wild-type S7 for its mRNA was determined from the amount of&#x000a0;protein required to half-saturate the RNA. Its value (6.8 &#x000b1; 0.7 &#x000b5;M<sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>1</sup>) was identical to that measured for the association constant between S7 and the 16S rRNA fragment (7.1 &#x000b1; 1.4 &#x000b5;M<sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>1</sup>), a value comparable to that of 5.3 &#x000b1; 0.5 &#x000b5;M<sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>1</sup> found previously in a slightly different high-ionic-strength buffer containing chloride and not acetate anions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c5">5</xref>).</p><p> Representative binding curves for different mutants are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke177f3">3</xref>. The apparent association constants of the mutant derivatives of S7 for the <italic>str</italic> mRNA fragment are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke177tb1">1</xref>, and the effect of the mutations on S7&#x000a0;binding to the <italic>str </italic>mRNA is compared to their effect on S7 binding to 16S rRNA. Several deletion and point mutations located throughout the protein sequence significantly decreased the affinity of S7 for its mRNA. They include an N-terminal deletion (&#x00394;1&#x02013;17), deletion of the &#x003b2;-hairpin (&#x00394;72&#x02013;89), point mutations in the N-terminal region (Q8A, F17G), mutation K35Q in loop 2 and mutation M115G in loop 5. Interestingly, the same mutations had been found to significantly interfere with S7 binding to the rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c5">5</xref>). The other mutations modestly or hardly affected S7 binding to the mRNA, comparable to their effect on rRNA binding. The fact that the effects of mutations are similar for 16S rRNA and mRNA binding strongly suggests that S7 uses the same features to bind the two RNA targets.</p><p> The effect of overexpression of the S7 mutants on cell growth was assessed by measuring the cell doubling time, under conditions where wild-type chromosome-encoded S7 was also expressed. A direct correlation could be readily observed between the capacity of the mutants to bind the <italic>str</italic> mRNA and their ability to interfere with cell growth (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke177tb2">2</xref>). Mutants that bind poorly the <italic>str</italic> mRNA had only a weak effect on cell growth. This was the case for mutants &#x00394;1&#x02013;17, &#x00394;72&#x02013;89, Q8A, F17G, K35Q and M115G. On the other hand, mutants that bind efficiently to the mRNA such as K34Q, K136Q and R142Q strongly interfered with bacterial growth as does wild-type S7. One of the mutants, &#x00394;148&#x02013;178, with a short C-terminal deletion, was even more detrimental than wild-type S7.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our results show that <italic>E.coli </italic>S7 binds its mRNA and 16S rRNA with the same affinity. S8, a regulatory ribosomal protein, binds its mRNA with an affinity which is ~5-fold less than its affinity for the rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c20">20</xref>), whereas S4, another regulatory ribosomal protein, has the same affinity for its mRNA and for the rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c21">21</xref>). One would have expected regulatory ribosomal proteins to bind preferentially the rRNA, so that they repress translation of their mRNA only when there is a shortage of rRNA transcript. Deckman and Draper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c21">21</xref>) concluded from their studies with S4 that the preferential incorporation of regulatory ribosomal proteins into ribosomes results from the high cooperativity of ribosome assembly. Our observation that S7 binds its mRNA and the 16S rRNA with the same affinity fully supports this conclusion.</p><p> As indicated in the Introduction, the binding sites of S7 on 16S rRNA and on its mRNA, although apparently dissimilar at the secondary structure level, present two identical sequence elements, which were identified as recognition elements for S7 binding in rRNA. Our results with a variety of S7 mutants clearly suggest that S7 uses the same determinants to bind the <italic>str</italic> mRNA and 16S rRNA since the same mutations which decreased S7 binding to rRNA decreased its affinity for the mRNA. Thus, it is very likely that S7 recognizes these two identical elements on the mRNA and 16S rRNA. Among ribosomal proteins acting as translational repressors, the binding sites for S8 and L1 on their mRNA are strikingly similar to their binding sites on the rRNA, from which it can readily be inferred that they recognize identical elements on the two targets (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c22">22</xref>). In contrast, like for S7, the mRNA binding sites of the translational repressors S4 and S15 seem very different from their binding sites on the rRNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c23">23</xref>). However, S4 appears to use the same determinants to bind rRNA and its mRNA since S4 deletions that decreased rRNA recognition had parallel effects on mRNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c24">24</xref>). As to S15, its interaction with 16S rRNA has been characterized in detail from the crystallographic structure of a complex between S15 from a thermophilic bacterium and a 16S rRNA fragment encompassing its binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c25">25</xref>), as well as from footprinting and interference studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c27">27</xref>). Footprinting and mutagenesis studies with its mRNA binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c29">29</xref>) strongly suggest that S15 recognizes similar elements on both rRNA and its mRNA. Therefore, it appears to be a common characteristic of ribosomal proteins acting as translational repressors that they recognize the same elements in their mRNA and in their rRNA binding site, whether these sites appear similar or dissimilar. Translation control involving the binding of a regulatory ribosomal protein generally causes translation repression by inducing a conformational change in mRNA that hinders ribosome binding or, alternatively, does not prevent ribosome binding but traps the bound ribosome in an inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c7">7</xref>). In the case of S7 that binds between the first and second cistrons of the <italic>str </italic>mRNA, the S7 cistron is translated by ribosomes, which, for the vast majority, have translated the upstream S12 cistron, scanned the intercistronic S12&#x02013;S7 region and resumed translation when reaching the S7 translation start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c8">8</xref>). It has been proposed that the binding of S7 in the intercistronic S12&#x02013;S7 region induces a conformational change in this region that prevents its scanning by the ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c11">11</xref>). Our results, suggesting that S7 recognizes two specific sequence elements within the S12&#x02013;S7 intercistronic region, agree with this hypothesis.</p><p> We observed that overexpression of wild-type S7 interferes with cell growth, which, as mentioned above, can be related to binding of its own polycistronic mRNA, the <italic>str</italic> mRNA, and repressing its translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c9">9</xref>). Our results show that there is a direct correlation between the capacity of each S7 mutant to bind the <italic>str</italic> mRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> and the effect of its overexpression on bacterial growth. Indeed, mutants that bind well the <italic>str</italic> RNA efficiently interfered with cell growth whereas overexpression of the mutants that bind poorly the <italic>str </italic>mRNA only weakly affected cell growth. Alternatively, these mutants that weakly interfere with cell growth could be rapidly degraded <italic>in vivo</italic>, thus accounting for their lack of effect. However, examination of the amount of the overexpressed S7 proteins at different times of bacterial growth does not support this possibility (data not shown). Interestingly, Fredrick <italic>et al. </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c9">9</xref>), who also investigated the effect of various mutations in S7 on cell growth, found a close correlation between the capacity of different S7 mutants to interfere with cell growth and their proficiency in 30S subunit assembly and suggested that S7 residues involved in mRNA binding are also involved in rRNA binding. This suggestion is directly confirmed by the results of the present study.</p><p> In our <italic>in vivo</italic> assays, the chromosome-encoded wild-type S7 is coexpressed with the plasmid-encoded S7 mutants. As suggested by the results from Fredrick <italic>et al. </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c9">9</xref>), it is likely that the 30S subunits contain almost exclusively wild-type S7 when the coexpressed S7 mutants bind poorly the 16S rRNA, whereas S7 mutants that bind efficiently 16S rRNA can outcompete wild-type S7 for the formation of 30S subunits. Therefore, with these mutants that conserve a high affinity for 16S rRNA as well as for the <italic>str</italic> mRNA, effects on growth could result not only from S7 binding to the <italic>str</italic> mRNA and repressing its translation but also from a decreased activity of the ribosomes having incorporated the mutated protein. Mutant &#x00394;148&#x02013;178, with a deletion of 31 amino acids at the C-terminal end, likely corresponds to such a case. This mutant binds well to 16S rRNA and to the <italic>str </italic>mRNA, and its overexpression is much more detrimental than that of wild-type S7. One could argue here that mutant &#x00394;138&#x02013;178, with a larger deletion at the C-terminus, is not as detrimental as &#x00394;148&#x02013;178, although it also lacks the sequence deleted in &#x00394;148&#x02013;178. However, it is likely that mutant &#x00394;138&#x02013;178 is less efficiently incorporated into the 30S subunit than mutant &#x00394;148&#x02013;178, due to its weaker binding affinity for the rRNA. Greuer <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c30">30</xref>) recently showed that a region in the C-terminus of <italic>E.coli </italic>S7 (positions 149&#x02013;155) could be crosslinked to a mRNA analog, in the spacer between the Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno sequence and the initiator codon. An attractive hypothesis is that the C-terminal region of S7 participates in the formation of a functional 30S initiation complex and that 30S subunits having incorporated mutant &#x00394;148&#x02013;178 would be impaired in translation initiation. Experiments are in progress in our laboratory to investigate this hypothesis. Interestingly, the portion of the C-terminal region of S7 that is crosslinked to mRNAs is extremely well-conserved in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c2">2</xref>), but not in the eukaryotic homolog of S7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c32">32</xref>). This could be related to the known difference in the way prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes initiate protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke177c33">33</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke177f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Secondary structure of mRNA and 16S rRNA fragments that bind S7.
