Reactivation of the latent infection involving a switch back to active bacterial replication can lead to post-primary transmissible tuberculosis. Mycobacterial mechanisms involved in slow growth or switching growth rate provide rational targets for the development of new drugs against persistent mycobacterial infection. Using chemostat culture to control growth rate, we screened a transposon mutant library by Transposon site hybridization (TraSH) selection to define the genetic requirements for slow and fast growth of <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> (BCG) and for the requirements of switching growth rate. We identified 84 genes that are exclusively required for slow growth (69 hours doubling time) and 256 genes required for switching from slow to fast growth. To validate these findings we performed experiments using individual <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG knock out mutants. We have demonstrated that growth rate control is a carefully orchestrated process which requires a distinct set of genes encoding several virulence determinants, gene regulators, and metabolic enzymes. The <italic>mce1</italic> locus appears to be a component of the switch to slow growth rate, which is consistent with the proposed role in virulence of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. These results suggest novel perspectives for unravelling the mechanisms involved in the switch between acute and persistent TB infections and provide a means to study aspects of this important phenomenon <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>With the average daily death toll from tuberculosis at 4,500 the worldwide burden of this disease is overwhelming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-World1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Control measures are being severely thwarted by the worldwide spread of antibiotic resistant strains of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. In 2008 WHO recorded the highest rates of multi-drug (MDR) resistant strains of TB and the spread of a virtually untreatable form of the disease caused by extensively resistant strains (X-DR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-World1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Novel anti-TB drugs are urgently required which shorten the lengthy drug regimen required to treat TB and also have activity against drug resistant strains. The identification of genes which provide essential but unique functions in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> greatly facilitates drug discovery programs and also provides further information about the complex biology of this highly successful pathogen.</p><p>Slow growth rate is amongst one of the remarkable features of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. This pathogen can only achieve a maximum growth rate equivalent to a doubling time of about 16 hours in optimal laboratory conditions whilst in the human host growth rates vary upon the site and stage of infection. Tuberculosis is characterized by two distinct phases an acute phase where the bacteria are actively growing and a persistent phase where the bacteria are in a slow growing or non-growing state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-Stewart1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. This ability to persist for decades in a state refractory to immune clearance but primed for reactivation is key to the success of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and represents an important barrier to the control of tuberculosis as presently used chemotherapies are largely inactive against non-dividing cells. The identification of pathways and genes essential to establish and maintain persistence would facilitate the development of drugs which target this phase of infection.</p><p>Although very little is known about the state of the tubercle bacillus during persistence, it is generally agreed that the organism replicates slowly or not at all during this stage of disease. To study this component of the biology of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> we utilized chemostat culture as this is the only method available to control growth rate. In addition, the use of continuous culture in a chemostat offers many advantages over batch culture enabling the experimenter to vary the growth rate whilst maintaining cells in a constant physical and chemical environment. Our previous studies into the physiology of <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG (the vaccine strain of the tubercle bacillus) demonstrated that growth rate modulated the biomass composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-Beste1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

The current study aims to further probe the physiological and gene regulatory state of slow-growing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> by mutational analysis. Transposon site hybridisation (TraSH) is a microarray based transposon tracking strategy to monitor the fitness of mutants in mixed populations under different conditions. This powerful functional genomic tool was developed using <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and has now been applied successfully to a variety of pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-Sassetti1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-Chan1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

This data provides an invaluable resource for mycobacterial researchers and will facilitate the characterisation of genes with unknown roles and provide further functional clues for some important virulence genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Genes required for growth on Roisin's glycerol minimal media</title><p>In the experiments described by Sassetti <italic>et al</italic> (2003) transposon libraries of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG were constructed and recovered on 7H10 agar and TraSH analysis was used to identify genes which were essential for the survival of both species on this media. The experiments described here used just the BCG transposon library generated by Sassetti <italic>et al</italic> (2003) for TraSH analysis to investigate the genetic basis of growth control in a chemostat model. Initially we determined the genes that were &#x02018;additionally essential&#x02019; for growth in the defined minimal media used for chemostat cultivations: Roisin's minimal broth. The additionally essential genes discussed here are defined as genes which were identified in this study as essential for growth of <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG on Roisin's minimal glycerol medium but had not been previously identified by Sassetti <italic>et al</italic> (2003) as essential for the growth of <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> on 7H10 medium.</p><p>A late log phase culture of the BCG transposon library <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-Sassetti1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> was inoculated into a 2 L bioreactor operated in batch mode.

Microarray signals were analysed using a rank based statistic, Rank products (RP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-Breitling1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. RP is a non-parametric statistical method which has demonstrated robustness in microarray analysis and has been shown to have a higher sensitivity and selectivity in comparison with t-test based statistical methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-Hong1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This method detects genes that consistently have the largest positive or negative log-ratio.</p><p>Roisin's media is a chemically defined glycerol-limited media that contains only one source of carbon plus Tween 80 as a dispersal agent, ammonia as a nitrogen source and lacks citrate, biotin or pyridoxine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-Beste1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast 7H10 is composed of several potential carbon sources including glutamic acid, glycerol, glucose, oleic acid and bovine serum albumin and also contains the co-factors biotin and pyridoxine hydrochloride and the buffer sodium citrate facilitating citrate mediated iron transport. In the absence of citrate mycobacteria grown on Roisin's would be reliant on the siderophore mycobactin for iron transport. We therefore expected to find that the set of &#x02018;additionally essential&#x02019; genes required to grow on Roisin's media to be principally those involved in glycerol uptake and metabolism, ammonia uptake and genes required for <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of biotin, pyridoxine and mycobactin.</p><p>A total of 241 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005349.s001">Dataset S1</xref>) that were not essential for survival in 7H10 media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-Sassetti1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> were identified here as uniquely required for growth in Roisin's minimal medium.

The route for glycerol utilization is generally assumed to proceed <italic>via</italic> glycerol kinase followed by dehydrogenation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-Keating1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. However, many bacteria utilize an alternative pathway whereby glycerol is first oxidized by glycerol dehydrogenase before being phosphorylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-Lin1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

To clarify the situation, and also to independently validate the TraSH data, an individual gene knock-out of <italic>glp</italic>K was constructed in both <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. The resulting mutants displayed a dysgonic growth phenotype when grown on 7H11 media and failed to grow on Roisin's agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005349-g001">Figure 1</xref>) confirming the TraSH result and indicating that the glycerol kinase pathway is indeed essential for glycerol metabolism.</p><fig id="pone-0005349-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005349.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Growth of wild type and <italic>glpK</italic> mutant strains.</title><p>Colonial morphology of 3 week grown (i) wild type <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG (ii) a <italic>glpK</italic> deletion mutant and (iii) <italic>glp</italic>K mutant carrying a copy of the <italic>glpK</italic> gene in the <italic>attB</italic> site on the chromosome on (A) 7H11 media and (B) Roisin's glycerol minimal media.

Surprisingly none of the genes involved mycobactin synthesis were essential for growth in Roisin's minimal medium. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is peculiar in its ability to produce both cell-associated (mycobactin) and secreted (carboxymycobactin) siderophores to capture iron. The cross feeding of the <italic>mbt</italic> mutants by carboxymycobactin released from neighboring cells may enable <italic>mbt</italic> mutants to overcome their siderphore deficiency. However <italic>mbtB</italic>, which, encodes the enzyme required for the initial steps in mycobactin T synthesis, had a pfp value of 0.21 and therefore may have a role in the optimal growth of mycobacteria in this media.

Cross feeding could also enable pyridoxine synthesis mutants to overcome the inability to synthesise this co-factor.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Comparison of glycerol essentiality results with flux balance analysis (FBA) model predictions of a genome-scale metabolic model</title><p>Genome-scale metabolic models provide a valuable framework to interpret essentiality screens as they allow predictions of gene essentiality using current knowledge of the metabolic network whilst also providing an insight into incomplete or incorrect metabolic knowledge. The glycerol TraSH results were compared with gene essentiality predictions using a genome-scale metabolic network of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (GSMN-TB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-Beste3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The gene essentiality scan was performed using the minimal biomass e as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-Beste3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition the carbon source was changed to glycerol and the biotin and citrate gates were closed. Overall there was a good correlation between the GSMN-TB model and the observed gene essentialities as 76.66&#x00025; of the predictions were identical to the experimental results (additionally essential genes only). This analysis identified some interesting inconsistencies (false positives and false negatives) which reveal important information about the metabolism of tuberculosis and this information can also be used to make informed alterations to the GSMN. The set of false negatives (genes predicted as dispensable by the model but shown to be essential experimentally) included genes which had potential homologues with annotations of only moderate confidence and maybe unable to replace the activity of their deleted isoenzyme. For example, <italic>fabD</italic> which is a major component of <italic>M. tuberculosi</italic>s fatty acid synthase II has a possible homologue <italic>fabD2</italic> which is present in the GSMN. The demonstration that <italic>fabD</italic> is essential suggests that <italic>fabD2</italic> is unable to functionally complement the activities of <italic>fabD</italic>. Several genes were also predicted as functionally redundant due to the presence in the model of alternative pathways that can substitute for genes predicted to be essential. For instance, the model predicted that the gene <italic>glpK</italic> is non-essential due to the presence of the alternative glycerol pathway described above. This alternative glycerol utilization pathway has now been deleted from the GSMN-TB model.</p><p>Amongst the false negative model predictions was the malate dehydrogenase gene <italic>mdh</italic> (Rv1240), which was identified previously as non-essential in the original TraSH screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-Sassetti1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> but was identified as essential in the TraSH analysis presented here. The non-essentiality in the model was due to the predicted activity of &#x0201c;malic enzyme&#x0201d; (malate dehydrogenase decarboxylating, <italic>mez</italic>) that catalyses the oxidative decarboxylation of L-malate to pyruvate and which, together with pyruvate carboxylase, can potentially convert malate to oxaloacetate and thereby complement <italic>in-silico mdh</italic> mutants. To confirm this result we attempted to construct <italic>mdh</italic> KO mutants in both <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG. Despite numerous attempts we were unable to delete the <italic>mdh</italic> gene even when the transformants were recovered on 7H11 media which contains glucose in addition to glycerol. When a second copy of the wild type <italic>mdh</italic> gene was integrated into the <italic>att</italic>B site in the chromosome, we could easily isolate mutant strains with deletions in the original <italic>mdh</italic> gene demonstrating that this gene was essential for growth on both glucose and glycerol containing medium. The result indicates that either malic enzyme and/or pyruvate carboxylase are not active in Roisin's medium (at least in the direction pyruvate to acetate). To date, activity of these enzymes has not been demonstrated in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p>Rv1099c, a fructose 1, 6 bisphosphatase (<italic>glpX</italic>) was predicted as essential for gluconeogenesis by the GSMN but this was not confirmed experimentally by the TraSH analysis.

Why would <italic>mce1</italic> operon mutants be advantageous at slow, during the switch to from fast to slow growth rate and at fast growth rate but not for the switch from slow to fast growth rate? The common factor in these three conditions is a switch from a fast to a slower growth rate. This is still compatible with the finding that the mutants also had a growth advantage at fast growth rate in the chemostat since this experiment involved a shift from growing at maximal growth rate in batch to the fast growth rate in the chemostat (which is nevertheless slower than the rate in batch). To validate this result a <italic>M. tuberculosis mce1</italic> operon mutant was constructed (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">methods</xref>) and competitive chemostat experiments performed at the slow growth rate after an initial period in batch. The results of two independent experiments showed that although there was no difference in fitness between the wild type and mutant during batch culture (results not shown) the mutant had dramatic competitive advantage at slow growth rate in the chemostat as evidenced by the outgrowth of the <italic>mce1</italic> mutant from a starting mutant:WT ratio of 1 to a ratio of 100 after 35 days of continuous culture confirming the TraSH data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005349-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

If this hypothesis is correct then the underlying mechanism may be involved in the observed hypervirulent phenotype of the <italic>mce1</italic> knock out strain <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005349-Shimono1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> and could have implications for understanding the switch from acute to persistent infections in the host.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The data presented here demonstrate that maintaining growth at slow and fast growth rate and switching between these states is a carefully controlled process in mycobacteria involving a unique set of genes and not simply acceleration or deceleration of the same cellular processes. Several of these genes are transcriptional regulators (such as <italic>hspR</italic>) and many have previously been implicated as involved in virulence including persistence. The results indicate that growth control in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is a complex process and that the phenomenon of growth control, as measured in the chemostat, may have relevance to virulence (including persistence) in the host. Many of the genes that we identified as involved in growth control in the chemostat have not previously been associated with any phenotype <italic>in vitro</italic> and therefore the results potentially also provide a fruitful experimental route towards unraveling the role of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genes whose function is currently unknown. Perhaps the most surprising finding of this study was the demonstration that the <italic>mce1</italic> operon is involved in growth control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. This result is very interesting but begs the question: how does <italic>mce1</italic> influence growth? Whilst our experiments do not identify what this role is they do provide a means to study this phenomenon <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Chemostat cultivations</title><p>A library of transposon mutants constructed in <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG Pasteur was kindly provided by Eric J.
