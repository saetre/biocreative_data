Trafficking of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells into chronic reactive lymph nodes maintained resident DCs in a mature state and promoted naive T cell responses and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) to antigens administered in the absence of adjuvants. Antibodies to CD62P, which blocked CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cell migration into reactive lymph nodes, inhibited DC maturation, T cell priming, and induction of EAE.

In lymph nodes, immature DCs continually present tissue antigens to self-reactive naive T cells, leading to abortive T cell proliferation and establishment of T cell tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). In contrast, mature DCs present microbial antigens and typically induce robust effector and memory T cell responses. In the latter case, DC maturation is initiated by microbial products, endogenous danger signals, or signals delivered by antigen-activated T cells, primarily through CD40L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). It is generally believed that full-blown T cell immune responses are dependent on a combination of stimuli derived from microbial products, endogenous danger signals, and feedback from T cells that act in a temporally and spatially ordered fashion to induce DC maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). However, it has been shown in some experimental systems that the triggering of CD40, by CD40L expressed on antigen-activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells or by agonistic antibodies, is sufficient to license DCs for priming of naive T cells against antigens administered in the absence of adjuvant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>).</p><p>CD40L is a TNF family member that is rapidly up-regulated on antigen-activated T cells and released by activated platelets, and plays an important role in immune responses by regulating DC and B cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Several studies have reported that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> effector and memory T cells contain preformed CD40L in intracellular stores that can be rapidly mobilized to the cell surface after TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Interestingly, mouse naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells also constitutively express low amounts of CD40L, which appears to be sufficient to induce survival of autoreactive B cells in the absence of T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Whether circulating naive or memory T cells may influence the DC maturation state in peripheral tissues or lymph nodes through constitutive expression of CD40L remains to be established.</p><p>Under steady-state conditions, migration of naive T cells and central memory T (T<sub>CM</sub>) cells to peripheral lymph nodes is dependent on the expression of CD62L and CCR7, which mediate interaction with the cognate ligands peripheral node addressin (PNAd) and CCL21, respectively, expressed on high endothelial venules (HEVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Effector and effector memory T (T<sub>EM</sub>) cells, which lack CD62L and CCR7, are largely excluded from resting lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). However, we recently demonstrated that CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells, as well as CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NK cells, can efficiently migrate into lymph node draining sites of injection of mature DCs or adjuvants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). In reactive lymph nodes, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> and NK cells modulate ongoing responses by killing antigen-bearing DCs, thus limiting secondary immune responses, or by producing IFN-&#x003b3;, which enhances Th1 polarization. Recruitment of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> and NK cells is dependent on the expression of CXCR3 on migrating cells and coincides with a transient expression of its ligand, CXCL9, on HEVs of reactive lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we report that mouse CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells, but not naive T or T<sub>CM</sub> cells, constitutively expressed CD40L at levels sufficient to trigger phenotypic maturation of DCs and license them for priming of naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in vitro and in vivo. We also found that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells were largely excluded from resting lymph nodes but migrated in a CD62P-dependent fashion into reactive lymph nodes that were induced to express, in a transient (acute) or sustained (chronic) fashion, CD62P on HEVs. Strikingly, presentation of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptides by T<sub>EM</sub> cell&#x02013;licensed DCs in chronic reactive lymph nodes was sufficient to prime self-reactive T cells, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells constitutively express CD40L and trigger DC maturation</title><p>It has been recently reported that naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells constitutively express CD40L in amounts that are sufficient to promote autoreactive B cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). We asked whether constitutive expression of CD40L on naive and memory T cell subsets would be sufficient to induce DC maturation. To generate memory T cells, BALB/c mice were either immunized with KLH in CFA or were adoptively transferred with OVA-specific DO11.10 TCR transgenic naive T cells and immunized with OVA-pulsed mature DCs. At least 4 wk after immunization, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> naive T cells (CD44<sup>low</sup>, CD62L<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD127<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), T<sub>CM</sub> cells (CD44<sup>high</sup>, CD62L<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD127<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), and T<sub>EM</sub> cells (CD44<sup>high</sup>, CD62L<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD127<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) were isolated from spleens of BALB/c mice (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081212/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081212/DC1</ext-link>) and stained with antibodies to CD40L. Naive T and T<sub>CM</sub> cells isolated from KLH-immunized mice did not express detectable levels of surface CD40L (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>). In contrast, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells homogeneously expressed low amounts of surface CD40L, which was significantly higher compared with naive T and T<sub>CM</sub> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>). Upon in vitro stimulation with CD3 antibodies, CD40L expression increased in all three subsets, although in T<sub>EM</sub> cells the kinetics were more rapid and the plateau level was &#x0223c;10-fold higher than that reached by naive T or T<sub>CM</sub> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref>). CD40L was also expressed on DO11.10 T<sub>EM</sub> cells but not on DO11.10 naive or T<sub>CM</sub> cells (unpublished data). CD40L mRNA was found to be expressed in comparable amounts in T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> cells (unpublished data), suggesting that the difference in protein expression may be caused by differences in translation and/or storage. Consistent with this possibility, previous studies showed the presence of prestored CD40L in memory T cells of both human and mouse origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells constitutively express CD40L and promote DC maturation in vitro through CD40L&#x02013;CD40 interaction.</bold> (a) Surface expression of CD40L (black lines) in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T naive (CD44<sup>low</sup>CD62L<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD127<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), T<sub>CM</sub> (CD44<sup>high</sup>CD62L<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD127<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), and T<sub>EM</sub> (CD44<sup>high</sup>CD62L<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD127<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) cells.

Hemagglutinin (HA) peptide&#x02013;pulsed immature DCs were cultured with CFSE-labeled HA-specific 6.5 TCR transgenic CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> naive T cells alone or together with naive T, T<sub>CM</sub>, and T<sub>EM</sub> cells specific for a different antigen (DO11.10 TCR transgenic T cells recognizing OVA). HA-specific naive T cells did not proliferate when stimulated with HA-pulsed immature DCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>), consistent with the notion that immature DCs have poor co-stimulatory capacity and fail to prime naive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). However, these cells proliferated vigorously and differentiated to IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing effector T cells when stimulated with immature DCs in the presence of OVA-specific T<sub>EM</sub> cells but not naive T or T<sub>CM</sub> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref> and not depicted). Similarly, CFSE-labeled OVA-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> naive T cells proliferated in response to OVA-pulsed immature DCs when cultured with polyclonal CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells but not naive T or T<sub>CM</sub> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 b</xref>).

The results of these in vitro experiments indicate that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells can license immature DCs for priming of naive T cells in an antigen-independent and CD40-dependent fashion, and raise the question of whether CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells might induce DC maturation in vivo.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>CD40L<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells license DCs for T cell priming in vitro.</bold> (a) Proliferation of CFSE-labeled HA-specific 6.5 transgenic naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells cultured with 50 &#x003bc;M HA<sub>110-119</sub>&#x02013;pulsed syngeneic immature DCs in the absence or presence of ex vivo&#x02013;isolated OVA-specific DO11.10 transgenic CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T naive, T<sub>CM</sub>, or T<sub>EM</sub> cells.

However, it is increasingly recognized that lymph nodes undergoing an immune response show an increased cellularity and become capable of recruiting CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> and NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Recruitment of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> and NK cells is dependent on expression of CXCR3 on migrating cells and coincides with a transient expression of its ligand, CXCL9, on HEVs of reactive lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). To investigate whether CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells would be also recruited to reactive lymph nodes, we injected i.v. in vivo&#x02013;generated OVA-specific memory T cells, comprising both T<sub>CM</sub> (CD127<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD62L<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and T<sub>EM</sub> (CD127<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD62L<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) cells, into syngeneic mice and measured their migration into a reactive lymph node, which had been induced by s.c. injection of LPS-matured DCs, and into a resting lymph node as control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 a</xref>). As expected, T<sub>CM</sub> cells, which represented a minor fraction of the transferred cell population, were highly enriched in resting lymph nodes, accounting for up to 90% of the recruited cells. In contrast, T<sub>EM</sub> cells were virtually excluded from resting lymph nodes but efficiently migrated into reactive lymph nodes, where they accounted for up to 85% of the migrated cells, a figure similar to that found in the spleen and inflamed peritoneum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 a</xref>).

Reactive lymph nodes were induced by s.c. injection of either LPS-matured DCs or adjuvants. After 2 or 30 d, mice were injected i.v. with fluorescinated antibodies to CD62P to stain the luminal side of HEVs. Reactive and resting lymph nodes were collected and examined by immunohistology after counterstaining with PNAd antibodies to identify HEVs. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 a</xref>, CD62P was not expressed on the HEVs of resting lymph nodes. After a single injection of mature DCs (DC 1&#x000d7;), CD62P was readily detected on day 2, persisted for &#x0223c;6 d, and was no longer detectable on day 30 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 a</xref> and not depicted).

The different staining patterns of CD62P and PNAd on HEVs may be caused by differences in cellular localization or by technical reasons, because antibodies to CD62P were injected i.v., whereas anti-PNAd antibodies were added on tissue sections.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of CD62P on HEVs of reactive lymph nodes correlates with increased lymph node cellularity and selective increase of T<sub>EM</sub> cell recruitment.</bold> (a) Reactive lymph nodes were induced by one or two consecutive (2 d apart) injections of 10<sup>6</sup> LPS-matured DCs (DC 1&#x000d7; and DC 2&#x000d7;, respectively).

Within a few hours after antibody injection, the number of T<sub>EM</sub> cells in reactive lymph nodes decreased substantially (Fig. S3 b), indicating that T<sub>EM</sub> cells continually recirculate from blood to lymph node and from there to efferent lymph. We conclude that expression of CD62P on the luminal side of HEVs of reactive lymph nodes can be induced in a transient or sustained fashion depending on the nature of the eliciting stimulus, and coincides with increased lymph node cellularity, which was caused by a uniform increase of all major cell subsets and a much higher increase of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells.</p><p>We also investigated the role of T cells in induction and maintenance of reactive lymph nodes.

Remarkably, injection of MOG peptide in PBS in mice carrying a reactive lymph node, which had been induced by injection of either CFA or mature DCs 1 mo earlier, led to the development of clinical symptoms and T cell infiltrates that were comparable in severity and extent to those induced by the administration of MOG in CFA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, c and d</xref>). Pretreatment of mice with anti-CD62P antibodies did not interfere with EAE induced by immunization with MOG peptide in CFA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 a</xref>), consistent with the fact that CD62P is not required for migration of effector T cells into the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>).

In reactive lymph nodes, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells trigger maturation of DCs in an antigen-independent fashion via constitutively expressed CD40L and license them for T cell priming against antigens, including self-antigens, administered in the absence of exogenous adjuvants.</p><p>We previously reported that, after s.c. injection of adjuvants or mature DCs, draining lymph nodes become capable of attracting leukocytes, such as CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> and NK cells, that are largely excluded from resting lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Entry of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> and NK cells requires expression of CXCR3 on migrating cells and coincides with expression of the cognate chemokines on HEVs of reactive lymph nodes. Although the ligand for CD62P is expressed on CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> effector T cells, this adhesion molecule is not required for homing of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to reactive lymph nodes, as demonstrated by experiments using specific blocking antibodies (unpublished data). The present study shows that migration of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells into reactive lymph nodes occurs through a different mechanism independent of CXCR3 and dependent on CD62P. This conclusion is based on the findings that wild-type and CXCR3-deficient CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells showed a comparable capacity to migrate into reactive lymph nodes, and that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cell migration was not observed in mice lacking CD62P/E and could be inhibited by antibodies against CD62P but not CD62E. In addition, migration of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells in lymph nodes coincides with expression of CD62P on HEVs that was induced, in an acute or chronic fashion, by adjuvants or mature DCs. Interestingly, chronic reactive lymph nodes did not appear to efficiently recruit cytotoxic CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells as acute lymph nodes do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), indicating that entry of these cells is restricted to the early phases of an immune response.</p><p>A recent study demonstrated that antigen-primed lymph nodes contain a resident population of antigen-specific CXCR5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> follicular helper T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). In contrast to follicular helper T cells, the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells described in this paper continually recirculate through the reactive lymph nodes because they disappeared rapidly when entry was blocked by injection of CD62P antibodies. It remains to be established which lymphocyte integrin is involved in this process and whether chemokine-dependent activation of integrins is required, because the high amounts of LFA-1 and &#x003b1;4-integrins expressed on memory T cells may promote efficient adhesion of rolling cells even in the absence of chemokine signaling. In addition, one should consider the possibility that CD62P-expressing platelets adhering to HEVs may facilitate extravasation of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells, as it has been suggested to allow for CD62P-dependent homing of CD62L-deficient leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>).</p><p>CD62P expression is known to be induced on the endothelial cells of inflamed peripheral tissues and to regulate recruitment of effector cells of the innate and adaptive immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Previous studies have shown that under conditions of intravital microscopy (but not in situ), CD62P can be expressed on HEVs of Peyer's patches and subiliac lymph nodes and can account for residual migration of leukocytes in the absence of CD62L or &#x003b2;7-integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). CD62P was also reported to be expressed at low levels on HEVs in the course of experimental mouse listeriosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Our results show for the first time that CD62P is induced in peripheral lymph node HEVs by s.c. injection of adjuvants or mature DCs and that it can mediate migration of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells. Intriguingly, CD62P expression on HEVs can be acute or chronic, depending on the nature of the eliciting stimuli. Although soluble TLR agonists (LPS, CpG, and R848) or a single injection of mature DCs induced a transient expression of CD62P (up to day 6), a single injection of CFA or two consecutive injections, 2 d apart, of mature DCs led to an up-regulation of CD62P that was sustained for &#x0003e;60 d. Importantly, the persistence of CD62P on HEVs correlates with increased lymph node cellularity, recruitment of T<sub>EM</sub> cells, and increased immunostimulatory capacity of lymph node&#x02013;resident DCs. Although the effect of CFA may be explained by a sustained release of microbial products from a tissue depot, it remains to be established how two injections of mature DCs, which are known to be short lived, may induce a long-lasting change in the draining lymph node in the apparent absence of residual antigen, as shown by the finding that 30 d after injection of OVA-pulsed DCs, CFSE-labeled OVA-specific T cells failed to proliferate (unpublished data).</p><p>We have provided evidence that T cells may be required for maintenance of chronic reactive lymph nodes. Indeed, although the initial increase of cell number in lymph nodes stimulated by adjuvants or mature DCs can be induced in T cell&#x02013;deficient CD3&#x003b5;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the sustained increase in lymph node cellularity is dependent on the presence of T cells. The findings that antibodies to CD62P prevented migration of T<sub>EM</sub> cells and increased lymph node cellularity would be consistent with a role for these cells in the development of chronic reactive lymph nodes. However, at this point we cannot rule out the possibility that cells other than T<sub>EM</sub> cells requiring CD62P to enter lymph node might also be involved. In addition, it is possible that other changes besides sustained expression of CD62P may take place in reactive lymph nodes. For instance, innate stimuli have been shown to promote remodeling of the primary feed arteriole, leading to an increase in lymphocyte input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that, once the inducing stimulus has reached a sufficient threshold, the reactive state of the lymph node may be maintained by irreversible structural changes or by continuous recruitment of T<sub>EM</sub> and/or innate immune cells.</p><p>Another major finding of this study is that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells constitutively express CD40L at levels sufficient to trigger DC maturation and to license them for T cell priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Constitutive CD40L expression was significantly higher in T<sub>EM</sub> cells as compared with naive or T<sub>CM</sub> cells, and only T<sub>EM</sub> cells, but not naive or T<sub>CM</sub> cells, triggered DC maturation and promoted T cell priming in vitro in an antigen-independent and CD40-dependent fashion. Importantly, this effect was also observed in vivo. DCs in chronic reactive lymph nodes, exposed to recirculating CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells, homogeneously expressed high levels of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules and were able to trigger naive T cell proliferation in response to antigens administered in the absence of adjuvants. The critical role of T<sub>EM</sub> cells was demonstrated by the fact that injection of CD62P antibodies, which blocked T<sub>EM</sub> cell migration into reactive lymph nodes, inhibited both DC maturation and T cell priming. The efficiency of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells in inducing DC maturation may rely on the anatomy of the lymph node, which places extravasating T<sub>EM</sub> cells in direct contact with DCs, and on the high numbers and motility of T<sub>EM</sub> cells, and hence, their ability to interact with multiple DCs in a serial fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Although our results indicate that DC maturation and licensing is selectively induced by T<sub>EM</sub> cells but not by naive or T<sub>CM</sub> cells, we cannot rule out the possibility that constitutive expression of CD40L on the latter may contribute to DC survival and function. Indeed, CD40L on mouse naive T cells has been shown to be sufficient to promote survival of autoreactive B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><p>Microbial products have been shown to be required to break tolerance to tissue antigens, leading to autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). In addition, LPS may activate autoreactive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in a bystander fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Based on our findings, we hypothesized that the DC licensing effect exerted by CD40L<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells trafficking into reactive lymph nodes may facilitate immune responses to poorly immunogenic antigens, such as tissue antigens, in the apparent absence of microbial products. This possibility was demonstrated by the finding that EAE could be induced by injection of a MOG peptide at a site draining into the chronic reactive lymph node accessible to circulating antigen-nonspecific T<sub>EM</sub> cells. Although endogenous danger signals, such as ATP or uric acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), may play a synergistic role in the priming of autoreactive T cells, the finding that the mere exclusion of T<sub>EM</sub> cells form the reactive lymph nodes by CD62P antibody treatment was sufficient to prevent immunopathology points to T<sub>EM</sub> cells as the primary inducing factor in eliciting this pathogenic response. Although it is premature to envisage a role for CD40L constitutively expressed on CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells in induction of autoimmune diseases, it is of note that increased levels of CD40L-expressing effector and memory T cells have been observed in autoimmune-prone mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) and in human memory T cells of patients with multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>), and targeting the CD40&#x02013;CD40L interaction has been proposed as a treatment for autoimmune diseases or to induce allograft tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). In addition, activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells have been shown to prime and expand endogenous autoreactive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in an antigen-dependent or -independent fashion through the licensing of DCs via CD40L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). We found that clinical symptoms and the extent of T cell infiltration were comparable in mice immunized with MOG in CFA or with soluble MOG draining into a reactive lymph node. It remains to be established whether these distinctive priming environments generate a comparable spectrum of polarized effector T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides evidence for a mechanistic link between changes in cell traffic in lymph nodes and predisposition to mount effector responses to otherwise nonimmunogenic antigens. We are currently testing the possibility that induction of chronic reactive lymph nodes at sites that drain tumor antigens may facilitate priming of effector T cells against the tumor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>C57BL/6 (H-2<sup>b</sup>) and BALB/c (H-2<sup>d</sup>) mice were purchased from Harlan.
