We previously identified GIV/Girdin as a G&#x003b1;i3 binding partner. We demonstrate that in mammalian cells G&#x003b1;i3 controls the functions of GIV during cell migration. We find that G&#x003b1;i3 preferentially localizes to the leading edge and that cells lacking G&#x003b1;i3 fail to polarize or migrate. A conformational change induced by association of GIV with G&#x003b1;i3 promotes Akt-mediated phosphorylation of GIV, resulting in its redistribution to the plasma membrane. Activation of G&#x003b1;i3 serves as a molecular switch that triggers dissociation of G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; and GIV from the Gi3&#x02013;GIV complex, thereby promoting cell migration by enhancing Akt signaling and actin remodeling. G&#x003b1;i3&#x02013;GIV coupling is essential for cell migration during wound healing, macrophage chemotaxis, and tumor cell migration, indicating that the G&#x003b1;i3&#x02013;GIV switch serves to link direction sensing from different families of chemotactic receptors to formation of the leading edge during cell migration.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>P.

During migration, signals from the exterior are relayed to the cell interior via surface receptors to initiate events necessary for efficient directional motility. The most extensively studied chemotactic receptors in the context of cell migration are the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) studied in fibroblasts and epithelial cells and G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors (GPCRs) extensively studied in leukocytes and <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Van Haastert and Devreotes, 2004</xref>). Regardless of which receptor system is involved in sensing chemotactic stimuli, they signal via a conserved pathway that culminates in the activation and enhancement of Akt/PKB through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) at the leading edge of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Merlot and Firtel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Van Haastert and Devreotes, 2004</xref>). Once the Akt signal is adequately enhanced, cells &#x0201c;polarize&#x0201d; and reposition their Golgi apparatus and microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in front of the nucleus and form the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ridley et al., 2003</xref>) oriented toward the direction of the chemotactic stimulus.</p><p>GIV (G&#x003b1;-interacting vesicle-associated protein) was discovered based on its ability to bind G&#x003b1;i3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le-Niculescu et al., 2005</xref>). Simultaneous work from other groups proposed distinct roles for GIV in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Simpson et al., 2005</xref>) and in regulating cell migration via its interaction with Akt, actin, and PI4P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>). Of particular interest is the fact that GIV is localized at the crossroads of two major signaling pathways, as it is able to interact with &#x003b1;-subunits of G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le-Niculescu et al., 2005</xref>) and enhance PI3K-Akt activity upon RTK stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anai et al., 2005</xref>). Although RTKs and G&#x003b2;&#x003b3;-subunits are known to directly increase PI3K activity and subsequently activate Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stephens et al., 1997</xref>), the role of G&#x003b1;-subunits in this process has remained unclear. We set out to define the role of G&#x003b1;-subunits and the significance of its interaction with GIV during cell migration and to understand how G&#x003b1;-subunits and GIV link cell surface receptors to downstream signaling events.</p><p>In this paper, we show that G&#x003b1;i3 regulates GIV's functions during cell migration. We provide mechanistic insights into how activation of the G protein dictates the formation of the leading edge in a chemotaxing cell by coupling direction sensing through cell surface receptors to Akt enhancement and actin remodeling via GIV.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>G&#x003b1;i3 is necessary for cell migration</title><p>Both GIV and G&#x003b1;i3 are localized on Golgi membranes and the plasma membrane (PM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stow et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denker et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le-Niculescu et al., 2005</xref>). We reported previously that GIV is predominantly on vesicles near the Golgi during quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le-Niculescu et al., 2005</xref>), and others reported that during cell migration it accumulates at the leading edge where it interacts with Akt and participates in actin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>). Because key participants in cell migration (GIV, PI3K, Akt, and actin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Merlot and Firtel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>) are enriched at the leading edge, we asked if G&#x003b1;i3 behaves similarly. We subjected confluent monolayers of HeLa cells to scratch wounding to induce unidirectional cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kupfer et al., 1982</xref>) and examined the distribution of endogenous G&#x003b1;i3 by immunofluorescence (IF). In quiescent cells far from the wound, G&#x003b1;i3 showed a predominant Golgi localization based on colocalization with a Golgi marker, &#x003b2;1-4 galactosyltransferase (&#x003b2;-GALT; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A, a&#x02013;c</xref>), and was almost undetectable at the cell periphery marked by actin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A, d&#x02013;f</xref>). In contrast, migrating cells at the edge of the wound showed peripheral G&#x003b1;i3-stained puncta within lamellipodial extensions. Some of these puncta colocalized with actin at the leading edge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A, g&#x02013;j</xref>). Thus, G&#x003b1;i3 showed different distributions depending on the migratory state of the cell.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>G&#x003b1;i3 redistributes to the cell periphery during cell migration and is necessary for cell migration.</bold> (A) Distribution of G&#x003b1;i3 in quiescent (a&#x02013;f) versus migrating (g&#x02013;j) HeLa cells after scratch wounding. In quiescent cells, endogenous G&#x003b1;i3 colocalizes with &#x003b2;GalT in the Golgi (a&#x02013;c) but not actin (d&#x02013;f). In migrating cells, G&#x003b1;i3 is found in puncta that partially colocalize with actin at the leading edge (g&#x02013;i). Arrows denote direction of migration. Boxed area in i is enlarged in j.

Repletion of hG&#x003b1;i3 by rat G&#x003b1;i3 (i and j), but not vector alone (k and l), restores this defect. HeLa cells treated as indicated were subjected to scratch wounding and examined immediately after wounding (0 h) or 16 h later (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5).

Depleting G&#x003b1;i3 (&#x0223c;95%) delayed wound healing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B, g and h</xref>), whereas controls closed the wound as expected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B, a and b</xref>).

Previously, we demonstrated that rG&#x003b1;i3-YFP localizes largely to the Golgi and behaves similarly to endogenous G&#x003b1;i3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weiss et al., 2001</xref>). During migration, G&#x003b1;i3-YFP localized preferentially within pseudopods at the leading edge as manifest by the transient &#x0201c;blush&#x0201d; of fluorescent signal within these microdomains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and Video 2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712066/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712066/DC1</ext-link>). This blush most likely reflects the transient localization of G&#x003b1;i3-stained puncta (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A, j</xref>) that are not resolved by the optical conditions used for live cell imaging (see Materials and methods). Because G&#x003b1;i3 is membrane anchored, membrane redundancy at the sites of pseudopod formation could lead to nonspecific accumulation of membrane-anchored proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Servant et al., 1999</xref>). However, myristoyl-palmitoyl&#x02013;modified YFP (mp-YFP), which has the same modifications as G&#x003b1;i3-YFP and was previously characterized as a general membrane marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zacharias et al., 2002</xref>), showed patchy distribution along the entire PM and other membranous compartments without any preference for the leading edge during polarized migration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref> and Video 3).

To distinguish whether G&#x003b1;i3 and GIV function in a common pathway or in independent parallel pathways mediating enhancement of Akt signaling, we investigated the effect of silencing both proteins. Silencing of G&#x003b1;i3 or GIV alone reduced Akt activation by &#x0223c;60 and 80%, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>).

Interestingly, S1416 lies within the G binding domain of GIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le-Niculescu et al., 2005</xref>), raising the question of whether the G&#x003b1;i3&#x02013;GIV interaction modulates ser/thr phosphorylation of GIV. We found that in G&#x003b1;i3-depleted cells GIV was poorly phosphorylated compared with controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Repletion of G&#x003b1;i3 with rG&#x003b1;i3wt restored phosphorylation of GIV to control levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). To determine if the G&#x003b1;i3&#x02013;GIV interaction enhanced or interfered with Akt mediated phosphorylation of GIV on S1416, we performed in vitro phosphorylation reactions with immunopurified GIV, GST-G&#x003b1;i3, and recombinant Akt. Because Akt phosphorylates immunopurified GIV at a single site, i.e., S1416 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>), p-ser/thr antibody was used to estimate the amount of phosphorylation that occurred. We found that preincubation of GIV with GST-G&#x003b1;i3G203A, the inactive mutant that binds GIV most avidly, increased the phosphorylation of GIV &#x0223c;2.5 fold (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>, lane 6), whereas GST-G&#x003b1;i3Q204L and GST-G&#x003b1;i3wt were not significantly different (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>, lanes 4 and 5).

Without G&#x003b1;i3, Akt amplification downstream of both RTK and GPCR failed to occur, actin remodeling was inhibited, and cells failed to undergo polarized migration after scratch wounding. We also showed that G&#x003b1;i3 localizes preferentially within pseudopods at the leading edge and that activation of G&#x003b1;i3 is essential for migration. Collectively, these results support a working model (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>) of how the switch operates in few key steps: inactive Gi3 heterotrimer interacts avidly with GIV and induces a change in the conformation of GIV. Upon a chemotactic stimulus (when Akt signaling is initiated) the G&#x003b1;i3-bound conformation of GIV facilitates phosphorylation of GIV at a critical Ser residue that is necessary for its functions at the leading edge. Subsequently, activation of G&#x003b1;i3 triggers dissociation of the Gi3-GIV macromolecular complex releasing G&#x003b2;&#x003b3;-subunits and GIV simultaneously. Released G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; participates in localized PI3K-Akt activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lilly and Devreotes, 1995</xref>), and released GIV amplifies and propagates this Akt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Postma et al., 2004</xref>). Amplification of cellular Akt activity via sequential coupling and uncoupling of G&#x003b1;i3 and GIV is likely to set up a positive feedback loop that mediates phosphorylation of further GIV molecules to remodel actin and form the leading edge. In this feedback loop, G proteins are presumably directly activated by GPCRs or indirectly transactivated via RTKs.</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Working model.</bold> (1) GIV preferentially and avidly binds to inactive GDP-bound G&#x003b1;i3. Interaction with G&#x003b1;i3 induces a change in conformation of GIV (dotted arrow). In a quiescent cell, this step is likely to occur predominantly on vesicles near the Golgi where G&#x003b1;i3 and GIV were previously shown to colocalize. (2) Upon a chemotactic stimulus, Akt signaling is initiated and results in phosphorylation of GIV at S1416. This critical phosphorylation step is facilitated by the favorable conformation of GIV induced by direct interaction with G&#x003b1;i3. Phosphorylation at S1416 was previously shown to be necessary for GIV's functions during cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>). (3) Upon phosphorylation, GIV continues to preferentially and avidly bind to G&#x003b1;i3; however, it selectively loses its affinity for PI4P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>), a phosphoinositide that is enriched in the Golgi, and redistributes from Golgi membranes to the peripheral actin bed near the PM. (4) Activation of G&#x003b1;i3 occurs, likely downstream of ligand occupied receptors, and is the key event that mediates simultaneous dissociation of G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; and GIV from the Gi3&#x02013;GIV complexes. (5) Released G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; activates PI3K-dependent Akt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lilly and Devreotes, 1995</xref>). (6) Released phospho-GIV enhances the initial Akt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anai et al., 2005</xref>), remodels actin, and promotes migration. (7) This second phase of Akt signal enhancement is critical for formation of the leading edge during polarized cell migration. Cyclical activation and inactivation of G&#x003b1;i in vivo thus contributes to progressive Akt enhancement, which promotes further cycles of GIV phosphorylation (8 and 2), redistribution of phosphorylated GIV from Golgi to PM/actin (3), and subsequent release from the Gi3&#x02013;GIV complexes upon activation of G&#x003b1;i3 (4). This contributes to the previously observed accumulation of phosphorylated GIV at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>) where GIV rapidly remodels actin to generate pseudopods.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820381f09"></graphic></fig><p>G&#x003b1;i3 and GIV directly interact with each other and share dual localizations on the Golgi and the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le-Niculescu et al., 2005</xref>). Our results provide clues as to where in the cell this sequential G&#x003b1;i3&#x02013;GIV molecular coupling might occur. In quiescent cells, G&#x003b1;i3 was predominantly found on the Golgi where it partially colocalizes with GIV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), and in migrating cells, G&#x003b1;i3 redistributes to the cell periphery and is concentrated in pseudopods at the leading edge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1 A and 2 A</xref>) where phosphorylated GIV accumulates during migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, we showed that depletion of G&#x003b1;i3 leads to accumulation of GIV on Golgi membranes and impairs phosphorylation of GIV at S1416. Previously, phosphorylation of GIV at S1416 by Akt has been demonstrated to specifically result in abolishing GIV's affinity toward PI4P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>), a lipid known to be enriched in Golgi membranes. Based on these findings, we postulate that GIV phosphorylation at S1416, which is facilitated by the G&#x003b1;i3&#x02013;GIV interaction, mediates the redistribution of GIV from the Golgi to the cell periphery. Mobilization of this internal pool of G&#x003b1;i3-bound GIV to the cell periphery sets the stage for G protein activation and subsequent release of phosphorylated GIV.</p></sec><sec><title>G&#x003b1;i3, a state-dependent molecular switch for cell migration</title><p>Because the active Q204L, but not the inactive G203A, G&#x003b1;i3 mutant reversed the phenotype of G&#x003b1;i3-depleted cells, activation of the G protein emerges as the key event in its functioning as a molecular switch. In the absence of G&#x003b1;i3 or after expression of inactive G&#x003b1;i3, Akt signaling does not occur (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4 A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5 B</xref>), indicating that the most significant and direct downstream consequence of G&#x003b1;i3 activation is Akt enhancement. As a consequence of this failure to enhance Akt signaling, phosphorylation of GIV on S1416, redistribution of GIV to the cell periphery, actin remodeling, and cell migration failed to occur (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Because activation of G&#x003b1;i3 was necessary for migration, it came as a surprise that in in vitro binding assays the inactive G protein binds GIV &#x0223c;10&#x02013;15-fold more than the active mutant. Collectively, our results suggest that the weaker interaction between the active G&#x003b1;i3 mutant and GIV is sufficient to facilitate targeting, phosphorylation, and the functions of GIV in vivo. Conversely, our finding that a strong interaction between the inactive G protein and GIV has an overall inhibitory effect on GIV's functions indicates that reversible coupling is essential for normal functioning of the switch. We conclude that the G&#x003b1;i3-GIV association constitutes an &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; switch that is regulated by cyclical G protein activation and is essential for phosphorylation, targeting, and subsequent release of GIV during cell migration.</p></sec><sec><title>G&#x003b1;i3 regulates phosphorylation of GIV</title><p>We show here that the G&#x003b1;i3&#x02013;GIV association is required for phosphorylation of GIV at S1416 by Akt. Phosphorylation of GIV at this site was previously demonstrated to play a critical role in cell migration, but the mechanism was unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>). We provide evidence that GIV undergoes a change in conformation when bound to G&#x003b1;i3. It is noteworthy that the Akt binding site on GIV (extreme C terminus) is separated from S1416 (which lies within the G binding domain) by &#x0223c;300 aa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anai et al., 2005</xref>). We speculate that a major molecular rearrangement occurs when GIV binds G&#x003b1;i3 to bring Akt bound to the carboxyl terminus closer to S1416 in the G binding domain and, thus, facilitates its phosphorylation. We also show that activation of G&#x003b1;i3 rather than phosphorylation of GIV is the key trigger for dissociation of GIV from the G&#x003b1;i&#x02013;GIV complex.</p><p>In the context of when these events take place, our results provide evidence that the cycling of G protein between active and inactive states ensures that phosphorylation of G&#x003b1;i3-bound GIV precedes its subsequent release from the complex. In a highly polarized chemotaxing cell, this is likely to occur on the PM at the leading edge where there is a concentration of ligand-occupied receptors, activated Akt, and activated G&#x003b1;i3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ridley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Van Haastert and Devreotes, 2004</xref>). Thus, the G protein molecular switch contributes to the spatial bias in accumulation of phosphorylated GIV that was previously demonstrated to occur selectively at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>G&#x003b1;i3 dictates formation of the leading edge by simultaneous release of G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; and phosphorylated GIV</title><p>We found that G&#x003b1;i3 through its interaction with GIV is required for Akt enhancement and actin remodeling during scratch wound&#x02013;induced migration in epithelial cells and for rapid chemotaxis in macrophages.

It is well established that to form a leading edge and migrate, cells must display biphasic Akt activation in response to a chemotactic stimulus in that a brief early phase of generalized Akt activation is followed by an enhanced and prolonged phase. The second phase of enhancement creates a steep PI3K-Akt signaling gradient that is restricted to the stretch of PM destined to form the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Postma et al., 2004</xref>).

Our observation of preferential accumulation of G&#x003b1;i3 together with the localization of phospho-GIV at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>) sets the stage for sequential signal amplification by placing the G&#x003b1;-subunit in the immediate vicinity of the ligand-occupied receptors that can activate G proteins. Activation of G&#x003b1;i3 accounts for a major part of Akt signaling (&#x0223c;60% of the peak Akt activity upon insulin/EGF stimulation) via regulation of GIV, indicating that although G&#x003b2;&#x003b3;-subunits initiate Akt signaling through activation of PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lilly and Devreotes, 1995</xref>), accumulation of simultaneously released phosphorylated GIV is essential for localized enhancement of Akt at the leading edge via the PI3K&#x02013;Akt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xiao et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, our work provides mechanistic insights into how activation of G&#x003b1;i3 links direction sensing to GIV-mediated PI3K&#x02013;Akt enhancement and actin remodeling at the leading edge.</p></sec><sec><title>G&#x003b1;i3 is required for centrosome repositioning during migration</title><p>We found that both G&#x003b1;i3 and GIV are localized on centrosomes and are necessary for polarized migration, whereas G&#x003b1;i3, but not GIV, is required for repositioning the MTOC/centrosome. In contrast, GIV is required for polarized migration but is not essential for centrosome repositioning. This is in keeping with the fact that asymmetrical extension of lamellipodia and centrosome repositioning are not necessarily coupled during polarized migration of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Euteneuer and Schliwa, 1992</xref>). Our results suggest a distinct hierarchy within the G&#x003b1;i3&#x02013;GIV regulatory complex, in which G&#x003b1;i3 regulates additional steps during cell migration besides those performed by GIV. The role of centrosomal GIV could be to nucleate microtubule tracks to the leading edge because, like other members of the Hook family, GIV can bind to microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Simpson et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Direction sensing via different chemotactic receptors converge upon G&#x003b1;i3 and GIV</title><p>GIV has been implicated in RTK-stimulated migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>), and Gi is well known to be important for GPCR-stimulated chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thelen, 2001</xref>).

Similarly, we have shown that upon direct stimulation with RTK ligands (insulin and EGF), activation of G&#x003b1;i3 is required to elicit a full response in terms of Akt activation, suggesting that prominent transactivation of G proteins takes place. Additionally, we provide evidence supporting the necessity for GIV during GPCR-stimulated Akt signaling or chemotaxis. Although indirect stimulation of some RTKs by GPCR&#x02013;G protein&#x02013;dependent intermediates is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luttrell et al., 1999</xref>), there is little mechanistic insight into how RTK stimulation might directly signal via G proteins to activate Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Waters et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhanasekaran, 2006</xref>). In this paper, we show that in epithelial cells during wound healing, chemotaxing macrophages, and tumor cells, the state-dependent interaction between G&#x003b1;i3 and GIV is essential, and upon depletion of either of these proteins the critical step of amplification of Akt signaling is abrogated.</p><p>We conclude that regardless of how the chemotactic signal is propagated from the cell surface to initiate Akt signaling, the common theme is the requirement of G&#x003b1;i3 activation and GIV to promote cell migration. Although we cannot rule out that different biochemical events may occur depending on whether GPCRs or RTKs are activated, it is tempting to speculate that molecular coupling between G&#x003b1;i3 and GIV could serve as a novel platform for receptor cross talk and that together they could be the long-sought missing link between chemotactic receptors and signal amplification.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and cell culture media were purchased from Invitrogen.

The reaction was initiated by adding 50 &#x003bc;M ATP and 1,000 mU human recombinant activated Akt1 (EMD) and terminated by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Trypsin digestion was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghosh and Kornfeld, 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>IF</title><p>All the steps for IF were performed at room temperature as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zheng et al., 2004</xref>). In brief, cells were fixed with 3% PFA for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 45 min, and incubated for 1 h with primary and secondary antibodies. Antibody dilutions were as follows: affinity purified anti-GIV, 1:10; anti-G&#x003b1;i3 (EMD), 1:30; anti-V5 (Invitrogen), 1:200; anti-ManII, 1:500; anti-pericentrin, 1:1,000; anti&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1:500; anti-&#x003b2;GALT, 1:20; Phalloidin-Texas Red, 1:1,000; secondary Alexa-conjugated antibodies, 1:500; and DAPI, 1:2,000 (Invitrogen). To visualize endogenous GIV or G&#x003b1;i3, cells were permeabilized with 0.05% (weight/vol) saponin and 0.2 mg/ml BSA in PBS for 1 min before fixation. Images were acquired with a microscope (Axioimager M1; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using a 100&#x000d7; aperture (Plan Neofluar; 1.3 NA), camera (Orca ER; Hamamatsu Photonics), and Openlab software (Improvision). For the centrosome repositioning assay, HeLa-C1 monolayers were scratch wounded, and 8&#x02013;10 h after wounding the number of cells with centrosomal (GFP-centrin) and Golgi (ManII) positioning within the 120&#x000b0; sector facing the wound were counted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kupfer et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grande-Garcia et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>For centrosomal localization studies, wide-field microscopy was performed using the 100&#x000d7; 1.3 N.A Neofluor oil immersion objective lenses on an inverted microscope (IX-70 DeltaVision Restoration; Olympus).

Optical sections were collected at 0.2-&#x003bc;m intervals along the apical&#x02013;basal axis. Applied Precision software (DeltaVision) was used to deconvolve z-section series of images. All individual images were processed using Image J software and assembled for presentation using Photoshop and Illustrator software (both Adobe).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Proteins samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with PBS supplemented with 5% nonfat milk and then incubated sequentially with primary and secondary antibodies. Infrared imaging with two-color detection and quantification of Western blots was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols using an Odyssey imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences). When anti-phosphoprotein antibodies (anti-pSer/Thr or anti-pAkt) were used, nonfat milk was replaced by BSA throughout the process. The dilution of the primary antibodies was as follows: anti-GIV serum, 1:500; anti-G&#x003b1;i3, 1:200; anti-G&#x003b1;s, 1:250; anti-actin, 1:2,000; anti-Akt total, 1:250; anti-pAkt, 1:250; anti-pSer, 1:250; anti-G&#x003b1;, 1:200.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Experiments were repeated at least three times and results are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SEM.

Fig. S2 shows that depletion of G&#x003b1;i3 impairs EGF-stimulated Akt activation. Fig. S3 shows that insulin-stimulated actin remodeling is inhibited in G&#x003b1;i3-depleted cells. Fig. S4 shows that GIV is occasionally distributed along actin stress fibers in epithelial cells. Fig. S5 shows that activation status of the G protein, and not phosphorylation of GIV at S1416, regulates the G&#x003b1;i3&#x02013;GIV interaction. Video 1 shows that HeLa cells expressing rG&#x003b1;i3-YFP demonstrate directional migration toward the wound whereas G&#x003b1;i3-depleted cells show random motility. Video 2 shows that G&#x003b1;i3-YFP preferentially localizes within pseudopods at the leading edge of a migrating HeLa cell. Video 3 shows that mp-YFP is distributed along the PM during polarized cell migration, with no preference for the leading edge.
