FOXP3 is an essential transcription factor for natural, thymus-derived (nT<sub>reg</sub>) and inducible T<sub>reg</sub> (iT<sub>reg</sub>) commitment; however, the mechanisms regulating its expression are as yet unknown. We describe a mechanism controlling iT<sub>reg</sub> polarization, which is overruled by the Th2 differentiation pathway. We demonstrated that interleukin 4 (IL-4) present at the time of T cell priming inhibits FOXP3. This inhibitory mechanism was also confirmed in Th2 cells and in T cells of transgenic mice overexpressing GATA-3 in T cells, which are shown to be deficient in transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated FOXP3 induction. This inhibition is mediated by direct binding of GATA3 to the FOXP3 promoter, which represses its transactivation process. Therefore, this study provides a new understanding of tolerance development, controlled by a type 2 immune response. IL-4 treatment in mice reduces iT<sub>reg</sub> cell frequency, highlighting that therapeutic approaches that target IL-4 or GATA3 might provide new preventive strategies facilitating tolerance induction particularly in Th2-mediated diseases, such as allergy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Specific immune responses against foreign or autologous antigens are driven by specialized epitope-specific T cells, whose numbers expand upon recognition of antigen found on professional antigen-presenting cells. The subsequent maturation process involves the differentiation of certain T cell phenotypes such as pro-inflammatory cells (Th1, Th2, Th17) or regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells, which serve to keep the immune response in check. The current study focuses on the role of two key transcription factors&#x02014;FOXP3 and GATA3&#x02014;in controlling the commitment of these cells. We demonstrate that the Th2 cytokine IL-4 inhibits the induction of FOXP3 and thus inhibits the generation of inducible T<sub>reg</sub> cells. We show that IL-4&#x02013;induced GATA3 mediates FOXP3 inhibition by directly binding to a GATA element in the FOXP3 promoter.

Dependent on the pathogen, T cells differentiate into different subtypes, such as Th1 or Th2 cells, which are most efficient in defeating microbial or parasitic invaders respectively. A hallmark of Th1 and Th2 differentiation pathways is the exclusiveness of the individual phenotype leading to either Th1 or Th2, but not to mixed populations. The exclusiveness of this mechanism is provided by a polarization process, where Th2 differentiation inhibits Th1 commitment and vice versa. Specifically interleukin 4 (IL-4)&#x02013;induced STAT6 and GATA3 inhibit differentiation into Th1 cells in the early phase of commitment &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

Naturally occurring, thymus-derived T<sub>reg</sub> (nT<sub>reg</sub>) cells are generated in the thymus and are assumed to protect against the activity of autoreactive T cells in the periphery. These cells express the forkhead transcription factor FOXP3 and constitutively express CD25 on their surface, but they lack expression of Th1 or Th2 cytokines. Particularly interesting are those T<sub>reg</sub> cells that are generated in the periphery and thus are potential targets for therapeutic interventions.

We show that GATA3 inhibits FOXP3 induction and that IL-4 limits FOXP3 expression in a GATA3-mediated way, both in vitro and in vivo.

However, it is not known if all CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells have the same capacity to express FOXP3. To investigate whether FOXP3 can be expressed by any T cell subset or if expression is restricted to a distinct lineage, FOXP3 mRNA expression was analyzed in freshly isolated T cells such as CD25-depleted CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> naive or CD45RO<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> memory T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), as well as T cells driven in vitro toward Th1, Th2, or iT<sub>reg</sub> phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g001">Figure 1</xref>B; phenotype on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050329-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).

Th1 cells showed only a 10-fold increase. In contrast, Th2 cells stimulated under the same conditions did not increase FOXP3 expression. The in vitro generated iT<sub>reg</sub> cells were unable to further up-regulate FOXP3, which was already at high levels under the resting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, right panel).</p><fig id="pbio-0050329-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Th2 Cells Cannot Induce FOXP3 Expression</title><p>(A) Human T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 with or without TGF-&#x003b2; as indicated on the <italic>x</italic>-axis of (B).

However, the neutralization of IL-4 with a blocking IL-4 antibody did not rescue FOXP3 expression in the differentiated Th2 cells (unpublished data). These data demonstrated that Th2 cells have a limited capacity to express FOXP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The inability of Th2 cells to express FOXP3 was also documented at the single-cell level, confirming that Th2 cells lack FOXP3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Only iT<sub>reg</sub> cells expressed FOXP3 in resting conditions. Interestingly, we observed that resting iT<sub>reg</sub> cells express FOXP3 but show low CD25 surface expression. Repeated exposure to TGF-&#x003b2; did not further increase the FOXP3 expression in the iT<sub>reg</sub> lineage but transiently induced FOXP3 expression in Th1 cells. Naturally occurring Th2 cells such as CRTH2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, T cells isolated according to their IL-4 secretion, or an IL-4&#x02013;producing T cell clone (BR8) were also lacking FOXP3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Furthermore TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated FOXP3 induction failed in these cells in contrast to the naive T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Because IL-4 is the key Th2 cytokine, the expression of IL-4 and FOXP3 in freshly isolated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). IL-4&#x02013;expressing cells were most abundant among CD45RO<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells, which did not co-express FOXP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, left panel).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, the frequency of the IL-4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells was always below 1&#x00025; in the FOXP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells close to the background.

In addition, neither the Th2 clone (BR8) nor CRTH2 cells significantly expressed FOXP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Cells enriched for their IL-4 secretion using the magnetic cell isolation technology contained some FOXP3-expressing cells, but importantly, the expression did not overlap.

Interestingly, the Th0 cells were expressing more FOXP3 than the Th2 cells, but expressed low levels of GATA3; however, the protein expression slightly differed from mRNA expression, suggesting also posttranslational regulation and degradation as potential additional mechanisms in the differentiation process. The phenotype of iT<sub>reg</sub> cells included an anergic phenotype upon anti-CD3 re-stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050329-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A), CD103, CTLA-4, GITR, and PD-1 surface expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050329-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B).

The IL-4&#x02013;mediated prevention of FOXP3 expression was not caused by interferences of the receptor signaling, because the phosphorylation of SMAD2 or STAT6 was not affected by the addition of IL-4 and/or TGF-&#x003b2;, which demonstrates that IL-4 as well as TGF-&#x003b2; signaling were functional under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Increasing amounts of IL-4 increase intracellular GATA3, whereas FOXP3 decreased, which is consistent with the mRNA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050329-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Furthermore, injection of IL-4 into wild-type B6 mice decreased the inducible or natural T<sub>reg</sub> number in vivo. A distinction of the T<sub>reg</sub> subsets is not possible, because recently activated iT<sub>reg</sub> cells also express surface CD25. We used complexes of recombinant mouse IL-4 (rmIL-4) plus anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which have been shown to dramatically increase the potency of the cytokine in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.

Upon administration of rmIL-4 plus anti-IL-4 mAb complexes, the total number of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell, as well as the Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells diminished by half (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050329-sg002">Figure S2</xref>G and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050329-sg002">S2</xref>H), confirming that the lower percentage was not due to an increase in the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells, but a real decrease of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. In conclusion, IL-4 negatively regulates the natural or inducible T<sub>reg</sub> cell turnover not only in vitro but also in vivo. To study the effects of IL-4 on already-existing human natural or inducible T<sub>reg</sub> cells, we exposed sorted CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (nT<sub>reg</sub> cells) to IL-4 and analyzed FOXP3 expression and suppressive capacity.

This inhibitory effect of GATA3 was further confirmed in BALB/c transgenic mice, expressing GATA3 in T cells (DO11.10:CD2-GATA3 transgenic mice). In line with the transient overexpression of GATA3 in human T cells, cells of these mice failed to induce FOXP3 expression upon exposure with antigen in the presence of TGF-&#x003b2;. Strikingly, the DO11.10:CD2-GATA3 mice do have peripheral FOXP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, which however displayed a 10&#x00025;&#x02013;25&#x00025; lower frequency compared to wild-type DO11.10 mice. Thus GATA3 restrains the development of certain T<sub>reg</sub> subsets, presumably the inducible, peripheral population and not those of thymic origin. Thymic T cells undergo a different maturation process, which may explain the insensitivity of nT<sub>reg</sub> to GATA3 overexpression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast to the Th2-differentiating and iT<sub>reg</sub>-inhibiting function of GATA3 in peripheral T cells, GATA3 acts in the thymus together with other transcription factors such as the <italic>Repressor of GATA3</italic> (ROG) in the differentiation process toward CD8 cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d; or participates in complex transcriptional feedback network to regulate sympathoadrenal differentiation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, the role of GATA3 appears to be tissue specific and cannot be generalized.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that GATA3 repressed FOXP3 expression directly by binding to the FOXP3 promoter region. A palindromic GATA-site is located 303 bp upstream of the TSS in a highly conserved region, which we have previously identified as the FOXP3 promoter &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Site-specific mutation of this site increased the activity of the promoter constructs, thus revealing the repressive nature of this GATA element in memory T cells, which naturally express GATA3, whereas no difference was seen in naive T cells, which do not express GATA3. This palindromic GATA element is bound by GATA3 protein as proven with pull-down experiments. Furthermore, it is shown by ChIP that GATA3 binds this element also in intact cells. It is known that GATA3 can induce transcription by chromatin remodeling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;, by directly transactivating promoters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, or, as shown in the current study, acts as a repressor of gene expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b057">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore keeping GATA3 expression low might be required to induce efficient FOXP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> iT<sub>reg</sub> cell generation.</p><p>The molecular interactions enabling GATA3 to inhibit FOXP3 are not identified yet, but the GATA-binding site is located adjacent to positive, inducing sites, composed of AP-1-NFATc2 sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050329-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, and GATA3 may compete with the binding of AP-1/NFAT to the promoter (unpublished observations).</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that FOXP3 is negatively regulated by cytokines such as IL-4. GATA3 acts as an inhibitor of FOXP3 expression in early T cell differentiation, as well as in differentiated Th2 cells by directly binding and repressing the FOXP3 promoter. We therefore describe a new mechanism of how Il-4 avoids tolerance induction by repressing FOXP3 expression. These findings will give new perspectives toward understanding molecular mechanisms of iT<sub>reg</sub> induction and thus pathways of peripheral tolerance induction, particularly in allergy and asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice.</title><p>Normal B6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine).
