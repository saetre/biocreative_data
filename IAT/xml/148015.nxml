We examined, by targeted mutagenesis, the effect of the conserved lysine residue at position 57 upon the various catalytic activities of the Fpg protein. Mutant Fpg protein with Lys-57--&#x0003e;Gly (K57G) had dramatically reduced DNA glycosylase activity for the excision of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-guanine (8-oxoG). While wild type Fpg protein cleaved 8-oxoG/C DNA with a specificity constant ( k cat/ K M) of 0.11/(nM@min), K57G cleaved the same DNA 55-fold less efficiently. FpgK57G was poorly effective in the formation of Schiff base complex with 8-oxoG/C DNA. The efficiency in the binding of 8-oxoG/C DNA duplex for K57G mutant was decreased 16-fold. The substitution of Lys-57 for another basic amino acid Arg (K57R) had a slight effect on the 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase activity and Schiff base formation. The DNA glycosylase activities of FpgK57G and FpgK57R using 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5N-methylformamidopyrimidine residues as substrate were comparable to that of wild type Fpg. In vivo, the mutant K57G, in contrast to the mutant K57R and wild type Fpg, only partially restored the ability to prevent spontaneously induced transitions G/C--&#x0003e;T/A in E.coli BH990 ( fpg mutY ) cells. These results suggest an important role for Lys-57 in the 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase activity of the Fpg protein in vitro and in vivo.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
