In the latter cases, such as plants and fungi, cholesterol-like sterols (phytosterols, ergosterol etc.) seem to substitute for cholesterol. The precise need for sterols in biological membranes still remains poorly defined, though its link with microdomains (variously termed rafts, caveoli etc.) may be part of the answer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Although the accumulation of cholesterol in atherosclerotic plaques has led to the concept that 'too much' cholesterol may be deleterious, too little cholesterol has now been proven pathophysiological for abnormal embryonic development. Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS, MIM 270400), a relative common dysmorphology disorder, is caused by mutations in DHCR7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], which encodes for 7-dehydrocholesterol &#x00394;7-reductase and catalyzes a final step of cholesterol biosynthesis. Recognition of other dysmorphology syndromes caused by defects in the post-squalene cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, such as desmosterolosis, lathosterolosis, X-linked chondrodysplasia punctanta and CHILD syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], has strengthened this concept.</p><p>Genetic disruption of the <italic>Dhcr7 </italic>results in neonatal lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Neonatal mice homozygous for the <italic>Dhcr7 </italic>gene disruption are deficient in cholesterol and have increased accumulation of the cholesterol precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC). Although no embryonic lethality was noted, these knockout pups exhibited a number of developmental abnormalities and died within 24 h after birth. A similar mouse SLOS model, generated by replacing exons 3, 4 and part of exon 5 of the murine <italic>Dhcr7 </italic>gene, with similar biochemical and structural defects and a 100 % neonatal lethality, has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Poor lung development or diffuse lung alveolar atelectasis with cyanotic and lethargic breathing are consistent between both <italic>Dhcr7 </italic>null models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and therefore is the likely reason for the respiratory insufficiency and subsequent death of <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>pups. These <italic>Dhcr7 </italic>knockout mice are models for human SLOS, especially the more severely affected patients, since early postnatal lethality with respiratory failure has been reported in severe SLOS cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Developmental lung abnormalities are also relatively common in SLOS patients, including pulmonary hypoplasia, abnormal pulmonary lobation and pulmonary arteries, anomalies of laryngeal and tracheal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Mammalian lung is unique in that it is fully developed, but does not function for gas exchange until at the moment of birth; the majority of structural development and maturation takes place <italic>in utero</italic>. Lung development is a complex process that involves branching morphogenesis of epithelium, interstitial development including vasculogenesis, cellular differentiation, biochemical maturation and physical growth. Four stages of mouse lung development have been described, based upon the histological appearances of lung; pseudoglandular, canalicular, terminal saccular and alveolar stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Impaired hedgehog function has been proposed as a mechanism underlying malformations found in SLOS. Hedgehog family members play diverse roles in embryonic development, and cholesterol is necessary for maturation of these morphogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling cascade has been shown to play a central role in lung development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Loss of Shh function resulted in severe lung defects associated with loss of branching morphogenesis, but preserved proximal-to-distal differentiation of lung epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Overexpression of Shh in the distal lung epithelium resulted in the absence of functional alveoli and an increase in interstitial tissue caused by an increased proliferation of both epithelial and mesenchyme cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Mice with Shh overexpression died less than 24 h after birth, probably owing to respiratory failure. It has been reported that inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by chemical inhibitors of <italic>Dhcr7 </italic>also led to a disturbance of the Shh signaling with abnormal embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and severe sterol deprivation can indeed inhibit the processing of transfected Shh in cultured mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In the present studies, we characterized lung development in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos from E10.5 to birth. Our results showed that cholesterol deficiency, caused by loss of Dhcr7 activity, did not alter lung branching morphogenesis (early gestational stages, E9.5 to E14.5). However, lung saccular development was impaired, with arrested or partially developed epithelial tubules and delayed vascular development. Differentiation of type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) appeared normal but differentiation of type I AECs was severely impaired. Therefore, cholesterol deficiency resulted in a distinct late gestational lung hypoplasia, characterized by impaired sacculation with delayed type I AECs differentiation and immature vascular development. However, this study does not support the concept that the perturbation of Shh-Patched-Gli pathway was involved in the pathogenesis of developmental lung hypoplasia in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos. Patterns of expression of Shh signaling cascade members were not altered, and processing of Shh appeared normal.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Body growth retardation at late gestation stage in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos</title><p><italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice were born in the expected Mendelian ratios from heterozygous parents, but all of these pups died within 24 h and most within 14 h of birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. At birth, they were clearly smaller than wild-type or heterozygous littermates. An experienced investigator can pick out knockout pups based on this along with presence of hypoxia and their lack of spontaneous movement. The breathing frequency in P0 <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>pups was markedly slower than control littermates (34 &#x000b1; 7 breaths/min in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, n = 10 vs. 92 &#x000b1; 16 breaths/min in controls, n = 32, p &#x0003c; 0.001) and the breathing was observed to be more irregular and shallow, with long periods of apnea.</p><p>To determine the gestational stage at which growth of the knockout embryos was affected, embryos were harvested at various stages of gestation and their body lengths compared between <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and controls.

Additionally, no cardiac defects were identified and this was confirmed by more detailed histological analyses (data not shown).

In contrast, the formation of these typical saccules was impaired in Dhcr7 deficient lungs. Instead, these saccular structures were lined by a low columnar epithelium that lacked flattened type I-like cells with the presence of many undeveloped or arrested epithelial tubules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).

This discovery has led to the identification of other disorders of embryonic development caused by mutations in genes encoding other enzymes in the post-squalene steps of cholesterol biosynthesis. Although these genetic studies now implicate the need for normal cholesterol synthesis, the mechanistic role(s) of cholesterol in normal embryonic development remains to be clarified.</p><p>In the present study, we report the characterization of lung development in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos. Although cardiac abnormalities are common in human SLOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], no structural abnormalities of the heart or the great vessels were observed in the <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>pups. Lung development in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos at the early stages, from lung bud formation to canalicular stage, was morphologically similar to controls. Instead, a distinct lung hypoplasia at the saccular stage, characterized by arrested or partially developed distal epithelial tubules, reduced terminal sac space, delayed type I AECs differentiation and delayed vascular development, was consistently observed at late gestational stages in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos. At late stages of normal fetal development, the mammalian alveolar epithelium undergoes an abrupt differentiation as a part of the preparation of the lungs for the postnatal demands of gas exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Both type II AECs, producing pulmonary surfactants, and type I AECs, lining the expanded alveoli, are important for alveolar maturation. In addition, the vascular development of alveoli is also essential for normal lung morphogenesis at late gestational stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We show here that the differentiation of type I AECs but not type II AECs in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>lungs was blocked or delayed, as indicated by fewer flattened type I cells and by reduced expression of markers of type I AECs, T1&#x003b1; and AQP5. Delayed vascular development was also involved in the delayed sacculation of <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>lungs. Additionally, the mesenchyme separating the AECs from the vascular beds remained thickened. In support of normal differentiation of type II AECs, no alteration in the gene expression patterns for surfactant proteins A, B, C or D was noted, nor was the pattern of distribution of SP-C altered in lungs from knockout embryos. Thus, impaired gas exchange, as opposed to poor inflation and alveolar tension, may be the cause of respiratory failure in these pups.</p><p>Loss of functional Dhcr7 led to a retardation of embryonic growth from E14.5~E16.5 onwards. By this stage, cholesterol levels were already lower and its immediate precursor, 7-DHC, elevated in the lungs (this study) as well as in the whole body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) followed by postnatal failure to thrive is a universally observed phenotype in SLOS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We showed here that body length was significantly reduced at later stages of gestation in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>animals, compared to controls. Whole body weights and fresh lung weights (as well as brain, heart and kidney, data not shown) at late gestational stages were also lower in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos. Interestingly, the lower lung/body ratios at E18.5 in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos compared to wild-type suggested a disproportionate inhibition of lung growth than other organs. Cell proliferation and division in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>lungs were markedly arrested without apparent increase in cell apoptosis. Therefore, it appears that growth retardation caused by cholesterol deficiency was primarily because of an inhibition of cell growth and proliferation, rather than an increase in cell death.</p><p>Cholesterol is present in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos, as it is in <italic>Sc5d</italic><sup>-/- </sup>(lathosterolosis) and <italic>Dhcr24</italic><sup>-/-</sup>(desmosterolosis) embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Total sterols and cholesterol in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryonic lungs (as well as in brain and liver, data not shown) were reduced and 7DHC/8DHC elevated, but a significant amount of cholesterol was detectable, comprising ~60% and ~30% of total tissue sterols at E13.5 and neonate, respectively. Fetal cholesterol can either be synthesized endogenously in fetal tissues or accrued from extra-embryonic tissues such as maternal serum, placenta, and yolk sac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Since these mice theoretically can not synthesize cholesterol, any accumulation of cholesterol must be derived from the maternal sources. Interestingly, <italic>Dhcr24 </italic>null mice are viable but contained almost no cholesterol in plasma and tissues at 3-months, whereas cholesterol content in <italic>Dhcr24 </italic>null embryo tissues accounts for ~60% at E11.5 and ~30% at E17.5, of total tissue sterols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. These results, as well as this study, suggest that a considerable amount of maternal cholesterol can be transferred to the murine fetus. One explanation of why the <italic>Dhcr24</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice are developmentally normal but <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice are affected may be because desmosterol can functionally substitute for cholesterol, whereas the other cholesterol precursors can not.</p><p>Although a mechanistic understanding of why a deficiency in cholesterol biosynthesis leads to abnormal embryonic development is lacking, a frequently advanced explanation has been that Shh signaling, involved in early developmental patterning, may be disrupted. In the developing lung primordium, Shh is expressed initially at E9 and promotes branching morphogenesis, which is impaired in Shh knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], suggesting that Shh, secreted by the epithelium, is critical for branching morphogenesis. In this study, the lack of evidence of abnormal lung branching morphogenesis in the early stages, but a consistent delayed maturation of the gas-exchange region of the lung in the saccular period of development of <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos was observed, suggesting early Shh signaling was normal. Shh protein expression and autoprocessing at E11.5 was indistinguishable between wild-type and <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos. Additionally, although these experiments were not quantitative, the abundance of Shh appeared unchanged between these genotypes. Thus, it is possible that the cholesterol levels (roughly 50% of normal levels) in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos were enough for completion of Shh autoprocessing or 7DHC accumulated in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryonic tissues can also participate efficiently as a sterol adduct in the Shh processing reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In this study, we also examined the Shh signaling pathway by immunohistochemistry of known key components of this pathway, such as patched, smoothened and Gli proteins. Shh signaling leads to the activation of transcription and increased protein levels of these components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. If Shh signaling were defective in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos, these could have resulted in abnormalities of the staining patterns of these components, but no such disturbance was detected. Indeed, the patterns of protein expression seemed comparable and indistinguishable from wild-type embryos at all stages of lung development examined.</p><p>In a recent in vitro study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos, grown in lipid-depleted culture and transiently treated with cyclodextrin, showed no affect on Shh processing. However, a deficiency in their ability to respond to Shh activation, as judged by reporter gene expression, was demonstrable. In contrast, when CHO cells, that stably expressed Shh, were subjected to sterol deprivation, an arrest of Shh autoprocessing was clearly demonstrable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the present study, we did not detect unprocessed Shh in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryonic tissues at E11.5. Subtle differences in Shh signal transduction can not be excluded by the present study. However, we favor a model whereby the loss of normal cholesterol biosynthesis is important, not so much for Shh autocleavage, as for the loss of the correct plasma membrane milieu. Since the loss of cholesterol content in the plasma membrane (and perhaps any membrane) is likely to alter the function of receptors more sensitive to this, loss of normal cholesterol synthesis may cause a loss of signal transduction of a host of such pathways. Thus, this effect may not be limited to the Shh pathway and other targets may be more important. This hypothesis is amenable to testing in the <italic>Dhcr7 </italic>null mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Cholesterol deficiency caused by Dhcr7 deficiency in mice resulted in, along with IUGR, a distinct lung saccular hypoplasia with impaired differentiation of type I but not type II AECs and delayed associated vascular development.

Five &#x003bc; m sections were mounted on Superfrost-Plus slides (VWR, West Chester, PA) for histological or immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses.</p><p>IHC was performed using an indirect method. After deparaffination in xylene and rehydration through a graded series of ethanol, sections were heated at 95&#x000b0;C in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0) for an initial 15 min and for three successive 5-min periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. After cooling, the sections were treated with hydrogen peroxide (3% v/v in PBS, pH7.4) for 10 min and rinsed in the PBS. Sections were blocked with 5% normal serum for 2 h, washed in PBS and incubated with antibodies against Shh-N19 (1:100), Patched (1:100), Smo-N19 (1:100), Gli1 (1:100), Gli3-N19 (1:100), SP-C C19 (1:200), caveolin 1&#x003b1;-N20 (1:200), aquaporin 5 (AQP5, 1:200), megalin (1:200), PECAM-1 (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or T1&#x003b1; (mAB 8.1.1, 1:1000 dilution, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) overnight at 4&#x000b0; C in a humidified chamber. The sections were washed in PBS, incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:1000~1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS for 2 h at RT, incubated with HRP-streptavidin complex for 30 min, rinsed in PBS and visualized using a Metal Enhanced Diaminobenzidine (DAB) Substrate Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Digital images were collected using a Polaroid Digital Microscope Camera mounted on an Olympus BX40 microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>Lung morphometry</title><p>Terminal saccular space areas were measured using NIH Image software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Multiple measurements were performed on randomly selected 0.04-mm<sup>2 </sup>fields located in the distal part of the lung sections. The proportion of lung comprising terminal saccular spaces was calculated as a percentage of the total examined area of the lung section. Three animals per genotype were examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of cell proliferation/Division/death</title><p>Changes in cell proliferation and division were assessed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) IHC, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and phosphorylated histone H3 (pHH3) IHC. The PCNA (1:2000) and pHH3-Ser28 (1:200) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For BrdU incorporation, timed pregnant mice at E18.5 were injected intra-peritoneally with 100 &#x003bc;g/gm body weight of BrdU (Sigma, St Louis, MO) 2 h prior to sacrifice, embryos dissected from uteri and processed as described above. Sections were stained with a monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (1:100, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) and visualized with a Cy2-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody using a laser-scanning confocal microscope. Cell death was investigated by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) using the Fluorescein In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>Sample preparation and western blotting was performed according to Kawakami <italic>et al </italic>with some minor modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Briefly, 3 embryos from each genotype were pooled, homogenized in ice cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF and 2 &#x003bc;g/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin and pepstatin A) with a tissue homogenizer (PRO Scientific Inc., Oxford, CT) using three pulses of 10 seconds each and then subjected to Dounce homogenizer by 10 strokes. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C, supernatants collected, protein concentration determined and used for western blotting. COS1 cells were transfected using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with expression constructs encoding either the full-length Shh or the N-terminal fragment of Shh without post-translational modifications (constructs kindly provided by Dr. Pao-Tien Chuang, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA), harvested 3 days after transfection and protein extracts prepared as described above. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and 20 &#x003bc;g (COS1 cells) and 75 &#x003bc;g (embryos) of lysates separated by 15 % SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with primary antibody (Shh-N19, 1:100) for 2 hours, followed by donkey anti-goat HRP second antibody (1:1000) and visualized by chemiluminescent detection according to manufacturer's protocols (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Boston MA).</p></sec><sec><title>Northern blotting</title><p>Northern blotting was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], using total RNA (20 &#x003bc;g) from P0 mice lungs. The cDNA probes for SP-A, SP-B and SP-C were kindly provided by Dr. Jeffery Whitsett (Division of Pulmonary Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio). A cDNA probe for SP-D was amplified by RT-PCR, using murine SP-D cDNA specific primers (sense 5'-TGCCTGGTCGTGATGGACG-3', and antisense 5'-AGCACTGTCTGGAAGCCCGC-3') and confirmed by sequencing.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Author's contributions</title><p>HY designed the experiments.
