Innate immune mechanisms that lead to protection against this parasite are still unknown. In order to investigate whether myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is required for resistance against <italic>N. caninum</italic>, genetically deficient mice (MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) and wild type littermates were infected with live tachyzoites and the resistance to infection was evaluated. We found that sub-lethal tachyzoite doses induced acute mortality of MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which succumbed to infection due to uncontrolled parasite replication. Higher parasitism in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was associated with the lack of IL-12 production by dendritic cells, delayed IFN-&#x003b3; responses by NKT, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, and production of high levels of IL-10. MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice replenished with IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; abolished susceptibility as the animals survived throughout the experimental period. We conclude that protective IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated immunity to <italic>N. caninum</italic> is dependent on initial MyD88 signaling, in a mechanism triggered by production of IL-12 by dendritic cells. Further knowledge on Toll-like receptor recognition of <italic>N. caninum</italic> antigens is encouraged, since it could generate new prophylactic and therapeutic tools to control parasite burden.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Neospora caninum</italic></kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>MyD88</kwd><kwd>IL-12</kwd><kwd>IFN-&#x003b3;</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="31"/><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Neospora caninum</italic> is an intracellular parasite that causes major reproductive losses in bovines, due to abortions and stillbirths caused by mid-gestational exposure or recrudescence of latent infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Some research groups have attempted to estimate the economic impact of neosporosis in cattle and they have suggested that several million dollars are lost per year with miscarriages and veterinary medical assistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Dogs and coyotes are <italic>N. caninum</italic> definitive hosts, once oocysts are shed after oral challenge with different parasite-harboring tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Canine neosporosis occurs mostly in puppies, which are infected in utero after recrudescence of a maternal latent infection, and its main clinical features are neuromuscular disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Also, there are unanswered questions that have been raised as if this parasite is able to infect humans, considering that serological evidence is found in different populations worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p><p>Innate immunity plays an important role in protection and pathogenesis of protozoan infections. In addition to conferring resistance to initial parasite replication, innate immunity activation is essential for the establishment of adaptive Th1 cellular responses, in order to control active infections and consequently overcome re-exposures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Parasite control is mainly based on an early IFN-&#x003b3; production, dependent on lymphocyte priming by antigen presenting cells (APC) and IL-12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. APC, which are crucial for early parasite recognition and control, distinguish pathogens through Toll-like receptors (TLR). Stimulation of TLR induces immediate protective responses through the production of diverse antimicrobial peptides and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is a critical signaling element after microbial recognition by TLR, once it represents a common cytoplasmatic adaptor protein to most of these receptors and it is responsible for pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis, leading to the elimination of intracellular pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. In the last decade, MyD88 was found as crucial for resistance to almost 40 different pathogens in experimental models, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].</p><p>In this sense, the present work was aimed at determining the requirement of TLR-associated adaptor protein MyD88 in the control of infection by <italic>N. caninum</italic>. Infection kinetics were analyzed in adaptor protein deficient mice and special emphasis was given to host parasitism, inflammatory cell migration and main Th1 cytokine production. Our results showed that MyD88 is responsible for IL-12 production and consequent early acute IFN-&#x003b3; response, resulting in infection control and host survival.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials|methods"><label>2.</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1.</label><title>Animals</title><p>Six- to eight-week old wild type (WT) C57BL/6 background mice, along with animals deficient in adaptor protein MyD88 (MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>), IL-12p40 (IL-12p40<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) and IFN-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) deficient mice were bred and maintained at the institutions&#x02019; animal facilities, Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, School of Medicine of Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, USP (Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, Brazil), with food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.

Although mice are naturally resistant to <italic>N. caninum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], they were not able to overcome parasite exposure in the absence of MyD88. Such a phenomenon was also observed by the depletion of other crucial immune components, since IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3;, cytokines that combined lead to infection control. Experiments herein conducted demonstrated that MyD88 is required for IL-12 synthesis by DC, which induce an early acute IFN-&#x003b3; production. Sequentially, effector Th1 responses mediated by an elevated IFN-&#x003b3;:IL-10 ratio confers control of parasite replication and consequent host survival. To our knowledge, this is the first report that demonstrates the mechanisms that underlie the production of these key cytokines during <italic>N. caninum</italic> infection.</p><p>Comparatively, related protozoan <italic>T. gondii</italic> is recognized by MyD88-dependent TLR2, TLR9, and TLR11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were unable to control parasite replication and succumbed to <italic>T. gondii</italic> after infection with low numbers of tachyzoites similarly to the results shown here. The pro-inflammatory environment required for host resistance to intracellular pathogens is manly generated by pathogen recognition by APC, which release chemical mediators that activate and direct effector cell phenotypes. IL-12 is a key cytokine involved in NK activation and commitment of na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes to the Th1 subset. Mice treated with anti-IL-12 monoclonal antibodies presented higher morbidity/mortality to <italic>N. caninum</italic> acute infection, demonstrating the key role of this cytokine in host protection, similarly to the results presented here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Our results clearly demonstrated that the lack of IL-12 production in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice after <italic>N. caninum</italic> infection reinforces the vital role of this cytokine, which has its production triggered by pathogen innate recognition, and inducing posterior protective immune responses. Thus, these results are in agreement to additional observations showing similar survival kinetics between IL-12 and MyD88 deficient mice.</p><p>Seemingly, IFN-&#x003b3; has a pivotal role in host resistance to <italic>N. caninum</italic>, inducing effector mechanisms like apoptosis of infected cells and NO production, as reviewed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Likewise, IFN-&#x003b3; was shown to be more relevant for the protection of <italic>N. caninum</italic> infection than MyD88 and IL-12, once IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice succumbed to acute infection earlier than the other genetically deficient mice analyzed. IL-12 stimulus after <italic>N. caninum</italic> infection triggers effector IFN-&#x003b3; production and consequent infection control as shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. In addition to the higher relevance of IFN-&#x003b3; in <italic>N. caninum</italic> infection, induction of this key cytokine seems to present MyD88-independent pathways, once MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were able to produce late IFN-&#x003b3; responses together with high levels of IL-10, in compliance with data recently published for <italic>T. gondii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Additionally, it is also important to highlight that, although IL-12p40 may also indicate IL-23 activity, treatment with the IL-12 active subunit (p70) conferred protective immunity to MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, suggesting that Th17 responses were not involved in the mechanisms proposed here for <italic>N. caninum</italic> infection in mice. Accordingly, IL-17 was not detected in serum samples or peritoneal wash of WT and MyD88 deficient mice during the experimental observation.</p><p>The absence of IL-12 production leading to the absence of early IFN-&#x003b3; response was not a consequence of impaired migration of producer cells to the site of infection, since a high influx of different cell lines with potential to produce both key cytokines was observed in the peritoneal cavity of MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Moreover, inflammatory migration to parasitized tissues was clearly MyD88-independent, once cell infiltrate in deficient mice was higher than in WT littermates at 10 days p.i. This enhanced cell migration might have occurred in response to higher parasite burden observed in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Conversely, WT mice possessed active cytokine-producing DC and lymphocytes at early acute infection, while MyD88-deficient cell lines were anergic to parasite stimuli. Corroborating with the results obtained in the present study, <italic>T. gondii</italic> induces a MyD88-independent, vigorous and long-lasting chemokine response in infected M&#x003a6; dependent on phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], in contrast to pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which presents major participation of MyD88 after <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that DC are the main producers of MyD88-dependent IL-12 during <italic>N. caninum</italic> infection in mice and, in the absence of the TLR adaptor protein, effector lymphocytes are not primed to produce early IFN-&#x003b3; that is crucial to control infection. It is now necessary to establish which MyD88-associated TLR are relevant in Th1 activation after infection by this parasite. Moreover, the mechanisms that underlie TLR recognition of <italic>N. caninum</italic> leading to the induction of an effector immune response against the parasite are yet to be determined. We believe that further knowledge on <italic>N. caninum</italic> specific TLR agonists and their mechanisms of action may lead to prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against neosporosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Cristiane M.
