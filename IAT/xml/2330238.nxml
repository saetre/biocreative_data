In fission yeast, the ortholog of mammalian sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), called Sre1, activates low-oxygen gene expression and is essential for anaerobic growth. Previous studies in multiple organisms indicate that SREBP transcription factors function as positive regulators of gene expression by increasing transcription. Here, we describe a unique mechanism by which activation of Sre1-dependent transcription downregulates protein expression under low oxygen. Paradoxically, Sre1 inhibits expression of <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> gene product by activating its transcription. Under low oxygen, Sre1 directs transcription of <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> from an alternate, upstream promoter and inhibits expression of the normoxic <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> transcript. The resulting low-oxygen transcript contains an additional 751 nt in the 5&#x02032; untranslated region that is predicted to form a stable, complex secondary structure. Interestingly, polysome profile experiments revealed that this new longer transcript is translationally silent, leading to a decrease in Tco1 protein expression under low oxygen. Together, these results describe a new mechanism for oxygen-dependent control of gene expression and provide an example of negative regulation of protein expression by an SREBP homolog.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>To survive in diverse environments, organisms have developed mechanisms to allow growth under conditions of limiting nutrients. For many organisms including fungi, oxygen is a critical nutrient and cells have evolved ways in which to adapt to a hypoxic environment. Changes in gene transcription and regulation of mRNA translation play a critical role in the response to hypoxia. In mammals, the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription factors are the principal regulators of hypoxic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In addition, hypoxia regulates gene expression by suppressing protein synthesis through the inhibition of translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Both of these mechanisms combine to mediate an adaptive response to limiting oxygen supply in mammalian cells.</p><p>In the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, the transcriptional response to limiting oxygen is mediated by the membrane-bound transcription factor Sre1, the yeast homolog of the mammalian sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) which regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Sre1 (900 aa) contains two transmembrane segments and is inserted into the ER membrane in a hairpin orientation with the N- and C-termini in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The N-terminus of Sre1 is a basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix, leucine zipper transcription factor that binds to a DNA sequence called a Sre1 regulatory element (SRE) to activate transcription of adjacent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Under atmospheric oxygen conditions, Sre1 is inactive and remains sequestered in the ER membrane. Under low oxygen, Sre1 exits the ER and is proteolytically cleaved in a post-ER compartment to release the N-terminal transcription factor (Sre1N), which enters the nucleus and activates gene expression. Genome-wide mRNA expression analysis revealed that under low oxygen Sre1 is primarily a transcriptional activator. Sre1 induces expression of 115 genes and controls expression of 68% of genes upregulated &#x0003e;2-fold under low oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Sre1 target genes include oxygen-dependent enzymes in lipid and heme biosynthesis as well as other gene products expected to be required for hypoxic growth. Consistent with these results, <italic>sre1<sup>+</sup></italic> is essential for growth under low oxygen conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Unlike mammals, regulation of translation by oxygen has not been reported in fission yeast.</p><p>To date, Sre1 and SREBPs are believed to function by upregulating protein expression through increased gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In this study, we describe a unique mechanism for oxygen-dependent regulation of translation that requires Sre1. Unexpectedly, Sre1 inhibits protein expression by upregulating transcription of the target gene, <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic>. Under low oxygen, Sre1 directs transcription of <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> from an alternate, upstream promoter that results in a transcript with a longer 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR). Interestingly, this longer low-oxygen transcript is translationally silent, leading to a decrease in Tco1 protein expression under low oxygen. Collectively, these findings outline a new mechanism for oxygen-dependent control of translation and provide an example of negative regulation of protein expression by an SREBP homolog.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, plasmids and standard procedures</title><p><italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> wild-type KGY425 (<italic>h</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>his3-D1, leu1-32, ura4-D18, ade6-M210</italic>) and <italic>sre1&#x00394;</italic> strains have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).

These target genes functioned in diverse metabolic pathways such as the synthesis of heme, ergosterol, ubiquinone and sphingolipids. Additional expression profiling experiments identified an uncategorized Sre1 target gene <italic>SPAC17G6.02c</italic>, which was upregulated under low oxygen. <italic>SPAC17G6.02c</italic> codes for a 324-aa RTA1-like protein that is predicted to contain seven transmembrane domains. The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> genome codes for four homologs of <italic>SPAC17G6.02c</italic>: <italic>RSB1, RTA1, RTM1</italic> and an uncharacterized gene <italic>YER185W</italic>. Previous studies demonstrate that these <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genes are involved in efflux of different cytotoxic compounds, such as sphingoid long-chain bases by Rsb1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), 7-amino-cholesterol by Rta1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and an unknown toxic substance in molasses by Rtm1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Due to the potential function of <italic>SPAC17G6.02c</italic> in oxygen-regulated lipid transport, we characterized this gene further and based on our results we named it <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> for translation controlled by oxygen.</p><p>To confirm that <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> is upregulated under low oxygen by Sre1, we performed northern analysis using a strand-specific probe on RNA isolated from cells grown in the presence or absence of oxygen for increasing time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). To our surprise, while the levels of <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> transcript increased under low oxygen, the size of the <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> mRNA also increased from &#x0223c;2 to &#x0223c;3 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lanes 1&#x02013;4). After 6 h of low oxygen growth, cells expressed the long <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> transcript (<italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic>) and not the short <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> transcript (<italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic>). Importantly, both the upregulation of <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> and the increase in transcript size required Sre1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lanes 5&#x02013;8). Consistent with this, the switch between <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> and <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> transcripts correlated with the proteolytic activation of Sre1 and the increase of cleaved Sre1N under low oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lower panel). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Low oxygen synthesis of <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> requires Sre1.

Given that <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> contains no predicted introns, we used RACE to determine the sequences of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;UTRs for each transcript. In the presence of oxygen, the <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> 5&#x02032;UTR was 655 nt and in the absence of oxygen the <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> 5&#x02032;UTR was 1406 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, top panel). The 3&#x02032;RACE revealed that the 3&#x02032;UTR was 390 nt in both the <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> and <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, bottom panel). In addition, the coding sequences of <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> and <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> were the same length as determined by RT&#x02013;PCR. These data indicate that <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> and <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> differ in size due to the presence of an additional 751 nt in the 5&#x02032;UTR of <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic>.</p><p>Thus far, the data are consistent with a model in which under low oxygen Sre1 directs transcription of <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> from an anaerobic promoter upstream of the aerobic promoter that produces <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic>. To test whether Sre1 binds to the <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> under low oxygen, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment. Using primers positioned 100-bp upstream of the start of the <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> transcript to detect DNA binding, Sre1 bound specifically to the <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> promoter and binding was increased 5-fold under low oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Sre1 displayed oxygen-dependent binding to the promoter of <italic>hem13<sup>+</sup></italic>, a gene required for heme biosynthesis, but not the Tf2-11 retrotransposon as expected from previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Next, we scanned the genomic sequence 500-bp upstream of the <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> 5&#x02032;UTR for sequences that matched the SRE consensus sequence determined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Two potential SREs were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, Probes A and B) and we assayed these sequences for their ability to bind the DNA-binding domain of Sre1 <italic>in vitro</italic> in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Sre1 bound to Probe A located &#x02212;1527 to &#x02212;1518 nt upstream of the <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> ORF as well as the positive control Probe C, a SRE from the promoter of <italic>sre1<sup>+</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 2 and 4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).

Together, these <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> binding experiments suggest that under anaerobic conditions, Sre1N binds to a SRE upstream of <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic>, leading to the synthesis of <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic>. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Sre1 binds to the <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> promoter.

Antibodies specifically recognized Tco1 as a doublet migrating &#x0223c;30 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, compare lanes 1 and 5). Interestingly, when wild-type cells were cultured under low oxygen to induce the <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> transcript, levels of Tco1 protein were dramatically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lanes 1 and 2).

These data indicate that activation of Sre1 is sufficient to induce expression of <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> and inhibit Tco1 expression.</p><p>Next, we tested whether the inhibition of Tco1 expression by Sre1 is reversible. Sre1N has a short half-life of 5&#x02013;10 min, and cleavage of Sre1 is rapidly inhibited upon shifting cells to the presence of oxygen (B.H. and P.E., unpublished data). Thus, Sre1N levels decrease rapidly after reintroducing oxygen to an anaerobic culture. For this experiment, we grew wild-type cells in the absence of oxygen for 10 h to induce <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> and inhibit Tco1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, lane 2).

As expected, Sre1N and <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> accumulated under low oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). After shifting to aerobic conditions for 30 min, Sre1N disappeared and there was a corresponding switch from the <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> to the <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> transcript. Tco1 protein was detectable at 30 min and continued to increase to 120 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;5). These data indicate that the Sre1-dependent inhibition of Tco1 expression is reversible and provide further evidence that expression of the <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> transcript leads to decreased Tco1 protein.

To investigate this directly, we performed a polysome profiling experiment. Wild-type yeast were grown in the presence or absence of oxygen for 8 h to generate cells expressing either the <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> or <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> transcript, respectively. Cell lysates were fractionated on a sucrose gradient to separate ribosome-associated RNA from free RNA. Overall, there was no significant difference in the two polysome profiles, suggesting that translation efficiency was similar in the presence and absence of oxygen for 8 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). To examine the translation status of <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> mRNAs, we isolated RNA from each fraction and quantified individual mRNAs by RT&#x02013;PCR.

Collectively, these data indicate that <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> is primarily associated with polysomes and therefore efficiently translated, while <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> fails to associate with ribosomes and is poorly translated. In addition, this property of <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> is independent of oxygen and thus likely results from sequence differences between the two mRNA transcripts.</p><p>RNA secondary structure can affect translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).

Two different RNA structure programs (M-fold and GeneBee) predicted that the <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> 5&#x02032;UTR folds to form a highly structured, stable RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> 5&#x02032;UTR was predicted to contain less secondary structure with a higher Gibbs energy of formation. The models predicted by GeneBee are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>.

Genome-wide expression analysis identified <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> as a Sre1 target gene of unknown function. Here, our characterization revealed that <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> mRNA is upregulated under low oxygen by Sre1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Counterintuitively, this increased gene expression leads to decreased Tco1 protein due to the Sre1-dependent synthesis of a poorly translated, alternative transcript, <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic>. Our data are summarized by a model for regulation of <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> expression outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>. In the presence of oxygen, Sre1 is inactive and cells synthesize a 2020-nt mRNA <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> that is efficiently translated into Tco1 protein. In the absence of oxygen, Sre1 is proteolytically activated leading to an increase in Sre1N which binds to the <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> promoter and directs expression of the 2771-nt mRNA <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> from an alternative, upstream promoter. At the same time, expression of <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> is blocked. The <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> transcript associates inefficiently with ribosomes, leading to an inhibition of Tco1 protein expression. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Model for regulation of Tco1 expression by oxygen. In presence of oxygen, the <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> transcript is synthesized and translated into Tco1 protein. Synthesis of <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> does not require Sre1. In the absence of oxygen, Sre1 is activated and binds to a SRE present upstream of <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic>, initiating transcription of <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> from an alternative promoter. The 5&#x02032;UTR of the <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> transcript forms a secondary structure that prevents association with ribosomes. The nucleotide length of each transcript is given.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn027f7"/></fig></p><p>Polysome profiling experiments demonstrated that <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic>, but not <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic>, is efficiently translated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). These two transcripts differ only in the length of their 5&#x02032;UTRs. The 5&#x02032;UTR of <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> contains an additional 751 nt and is predicted to assume a more complex and stable secondary structure than the <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> 5&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Inasmuch as RNA secondary structure is known to affect translation initiation and efficiency, the structure of <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> 5&#x02032;UTR could directly inhibit Tco1 translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>). Alternatively, the <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> 5&#x02032;UTR contains 14 AUG initiation codons compared to three in <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic>. The 5&#x02032;UTRs of <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> and <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> code for seven ORFs (ranging from 3 to 97 aa in length) and three ORFs (8 &#x02013;19 aa in length), respectively. Upstream ORFs (uORFs) can regulate translation of downstream ORFs by preventing reinitiation of ribosomes after translation termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In this way, uORFs present in the <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> 5&#x02032;UTR could prevent translation of Tco1. Consistent with this possibility, 35&#x02013;40% of <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> mRNA was found to be associated with polysomes in fractions 6&#x02013;12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Examples exist in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and humans in which transcription from an alternative promoter leads to a different 5&#x02032;UTR and less efficient translation, but the mechanisms involved in this regulation are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Future experiments will determine the functional contribution of these two mechanisms to the inhibition of Tco1 translation.</p><p>One question that arises from these observations is why do cells make the <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> transcript if it is not translated? One possible explanation is that inhibition of <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> synthesis requires active transcription from the upstream <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> promoter through a mechanism such as transcriptional interference or promoter competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The regulated transcription of <italic>SER3</italic> in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is a well-characterized example of transcriptional interference in which the upstream, noncoding <italic>SRG1</italic> transcript inhibits transcription from the <italic>SER3</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In addition, the alcohol dehydrogenase gene in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is regulated by two closely linked promoters during larval development. During late larval stages, there is a switch in promoter usage, wherein the distal promoter represses transcription from the proximal promoter by transcriptional interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Here, transcription from the <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> promoter inhibits transcription of <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), but both transcripts code for the same protein product. In an alternative model, active transcription from the <italic>tco1<sup>L</sup></italic> promoter could maintain an open chromatin state in order to allow rapid synthesis of <italic>tco1<sup>S</sup></italic> and Tco1 upon the reintroduction of oxygen and loss of Sre1N. A similar idea has been proposed to explain the production of translationally silent transcripts in response to mating pheromone in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>Finally, while our experiments do not directly address the physiological function of Tco1, we find that expression of Tco1 decreases under low oxygen due to a block in translation. <italic>tco1<sup>+</sup></italic> is a nonessential gene and we have failed to detect any phenotypes associated with the loss or overexpression of Tco1 under anaerobic or other standard laboratory conditions. By homology to the characterized <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> transporters Rta1p, Rsb1p and Rtm1p, we speculate that Tco1 may export a toxic compound(s) from cells under aerobic conditions, but that this substrate is either absent or no longer toxic under anaerobic conditions. Future experiments will address the physiological basis for this unique mechanism for inhibition of Tco1 translation under low oxygen.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>Predoctoral fellowship from the American Heart Association (0615376U to B.H.); National Institutes of Health (HL077588).
