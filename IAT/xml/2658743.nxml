Therefore, understanding how myotube apoptosis is regulated is important for developing novel strategies for treatment of muscle loss. We investigated the regulation of apoptosis in skeletal muscle and report a striking increase in resistance to apoptosis following differentiation. We find mitotic C2C12 cells (myoblast-like cells) are sensitive to cytosolic cytochrome <italic>c</italic> microinjection. However, differentiated C2C12 cells (myotube-like cells) and primary myotubes are markedly resistant. This resistance is due to endogenous X-linked inhibitor of apoptotic protein (XIAP). Importantly, the selective difference in the ability of XIAP to block myotube but not myoblast apoptosis is not due to a change in XIAP but rather a decrease in Apaf-1 expression. This decrease in Apaf-1 links XIAP to caspase activation and death. Our findings suggest that in order for myotubes to die, they may degrade XIAP, functionally inactivate XIAP or upregulate Apaf-1. Importantly, we identify a role for endogenous Smac in overcoming XIAP to allow myotube death. However, in postmitotic cardiomyocytes, where XIAP also restricts apoptosis, endogenous Smac was not capable of overcoming XIAP to cause death. These results show that as skeletal muscle differentiate, they become resistant to apoptosis because of the ability of XIAP to regulate caspase activation. The increased restriction of apoptosis in myotubes is presumably important to ensure the long term survival of these postmitotic cells as they play a vital role in the physiology of organisms.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that is unique in its structure and development. Individual myotubes that comprise skeletal muscle are derived from mitotic myoblasts which under the right environmental cues begin to express myogenic markers, exit the cell cycle and fuse to form long multinucleated myotubes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Walsh1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. While the molecular details of this differentiation process are well understood, very little is known about whether fundamental biological processes such as apoptosis are altered during this process of differentiation. Understanding this phenomenon is important because, following the developmental period, muscle loss can have deleterious effects. For example, conditions such as muscular dystrophies, neurogenic muscular atrophy and mitochondrial myopathies result in skeletal muscle death involving apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Tews1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Apoptosis is a genetically regulated, evolutionarily conserved form of cell death. It is characterized by the activation of caspase proteases that cleave numerous substrates within the cell to cause the demise of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-FuentesPrior1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis which can be activated by various stressors such as growth factor withdrawal, ER stress and DNA damage, signaling pathways converge upon the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak. This causes their activation and translocation to the mitochondria where they release cytochrome <italic>c</italic> from the intermembrane space. Once free in the cytosol, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> binds to the adapter protein Apaf-1. This binding induces a conformational change in Apaf-1 in such a way that Apaf-1 oligomerizes as well as binds to procaspase 9 to form the apoptosome complex. Once on the apoptosome, caspase 9 becomes active and cleaves procaspase 3 into its active form. Active caspase 3 is known as the executioner caspase because it cleaves various proteins ultimately leading to the death of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Hengartner1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Wang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Recent reports indicate that mitotic myoblasts utilize an alternative mechanism of activating caspases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Ho1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

Smac is a mitochondrial intermembrane space protein which acts as an inhibitor of an antiapoptotic family of proteins known as the Inhibitor of Apoptotic Proteins (IAPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Chai1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Du1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. IAPs regulate apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting caspases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Eckelman1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite our knowledge of the structure and function of Smac, a critical role for endogenous Smac in regulating apoptosis has not been discovered in other primary cells. Importantly, what happens to this pathway upon differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes is unknown. Skeletal muscles are known to become more resistant to apoptosis upon differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Sandri1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as most of the studies examining skeletal muscle apoptosis have focused on whole tissue, the mechanism for this increased resistance has not been clearly identified at the cellular level.</p><p>In this study, we investigated how isolated myotubes regulate their caspase activation following differentiation. We report that myotubes exhibit an increase in their resistance to apoptosis relative to their mitotic precursor cells. While mitotic C2C12 cells (mC2C12) die with the introduction of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> into their cytosol, differentiated C2C12 (dC12C12) cells and primary myotubes do not. This increased resistance is due to endogenous XIAP. We show that endogenous XIAP is able to selectively block caspase activation in myotubes not because its levels are increased in myotubes but rather because the level of Apaf-1 is dramatically decreased. Importantly, our studies identify endogenous Smac as having a vital role in overcoming this XIAP inhibition in myotubes but not cardiomyocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Myotubes develop resistance to cytochrome <italic>c</italic>-induced apoptosis upon differentiation</title><p>To determine whether cytochrome <italic>c</italic>-mediated caspase activation becomes more restricted with skeletal muscle differentiation, we microinjected cytochrome <italic>c</italic> in C2C12 cells and myotubes.

To determine why postmitotic myotubes have selectively developed this XIAP brake in apoptosis, we looked at the level of XIAP in these mitotic and postmitotic cells. We found XIAP levels to be the same in mC2C12 versus dC2C12 and primary myoblasts versus primary myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g003">Fig. 3a, b</xref>). However, we found that Apaf-1 levels were decreased in both dC2C12 cells and primary myotubes relative to their mitotic precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g003">Fig. 3a, b</xref>). Examination of the mRNA levels also showed a decrease in Apaf-1 in primary myotubes relative to myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g003">Fig. 3c</xref>). These results lead us to examine whether Apaf-1 was limiting for caspase activation in myotubes. To test this, we injected plasmids for Apaf-1 and GFP in dC2C12 cells. Twenty four hours following injections, GFP expressing cells were injected with cytosolic cytochrome <italic>c</italic>. Expression of Apaf-1 alone in dC2C12 cells did not induce death and the cells remained resistant to control injection of yeast cytochrome <italic>c</italic>. In contrast, injection of bovine cytochrome <italic>c</italic> was able to induce death in the Apaf-1 overexpressing dC2C12 cells. Cells injected with vector and GFP showed significantly less death with bovine cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>). Thus, expressing Apaf-1 was sufficient to allow cytochrome <italic>c</italic>-mediated death in myotubes. Together, these results suggest that the decreased levels of Apaf-1 in myotubes results in limited caspase activation, thus allowing endogenous XIAP to effectively protect against cytochrome <italic>c</italic>-mediated death.

Wildtype and Smac-deficient neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes were infected with a tBid-GFP adenovirus. Infected cells were examined by time-lapse microscopy over a 12 hour period. As expected, tBid-GFP infected wildtype cardiomyocytes showed only 20 &#x00025; survival, and this death was blocked with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Surprisingly, and in contrast to mytotubes, Smac-deficient cardiomyocytes also showed only 23 &#x00025; survival when infected with tBid-GFP adenovirus. The death of the Smac-deficient cardiomyocytes was apoptotic as it was completely blocked by the addition of z-VAD-fmk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g005">Fig. 5c</xref>). Western analysis indicated that myotubes and cardiomyocytes expressed similar levels of endogenous Smac despite the fact that myotubes could utilize Smac to overcome XIAP whereas cardiomyocytes could not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g005">Fig. 5d</xref>). Levels of Smac were lower in sympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g005">Fig. 5d</xref>) which, like cardiomyocytes, do not appear to require endogenous Smac to overcome XIAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Potts1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Vaughn1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Together, these data suggest that unlike myotubes, endogenous Smac was not required for mitochondria-mediated death in cardiomyocytes. In addition it suggests that there is likely to be an additional mitochondrial factor in cardiomyocytes that is released to allow XIAP to be overcome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Together, the data presented in this study identify that postmitotic myotubes have increased suppression of their apoptotic pathway relative to their mitotic precursors. Differentiated C2C12 cells and primary myotubes were both resistant to cytosolic cytochrome <italic>c</italic> due to the activity of endogenous XIAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g002">2</xref>). However, myotubes inhibited caspase activation not by <italic>increasing</italic> XIAP levels but rather by <italic>decreasing</italic> Apaf-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g003">Fig. 3a, b, c</xref>). Importantly, overexpressing Apaf-1 alone in dC2C12 cells, was sufficient to allow cytosolic cytochrome <italic>c</italic> injection to kill dC2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>). Therefore, an Apaf-1 reduction is sufficient to set up this differential resistance between mitotic precursors and myotubes. It is noteworthy to mention that a previous study found that human skeletal muscle cytosol completely lacks Apaf-1 and therefore is refractory to cytochrome <italic>c</italic>-mediated caspase activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Burgess1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. This difference could be attributed to the different model systems or the age of the skeletal muscle used, suggesting that skeletal muscle continue to reduce Apaf-1 expression with age.</p><p>Based on these data, we propose that following cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release from the mitochondria, the low levels of Apaf-1 present in myotubes result in reduced apoptosome formation and caspase activation. As a consequence, endogenous XIAP is sufficient to effectively block this reduced level of caspase activation. However, in mC2C12 cells, high levels of Apaf-1 result in robust apoptosome formation, and thus, increased caspase activation that cannot be successfully inhibited by endogenous XIAP. As a consequence, these mitotic cells readily undergo apoptosis with cytosolic cytochrome <italic>c</italic> while myotubes do not.</p><p>This increased resistance to apoptosis employed by myotubes is strikingly similar to that found in other postmitotic cells, specifically neurons and cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Potts1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Potts2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings suggest that regardless of the function or phenotype of the cell, postmitotic cells share the same features in restricting their ability to undergo apoptosis. By requiring not only cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release but also inhibition of XIAP function in order to activate caspases, endogenous XIAP presumably serves as a safety brake to death. For example, if the mitochondria accidentally release cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, the presence of XIAP would block caspase activation and therefore prevent these cells from undergoing unwanted apoptosis. Arguably, increased resistance to caspase activation would be critical to these postmitotic cells because of their inability to replicate and their limited regenerative potential. These postmitotic cells also serve vital functions that require their presence for the lifetime of the organism. On the other hand, not having this resistance to apoptosis in mitotic cells is beneficial to the organism as mitotic cells can give rise to cancer. Indeed, the mechanisms by which the apoptotic pathway is inactivated in many cancers are similar to those seen in postmitotic cells. For example, several melanomas restrict their Apaf-1 expression at the transcriptional level in order to block apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Soengas1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Furukawa1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, many chemoresistant cancers have been found to utilize XIAP to effectively block caspase activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Beauparlant1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The XIAP-deficient mice lack an overt developmental phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Harlin1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. This is consistent with our finding that myotube apoptosis is dependent on the removal of the endogenous XIAP brake as well as the release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>. Neither event alone is capable of activating caspases. However, the XIAP-deficient myotubes are predicted to be more vulnerable if exposed to toxic stimuli or injury that causes mitochondrial damage and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release, because they lack the postcytochrome <italic>c</italic> brake.</p><p>Despite the ability of myotubes to restrict apoptosis, there are certainly circumstances in which myotubes activate caspases and die. Caspase-mediated death has been observed during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Sandri1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The role of apoptosis in pathological conditions is more controversial. For example, several studies examining human spinal muscular atrophy found that muscle fibers experience apoptotic DNA fragmentation and the upregulation of apoptosis associated factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Tews2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Migheli1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, a study utilizing time-lapse microscopy to examine denervated and unloaded muscle did not reveal any nuclei loss in muscle fibers, suggesting apoptosis is not responsible for the loss of muscle mass experienced during muscle atrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Bruusgaard1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Caspase-mediated death is thought to be involved to some extent in additional pathological conditions including muscular dystrophies and mitochondrial myopathies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Tews1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Based on our findings, death stimuli that activate caspases in myotubes would not only have to cause the release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> but also inhibit XIAP. Here we identified three ways in which this could occur. First, as XIAP-deficient myotubes are completely sensitive to cytosolic cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>), a stimulus which is able to degrade or cleave XIAP and release cytochrome <italic>c</italic> would be able to sensitize myotubes to apoptosis. In fact, selective XIAP degradation has been seen in neurons undergoing apoptosis in response to nerve growth factor withdrawal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Potts1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, dC2C12 cells overexpressing Apaf-1 became sensitive to cytochrome <italic>c</italic>-mediated death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>). Therefore, a death stimulus which increases Apaf-1 expression would also be able to overcome XIAP inhibition. Supporting this idea, it has been shown that skeletal muscle undergoing caspase activation due to metabolic deficiencies with ATP depletion and oxidative stress show an increase in Apaf-1 levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Ikezoe1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Third, XIAP could also be functionally inhibited in response to a death stimulus. This could occur through several different mechanisms including an inactivating posttranslational modification of XIAP or via an endogenous inhibitor of XIAP. Here we show that releasing endogenous Smac from the mitochondria is indeed sufficient to overcome XIAP and allow cytochrome <italic>c</italic> to activate caspases in myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g004">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p><p>While the role of Smac as an IAP inhibitor has been extensively characterized <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Chai1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Du1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, the role of endogenous Smac has remained elusive since most cells do not need to inhibit XIAP to die <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Harlin1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Okada1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. While neurons and cardiomyocytes engage the XIAP brake just like myotubes, one striking contrast between these postmitotic cells is that neurons and cardiomyocytes do not appear to utilize endogenous Smac to overcome XIAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Potts1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Vaughn1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The levels of endogenous Smac are much lower in sympathetic neurons compared to myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g005">Fig. 5d</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that neurons do not contain enough Smac protein to fully inhibit XIAP. However, cardiomyocytes and myotubes have comparable levels of Smac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005097-g005">Fig. 5d</xref>), suggesting that the reason endogenous Smac is not effective in cardiomyocytes is not due to a lack of protein altogether. Interestingly, other than myotubes, the only cell type in which a role for endogenous Smac has been identified is their precursor, myoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Ho3">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. This raises the intriguing possibility that endogenous Smac may play a vital role in this particular myogenic cell lineage but not in other cell types.</p><p>It is intriguing that Smac-deficient cardiomyocytes are still able to undergo tBid-induced death. This could be due to the release of an additional mitochondrial factor in cardiomyocytes. Known mitochondrial factors include AIF and HtrA2. AIF can be released from the mitochondrial and cause death but AIF-induced death is caspase independent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Susin1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and therefore would not be blocked by the addition of z-VAD-fmk. Structural data have cast doubt on the IAP inhibitor function of HtrA2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Li1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, making it an unlikely candidate as well. This raises the possibility that cardiomyocytes contain an additional potentially novel mitochondrial factor that can overcome XIAP when released.</p><p>The potential significance of the XIAP brake in myotubes can be seen in mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, a group of heterogeneous disorders due to mutations in either mitochondrial DNA or nuclear genes. These mutations lead to mitochondrial abnormalities which ultimately result in a decrease in ATP synthesis and increased oxidative stress. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these deficiencies even within the same patient, some fibers appear healthy, some appear to suspend apoptosis and others seem to die with active caspase 3 immunoreactivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Ikezoe1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Mirabella1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Aure1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Many fibers from mitochondrial encephaolmypothaties show clear Bax upregulation and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release. However, the number of fibers that show TUNEL staining is much lower <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Ikezoe1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that in these fibers cytochrome <italic>c</italic> is released but cannot undergo caspase-mediated death.

A potential role of endogenous Smac can be seen <italic>in vivo</italic> as well, in patients with neurogenic muscular atrophy. In this condition, where patients experience apoptotic muscle fiber loss, there is an upregulation of multiple IAPs, including XIAP, but also Smac which appears to become released into the sarcoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005097-Tews4">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.
