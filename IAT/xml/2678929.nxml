Dysferlin is a component of that system and absence of dysferlin causes muscular dystrophy (dysferlinopathy) characterized by adult onset muscle weakness, high serum creatine kinase levels and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate. We have observed that dysferlinopathy patient biopsies show an excess of immature fibres and therefore investigated the role of dysferlin in muscle regeneration. Using notexin-induced muscle damage, we have shown that regeneration is attenuated in a mouse model of dysferlinopathy, with delayed removal of necrotic fibres, an extended inflammatory phase and delayed functional recovery. Satellite cell activation and myoblast fusion appear normal, but there is a reduction in early neutrophil recruitment in regenerating and also needle wounded muscle in dysferlin-deficient mice. Primary mouse dysferlinopathy myoblast cultures show reduced cytokine release upon stimulation, indicating that the secretion of chemotactic molecules is impaired. We suggest an extension to the muscle membrane repair model, where in addition to fusing patch repair vesicles with the sarcolemma dysferlin is also involved in the release of chemotactic agents. Reduced neutrophil recruitment results in incomplete cycles of regeneration in dysferlinopathy which combines with the membrane repair deficit to ultimately trigger dystrophic pathology. This study reveals a novel pathomechanism affecting muscle regeneration and maintenance in dysferlinopathy and highlights enhancement of the neutrophil response as a potential therapeutic avenue in these disorders.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Mutations in the dysferlin gene cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), Miyoshi myopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C2">2</xref>) and distal anterior compartment myopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C4">4</xref>), collectively known as the dysferlinopathies. These conditions present typically with adult onset, progressive muscle weakness, highly elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C6">6</xref>). Dysferlin is named after its homology to the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> fertility factor <italic>fer-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C7">7</xref>) involved in maturation of spermatids by fusing large vesicles with the plasma membrane. It is a class II membrane protein, containing multiple C2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C8">8</xref>), inferring that, like many C2 domain-containing proteins, dysferlin is involved in vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C2">2</xref>). Dysferlin interacts with various proteins including affixin, AHNAK, annexin A1 and A2, calpain-3 and caveolin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C11">11</xref>). The annexins and AHNAK are found in the enlargeosome, a calcium-regulated vesicle capable of rapid exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C14">14</xref>) and both dysferlin and caveolin-3 traffic via the late endosomal compartment, from which the enlargeosome derives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C15">15</xref>). A deficiency of membrane resealing in a mouse model of dysferlinopathy is consistent with the theory that dysferlin is involved in the fusion of vesicles from the enlargeosome with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C17">17</xref>). The &#x02018;membrane repair hypothesis&#x02019; postulates that dysferlin is a key component of the muscle membrane repair system, which forms vesicle plugs over membrane lesions, maintaining cell homeostasis before the formation of new membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C17">17</xref>). Recent studies have identified a further component of the muscle resealing apparatus, MG53, which responds early to membrane breaches and may serve to aggregate the membrane repair complex at the sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C19">19</xref>). Dysferlinopathy patients usually develop muscular dystrophy in adult life, following a period of good muscle performance. Mouse models of dysferlinopathy have a mild muscle phenotype, as do MG53 knockout animals. However, the link between the failure of membrane repair and the ultimate development of a muscular dystrophy remains unclear. We were therefore interested to explore how cumulative damage might be implicated in the development of disease and focused our attention on the next stage of muscle response to injury, whereby a muscle fibre undergoes regeneration. This process requires multiple cell types to work in synchrony, producing new contractile tissue in a few days, even after massive injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C20">20</xref>). Signalling from damaged tissue initiates rapid recruitment of neutrophils from the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C21">21</xref>). After 24&#x02013;48 h, signalling from neutrophils and satellite cell populations attract monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C22">22</xref>), which are initially pro-inflammatory and phagocytose cellular debris. Activated satellite cells then start to proliferate and migrate to the injury site. Then, the monocyte population switches to an anti-inflammatory phenotype, differentiating into macrophages, which clear cellular debris and induce satellite cells to fuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C23">23</xref>). Studies have shown that the depletion of inflammatory cells has a marked effect on the eventual outcome of the regenerative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C26">26</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrate that dysferlin-deficient patients show an increase in immature fibres as defined by neonatal myosin (neo-MHC) labelling, suggesting that the regenerative process is delayed or incomplete in dysferlinopathy. Inducing muscle damage in the C57BL/10.SJL-<italic>Dysf</italic> mouse model of dysferlinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C27">27</xref>) demonstrates attenuated muscle regeneration. There is delayed early neutrophil recruitment, failure of clearance of necrotic fibres and a prolonged inflammatory infiltrate that correlates with a delay in the recovery of contraction force. The cumulative result of sequential impaired regeneration may be key to the ultimate development of a dystrophic phenotype in dysferlinopathy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Dysferlinopathy patients show a higher number of immature fibres than muscular dystrophy controls</title><p>We assessed the number of immature fibres, as defined by neo-MHC expression, in 10 molecularly confirmed LGMD2B patients from the NCG rare neuromuscular disease service archives.

Dysferlin-deficient muscle initially showed a lower concentration of mononuclear cells (3 days post-injection), but there was striking failure to resolve the inflammatory process, continuing beyond the point where the muscle was repaired in control mice. Later stage regenerating C57BL/10.SJL-<italic>Dysf</italic> muscle (7 and 14 days post-injection) is characterized by darkly staining red fibres, which remain anuclear and appear to provide foci for the ongoing inflammatory response.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C16">16</xref>) demonstrated that dysferlin-deficient myotubes have a defect in membrane repair, leading to the hypothesis that failure to repair sarcolemmal damage following injury causes loss of cell homeostasis and cell death. Cumulative experience from the natural history of dysferlinopathy in patients and animal models and now also from the MG53 knockout demonstrates that the development of early severe muscular dystrophy is not a feature of defective muscle membrane repair. We became interested in a possible perturbation of the regenerative process both because it represents a longer term response to injury and also because of our observation of an increased number of immature fibres in dysferlinopathy patients compared with disease controls. We believe that the patch hypothesis of dysferlin function can be extended to put emphasis also on the content of the vesicles which fuse at the cell membrane after muscle injury, including neutrophil chemotactic factors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP121F8">8</xref>). Failure of the release of cytokines from damaged muscle could account for the impairment of inflammatory cell recruitment at an early stage of regeneration with subsequent incomplete muscle remodelling, resulting in the persistence of inflammatory cells and necrotic fibres, and over time, the development of muscular dystrophy.</p><fig id="DDP121F8" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;8.</label><caption><p>Hypothetical mechanism linking membrane repair with neutrophil recruitment in normal muscle. A membrane wound (<bold>A</bold>) such as physical injury or exercise induced tear, induces the calcium dependent fusion of vesicles with the sarcolemma (<bold>B</bold>) under the control of dysferlin. This releases vesicle contents, the hypothesized neutrophil chemotactic factors and reseals the membrane. Dysferlin continues to induce vesicle fusion (<bold>C</bold>) to set up a chemotactic gradient which directs neutrophils directly to the fibre, and specific region of the fibre, which was wounded.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ddp12108"/></fig><p>This hypothesis is based on the known function of dysferlin and other ferlin proteins as well as the expression pattern of dysferlin in blood, which is restricted to the type II (non-classical) monocyte population (data not shown). Dysferlin is not expressed at an appreciable level in neutrophils, and so the deficient neutrophil response is unlikely to be due to functional differences between dysferlin-deficient and wild-type neutrophils. The dysferlin positive monocyte population is distinct from those which initially invade muscle following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C23">23</xref>), so it is unlikely that monocyte expression of dysferlin is involved in the defective regeneration, since the type II monocytes are not involved until after the resolution of the inflammatory phase where regeneration of dysferlinopathic muscle is already abnormal. The well-established function of dysferlin in fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C16">16</xref>) and the observation of reduced cytokine release by dysferlin-deficient cells provide an alternative explanation, that part of the function of dysferlin is to release cytokines from internal vesicles in order to attract neutrophils to the site of injury. The model presented in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP121F8">8</xref> is based on the assumption that the primary site of dysferlin action is the mature myofibre. An equally acceptable model could be conceived where dysferlin acts to secrete chemotactic factors from activated satellite cells or tissue resident macrophages (which derive from type II monocytes) and would also be found at the injury site, although not in the early stages when the neutrophil recruitment defect can already be demonstrated. This hypothesis remains tentative until some of the underlying assumptions have been tested.</p><p>Notexin injection is a well understood method for studying the process of muscle regeneration in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C32">32</xref>). Previous studies have indirectly suggested many ways that dysferlin could be involved in regeneration, including a possible role in satellite cell activation or fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C31">31</xref>). Our data suggest the defect is not at the level of the satellite cell, as the expression pattern of genes involved in satellite cell activation and differentiation are not altered, and myoblasts appear to fuse normally. On the other hand, we show a significant reduction in neutrophil recruitment and a failure to clear necrotic fibres in regenerating dysferlin-deficient muscle: in keeping with the abnormal histology, there is reduced recovery of muscle force.</p><p>Following muscle injury, inflammatory cells are recruited to the injury site in an orderly manner. Neutrophils and monocytes coexist at the site of damage, suggesting that they have different, complementary functions. It is known that neutrophils produce oxidizing agents that can destroy cell membranes in the absence of other inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C33">33</xref>), and blocking neutrophil function results in significantly diminished early tissue destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C34">34</xref>). Monocytes are not responsible for membrane disruption, but their reparative functions are inhibited by the absence of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C36">36</xref>). Therefore, specific neutrophil functions are necessary for tissue repair and the interactions between neutrophils and monocytes appear essential to physiological regeneration. It is clear that the impaired neutrophil recruitment is not a consequence of the delayed regenerative process, since this effect precedes any perturbation in muscle regeneration and can also be observed shortly after needle wounding.</p><p>There is already direct evidence that the depletion of the neutrophil population impairs and attenuates muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C24">24</xref>), leading to reduction in macrophage numbers and failure to clear necrotic fibres similar to our findings. The complete neutropenia induced in these studies is more extreme than the situation in dysferlinopathy, where only a partial reduction in neutrophil recruitment is observed. The moderate reduction in macrophage recruitment observed in our studies is also consistent with these data, where total neutropenia resulted in only an &#x0223c;50% reduction in macrophage numbers. This is most likely due to the existence of neutrophil independent mechanisms of macrophage recruitment and a non-linear relationship between neutrophil signalling and macrophage response.</p><p>The inflammatory phase of muscle regeneration in our model persists beyond the stage where it has resolved in the control animals. This is entirely consistent with the human situation in dysferlinopathy where a persistent inflammatory infiltrate is common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C6">6</xref>) possibly reflecting a failure of muscle remodelling following partial regeneration. We hypothesise that both in this model system and in the dystrophic patients, the persistent necrotic fibres provide foci for an ongoing inflammatory reaction. An increasingly pro-inflammatory milieu develops from successive rounds of poor regeneration, increasing the tissue load of both necrotic and inflammatory cells and directing myogenic cells towards a fibrotic fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C38">38</xref>).</p><p>We have confirmed previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C32">32</xref>) that the established membrane repair defect in dysferlinopathic muscle does not appear to cause acute exercise intolerance which is in contradistinction to the findings in the MG53 knockout mouse, despite an apparently comparable membrane resealing defect. Careful analysis of these animal models in the future may help to demonstrate the relative contributions of these different proteins to the process of repair and subsequent recovery. For example, it is possible to speculate that if the reduction in early neutrophil recruitment is specific to dysferlin deficiency, the normal neutrophil response in the MG53 knockout could contribute to the acute damage observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C18">18</xref>). Our finding of slight weakness, but no susceptibility to lengthening contractions in the dysferlin-deficient mice is consistent with this interpretation and the clinical situation, where patients generally develop weakness at a late stage and following a period of pre-symptomatic hyperCKaemia. This expanded model of disease pathogenesis explains a number of unusual features of the disease, including the late onset following a period of good muscle prowess with exercise tolerance and the extensive inflammatory process.</p><p>Previous studies have examined the role of dysferlin in monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C40">40</xref>) and found evidence of an increased phagocytotic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C40">40</xref>). However, these authors examined the SJL/J strain and compared these animals with C57BL/6J. Genetic differences between these strains make it difficult to conclude that a global increase in phagocytotic activity is supported, especially given the strongly pro-inflammatory situation in SJL/J which would <italic>a priori</italic> be expected to increase the activity of phagocytes. Our studies using very similar techniques in C57BL/10-SJL.<italic>Dysf</italic> indicate no significant difference in the phagocytotic index when compared with the genetically equivalent C57BL/10 (data not shown). These authors also examined phagocytes from dysferlinopathy patients. However, in these patients, there is commonly an ongoing inflammatory process in the muscle which would also be expected to increase phagocyte activity. The assay used, both in our laboratory and others, is a simple measure of the phagocyte ability to engulf fluorescent particles, whereas the process that we are examining in this study (the clearance of necrotic fibres by both neutrophils and macrophages) is much more complex, requiring tight control in order to initiate the orderly inflammatory process that degrades damaged tissue without damaging healthy cells. We believe that it is this cascade, rather than the process of phagocytosis itself which is defective here. It is, however, also important to consider that an additional factor in the resolution of regeneration might reside in the monocyte population, which also express dysferlin. Dysferlin is specifically expressed in the Ly-6C<sup>lo</sup>, pre-macrophage population which is not recruited to the muscle until later in the regenerative process&#x02014;a defect in this monocyte population therefore does not explain the early neutrophil recruitment defect but requires further investigation in the later stages of regeneration.</p><p>Although the precise mechanisms responsible for attracting inflammatory cells into damaged tissues remain unclear, mice with engineered mutations in MCP-1 or its receptor CCR2 display impaired skeletal muscle regeneration after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C42">42</xref>). Interestingly, not only inflammatory cells but also satellite cells are responsible for cytokine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C43">43</xref>). We demonstrated that MCP-1 release from dysferlin-deficient myoblasts was significantly reduced relative to wild-type. It is already established that dysferlin translocates to the membrane in response to injury and is responsible for the fusion of vesicles with the sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP121C45">45</xref>). Our findings implicate dysferlin in the process of cytokine/chemokine release upon muscle injury.</p><p>Establishing a link between any postulated molecular mechanism of disease and the end point of <italic>in vivo</italic> pathology is crucial to the development of targeted therapeutics. Our work emphasises failure of ongoing muscle regeneration and maintenance in addition to the acute response to sarcolemmal damage.

The cells were cultured on collagen-coated flasks at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator and the growth medium was changed every 2 days. After four to five passages, most of the fibroblasts were eliminated from the culture and myoblasts were grown by replacing the F-10 based growth medium to F-10/DMEM-based primary myoblast growth medium (40% of Ham&#x02019;s F-10, 40% of DMEM, 20% fetal calf serum, 2.5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin). For fusion assays, the medium was substituted with DMEM containing 5% horse serum and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin. Primary myoblasts were cultured in a 24 well plate for 2 days before stimulation with 200 U/ml IFN-&#x003b3; or wounding with 0.005% saponin. The medium and cells were harvested 24 h after stimulation and MCP-1 concentration was analyzed by ELISA (R&#x00026;D Systems).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp121/DC1">Supplementary Material is available at <italic>HMG</italic> online.</ext-link></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="ddp121_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="ddp121_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank Neil Hamilton and Steve Smith for technical support, Dr Clare Jeffray and Dr Ian Gibb (Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle) for performing the CK analysis, Professors John Harris and Clarke Slater for their advice concerning notexin, Dr Emilie Groen for an initial analysis of the LGMD2A data, Professor John Mathers for use of the treadmill, Ian Dimmick and Dr Rebecca Stewart for help with flow cytometry, Dr Andrew Roddam (University of Oxford) for help and advice with the statistical analysis and Dr Paul Sharp (Imperial College, London) for training in the <italic>in situ</italic> force measurement protocol.
