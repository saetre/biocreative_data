In addition to the genetic changes caused by this DNA damage, such tumors often contain epigenetically silenced genes with aberrant promoter region CpG island DNA hypermethylation. We herein explore the relationships between such DNA damage and epigenetic gene silencing using an experimental model in which we induce a defined double strand break in an exogenous promoter construct of the E-cadherin CpG island, which is frequently aberrantly DNA hypermethylated in epithelial cancers. Following the onset of repair of the break, we observe recruitment to the site of damage of key proteins involved in establishing and maintaining transcriptional repression, namely SIRT1, EZH2, DNMT1, and DNMT3B, and the appearance of the silencing histone modifications, hypoacetyl H4K16, H3K9me2 and me3, and H3K27me3. Although in most cells selected after the break, DNA repair occurs faithfully with preservation of activity of the promoter, a small percentage of the plated cells demonstrate induction of heritable silencing. The chromatin around the break site in such a silent clone is enriched for most of the above silent chromatin proteins and histone marks, and the region harbors the appearance of increasing DNA methylation in the CpG island of the promoter. During the acute break, SIRT1 appears to be required for the transient recruitment of DNMT3B and subsequent methylation of the promoter in the silent clones. Taken together, our data suggest that normal repair of a DNA break can occasionally cause heritable silencing of a CpG island&#x02013;containing promoter by recruitment of proteins involved in silencing. Furthermore, with contribution of the stress-related protein SIRT1, the break can lead to the onset of aberrant CpG island DNA methylation, which is frequently associated with tight gene silencing in cancer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Human cancers contain epigenetic changes as well as DNA mutations that play a role in abnormal silencing of tumor suppressor genes. In contrast to DNA mutations that change the sequence of DNA, epigenetic changes cause abnormal silencing of genes through DNA methylation via the addition of methyl groups to DNA and through modifications to the associated chromatin proteins. One important event in tumor initiation and progression is the exposure of cells to DNA damage during events such as chronic inflammation and carcinogen exposure. We hypothesized that such damage may play a role in producing chromatin alterations, which could initiate epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Here we show, using an exogenous gene promoter model, that key proteins involved in epigenetic silencing are recruited to the DNA near a double strand break. Occasionally, sustained localization of these proteins to the gene promoter leads to silencing of the associated gene and to the seeding and spreading of DNA methylation within the promoter that further stabilizes the silencing. This finding suggests that DNA damage may directly contribute to the large number of epigenetically silenced genes in tumors.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic inflammation along with aging causes an increase in reactive oxygen species that induces DNA damage in the form of base oxidation, single stand breaks, and double strand breaks (DSBs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Bjelland1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In response to DSBs, cells undergo cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.

In general, acetylation of lysine residues induces an open chromatin configuration associated with gene expression, whereas deacetylation induces closed, compact chromatin associated with transcriptional repression. The amino-terminal tails of both histones H3 and H4 contain several lysine residues that can be acetylated by histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and deacetylated by histone deacetylases (HDACs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Roth1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-deRuijter1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Specifically, mutational studies have indicated that lysine 16 of histone H4 (H4K16) and lysines 9, 14, and 18 of H3 are critical in silencing and are all acetylated in active chromatin and hypoacetlyated in transcriptionally-repressive chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Hecht1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Thompson1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Histone methylation also plays a role in chromatin dynamics with mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of H3K4 being associated with active chromatin, and alternatively with mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of H3K9 and H4K20 and di- and tri-methylation of H3K27 being associated with closed chromatin and gene silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Jenuwein1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Kirmizis1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It has become increasingly apparent that DNA repair must be intimately involved with regulation of chromatin. For the repair of DSBs there is an access, repair, restore (ARR) hypothesis wherein chromatin after a DSB is first modified to generate an open chromatin structure allowing access to the DNA by repair proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Green1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

SIRT1 recruited transiently to the DNA near the break (SCE PCR) increased from the 4 hour time point to the 4&#x0002b;16 hour time point. The highest recruitment levels correspond to when the DNA begins to be repaired in our experimental design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g002">Figure 2B</xref> &#x02013; right lower panel). A lesser and earlier increase occurred at the downstream TK gene site which persisted to a varying degree over 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g002">Figure 2B</xref> &#x02013; right lower panel). Importantly, H4K16ac, the residue that SIRT1 is known to deacetylate, shows an early increase in enrichment at 4 hours followed by a decrease at the 4&#x0002b;4 hour time point, particularly at the SCE site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g002">Figure 2B</xref> &#x02013; upper right panel). The most significant decrease in the enrichment of H4K16ac corresponds to the sharp increase in SIRT1 recruitment at the 4&#x0002b;16 hour time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g002">Figure 2B</xref> &#x02013; compare right upper and lower panels). We also looked for other silent chromatin marks at the break site. Importantly with respect to participation of SIRT1, we demonstrated a strong enrichment of H3K27me3, the mark catalyzed by the EZH2 enzyme in PRC4 in the absence of histone H1, again primarily to the area near the break site. There was also a less substantial enrichment of the repressive mark K9H3me2 at the SCE region at the 4&#x0002b;16 hour time point and in the TK region at the 4 hour time point of I-SceI induction. In addition, H3K9me3 increased sharply in the same TK region at the 4&#x0002b;4 hour time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-1000155-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000155.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>DSB damage and/or repair induces the transient recruitment of SIRT1, DNMT1, and DNMT3B.</title><p>(A) Cells were treated with tet as indicated, crosslinked and sonicated for ChIP.

In previous studies, using a model of UVA laser microirradiation, the DNA methylation catalyzing enzyme DNMT1 has been shown to be localized grossly to the regions irradiated immediately following damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Mortusewicz1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we looked for localization of this maintenance DNA methylation enzyme plus the de novo DNMT, 3B, to the break site. DNMT1 was localized to the break, in modest increases, mostly at the 4&#x0002b;4 hour time point for both the SCE and TK regions and interestingly this enrichment is maintained at the SCE site only at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). On the other hand, DNMT3B was localized to the break site only early in the time course. Enrichment was demonstrated at the 4 hour time point only at the SCE region and at both the SCE and TK regions at the 4&#x0002b;4 hour time point when the I-SceI enzyme expression is the highest and the DNA is undergoing cutting.</p><p>We next looked to further understand the potential interactive roles of the demonstrated recruitment of SIRT1, the DNMTs, and histone modifications to the promoter in the function and DNA methylation of the promoter. We initially focused on the role of SIRT1 in the kinetics of break repair by knocking down levels of this protein. By western blot, overall levels of cellular SIRT1 were significantly knocked down in SIRT1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) treated cells versus the non-target (NT) treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition to its role in deacetylating histones SIRT1 can also deacetylate p53, and we used this latter modification to further monitor the efficacy of our knockdown. In the SIRT1 knockdown cells there is a significant increase in acetyl lysine 382 p53 consistent with SIRT1 depletion. Importantly, in MDA-MB-231 cells, p53 contains a point mutation that makes the protein non-functional, so this increase in acetyl p53 has no functional consequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-OConnor1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pgen-1000155-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000155.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Effects of knockdown of SIRT1 by siRNA.</title><p>(A) Cells were transiently transfected for three consecutive days with non-target siRNA (NT) or SIRT1 siRNA (SIRT1), treated with tetracycline to induce HA-I-SceI as indicated, and crosslinked and sonicated for ChIP analyses.

Input DNA was used from the ChIP samples from (B). PCR was performed using primers on either side of the cut site with the 3&#x02032; primer being unique to the exogenous E-cad promoter. PCR using genomic GAPDH primers is used as a loading control. The average change in PCR across the break site over GAPDH was quantitated by gel densitometry for four PCRs with error bars indicating standard error (bottom panel).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000155.g003"/></fig><p>In our SIRT1 knockdown studies, it is first important to note that the kinetics of SIRT1 recruitment to the DSB is somewhat different from those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g002">Figure 2</xref>, possibly because the rounds of transfection necessary for the siRNA knockdown additionally stress the cells. Thus, in the non-target control (NT) cells, SIRT1 recruitment is seen at the SCE and TK sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g003">Figures 3B and C</xref>) earlier than in the studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, peaking at 4 hours, and being maintained over 48 hours. Even though, in the SIRT1 knock down studies, there is a striking reduction of overall levels of the cellular SIRT1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), the reduction at the SCE and TK sites, relative to that in the control NT cells, was less severe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g003">Figure 3B and C</xref>). However, this reduction did correlate with changes in levels of H4K16ac. Thus, overall, SIRT1 localization appeared delayed at the promoter region in the SIRT1 knockdown cells as compared to the NT cells, and this correlated with sustained enrichment of the H4K16ac mark early after I-SceI induction and lasting through the 4&#x0002b;16 hour time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, at the 4&#x0002b;24 hour time point where we see late enrichment of SIRT1 at the SCE site in the knockdown cells, H4K16ac levels are again reduced, suggesting that the level of acetylation of H4K16 is dependent on SIRT1 recruitment to the break site and the SIRT1 knockdown has a functional consequence. In addition, there was a modest early decrease (4 and 4&#x0002b;4 hour time points) of SIRT1 at the TK site, and this correlated with increased H4K16ac at the 4&#x0002b;4 hour and 4&#x0002b;16 hour time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The most informative local result for SIRT1 knockdown appears to be the levels of H4K16ac as discussed above. The persistent high levels of H4K16ac recruitment through the 4&#x0002b;16 time point in the knockdown cells demonstrate the effect of the SIRT1 knockdown at the chromatin near the break site.</p><p>We performed ChIP for phospho-H2AX in knockdown cells to see if the kinetics of phospho-H2AX recruitment to, and removal from, the break site were altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). In the SIRT1 knockdown cells, the levels of phospho-H2AX recruitment at the SCE site were distinctly diminished by ChIP but had the same overall time frame of recruitment and loss as in the NT cells. Importantly, for the levels of knock down of SIRT1 achieved, and with the delayed recruitment of SIRT1 to the break site, there did not appear to be a significant effect on the kinetics of repair as analyzed by our PCR assay using primers that are on either side of the cut site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the potential role of SIRT1 in recruitment of the PcG mark H3K27me3 and the recruitment of EZH2, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the mark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Kuzmichev2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. In the NT cells, EZH2 was enriched in the promoter and in the body of the gene at the 4 hour time point and, to a greater extent, at the 4&#x0002b;4 hour time point in the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). H3K27me3, correspondingly, was enriched in the promoter and the body of the gene at these time points, directly corresponding to the localization of EZH2. Interestingly, in the SIRT1 knockdown cells there was an increased enrichment of EZH2 in the promoter at 4 hours as compared to NT knockdown cells, but similar levels of H3K27me3 over the entire time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). In contrast, in the TK gene, EZH2 enrichment was sharply increased at the 4 and 4&#x0002b;4 hour time points in the SIRT1 knockdown as compared to the NT cells and, correspondingly, the H3K27me3 mark was greater at all time points in the body of the gene. Thus, even modest SIRT1 knockdown appears to increase the magnitude of recruitment of EZH2 to the break region downstream to the actual cut site. Recruitment of H3K27me3 in the promoter of both the NT and SIRT1 knockdown cells decreased at 4&#x0002b;16 hours but increased again at 4&#x0002b;24 hours. This later increase may be indicative of some persistent double strand breaks. Alternatively, this increase may reflect altered kinetics observed selectively in the knockdown experiments. Both the NT and SIRT1 knockdown cells have similar H3K27me3 enrichment whereas the non-siRNA treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g002">Figure 2</xref>) show no enrichment for this modification at this later time point.</p><fig id="pgen-1000155-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000155.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Changes in enrichment of silencing proteins and chromatin marks with knockdown of SIRT1.</title><p>(A) Changes in ChIP results at the SCE site with SIRT1 knockdown.

In the SIRT1 knockdown cells, there was a much increased enrichment of DNMT1 which occurred earlier than in the NT treated cells&#x02014;at the 4 and 4&#x0002b;4 hour time point&#x02014;and persisted through the 4&#x0002b;24 hour time point in the promoter and mostly at the 4 hour time point in the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>). These data suggest that DNMT1 can be recruited, possibly to an increased degree and with slightly different timing, to the area around the break when SIRT1 levels are reduced. The most striking change, however, was that DNMT3B recruitment, even with the modest change in SIRT1 knockdown, was virtually absent in the SIRT1 knock down cells. These data suggest that SIRT1 may play a role in early recruitment of DNMT3B to the DNA around the DSB.</p><p>We next sought to further place the above findings for changes in chromatin surrounding an induced DSB into the context of genes that are DNA hypermethylated and heritably silenced in cancer&#x02014;and for which our engineered E-cad promoter region provides a model. Despite the dynamic chromatin changes and DNMT recruitment we have outlined above, we saw no evidence during the acute period of DSB repair of any induction of the cancer-related gene silencing events (i.e. loss of TK expression-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and/or DNA methylation-data not shown).

We thus tested this hypothesis for our model.</p><p>To look for selection of long term silencing events, we induced our DSB by treating the cells with tet for either 4 hours or 24 hours and then negatively selected the cells for HSVTK silencing via treatment with ganciclovir. Cells that silence the E-cad promoter do not express HSVTK and therefore are not sensitive to ganciclovir, unlike the parental, uncut cell line. After selecting one thousand cells that were either uncut or cut with ganciclovir, no clones from the uncut cells survived whereas ten clones from the 1000 cells plated from the cut cells survived. As an additional control experiment, a cell line containing the inducible I-SceI enzyme and an E-cad promoter without an I-SceI consensus cut site driving the expression of the HSVTK gene was treated with tetracycline followed by ganciclovir as above. No clones survived from this cell line (data not shown). By RTPCR expression levels, HSVTK was transcriptionally silent in the ganciclovir resistant clones from above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, one out of the ten silent clones had a portion of the promoter or gene deleted (data not shown), indicating that improper repair may result in deletion events. The rest of the silent clones appeared to have intact sequences as examined by PCR. Therefore, the frequency of silencing without deletion of HSVTK in our system is 0.9&#x00025;. We examined the promoters in two of these silent clones by ChIP at passage 5 after ganciclovir selection. There was no enrichment of SIRT1 or change in H4K16ac in the clones as compared to uncut, unselected cells (P), but there was a significant enrichment of DNMT1, DNMT3B and EZH2, along with the silent chromatin marks dimethyl and trimethyl H3K9 and H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, when the promoters were examined by ChIP at a later passage (p34 to p36 after ganciclovir selection) DNMT1 was still enriched at the promoter, but localization of DNMT3B was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). These findings suggest that the chromatin in the promoter is indeed in a silent state and that this silent state is accompanied in later passages by the presence DNMT1 but not DNMT3B.</p><fig id="pgen-1000155-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000155.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Inducing a DSB in a promoter can lead to silencing and the seeding of methylation.</title><p>(A) Cells were untreated (P) or treated for 4 hours (named A) or 24 hours (named B) with tetracycline.

DNA was isolated from uncut, unselected cells (parental) and two HSVTK silent clones (1B and 8B) at passages 1, 10, 20 and 30 after ganciclovir selection.

(E) CpG methylation spreads with passage. The E-cad promoters containing the cut site were bisulfite sequenced in HSVTK silent clones at passages 1, 10, 20 and 30 after ganciclovir selection. A mean number of methylated CpGs per bisulfite sequenced clone is reported. A minimum of 6 bisulfite clones were sequenced per HSVTK silenced clone. The means presented are determined from the data shown in (D) plus additional unmethylated clone 6B and methylated clone 3B. (F) Effects of DAC and TSA treatment on expression of HSVTK as analyzed by realtime RT-PCR. In the lesser DNA methylated clone, 1B, both drugs lead to increased TK expression, while in the more DNA methylated clone, 8B (see panels D and E), DAC induces more increased expression than TSA treatment. Parent clones, or passage 30 of HSVTK silent clones, were treated with 1 &#x000b5;M deoxyazacytidine once a day for three days or once with 300 nM TSA for 16 hours.

The parental cell line was almost completely unmethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). The HSVTK silent clones showed a varying degree of methylation. HSVTK silent clones originally treated with tet for 4 hours showed very little CpG methylation (data not shown), however, the majority of those treated with tet for 24 hours showed an increase in CpG methylation 3&#x02032; to the break site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g005">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g006">6B</xref>). To examine how methylation might change with time in the silenced clones, we bisulfite sequenced increasing passages of two HSVTK silent clones, one without and one with initial DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Clone 1B, which initially had very little methylation continued to have only a scattered change in methylation with passage. Clone 8B had initial methylation just 3&#x02032; to the break site and methylation spread with passage towards the actual break site and became quite prominent by passage 30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly, this methylation occurs in the region that is flanked by the ChIP PCR primers in the promoter (SCE), demonstrating that the DNA methylation enzymes are recruited to the region where the methylation is occurring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). To further demonstrate how the DNA methylation changes with cell passage, we calculated the mean number of methylated CpGs per bisulfite-sequenced clone per passage of selected HSVTK silent clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g005">Figure 5E</xref>).

The difference in the mean for the SIRT1 siRNA treated cells is significantly different from that of the NT siRNA treated cells (the asterisk indicates p&#x0003c;.05 by Student's T-test). (D) Model for double strand break induced silencing of a gene. Initially after a DSB occurs in the promoter of a gene H2AX is phosphorylated (orange circles) and H4K16 is acetylated (green circles) causing the chromatin to open, allowing access to the break by repair factors and a stimulation of DNA damage signaling. Then SIRT1, EZH2, DNMT1, and DNMT3B are recruited to the area around the break site resulting in a decrease in H4K16ac and an increase in H3K27me3 (purple circles). These modifications result in compaction of the chromatin around the break site possibly causing a reduction in DNA damage signaling initiated by the prior decondensation of the chromatin or preventing transcription of unrepaired DNA. In the majority of cells (99.1&#x00025;) the DNA is repaired and the chromatin returns to its original state. In a small fraction of the cells (0.9&#x00025;) the promoter becomes silenced and gene expression is lost possibly due to the persistent localization of EZH2, DNMT1, and DNMT3B to the area of the break site and the prolonged condensed chromatin. Additionally, there is a seeding of DNA methylation in the area 3&#x02032; to the break site (white circles &#x02013; unmethylated CpGs; black circles &#x02013; methylated CpGs). After passage, DNMT3B is no longer localized to the promoter but EZH2 and DNMT1 are retained. The DNA methylation continues to spread further stabilizing the silencing of the downstream gene.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000155.g006"/></fig><p>To further look at the nature of the relationships between silencing and DNA methylation, we treated one unmethylated and one DNA methylated clone with the DNA demethylation agent 5-deoxy-azacytidine (DAC) or with Trichostatin A (TSA), a type I/II histone deacetylase inhibitor. DAC treatment inhibits DNMT activity and causes re-expression of genes silenced with DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Cameron1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. It will sometimes cause this response in low expression genes which have no proximal promoter DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we and others have previously shown that TSA treatment is generally ineffective for re-expression of such silent genes, particularly when the CpG island is densely DNA methylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Cameron1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. TSA can be more effective when the DNA methylation in such genes is partial or minimal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Cameron1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, when the HSVTK silent clones are treated with TSA or DAC, the clone that has silent chromatin but no methylation (clone 1B) has re-expression of HSVTK by either treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). However, clone 8B, which has silent chromatin and increased DNA methylation, has HSVTK re-expressed by DAC treatment but to a much lesser degree with TSA. These findings suggest that at this later passage of clone 8B the partial DNA methylation plays at least some role in maintaining the silencing of the HSVTK gene.</p><p>As demonstrated above, a DSB in the promoter of a gene that is associated with transient recruitment of silencing proteins can, in occasional cells, cause long term silencing of the involved gene. Some partial DNA methylation can also be associated with such silencing and is possibly maintained by the persistence of the maintenance DNMT, DNMT1, in the region. Because we observed in the acute DSB induction studies a transient recruitment of the de novo DNMT, 3B&#x02014;which would be the best candidate to initiate any DNA methylation&#x02014;and evidence that SIRT1 may play a role in this recruitment, we sought to determine the significance of these dynamics in long term silencing. To study this, we performed our siRNA knock down of SIRT1 by treating cells with NT or SIRT1 siRNA, followed by treatment with tet for 24 hours, then selection with ganciclovir. Global SIRT1 knockdown levels were similar after tet treatment to those in the studies described earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Both NT and SIRT1 siRNA treated cells had similar numbers of surviving, silenced clones (9 and 8 out of approximately 1000 cells selected, respectively) suggesting that the amount of reduction achieved for SIRT1 recruited to the promoter during DNA damage did not alter silencing of the promoter. Next, the DNA from clones that survived ganciclovir treatment was bisulfite treated and sequenced as above. NT treated HSVTK silent clones showed a similar pattern to non-siRNA treated cells (untreated) both in terms of how many bases were DNA methylated per clone and the position where the methylation occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). Thus, CpGs 3&#x02032; to the cut site were methylated in 8 out of 9 of the clones with a mean of 3.1 methylated CpGs per clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g006">Figure 6A and 6C</xref>). In HSVTK silent clones from SIRT1 siRNA treated cells, only 2 out of 8 clones had methylated CpGs in numbers greater than those for uncut cells. This difference in the number of HSVTK silent clones with methylated CpGs versus those with unmethylated CpGs was significantly different between the SIRT1 knockdown cells and either the NT or the untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Also, the mean number of methylated CpGs per HSVTK silent clone in SIRT1 knockdown cells, 1.3, is significantly different from the number in both the NT knockdown cells, 3.1 methylated CpGs, and the cells not treated with siRNA, 3.4 methylated CpGs with p&#x0003c;.05 by Student's T-test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The above results suggest that the reduced levels of SIRT1 recruited to the break site during repair do not affect silencing of the promoter. However, possibly by playing a role in transient recruitment of DNMT3B to the DSB region, SIRT1 does appear to play a role in seeding of methylation in the promoter CpG island in occasional cells, which can then be perpetuated and expanded by the persistent presence of DNMT1.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study our data emphasize, as has been shown for some chromatin constituents by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Tamburini1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Mortusewicz1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Boulton1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Tsukamoto2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, that during normal repair of a DSB, silencing proteins are recruited to the site of DNA damage along with enrichment of their corresponding histone marks. We substantially add to these previous data by showing the involvement of the principal long term silencing complex PcG. In the ARR model of DSB repair SIRT1 and the PcG protein, EZH2, most likely play a role in the restoration phase of repair by returning chromatin back to its original more condensed state or making chromatin even more condensed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). We hypothesize that following DNA damage in our particular model involving a gene promoter region, the EZH2 catalyzed trimethylation of H3K27, plus the enrichment of the additional silencing marks, H3K9me2 and H3K9me3, may all lead to a transient silencing of the gene in order to make sure the DNA repair is complete before transcription can resume and/or to a compaction of the chromatin that blunts the DNA damage signaling stimulated by the initial opening of the chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Murga1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>During the normal process of DSB repair the association of the above proteins and histone marks with the DSB appears to be transient for most cells, returning to low or absent baseline levels after repair has occurred. This is true in our exogenous gene promoter region, even in a tumor cell which involves a promoter sequence that frequently is DNA hypermethylated and abnormally, heritably silenced in cancer. However, and important to the model for how abnormal CpG island DNA hypermethylation and gene silencing might occur in cancer, we have demonstrated that induction of a break in the promoter of a gene can infrequently lead to long term silencing of that gene. Silencing could occur because, occasionally, there is permanent association of the silencing factors to the break or at least proteins that are important for establishing an epigenetic memory for silencing. Additionally, in cells with such retained silenced promoters, there appears to be an early seeding of CpG methylation that spreads over time and which potentially can, then, contribute to a more stable silencing of the promoter.</p><p>This work suggests that a DSB occurring in the promoter of a gene may be an initiating event for the silencing of the promoter, leading to a mechanism by which oxidative or other DNA damage can induce epigenetic silencing, including promoter CpG island DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes.

Furthermore, we have hypothesized from studies of cancer progression, including the very early appearance of many DNA hypermethylated genes, that this PcG component is particularly important for the vulnerability of genes to the abnormal DNA methylation during cancer evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Ohm2">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. In turn, we have wondered whether settings that are high risk for cancer development, such as chronic inflammation which exposes cells to a significant amount of DNA damage, collaborate with the PcG chromatin for such DNA methylation recruitment. Our present study further points to this possibility and links SIRT1 to the process, especially to recruitment of DNA methylation. The findings suggest that a DSB occurring in the promoter of a gene may initiate epigenetic silencing in occasional cells and this silencing, in turn, could contribute risk of tumor development.</p><p>Our present link of SIRT1 and PcG to the DNMTs during DNA damage repair brings up important issues regarding whether these proteins form a complex during DNA repair or are recruited independently to the break site. A PcG complex, termed PRC4, containing SIRT1 and EZH2, has previously been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Kuzmichev3">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, SIRT1 has been found to co-localize and to be co-immunoprecipitated with DNMT1 at rRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Espada1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>and it has been hypothesized that the DNMTs may be recruited to DNA through interaction with PcG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Schlesinger1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Vire1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. Although SIRT1 and EZH2 appear to be recruited to the break site in the same time frame, EZH2 is still recruited, and possibly even more so, when SIRT1 is knocked down, suggesting that its recruitment is not dependent on SIRT1. There are higher levels of EZH2 enrichment in the TK gene in the SIRT1 knockdown cells in contrast to relatively low EZH2 enrichment in the TK gene in the non-target knock down cells. The presence of higher levels of EZH2 and H3K27me3 may be an attempt to further compact the DNA in the absence of high levels of SIRT1 or to turn off the DNA damage signal which may have been initiated by histone acetylation and therefore maintained in the SIRT1 knockdown cells. Intriguingly, an important and novel finding in our studies is that the seeding of the DNA methylation appears highly dependent on SIRT1 presence during the acute DNA damage and repair interval and seems likely to involve a role for SIRT1 in the transient localization of the de novo DNMT, 3B, during repair. It is unclear from this work whether this recruitment of DNMT3B is because of a direct interaction with SIRT1. After DNA damage, the earliest time points of SIRT1 recruitment (4 and 4&#x0002b;4 hours-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) correspond to the time points where we demonstrate enrichment of DNMT3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000155-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). However, DNMT3B is not enriched at later time points where SIRT1 recruitment is the greatest. As an alternative to a direct physical interaction between SIRT1 and DNMT3B, SIRT1 could affect DNMT3B localization to the cut site indirectly by playing a critical role in a complex that forms at the break site or by modifying another protein that plays a role in DNMT3B recruitment. For example, SIRT1 knockdown appears to have the greatest effect on the persistence of H4K16ac after damage. Acetyl H4K16 is a critical residue for chromatin formation, with deactylation of this residue being associated with tight compaction of chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-ShogrenKnaak1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. Its status could influence other histone modifications through composition of the complex formed at the break site that could potentially contain HATs, HDACs, HMTs, and/or histone demethylases. A change in these other histone modifications could in turn influence DNMT3B recruitment. Unlike DNMT3B, DNMT1 localization is independent of SIRT1, suggesting that DNMT1 is recruited through a different mechanism. Further studies need to be performed to identify how silencing complexes formed at sites of DNA damage precisely involve interactions between SIRT1, EZH2 and other PcG components, and the DNMTs and whether such interactions are operative in other transcriptional silencing processes.</p><p>Recently Cuozzo et al also demonstrated that DNMT1 is associated with chromatin, after DNA damage, specifically after repair by HR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Cuozzo1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. After HR, some DNA methylation occurs that plays a role in silencing the recombined genes. This silencing is dependent on DNMT1 and reversed by treatment with DAC. Interestingly, this paper showed induced methylation localized 200 to 300 bp 3&#x02032; of the break site, similar to the degree and relative localization of DNA methylation in our model cut site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Cuozzo1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. We extend these findings by showing that with passage this methylation can be expanded, increasing from approximately 4 methylated CpGs to 10&#x02013;13 methylated CpGs in 30 passages. We suggest that our current findings provide molecular support for our previous model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Ohm2">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref> concerning how this expansion occurs in tumors. An event occurs in a cell that causes an initial seeding of methylation at a promoter, and over time during tumor progression, this methylation spreads and contributes to progressive stable silencing of the involved promoter. A similar model exists for transient &#x0201c;hit and run&#x0201d; silencing of a promoter construct by a transcription repression complex leading to cell clones with retained silencing, even in the absence of the original complex, and progressive spread of DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Ayyanathan1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Another intriguing finding from our work is the different potential roles of DNMT1 and DNMT3B in silencing. Both are found to be transiently recruited to the site of DNA damage, albeit with slightly different timing. In terms of normal DNA repair, this transient recruitment of DNMT1 and DNMT3B to the break site may be part of a universal mechanism used during DNA damage repair to restore the correct DNA methylation code to the area around the break. However, this may be more for areas widely flanking the break in our model situation since the CpG island of gene promoters like the one we are using are generally maintained free of DNA methylation in normal cells. Alternatively, in the transient setting, these proteins could perform a silencing role without using their DNA methylating capacity since multiple studies suggest these proteins have transcriptional repression potential independent of their ability to catalyze DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Rountree1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Fuks1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>. Although DNMT1 is predominantly a maintenance DNMT, it has been demonstrated to have some de novo methyltransferase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Vertino1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Jair1">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>, while DNMT3A and DNMT3B are thought to be the predominate de novo methyltransferases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Okano1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>. Our present work supports the thought that these enzymes can work together at different phases of methylation initiation, maintenance, and spreading. We only detect seeding of methylation when DNMT3B is present at the cut site and do not observe seeding when only DNMT1 is present. Additionally, at early passages of the clones that have silenced the promoter containing the cut site, both DNMT1 and DNMT3B are present. However, at later passages, enrichment of DNMT3B is lost even though the methylation is still expanding. We were not able to detect enrichment of DNMT3A either transiently or in our silent clones. It is unclear however whether these results are due to a lack of recruitment or a sensitivity issue for the antibody used for ChIP. These findings suggest that DNMT3B is important for the initial seeding of methylation, while DNMT1 is needed for de novo activity in expanding and maintaining the sites of DNA methylation.</p><p>With respect to DNA repair, chromatin modifications are important in the specific steps of repair of DSBs. Phospho-H2AX is required for the recruitment of the chromatin remodeling complex INO80 that most likely plays a role in repositioning nucleosomes around the break <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-vanAttikum1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Tsukuda1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref>. Phospho-H2AX is also necessary for the stable, concentrated recruitment of DNA repair proteins to the site of the break <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Paull1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Stucki1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to H2AX modifications, it has been demonstrated by using a pan-acetyl lysine H4 antibody that lysine residues of histone H4 are acetylated by the human TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex in response to DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Murr1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Our work supports these findings because at the 4 hour time point we see an increase in H4K16ac when compared to uncut cells. Adding to this process, we show that this initial acetylation of histone H4, specifically at lysine 16, is followed by the deacetylation of the same residue concomitant with recruitment of SIRT1 to the break site. We hypothesize that this deacetylation is important to return the chromatin back to its original state following DNA repair. Although we did not see a change in DNA repair following knockdown of SIRT1 and prolonged acetylation of H4K16, it has been demonstrated in yeast that a lack of deacetylation of H4K16 after DNA damage affects repair by the NHEJ pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Jazayeri1">&#x0005b;79&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In mammalian cells it is hard to separate a role for SIRT1 in DNA damage repair from its role in p53 regulation. SIRT1 deacetylates p53 and therefore decreases transcriptional activity of the protein. Inhibition of SIRT1 has been shown to induce apoptosis and enhance radiation sensitization, most likely because p53 acetylation is increased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Matsushita1">&#x0005b;80&#x0005d;</xref>. Loss of SIRT1 has also been shown to allow cells to bypass senescence and allow cell division without repair of DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Abdelmohsen1">&#x0005b;81&#x0005d;</xref>. While it is unclear in these previous studies how much of the effect of SIRT1 on damage sensitization and cell cycle check points is dependent on p53, our system looks at the role of this protein in DNA damage repair independent of p53. In MDA-MB-231 cells p53 is mutated so, although SIRT1 knock down causes an increase in acetyl p53, the p53 protein is non-functional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-OConnor1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Our work then directly demonstrates that SIRT1, in the absence of functional p53, is localized to the chromatin near a DSB and plays a role in recruiting DNMT3B to the vicinity.</p><p>In summary, the system of Jasin et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Rouet1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> used here uniquely allows us to determine if induction of a DSB in a promoter can lead to transcriptional silencing. In a transient setting, several factors that play a role in gene silencing are recruited to the break and, occasionally, retention of some of these factors can lead to sustained silencing, which can be associated with initiation and spreading of DNA methylation to further stabilize the silencing. Our model is important to understanding how DNA damage occurring at gene promoter sites may be one key factor in initiating abnormal epigenetic gene silencing in association with abnormal CpG island DNA methylation. In terms of cancer prevention, targeting the series of events suggested by our model at sites of chronic inflammation may be beneficial to reducing tumor formation by decreasing the silencing of the large number genes which we now know become aberrantly silenced during neoplastic progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Graff1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Baylin1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000155-Ohm2">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>.

Ten microliters of PCR product were size fractionated by PAGE and were quantified using Kodak Digital Science 1D Image Analysis software. Enrichment was calculated by taking the ratio between the net intensity of the gene promoter PCR products from each primer set for the bound, immunoprecipitated sample and the net intensity of the PCR product for the non-immunoprecipitated input sample. Values for enrichment were calculated as the average from at least three independent PCR analyses. Each ChIP experiment was performed twice.

Genomic DNA primers specific for the HSVTK gene (TK), the SCE containing CDH1 promoter (SCE), or GAPDH were used. (B) Realtime PCR was performed on DNA used in (A). Two standard curves were generated using the copy number standards, one for the TK and one for the GAPDH primers from (A). The TK copy number in the genomic DNA was normalized so the GAPDH copy number was two.
