This study focuses on Plk4, the most divergent member of the Plk family, which is necessary for proper cellular proliferation. More specifically, alterations in Plk4 levels cause significantly adverse mitotic defects including abnormal centrosome duplication and aberrant mitotic spindle formation. We sought to clarify the effect of reduced Plk4 levels on the cell by examining transcript profiles of <italic>Plk4 </italic>wild-type and heterozygous mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Subsequently, the levels of several key proteins involved in the DNA damage response were examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>143 genes were found to be significantly up-regulated in the heterozygous MEFs compared to their wild-type counterparts, while conversely, 9 genes were down-regulated. Numerous genes with increased transcript levels in heterozygous MEFs were identified to be involved in p53-dependent pathways. Furthermore, examination of the promoter regions of all up- and down-regulated genes revealed that the majority contained putative p53 responsive elements.</p><p>An analysis of transcript levels in MEFs after exposure to either ionizing or ultraviolet radiation revealed a significant change between wild type and heterozygous MEFS for Plk4 transcript levels upon only UV exposure. Furthermore, changes in protein levels of several important cell check-point and apoptosis regulators were examined, including p53, Chk1, Chk2, Cdc25C and p21. In heterozygous MEFs, p53, p21 and Chk2 protein levels were at significantly higher levels. Furthermore, p53 activity was increased 5 fold in the <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous MEFs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Global transcript profiles and levels of key proteins involved in cellular proliferation and DNA damage pathways were examined in wild-type and <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous MEFs. It was determined that Plk4 haploinsufficiency leads to changes in the levels of RNA accumulation for a number of key cellular genes as well as changes in protein levels for several important cell cycle/DNA damage proteins. We propose a model in which reduced Plk4 levels invoke an increase in p53 levels that leads to the aforementioned changes in global transcription profiles.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Plk4 (Sak), is a member of the polo-like kinase (Plk) family of serine/threonine kinases which are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, cellular response to stress such as DNA damage, and the duplication and maturation of centrosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Deregulation of the Plks by overexpression, depletion via epigenetic silencing or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has implicated them in the development of centrosome abnormalities and has been associated with a CIN (chromosomal instability) phenotype and malignancy. Plk4 is a major regulator of centriole duplication as indicated first by an increase in the number of supernumerary centrosomes correlated with Plk4 overexpression, and second, by a reduction in centriole duplication with the eventual development of mono-polar spindles upon repeated cell divisions observed after RNA interference for Plk4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Homozygous null <italic>Plk4 </italic>mice are embryonic lethal at ~E7.5 of development, with an increase in the proportion of mitotic cells, whereas <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous mice are phenotypically normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Interestingly aged <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous mice display haploinsufficiency with tumours developing at a high frequency in major sites such as the liver and lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Haploinsufficiency for Plk4 affects normal progression through the cell cycle and maintenance of the genome. For example, in a two thirds liver hepatectomy model, <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous hepatocytes had an increased rate of tri- and tetra-polar spindle complexes with frequent mitotic errors as compared to those form wild-type regenerating livers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. At 9&#x02013;12 months post-hepatectomy all the <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous mice had abnormal liver morphology and there was an increased rate of tumourigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These results suggest that Plk4 haploinsufficiency potentially leads to increased aneuploidy a likely tumour promoting event. Plk4 loss also has implications in human malignancy, where LOH for Plk4 was found in the majority of a small sample of hepatocellular carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Plks 1&#x02013;3 in general all play important roles in the regulation of the cell cycle and the DNA damage response. Furthermore, several of their respective substrates are in common, with the individual Plks likely placing their substrate under tighter or opposing control. For example, both Plk3 and Plk1 phosphorylate Cdc25C and p53 by targeting different residues in each case. Plk3 phosphorylates Cdc25C on serine 216 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], a site that is also targeted by Chk1 and Chk2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Phosphorylation of serine 216 of Cdc25C is inhibitory, which is due to sequestration of the protein phosphatase in the cytoplasm by 14-3-3 protein, thus blocking mitotic entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Human Cdc25C is phosphorylated on Ser-198 by Plk1, part of an activation amplification loop that increases the phosphatases activity to allow mitotic entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is known to inhibit p53 function by physical interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], while phosphorylation of p53 at Ser 20 by Plk3 serves to functionally link DNA damage with increased p53 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Chk2 is another protein that is phosphorylated by the Plks. Plk1 interacts with, phosphorylates and colocalizes with Chk1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], Plk3 phosphorylates Chk2 at two residues, which results in subsequent phosphorylation of Chk2 on T68 by ATM in response to DNA damage, thus upregulating Chk2 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Similar to the other Plk family members, which have established roles in DNA damage pathways, Plk4 likely functions within or is a target of DNA damage pathways. This is supported by the observation that Plk4 interacts with and phosphorylates p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Plk4 expression is repressed in a p53 dependent manner in response to DNA damaging agents, with the p53 repression of Plk4 activity occurring through the recruitment of a histone deacetylase (HDAC) transcription repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Additionally, Cdc25C, a key regulator of the entrance into mitosis and target of DNA damage proteins, is a substrate for Plk4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Significant phenotypic differences are also observed between <italic>Plk4 </italic>wild-type and heterozygous mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Contrary to what would be expected, heterozygous <italic>Plk4 </italic>MEFs display a phenotype typified by multiple centrosomes which lead to multipolar spindles, mitotic failure and delayed proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>All the evidence published to date is consistent with a model as suggested by Habendanck et al (2005) in which reduced Plk4 activity causes occasional cellular division failure as a result of aberrant centrosome duplication and subsequent mitotic spindle malformation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], This cell division failure can lead to either aneuploidy or polyploidy, which could in turn contribute to the higher incidence of tumors in heterozygous mice. As an initial step in further characterizing the effect of lower Plk4 levels on the cell, we utilized microarrays to provide a general survey of differences in the transcript profiles of <italic>Plk4 </italic>wild-type and heterozygous MEFs. Here, we report on a spectrum of genes that are upregulated or downregulated in the <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous MEFs, including the key cell cycle regulators p53, p21 and chk2 and the presence of increased p53 levels/activity as a result of Plk4 haploinsufficiency.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Establishment of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)</title><p>Mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines were established from 12.5 day old wild-type and heterozygous Plk4 embryos as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

Total RNA extracted from MEFs was subjected to microarray analysis at the University Health Network (UHN) Microarray Centre in Toronto. The samples were labeled using the UHN's standard indirect labeling protocol and hybridized to a Mouse 22.4K chip.

For example, heterozygous MEFs exhibit a growth rate approaching one half that of their wild-type counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Many of these cells contain multiple centrosomes, micronuclei and mitotic defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In the present study we examined the cell cycle profiles of <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous MEFs in comparison to wild-type MEFs and found that the heterozygous MEFS displayed a decrease in cells in G0/G1 and an increase in the number of cells in G2/M (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These results suggest that Plk4 haploinsufficiency may also lead to impaired progression through the cell cycle with the potential to lead to abnormal chromosomal alignment and segregation. Plk4 haploinsufficiency and loss of heterozygosity have also been implicated in the development of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in mice and humans respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cell cycle profile of <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous and wild-type MEFs</bold>.

In order to accomplish this, we utilized independent cultures of asynchronously growing age matched <italic>Plk4 </italic>wild-type and heterozygous MEFs in three replicates. Quantification and normalization of the data was performed using "The Institute for Genomic Research" (TIGR) TM4 microarray data analysis suite. Normalization and filtering of the data was performed using the TIGR Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) application. Analysis of all microarray data sets for the different microarray experiments (ex. Wild-type <italic>Plk4 </italic>MEFs vs Heterozygous <italic>Plk4 </italic>MEFs) were performed independently.</p><p>K-means clustering analysis was performed using TIGR Multiexperiment Viewer (MEV). Within each cluster, genes having a log ratio value greater than 1 or less than -1 on each microarray chip were identified. Genes having a log ratio greater than 1 represented genes in the heterozygous MEFs that have at least a two fold increase in gene expression. As the wild-type MEFs was used as the control, genes with a log ratio greater than 1 were classified as up-regulated in the heterozygous MEFs and genes with a log ratio less -1 represented genes in the wild-type MEFs that have at least a two fold increase in gene expression or are down-regulated in the heterozygous MEFs.</p><p>From the microarray data, 9 genes were identified as having at least a two-fold decrease in transcript levels in the heterozygous MEFs when compared to the wild-type control (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), while 143 genes were identified as having at least a two-fold increase in transcript levels in the heterozygous MEFs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). We ordered these genes within each functional group based on the average fold difference between <italic>Plk4 </italic>wild-type and heterozygous MEFs. In order to test the validity of the microarray results we assessed transcript levels for Plk4 and three arbitrary genes with at least a two-fold increase in expression by qualitative RT-PCR.

All the microarray data has been deposited into the MIAME database under accession number E-MEXP-2161.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The presumed major cellular function for each down or up-regulated gene was identified using annotation data from the PubMed database, and/or the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. Furthermore, we utilized GenMAPP 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and Panther [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] to identify global biological trends in our gene expression data. The few genes that were downregulated in <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous MEFs functionally included genes involved in development and metabolism. Far more genes were upregulated than were downregulated in the heterozygous MEFs. These included genes with a spectrum of known functions such as cell cycle control, the DNA damage response, DNA repair, epigenetic modification, development, and transcription/translation. In particular, several key genes involved in p53 dependent pathways, Rho signaling, Wnt signaling and the proteasome were upregulated in the heterozygous MEFs. Several of these genes have been implicated in malignancy and are of particular interest given the increased rate of malignancy previously identified in <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous mice. This includes securin (<italic>Pttg1</italic>) which serves to prevent premature chromosome separation through inhibition of separase activity. Securin is involved in several key cellular events including mitosis, cell cycle progression, DNA repair and apoptosis. Furthermore, securin (<italic>Pttg1</italic>) is upregulated in several malignancies and in particularly, pituitary adenomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Casein Kinase II (Csnk2a1), a serine/threonine kinase is a positive regulator of Wnt signalling pathway that is also upregulated in most cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Pic3c2a) is an upstream regulator of Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], both of which are aberrantly regulated in many cancer types and as such are prime targets for intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], Wisp1 overexpression has been implicated in cellular morphological transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The observation that the expression levels of genes involved in p53 dependent pathways were altered, coupled with the known interaction of p53 with Plk4, and since changes in p53 levels, like Plk4, may also contribute to centrosome abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], led us to further analyze this result. We therefore analyzed the promoter region of both the up and downregulated genes utilizing the MAPPER search engine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and found that the majority of these genes contained numerous p53 responsive elements within the first 5 kilobases upstream of the transcriptional start site. Furthermore, several of these upregulated genes are known p53 targets (including <italic>msh2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]) or affect the p53 transcriptional machinery (like CDK8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title>The effect of ionizing and ultraviolet radiation on the Plk4 transcript and protein profiles in MEFs</title><p>The Plks are known components of DNA damage pathways, affecting levels and activity of a number of key proteins including p53, Chk2, Cdc25C and others. Plk4 is known to interact with proteins involved in the response to DNA damage including p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], Cdc25C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and Chk2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. This characteristic, coupled with the observation that many of the upregulated genes contain numerous p53 responsive elements within their promoter, led us to examine the effect of DNA damaging agents on the levels of key genes involved in the DNA damage response in the context of Plk4 levels. Wild-type and heterozygous MEFs were exposed to 25 Gy IR or 40 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>UV and changes in transcript levels were analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In response to IR, we found no significant difference in Plk4 transcript levels between wild-type and heterozygous MEFs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In contrast, upon exposure to UV, there is a striking difference in transcript profile levels of Plk4 between <italic>Plk4 </italic>wild-type and heterozygous MEFs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Initially, post exposure to UV, Plk4 transcripts are undetectable in both wild-type and heterozygous MEFs. Interestingly two hours post UV exposure plk4 transcripts levels in the wild-type MEFs returned to control levels and then subsequently increase to 40% greater expression, while no Plk4 transcripts are detectable in the heterozygous MEFs. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect Plk4 protein in these MEFs with the commercially available antibodies. As our array results suggest that p53 activity may be increased in the <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygotes, we were therefore interested in examining p53 protein levels. We found a sharp contrast between wild-type and heterozygous MEFs, with levels of p53 protein expression substantially higher in the heterozygotes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). These results would seem to suggest that the levels of p53 in the heterozygous MEFs may be the result of DNA damage that occurs as a result of genomic instability. We also examined p53 levels in these cells after exposure to DNA damaging agents based on the differences found for Plk4 transcript levels 6 hrs post exposure. In the case of UV we did not see any additional increase in the level of p53 protein compared to the <italic>Plk4 </italic>wild-type and heterozygote controls. In contrast, the levels of p53 in the wild-type MEFs increased to the heterozygote levels when exposed to IR. The levels were stabilized at close to maximal levels for these conditions and increased insignificantly. Results displayed are the representative data from three independent experiments. We subsequently examined the levels of a number of known cell cycle control and DNA damage response proteins. Chk2, which is known to aid in the maintenance of sustained G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>/M arrest, and apoptosis by phosphorylating p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], was also at much higher levels in the heterozygous MEFs pretreatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). Upon exposure to UV or ionizing radiation the levels of Chk2 were elevated in both wild-type and heterozygous MEFs. We next examined the levels of p21, a downstream effector and transcriptional target of p53 and found that the levels were increased in <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygote MEFs when compared to wild-type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). Consistent with this result, in our microarray data, p21 transcript levels were also upregulated 1.95 times (just below our arbitrarily chosen 2 fold cut-off) in the <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous MEFs. Additionally, six hours post DNA damage we observed a substantial increase in p21 levels in the wild-type MEFs, while there was no further increase apparent in the heterozygous MEFs post DNA damage. The observation that p21 protein and transcript levels were elevated in the heterozygous MEFs again corresponds with the aforementioned increased levels of p53. Furthermore, it is also consistent with the increased levels of CDK8 transcripts found in the heterozygous MEFs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). CDK8 binding to p53 target genes is known to correlate positively with transcriptional strength. CDK8 is recruited to the <italic>p21 </italic>locus during conditions of strong p21 transcriptional activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We found minimal differences in the detectable levels of Cdc25C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>) and Chk1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3e</xref>) prior to or post treatment.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of protein levels upon DNA damage between heterozygous and wild-type MEFs</bold>.

Since we observed a large decrease in the level of plk4 transcripts in heterozygous MEFs upon UV exposure and since UV is a more effective inducer of both p53 activity and apoptosis than IR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] we examined the levels of apoptosis after UV treatment. Interestingly, we found no significant difference in the levels of apoptosis for wild-type and heterozygous MEFs prior to or post treatment with UV (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). While we were surprised that there was no difference in the level of apoptosis between wild-type and heterozygous MEFs, it is consistent with the elevated level of Wisp1 mRNA seen in the heterozygous MEFs. Wisp1 is known to attenuate p53 mediated apoptosis through the activation of PKB/Akt anti-apoptotic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This results in the protection of cells from the late stages of p53 mediated apoptosis. Additionally, while the cell cycle profiles of wild-type and heterozygous MEFs were different without treatment, their respective responses to UV irradiation were similar with an overall increase in the Sub G0 population post exposure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Assessment of levels of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in heterozygous and wild-type <italic>Plk4 </italic>MEFs</bold>. <bold>A.)

In order to address the possibility that elevated p53 levels may be correlated with a senescent phenotype in the <italic>Plk4</italic> heterozygous MEFs, we stained the cells for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity from passages 2&#x02013;5 (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). We found no evidence of increased &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in the <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterzoygous MEFs relative to the wild type MEFs; thus suggesting that the elevated p53 protein levels in the <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous MEFs were not correlated with an increase in cellular senescence.</p><p>p53 accumulation and activity is regulated by post-translational modification of at least 20 sites via protein phosphorylation and/or other post-translational modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. As previously stated, the p53 protein levels are markedly increased in the <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous MEFs compared to wild-type. It was therefore of interest to determine whether the increase in p53 levels was also accompanied by an increase in p53 activity. In order test this possibility we utilized an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure p53 transcriptional activity in our <italic>Plk4 </italic>wild-type and heterozygous MEFS. Interestingly, in agreement with the presence of p53 responsive elements in the genes that were upregulated in the array data, we observed a 5 fold increase in p53 activity in the heterozygous MEFs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>p53 activity and model of Plk4 and p53 interactions in <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous MEFs</bold>. <bold>A.) Effect of Plk4 haploinsufficiency on p53 activity</bold>. p53 transcriptional activity was analyzed in Plk4 heterozygous and wild-type MEFs from nuclear extracts using a capture ELISA assay. The p53 specificity was confirmed upon incubation with competing labeled and unlabeled oligonucleotides. The results were normalized against wild-type control and are representative of three independent experiments. <bold>B.) Model of p53 and Plk4 regulation in <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous and wild-type MEFs</bold>. Shown are proposed Plk4/p53 direct/indirect interactions in <italic>Plk4 </italic>wild-type and heterozygous MEFs with the resultant corresponding changes in protein levels, activity and gene expression. Solid lines indicate pathways that are functionally active, whereas dotted lines indicate pathways with reduced activity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-10-319-5"/></fig><p>We propose that the increased p53 protein levels and activity that occur as a result of Plk4 haploinsufficiency may in turn contribute to the over-expression of numerous genes containing p53 responsive elements within their promoters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). The function of these genes encompasses a spectrum of cellular activities including cell cycle control and the response to DNA damage. The results suggest that one function of Plk4 phosphorylation of p53 may be with respect to p53 protein stability and/or activity. In this scenario the possibility exists that this arises through a direct effect in which lower Plk4 levels result in reduced phosphorylation of p53 by Plk4 thus leading to an increase in protein p53 stability and activity. Alternatively, the presence of supernumerary centrosomes seen in <italic>Plk4 </italic>heterozygous MEFs may lead to an increase in genomic instability and the induction of checkpoints to deal with the ensuing DNA damage. Very few targets for Plk4 have been identified thus far. However, the possibility exists that the increased levels of p53 and phenotypic changes observed occur as a result of indirect consequences of Plk4 haploinsufficiency and targeting of other substrates. For example, one known plausible indirect effect of Plk4 haploinsufficiency could be through Chk2. Plk4 both interacts with and phosphorylates Chk2, a key regulator of the DNA damage response and p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Conceivably, reduced phosphorylation of Chk2 as a result of lower Plk4 levels may result in altered Chk2 levels and/or activity towards p53 thus resulting in p53's increased stability or activity. This is consistent with the observation that Chk2 levels are greatly increased in the heterozygous MEFs and the observation that the cell cycle profiles of heterozygous MEFs are altered.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Plk4 haploinsufficiency leads to changes in the levels of RNA accumulation for a number of key cellular genes as well as changes in protein levels for several important cell cycle/DNA damage proteins. The majority of the upregulated genes have numerous p53 responsive elements within their promoter regions, thus suggesting that Plk4 haploinsuficiency directly or indirectly leads to an increase in p53 activity in MEFs. Further studies should reveal the nature of the relationship between Plk4 levels, p53 and the down and upregulated genes found in <italic>Plk4</italic> heterozygous MEFs.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>Cdc25C: Cell division cycle 25 homolog C; CDK8: Cyclin dependent kinase 8; Csnk2a1: Casein Kinase II; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HDAC: Histone deacetylase; LOH: Loss of heterozygosity; MEFs: Mouse embryonic fibroblasts; MEV: Multiexperiment viewer; MIDAS: Microarray Analysis System; OMIM: Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man; Pic3c2a: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Plk: Polo-like kinase; Plk4: Polo-like Kinase 4; RT-PCR: reverse trancription polymerase chain reaction; Sak-Snk/Plk-akin kinase; SAP30BP: Sap 30 binding protein; Sart1: Squamous cell carcinoma antigen recognized by T-cells; TIGR: The Institute for Genomic Research; TUNEL: TdT mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling; UHN: University Health Network; UV: Ultraviolet; WISP1: Wnt Inducible Signaling Pathway protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AM carried out the initial isolation of MEFs, along with the RNA isolation, RT-PCR, microarray data analysis and Western blot analysis of proteins of interest.
