It is widely accepted that mRNA decay is initiated by a series of endonucleolytic cleavages catalysed by RNase E, or occasionally by RNase III, followed by processive exonucleolytic degradation of the message. The <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA, which encodes ribosomal protein S15, has been used as a model for the study of mRNA decay. An RNase E cleavage located 10 nucleotides downstream of the coding sequence (M2 site) initiates the mRNA decay by removing the 3&#x02032; stabilizing terminal hairpin that protects the mRNA against the attack of exonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c1">1</xref>). The body of the messenger is then further degraded by the combined actions of poly(A) polymerase I (PAP I), polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) and RNase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c3">3</xref>). Poly(A) tails were detected at the termini of nascent terminated mRNA, and at the end of decay intermediates produced by endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c4">4</xref>). Poly(A) tails promote decay of <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA and of other structured RNAs by providing an unstructured 3&#x02032; end, to which 3&#x02032; exonucleases bind &#x0005b;for a review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c5">5</xref>)&#x0005d;. The degradation is controlled by RNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c6">6</xref>), RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c7">7</xref>), ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c9">9</xref>) and secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c12">12</xref>).</p><p>The pleiotropic phenotype of <italic>hfq</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> strains shows that the Hfq protein acts on different pathways of <italic>E.coli</italic> metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c14">14</xref>). Hfq has been reported to be involved in the regulation of iron content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c16">16</xref>), the expression of the &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> subunit of RNA polymerase upon entry into stationary phase, the response to hyperosmolarity and low temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c19">19</xref>), mRNA stability at slow growth-rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c20">20</xref>) and stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c21">21</xref>), and in controlling the activity of regulatory sRNAs under stress conditions (see below). Hfq is known to stabilize some RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c22">22</xref>) and to target others for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c23">23</xref>). In the case of the <italic>ompA</italic> messenger, Hfq interferes with ribosome binding and unmasks an RNase E cleavage site, destabilizing the transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c12">12</xref>). On the other hand, Hfq stimulates processivity of poly(A) polymerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c24">24</xref>). We have shown that Hfq affects the position, frequency and length of oligo(A) tails at the 3&#x02032; end of <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c25">25</xref>). However, the failure to detect a direct interaction between Hfq and poly(A) polymerase I (M.Folichon, V.Arluison and E.Hajnsdorf, unpublished results) led us to the notion that the formation of a poly(A)&#x02013;Hfq complex may stimulate poly(A) elongation by PAP I.</p><p>Hfq affects gene expression either by interacting directly with mRNA and&#x0002f;or by promoting annealing between regulatory RNAs that it directs to target messengers. The propensity of Hfq to bind single-stranded A&#x02013;U-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c26">26</xref>) is exemplified by the direct interactions between Hfq and the OxyS, DsrA and Spot42 sRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c28">28</xref>). Hfq somehow facilitates the annealing of these riboregulators with their target mRNAs, namely the <italic>rpoS</italic>, <italic>fhlA</italic> and <italic>galK</italic> mRNAs, respectively. On the other hand, in the case of Q&#x003b2; RNA, Hfq facilitates the access of replicase, presumably by melting its 3&#x02032; end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c30">30</xref>). Similarly, Hfq binding weakens base-pairing in stem loops of OxyS sRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c31">31</xref>).</p><p>In an attempt to understand the role of Hfq in the polyadenylation of prokaryotic mRNA, we have compared the interaction between Hfq and a polyadenylated or a non-polyadenylated mRNA fragment. This fragment corresponds to the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>rpsO</italic> transcript, which has been shown to be polyadenylated both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c32">32</xref>). Measurements of dissociation constants show that Hfq exhibits a high affinity for <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA and binds more steadily to molecules harbouring poly(A) tails. Consistently, Hfq binds preferentially to poly(A) tails and interacts with an internal site located between the two hairpins of the polyadenylated RNA at higher concentrations. Moreover, we show that the poly(A) tail and the internal binding site are protected by Hfq from ribonucleases, namely PNPase, RNase II and RNase E, which are known to trigger the degradation of this mRNA in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c33">33</xref>). Our findings raise the possibility that the high affinity of Hfq for polyadenylated RNA may play a general role in RNA maturation and degradation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein purification</title><p>Hfq was overproduced from strain BL21 (DE3) transformed with pTE607 plasmid (kindly provided by T.

This RNA and its polyadenylated derivative were synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c24">24</xref>). An extended polyadenylated &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA was transcribed using a PCR-amplified template, using the following primers: 5&#x02032;-<underline>TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG</underline>AGACGTAGCACGTTACACC (upstream primer) and 5&#x02032;-GATCCCGGGATCCACCACCAT<sub>18</sub>GAAAAAAGGGGCCACTCAGG (downstream primer). Underlined nucleotides correspond to the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Transcription reactions were carried out either as described previously, yielding uniformly labelled RNA with high specific activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c24">24</xref>), or according to Ambion&#x02019;s MEGAshortscript protocol and with &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;UTP as tracer, except that 20 mmol&#x0002f;l guanosine was added to allow direct 5&#x02032;-labelling.

Due to the resolution of the preparative gel, the poly(A) size fractions contained different size distributions. Values are estimated mean values of each fraction. Poly(A) concentration was determined by spectrophotometry with the extinction coefficient taken from the Pharmacia catalogue.</p></sec><sec><title>Gel shift assays</title><p>Radiolabelled RNAs (5 pmol&#x0002f;l) were titrated against Hfq protein (15 pmol&#x0002f;l to 2 nmol&#x0002f;l, expressed as monomers) in 50 &#x000b5;l buffer containing 10 mmol&#x0002f;l Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8), 1 mmol&#x0002f;l EDTA, 80 mmol&#x0002f;l NaCl, 1&#x00025; glycerol (v&#x0002f;v), 0.01&#x00025; dodecyl maltoside (v&#x0002f;v) at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min. Reactions were loaded onto running native gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c27">27</xref>) and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The apparent dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) was determined for Hfq&#x02013;<italic>rpsO</italic> RNA complexes, assuming that complex formation obeys a simple bimolecular equilibrium and the concentration of the labelled RNA is negligible compared to Hfq concentration. In practice, the reactions were performed with protein in excess over RNA, and thus the free Hfq concentration changed little during RNA binding. Therefore, the results were plotted using the equation:</p><p>Q &#x0003d; &#x0005b;Hfq&#x0005d;&#x0002f;(<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x0002b; &#x0005b;Hfq&#x0005d;)</p><p>Q represents the fraction of labelled RNA bound to Hfq.

We used an RNA fragment corresponding to the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>rpsO</italic> transcript, which was shown to be polyadenylated both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c32">32</xref>). An 18-A tail was added to the 3&#x02032; end of this RNA for two reasons. First, it corresponds to the minimum size of the oligo(A) tails at the 3&#x02032; end of this fragment (ranging from 20 to 35 As) required to detect Hfq stimulation of poly(A) tail elongation by poly(A) polymerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c24">24</xref>). Secondly, it fits the size of the tails found at the end of total RNA, which can be up to 50 nucleotides in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c38">38</xref>). The RNA, referred to as &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA, corresponds to the last 97 nucleotides of the <italic>rpsO</italic> primary transcript, and is predicted to contain two secondary structures separated by a single-stranded region (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f2">2</xref> below). This RNA and its adenylated derivative containing an 18-residue poly(A) tail &#x0005b;&#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic>-(A)<sub>18</sub>&#x0005d; were incubated with increasing quantities of Hfq and of His<sub>6</sub>-Hfq. Overexpressed His<sub>6</sub>-Hfq had the same binding capacity as overexpressed native Hfq (data not shown), indicating that the histidine tag at the C-terminus of the protein does not perturb the RNA binding capacity of the protein. The tagged protein was used throughout this study, and is referred to as Hfq.</p><p>&#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic>-(A)<sub>18</sub> RNAs were incubated with increasing concentrations of Hfq protein. The formation of complexes was analysed by mobility shift assay. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f1">1</xref> shows that Hfq binds both non-polyadenylated and polyadenylated RNA. In both cases, two complexes were observed (referred to as Ia and IIa, and Ib and IIb in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f1">1</xref>A), the second ones (IIa and IIb) forming at higher protein concentrations. The equilibrium dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) were deduced from the strongest binding site (Ia and Ib) for both &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic>-(A)<sub>18</sub> mRNAs, assuming a bimolecular model. The apparent binding affinity of Hfq for the adenylated RNA (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 90 &#x000b1; 16 pM) is 15 times higher than that for the non-polyadenylated RNA (1.4 &#x000b1; 0.1 nM). It is likely that the binding of the protein to the poly(A) tail accounted for this difference. To address this point, we incubated Hfq with poly(A) RNA under the same conditions. We performed the titration experiment with poly(A)<sub>115</sub>, which has the same length as the polyadenylated RNA, &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic>-(A)<sub>18</sub>. The mobility shift assay revealed the appearance of distinct intermediary complexes, which presumably correspond to the sequential filling of binding sites as the protein concentration is increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f1">1</xref>A). These data suggest that Hfq binds non-cooperatively to the poly(A)<sub>115</sub>. A similar Hfq concentration is required to detect binding to either poly(A)<sub>115</sub> or &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic>-(A)<sub>18</sub> RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f1">1</xref>A, lanes 13&#x02013;14 and 24&#x02013;25, respectively). Thus the formation of complex Ib with &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic>-(A)<sub>18</sub> is likely to be due to the binding of the protein to the polyadenylated extremity of the RNA. This result also implies that the &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA does not affect the binding of Hfq to its poly(A) tail and that a tail of 18 As is sufficient for efficient Hfq binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c24">24</xref>). Moreover, the fact that similar Hfq concentrations were required for the formation of complex Ia with non-polyadenylated &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f1">1</xref>A, lane 7) and complex IIb with polyadenylated &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic>-(A)<sub>18</sub> RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f1">1</xref>A, lane 22), suggests that this latter complex corresponds to the interaction of the protein with an internal region of &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> RNA. We cannot determine, however, if complex IIa on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f1">1</xref>A results from sequential binding of Hfq to two sites on &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> RNA or if protein&#x02013;protein interactions account for the appearance of complex IIa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c39">39</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Enzymatic and chemical probing of polyadenylated RNA complexed to Hfq</title><p>Chemical and enzymatic probing was used to determine where Hfq binds on the polyadenylated RNA and whether Hfq binding causes conformational changes in the polyadenylated &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA. The polyadenylated RNA, free or bound to Hfq, was submitted to partial enzymatic hydrolysis with RNase V1 (specific for double-stranded regions) and RNase T2 (specific for unpaired nucleotides with a preference for adenines). The RNA was also subjected to Pb(II)-induced cleavages, which has proven to be exquisitely sensitive to subtle structural variations and which induces cleavages, mainly in interhelical regions, loops and bulged nucleotides. The experimental results and a schematic view of the secondary structure of the RNA are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f2">2</xref>.</p><p>The data correlate well with the existence of the two hairpin structures (helix 1 and the terminator stem&#x02013;loop, t1) connected by a single-stranded interhelical region (connecting region shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f2">2</xref>A, D and E). Both helices are cleaved by RNase V1, whereas the single-stranded and loop regions are cleaved by both RNase T2 and Pb(II). The presence of several Pb(II) cleavages in helix I (C26&#x02013;C28&#x0002f;G32&#x02013;G34) and in helix II (A72&#x02013;A73) suggests that these two regions are metastable. Finally, the presence of concomittant RNase V1 cleavages (at positions 53&#x02013;54, 58 and 64) and single-stranded specific cleavages in region 53&#x02013;60 suggests the existence of an equilibrium between unpaired and paired residues, resulting in the formation of alternative conformers. Indeed potential base pairings may occur either between residues GAGA6 and UCUU60 or between residues AUUC58 and GAGU66.</p><p>The addition of increasing concentrations of Hfq induced a strong reduction in the number of cleavages in the poly(A) tail region by Pb(II) and RNase T2 hydrolysis. Moreover, the RNase V1 cleavages at position 99&#x02013;102 were strongly reduced by Hfq binding. These data indicate that the poly(A) tail is the major binding site of Hfq. Higher Hfq concentrations caused a significant reduction in Pb(II) cleavages in the U-rich sequence U66&#x02013;U68. Hfq, concomitantly, prevented cleavages at positions U53&#x02013;A54, C58 and A64 by RNase V1. Since Pb(II) cleavages were not affected by Hfq binding in region 55&#x02013;60, a more open conformation of residues C52&#x02013;U60 may be favoured. Subtle rearrangements induced by Hfq binding are also supported by the fact that weak, but reproducibly enhanced, cleavages by RNase V1 (at G46) and Pb(II) (at C52 and U53) were observed at the bottom of helix 1.</p><p>In summary, the results suggest that Hfq binds strongly to the poly(A) tail and to a lesser extent to the U-rich interhelical region, and induces subtle changes in the structure of the polyadenylated RNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Hfq binding protects poly(A) from RNase II- and PNPase-mediated decay</title><p>We next used RNase II, an exoribonuclease of 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; polarity that degrades single-stranded polyribonucleotides, to examine the effect of Hfq binding to the poly(A) tail. The <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA fragment used as a substrate (see above) contained a tail of 18 As downstream of the stable terminator stem&#x02013;loop, which protects the upstream RNA from attack by exonucleases. We confirm here that degradation of this transcript by RNase II is arrested by the terminator structure and show that Hfq protects the poly(A) tail from digestion by RNase II.</p><p>RNase II degraded the polyadenylated substrate in a two-step process. An initial rapid shortening from the poly(A) tail yielded a set of stalled intermediates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f3">3</xref>A, first three lanes) followed by a slower progressive shortening of the intermediates. These data suggest that the first step is processive, while the second step is distributive, i.e. RNase II dissociates from its substrate after the removal of each nucleotide. Carrying out the RNase II digestion with five times less enzyme confirms this two-step reaction (data not shown). The processive step of RNase II degradation generates intermediates with 3&#x02032; tails of approximately eight A-residues 3&#x02032; to the stable hairpin structure ending at C100 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f3">3</xref>A), in agreement with Coburn <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c40">40</xref>). Then, RNase II generates stable intermediates distributively, with 3&#x02032; ends close to the base of the stem&#x02013;loop structure. A comparison with a non-polyadenylated <italic>rpsO</italic> substrate used as a marker indicated that RNase II hydrolysis of the &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic>-(A)<sub>18</sub> RNA stopped three A-residues downstream of the secondary structure under these conditions (data not shown). In the presence of 1 &#x000b5;mol&#x0002f;l Hfq, 80&#x00025; of the substrate was protected against RNase II degradation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f3">3</xref>A and C). We have calculated that Hfq concentration ranges from 8 to 20 &#x000b5;mol&#x0002f;l, depending on physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c41">41</xref>). This suggests that Hfq binding protects poly(A) tailed RNA by preventing the access of RNase II to the 3&#x02032; extremity of the RNA. Surprisingly, the few molecules that are still attacked by RNase II are shortened up to residues A4 and A5 of the oligo(A) tail, suggesting that processive degradation stops closer to the t1 hairpin. This is in agreement with the footprinting experiments, which suggest that Hfq binding weakens base-pairing at the bottom of the hairpin.</p><p>We have shown previously that PNPase degradation of polyadenylated <italic>rpsO</italic> transcript is arrested three to five adenine residues downstream of the transcription terminator site <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c42">42</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> assays, using the polyadenylated substrate described above, also revealed a two-step degradation process by PNPase. The first step is characterized by the appearance of an intermediate, seven residues shorter than the initial substrate. This intermediate was further degraded to the final stalling site of PNPase, one or two adenines downstream of C100 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f3">3</xref>B). The addition of purified Hfq dramatically impeded PNPase digestion of poly(A) tails (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f3">3</xref>B and C). Hfq may either mask the 3&#x02032; end of the RNA or prevent interactions between the enzyme and its RNA binding site.</p></sec><sec><title>Hfq binding decreases RNase E cleavage efficiency</title><p>Our data indicate that Hfq also binds to the 14-nucleotide-long sequence lying between the two hairpins of the polyadenylated &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA fragment, albeit with a weaker binding affinity than for the poly(A) sequence. In particular, the GCGA<underline>GU</underline>UU sequence, containing the M2 RNase E cleavage site (underlined) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c1">1</xref>), is protected by Hfq from cleavage by RNase T2 and Pb(II). We performed <italic>in vitro</italic> processing experiments with a degradosome preparation containing RNase E to determine the effect of Hfq binding to this region. We omitted phosphate from the buffer to prevent exonucleolytic degradation of the RNA by PNPase present in the degradosome.</p><p>We first showed that most of the full-length RNA was efficiently cleaved using different concentrations of the degradosome, and concomitantly a shorter RNA fragment corresponding to the M2 RNase E cleavage site accumulated. Interestingly, the addition of increasing amounts of Hfq (10 nmol&#x0002f;l, 100 nmol&#x0002f;l, 1 &#x000b5;mol&#x0002f;l and 10 &#x000b5;mol&#x0002f;l) progressively reduced the processing of the polyadenylated &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA by RNase E from 89 to 20&#x00025; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f4">4</xref>). This was also accompanied by a lesser amount of the RNase E main cleavage product as Hfq concentration increased. Furthermore, the non-adenylated &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> RNA was protected by Hfq binding against RNase E hydrolysis, suggesting that binding of Hfq to the poly(A) tail does not contribute to the inhibition of RNase E cleavage (results not shown). Altogether, these result suggest that Hfq binding to the connecting region inhibits RNase E cleavage by masking the GUUU sequence of the cleavage site. However, the Hfq binding effect was less pronounced on RNase E cleavage efficiency than on RNase II or PNPase hydrolysis. This may result from the fact that binding of Hfq to the GUUU sequence is weaker than for the poly(A) tail.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This report shows that Hfq forms stable complexes with <italic>rpsO</italic> RNAs and preferentially binds the poly(A) tail of polyadenylated mRNA. A second and weaker binding site is also detected in the single-stranded region just upstream of the transcription terminator hairpin. We further demonstrate that binding of these sites by the Hfq protein protects the polyadenylated <italic>rpsO</italic> RNA from the two 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exoribonucleases, RNase II and PNPase, and from cleavage by RNase E.</p><sec><title>Hfq binds tightly to the poly(A) tail of rpsO mRNA</title><p>Gel retardation assays demonstrated that Hfq exhibits a high affinity for polyadenylated RNA. The discrepancy with the lower <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c24">24</xref>) probably reflects variation in the proportion of active protein resulting from the purification method or from aggregation of the protein used in early experiments. The high affinity of the Hfq protein for the poly(A)-tailed &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA is of the same order of magnitude as that for poly(A)<sub>115</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f1">1</xref>A). The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values of Hfq bound to poly(A)-tailed RNA and non-polyadenylated RNA reported here are 90 pM (15 pM if a Hfq hexamer binds the RNA) and 1.4 nM (0.23 nM for the hexamer), respectively. The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for poly(A)-tailed <italic>rpsO</italic> RNA is also of the same order of magnitude as the value reported by de Haseth and Uhlenbeck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c43">43</xref>) for (Ap)<sub>27</sub> (6.25 pM for the hexamer) at a similar salt concentration. With RNA substrates containing significantly fewer adenosine residues, the equilibrium dissociation of both <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic> Hfq proteins with AAAAAAG and A<sub>7</sub>, respectively, was only 30.5 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c44">44</xref>) (V.Arluison, unpublished data). These data suggest that a critical number of adenine residues is required for high binding affinity. This is in agreement with earlier fluorescence titration experiments indicating a saturation point of 14 A-residues per Hfq hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c43">43</xref>). On the other hand, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value we found for non-polyadenylated <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA (0.23 nM for hexameric Hfq) differs from the values measured for Spot42 &#x0005b;20 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c28">28</xref>)&#x0005d; and DsrA &#x0005b;1.2 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c45">45</xref>)&#x0005d;. A comparison of known binding sites (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg915tb1">1</xref>) suggests Hfq does not recognize a strict RNA consensus. Our data are nevertheless consistent with earlier observations that Hfq binds single-stranded A&#x02013;U-rich RNA regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c26">26</xref>), either adjacent to hairpin structures &#x0005b;Spot42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c28">28</xref>), <italic>ompA</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c12">12</xref>)&#x0005d; or surrounded by them &#x0005b;DsrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c45">45</xref>), OxyS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c27">27</xref>), Spot42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c28">28</xref>)&#x0005d;. These RNA hairpin structures probably help to constrain the Hfq binding site in a single-stranded conformation.</p><p>We propose that two Hfq hexamers bind independently to &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> RNA-(A)<sub>18</sub>; the first strong binding occurs on the poly(A) moiety of the RNA, and the second weaker binding on the U-rich connecting region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f2">2</xref>). Moreover, the gel-shift assay performed with poly(A)<sub>115</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg915f1">1</xref>A) and previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c43">43</xref>) suggest that Hfq hexamers can sequentially bind every 14 residues and cover long poly(A)-sequence-like &#x02018;pearls on a string&#x02019;. We cannot exclude, however, that Hfq hexamers exhibit several distinct binding sites for RNA. Two sites were indeed described for the <italic>Pyrococcus abyssi</italic> Sm protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c46">46</xref>), and the contribution of these sites differs depending on the RNA sequence. Mutational analysis of <italic>E.coli</italic> Hfq will be required to define the poly(A) binding site more precisely.</p><p>The high affinity of Hfq for poly(A) and A&#x02013;U-rich regions, implies that this abundant protein &#x0005b;between 2500 and 35 000 Hfq molecules per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c48">48</xref>)&#x0005d; can be strongly associated with RNA fragments during exponential growth. However, Hfq has been shown to be a co-factor of the transiently expressed sRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c28">28</xref>). This binding would imply either that new Hfq molecules are synthesized or that Hfq is released from short-lived RNAs, or possibly that Hfq is transferred from storage RNA to the transiently expressed sRNAs under particular physiological conditions. It is indeed conceivable that the capacity of Hfq to promote RNA&#x02013;RNA interactions could allow the protein to be rapidly transferred from a storage RNA, for example poly(A) tails, to a newly synthesized small regulatory RNA, despite the high affinity of the Hfq for RNA. This hypothesis is presently under investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Hfq modulates <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA degradation</title><p>The footprinting data suggest that Hfq destabilizes the bottom of both helices in the &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA. This correlates well with the data showing that RNase II continues the processive degradation of nucleotides to the bottom of the t1 hairpin of the <italic>rpsO</italic> transcript in the presence of Hfq. These data are consistent with the proposed role of Hfq as an RNA chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c49">49</xref>) and with the idea that Hfq facilitates base pairing between small RNAs and their target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c31">31</xref>). It has also been reported that Hfq affects the orientation of helices of the DsrA sRNA rather than its secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c45">45</xref>). In the case of &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA, we propose that weakening of base pairing at the bottom of the transcription terminator may facilitate the addition of A-residues at the 3&#x02032; end of the molecule by PAP I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c24">24</xref>).</p><p>Our data also suggest that Hfq may play a role in the stabilization of RNAs. We showed here that at physiological concentrations, Hfq masks the M2 RNase E site, where RNase E initiates degradation of the <italic>rpsO</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c33">33</xref>). Since RNase E and Hfq both recognize single-stranded A&#x02013;U-rich regions of RNA, one can speculate that Hfq may bind the RNase E sites of other RNAs, therefore may modulate processing and degradation of the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c50">50</xref>). In contrast, Hfq may also cause degradation of <italic>ompA</italic> mRNA by competing with the binding of the ribosome to the A&#x02013;U-rich translation initiation site of the <italic>ompA</italic> mRNA and as a result the mRNA is no longer protected from ribonucleases by translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c12">12</xref>).</p><p>We proposed that Hfq also protects poly(A) tails from degradation by the exoribonucleases PNPase and RNase II. This may explain why poly(A) can be detected in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg915c51">51</xref>). However, there is an apparent paradox; on the one hand Hfq stimulates processive synthesis of poly(A) tails, which promote RNA degradation, and on the other hand Hfq protects these tails from PNPase and RNase II. This property raises the interesting possibility that Hfq prevents poly(A)-dependent degradation of full-length transcripts whose stability is mostly controlled by RNase E and favors poly(A)-dependent degradation of stably structured RNAs devoid of RNase E sites.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg915f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Affinity of Hfq for &#x00394;<italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA.
