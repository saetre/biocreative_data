In most cases, infection is either minimally symptomatic or results in an uncomplicated, though sometimes severe, acute febrile illness (dengue fever, DF). In a small percentage of cases, however, individuals develop a severe capillary leakage syndrome, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), which can be life-threatening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007251-Gubler2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Studies on humans infected with DENV provide strong evidence for an immunologic basis for the pathogenesis of DHF.

Additionally, no virus was detected in any organs of infected non-engrafted mice suggesting that the engrafted human cells were necessary for in vivo replication of this mouse adapted neurovirulent strain of virus and that the symptoms of dengue disease that we have observed in humanized mice is not likely due to replication in neuronal sites.</p><p>Detection of DENV RNA at multiple late time points post infection in organs known to be targets of infection in humans is encouraging and suggests that DENV-2 replicates within human cells of infected mice. Detection of the NS1 protein in predominantly hCD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells using the mAb 7E11 suggests that the viral RNA detected by RT-PCR is due to replication of DENV within cells in humanized NOD-<italic>scid IL2r&#x003b3;<sup>null</sup></italic> mice, consistent with productive infection. Confirmation of the ability of infectious virus in liver lysates from infected mice to infect C6/36 cells further validates our PCR and flow cytometry results. Further studies will be needed to compare DENV tropism in this mouse model to those in humans.</p><p>Similar to results by Kuruvilla et al, we have detected virus in the sera (data not shown) and livers of mice that persisted for &#x0003e;20 days in our initial studies in a subset of NOD-<italic>scid IL2r&#x003b3;<sup>null</sup></italic> mice. Mice with high viremia lost weight and appeared sick while mice with low level or intermittent viremia had less appreciable weight loss. We are still unclear why some mice harbor DENV several weeks after infection. We speculate that the low IgG responses and inefficient human T cells generated in NOD-<italic>scid IL2r&#x003b3;<sup>null</sup></italic> mice may contribute to inefficient viral clearance in this model. In our more recent studies with NOD-<italic>scid IL2r&#x003b3;<sup>null</sup></italic> Tg(HLA-A2/Hu&#x003b2;2M) mice however, we have not detected any virus in the sera of mice at 2 or more weeks post infection. The results with humanized A2 transgenic NOD-<italic>scid IL2r&#x003b3;<sup>null</sup></italic> mice are highly encouraging and must be considered when evaluating varying humanized models as suitable animal models to assess dengue infection and immunity since infectious virus is cleared in approximately 2 weeks after natural infection in humans.</p><p>We detected DENV-2-specific IgM antibodies in the sera of mice 5&#x02013;14 days after infection indicating that these mice are able to generate antibody responses against DENV. However, as reported by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007251-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, we detected little or no DENV-specific IgG (data not shown) suggesting that very low levels of class switching occurred in these mice.

Sera from BLyS-treated DENV-infected mice did not show substantially higher DENV-specific IgM or IgG responses (data not shown). Kuruvilla et al demonstrated high levels of DENV-specific IgM and IgG in stem cell engrafted RAG-hu mice several weeks post infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007251-Kuruvilla1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, only RAG-hu mice that were immunized with a pool of four different strains of DENV-2 generated a strong antibody response while mice infected with individual strains of DENV-2 had very low levels of dengue-specific antibodies. The basis for the difference in response to the mixture of viruses was not determined. Antibody responses in our model might be enhanced by using a pool of different DENV-2 strains as done by Kuruvilla et al or by increasing the viral inoculum. However neither strategy mimics the natural course of DENV infection.</p><p>One major difference between our study and previous studies of DENV infection in humanized mouse models is our demonstration of IFN-&#x003b3; production by human T cells in response to DENV-2 antigen and virus-specific peptides. Most of the mice immunized by either the i.p. or s.c. route had significant DENV-specific IFN-&#x003b3; responses to the inactivated antigen with low intensity staining at 1&#x02013;2 weeks post infection. Several studies have reported the important role of IFN-&#x003b3; in the clearance of DENV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007251-Johnson1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007251-Diamond1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007251-Diamond2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. It remains unclear how the human T cells generated in NOD-<italic>scid IL2r&#x003b3;<sup>null</sup></italic> mice are effectively educated. While mature human T cells could develop by extrathymic education and selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007251-Ishikawa2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007251-Traggiai1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, presumably most of their education occurs in the murine thymus. Melkus et al were able to overcome this problem by using NOD-<italic>scid</italic> mice implanted with human fetal liver and thymic tissues to measure human EBV-specific immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007251-Melkus1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our data using NOD-<italic>scid IL2r&#x003b3;<sup>null</sup></italic> Tg(HLA&#x02013;A2/Hu&#x003b2;2M) mice are very encouraging and indicate that expression of human HLA molecules allow for better education of dengue-specific human T cells in humanized mice. As far as we know, we are the first to demonstrate A2 restricted peptide-specific responses in humanized mice. The ability of T cells to respond to ex vivo peptide stimulation by secreting multiple cytokines including IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-2 demonstrate the polyfunctionality of T cells in NOD-<italic>scid IL2r&#x003b3;<sup>null</sup></italic> Tg(HLA-A2/Hu&#x003b2;2M) mice. The frequency of cells that respond to the 3 A2 restricted peptides by secreting IFN-&#x003b3; in splenocytes of humanized mice (0.1&#x02013;2.8&#x00025; of total CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells) is in line with frequencies detected in human PBMC of DENV immune donors (0.1&#x02013;0.68&#x00025; of total CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007251-Bashyam1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. These preliminary studies suggest that NOD-<italic>scid IL2r&#x003b3;<sup>null</sup></italic> Tg(HLA-A2/Hu&#x003b2;2M)mice can be used effectively to assess T cell responses to virus-specific peptides identified in humans. Further experiments will need to be performed to assess the frequency and function of dengue-specific T cells during acute infection, in memory as well as following sequential heterologous dengue virus infections.</p><p>There are still some limitations in immunodeficient <italic>IL2r&#x003b3;<sup>null</sup></italic> humanized mouse models including the requirement of human specific molecules for optimal function of the human immune system and issues of remaining innate immunity that present obstacles to human hematopoietic stem cell engraftment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007251-Pearson1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, optimal conditions to ensure reliable human T and B cell engraftment will likely involve for example the use of neonatal rather than adult mice for engraftment and transgenic expression of select cytokines. Overcoming these limitations should be achievable in the future and will allow investigators to better recapitulate immune responses observed in immunocompetent individuals in humanized mouse models.</p><p>In summary, we have characterized a humanized mouse model with functional DENV-specific adaptive immune responses. The virologic and immunologic data presented set the stage for investigating both host and virus-specific mechanisms that control primary and sequential DENV infections. Since prior immunity is a major risk factor to developing DHF, these mice could potentially be used to study the role of cross-reactive sub-neutralizing antibodies and T cells during sequential DENV infections. Understanding the contribution of host components to severe dengue disease will lead to the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Massachusetts Medical School and the recommendations in the <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences, 1996).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Immunodeficient Mice</title><p>NOD.<italic>Cg-Prkdc<sup>scid</sup>Il2rg<sup>tm1Wjll</sup>/SzJ</italic> mice (hereafter termed: NOD-<italic>scid IL2r&#x003b3;<sup>null</sup></italic>) and NOD.<italic>Cg-Prkdc<sup>scid</sup>Il2rg<sup>tm1Wjll</sup></italic> Tg(HLA-A2/H2-D/&#x003b2;2M)1Dvs/Sz (hereafter termed NOD-<italic>scid IL2r&#x003b3;<sup>null</sup></italic> Tg(HLA-A2/Hu&#x003b2;2M) mice were bred at the Jackson Laboratory and subsequently maintained in the animal facilities at the University of Massachusetts Medical School <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007251-Shultz2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.
