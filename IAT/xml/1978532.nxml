There were three major findings. First, continued evolution of R5 viruses in PBMCs, spleen and lymph nodes involved multiple bottlenecks, independent of coreceptor switch, resulting in fitter quasispecies driven by positive selection. Second, evolution of X4 strains appeared to be a sequential process requiring the initial fixation of positively selected mutations in V1-V2 and C2 domains of R5 variants before the emergence of high charge V3 X4 variants. Third, R5 viruses persisted after the emergence of CXCR4-using strains, which were found predominantly but not exclusively in the thymus.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our data indicate that the evolution of X4 strains is a multi-step, temporally structured process and that the thymus may play an important role in the evolution/amplification of coreceptor variants.

Clade C included HIV-1 strains from PBMCs at T3 with contemporaneous variants in the lung, lymph nodes, spleen and thymus. In contrast, the monophyletic cluster at the top of the tree included only X4 HIV-1 variants that were found in thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen.

Overall, our data suggest that the evolution of HIV-1 envelope involved a complex, but nonetheless ordered and potentially restricted, developmental program that was recapitulated in different individuals.</p><p>In addition to amino acid substitutions in V1-C2, recombination was detected between V1-V2 and V3 in two individuals. Rather than random distribution of putative breakpoints in the recombinants, essentially all sequences had crossover localized to the C2 region. Evolution of HIV-1 in the brain of one subject was highly compartmentalized and limited to CCR5-using variants, in agreement with previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000950-Salemi1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000950-Sha1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. An elevated recombination rate among the R5 sequences in the brain, which our data identified, would be consistent with a long independent evolution of a segregated viral subpopulation in a separate compartment. Since only <italic>post mortem</italic> samples were available from brain tissue, phylogenetic analysis could not exclude earlier input of viral sequences and turnover similar to PBMCs. Analysis of X4 strains of recombinant origin showed that recombination always occurred within C2 between ancestral V1V2 sequences of R5 phenotype from PBMCs and ancestral V3 sequences of X4 phenotype from thymus, suggesting that the thymus may play an important role in the amplification of CXCR4-using strains.</p><p>We also found evidence of bottlenecks characterized by strong purifying selection, after a positive selection episode, suggesting the presence of temporary adaptive peaks in the fitness landscape. In fact, it is expected that if a population reaches a local high-fitness peak, most of the variants in the next generation would be removed by purifying selection or genetic drift. Emergence of fitter HIV-1 strains through the bottlenecks could be due to multiple selective factors: antiretroviral therapy, cellular immune control, change in target cell populations or change in host milieu favoring X4 variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000950-Cocchi1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, and/or emergence of viral variants with enhanced entry efficiency. In the subjects in our study, positive selection occurred in the absence of combination antiretroviral treatment, ruling out drug selective pressure. All patients had severely suppressed CD4 T cells and none of the known B-cell epitopes (listed at the Los Alamos HIV databases) were localized in the V1-V3 region of sequences from any of our subjects, arguing against immune control as a major selection factor, although lack of immunity, as found in the SIV model, may provide a selective advantage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000950-Ho1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data are consistent with a model of enhanced viral entry efficiency combined with host milieu as major selective pressures driving episodic selection.</p><p>The results obtained in the present work also point to the potential importance of the thymus for the evolution/amplification of the X4 coreceptor use.

The finding in one of the subjects that HIV-1 X4 gene flow was from thymus to lymphoid tissues, but not <italic>vice versa</italic>, is consistent with trafficking patterns of thymocytes and implicates X4-infected thymocytes as a potential mechanism for systemic dissemination of X4 variants. Studies based on experimental observations and mathematical models suggest that the increased turnover rate of na&#x000ef;ve T-cells over time in HIV-1 infected patients could be a consequence of progressive depletion of memory T-cells in the periphery, and may explain the increased fitness of X4 viruses and their emergence in about 50&#x00025; of the individuals during the late stage of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000950-Ribeiro1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Our finding that the evolutionary rates of R5 and X4 HIV-1 sub-populations are not significantly different support the hypothesis that amplification of X4 variants is due to factors other than an increased rate of evolution and may be linked to the availability of target cells.

We examined HIV-1 quasispecies in thymus tissues from only four subjects. Since no <italic>ante mortem</italic> thymic or lymphoid tissues were available, the exact evolutionary history of the X4 population in the thymus at earlier time points is uncertain. For example, we cannot exclude that similar X4 variants may have emerged in other tissues (such as lymph nodes or spleen) prior to or concomitant with their appearance in the thymus. Also, the result of the migration analysis is not informative about the viral flow during early infection and would require further investigation using longitudinal samples from different subjects to be confirmed. However, while it is feasible to collect serial PBMC samples from earlier time points, serial biopsies of tissues such as thymus and spleen are hardly an option in human patients. Such a difficulty points to the importance of animal models, such as SIV-infected rhesus macaque, to discern the role for the thymus and secondary lymphoid tissues in evolution of X4 variants.</p><p>Further clarification of the key-role of the thymus and other lymphoid tissues in the evolution/amplification of X4 strains might have important consequences for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. R5 coreceptor-blocking agents may be extremely efficient, during the early stage of the disease, in avoiding the emergence of the X4 quasispecies associated with certain types of disease progression. On the other hand, the development of X4 entry inhibitors and/or drugs able to target the export of X4 infected T-cells from the thymus could be critical to control HIV-1 infection in advanced disease stages. If breakdown of immunity contributes to selection for X4 variants, then immune-based strategies may delay or prevent amplification of X4-using viruses independent of the tissue of origin. A detailed mapping of V1-V3 sites under positive selection associated with increased viral entry efficiency will lay the foundations for the development and evaluation of such novel drugs, and our study has shown the potential power of phylodynamics and high-resolution phylogeny for accomplishing this important task.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Subjects and samples</title><p>Four pediatric subjects infected by maternal HIV-1 transmission (S1, S2, and S4) or by neonatal blood transfusion (S3) were enrolled under a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Florida, College of Medicine.

Bootscanning plots, like the ones showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000950-g003">Figure 3</xref>, display how the bootstrap support (y-axis) for the clustering of the query sequence with the parental sequences changes along the alignment (x-axis). Since recombination leads to the creation of mosaic genomes originated from different ancestors, a recombination event can be detected by the &#x0201c;jumping&#x0201d; of the query sequence between highly supported phylogenetic clades in trees obtained from different genomic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000950-Salminen1">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>. Bootscanning plots were obtained using a window of 200 nucleotides sliding forward in steps of 20 nucleotides. Trees were inferred by NJ using HKY estimated distances with a transition transversion ratio empirically estimated by maximum likelihood for each window.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Phylogenetic Analysis of non-recombinant data sets</title><p>A total of 33 sequences for S1 (median per tissue 8, range 5 to 13); 49 sequences for S2 (median/tissue 9, range 6 to 12); 17 sequences for S3 (median/tissue 8, range 1 to 17); and 103 sequences for S4 (median/tissue 15, range 3 to 35) were analyzed. The best fitting nucleotide substitution model was tested with a hierarchical likelihood ratio test, using a neighbor-joining (NJ) tree with LogDet corrected distances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000950-Swofford1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>. Maximum likelihood (ML) trees were then inferred with the selected model (HKY&#x0002b;&#x00393;, 8 categories, for all data sets) and ML-estimated substitution parameters. The heuristic search for the best tree was performed using an NJ tree as starting tree and the TBR branch-swapping algorithm. Neighbor-Joining (NJ) trees were also estimated using pair-wise distances inferred by ML with the best fitting nucleotide substitution model. Calculations were performed with PAUP&#x0002a; 4.0b10 written by David L. Swofford. Statistical support for internal branches in the NJ trees was obtained by bootstrapping (1000 replicates) for the NJ trees and the ML-based zero branch length test for the ML trees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000950-Swofford1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>. Trees were rooted by ML rooting by selecting the rooted tree with the best likelihood under the molecular clock constraint, or by outgroup rooting using the earliest PBMC samples as outgroup. The location of the root was confirmed by inferring rooted Bayesian trees with a relaxed clock model and exponentially distributed evolutionary rates as prior. The Bayesian calculation consisted of 50,000,000 generations Markov Chains Monte Carlo (MCMC) with sampling every 5000<sup>th</sup> generation using the BEAST software package version 1.4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/beast/">http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/beast/</ext-link>). Convergence of the MCMC was assessed by calculating the effective sampling size (ESS) of the combined runs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000950-Drummond1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>. All parameter estimates showed significant ESS (&#x0003e;250). Bayesian trees were also obtained with the program MrBayes v3.1.2, using the HKY&#x0002b;&#x00393; model, running in parallel two MCMC for 10,000,000 generations with sampling every 100<sup>th</sup> generation. Convergence was assessed by comparing the average standard deviation of split frequencies (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). Statistical support for each clade in the Bayesian trees was obtained by calculating clade-specific Bayesian posterior probabilities with MrBayes. In each case, ML and Bayesian methods inferred the same topology.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Reconstruction of ancestral sequences and positive selection analysis</title><p>Ancestral amino acid sequences in the genealogy obtained for each patient were inferred by the maximum likelihood method, using the codon substitution model M0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000950-Yang1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>.

A one-character data matrix is obtained from the original data set by assigning to each <italic>taxon</italic> in the tree a one-letter code indicating its tissue of origin. Then, the phylogenetic tree obtained from the nucleotide aligniment is imported in MacClade and the putative origin of each ancestral sequence (i.e. internal node) in the tree is inferred with the Fitch algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000950-Fitch1">&#x0005b;79&#x0005d;</xref> by finding the most parsimonious reconstruction (MPR) of the ancestral character (this can be accomplished by selecting the <italic>Trace character</italic> option in the <italic>Trace</italic> menu of MacClade). The result is a tree colored as in supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000950.s003">Figure S2</xref>, were each colored branch represent the tissue of origin of the internal node (ancestral sequence) or tip node (actual sequence) subtending that branch. A change in color (i.e. in tissue assignment) between two branches connected trough a node represent a migration event from one tissue to another that must have occurred during the genealogical evolution of the sequences under investigation. The final tree-length, i.e. the number of observed migrations in the genealogy, computed by MacClade can be compared to the tree-length distribution of 10,000 trees obtained by random joining-splitting (by selecting the <italic>Character steps/etc</italic> option from the <italic>Char</italic> menu). Observed genealogies significantly shorter than random trees indicate the presence of subdivided populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000950-Slatikin1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>. Specific migrations among different compartments (states) were traced with the <italic>State changes and stasis</italic> tool (MacClade), which counts the number of changes in a tree for each pair-wise state. When multiple MPRs were present (as in our data sets), the algorithm calculated the average migration count over all possible MPRs for each pair. The resulting pair-wise migration matrix is then normalized to obtain the percentage of observed migration to/from different tissues in the tree.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000950.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Distribution of HIV-1 V1V3 recombinant sequences</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000950.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000950.s002"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>V1-V3 multiple alignment of reconstructed ancestral sequences from patients S2 and S4.
