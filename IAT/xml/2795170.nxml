Previously, we described an association between the MLL/SET1 complexes and a highly restricted, gene-specific DNA-binding protein Ap2&#x003b4; that is required for recruitment of the MLL/SET1 complex to target <italic>Hoxc8</italic> specifically. Here, we reduced levels of Ap2&#x003b4; and Ash2l in the neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro2A, and analyzed their gene expression profiles using whole-genome mouse cDNA microarrays. This analysis yielded 42 genes that are potentially co-regulated by Ap2&#x003b4; and Ash2l, and we have identified evolutionarily conserved Ap2-binding sites in 20 of them. To determine whether some of these were direct targets of the Ap2&#x003b4;-Ash2l complex, we analyzed several promoters for the presence of Ap2&#x003b4; and Ash2l by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Among the targets we screened, we identified <italic>Fgfr3</italic> as a direct transcriptional target of the Ap2&#x003b4;-Ash2l complex. Additionally, we found that Ap2&#x003b4; is necessary for the recruitment of Ash2l-containing complexes to this promoter and that this recruitment leads to trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3). Thus, we have identified several candidate targets of complexes containing Ap2&#x003b4; and Ash2l that can be used to further elucidate their roles during development and showed that <italic>Fgfr3</italic> is a novel direct target of these complexes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>PcG and trxG proteins act antagonistically to maintain heritable patterns of gene expression, with the former marking genes for repression and the latter for activation. PcG complexes are associated with trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) whereas trxG complexes are linked to H3K4me3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Schuettengruber1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Ruthenburg1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. This relationship embodies the characteristic of cellular memory to establish the identity in each cell type during development. Previously, these marks were considered to be static; recent evidence, however, has shown that these marks are involved in dynamic gene regulation through active recruitment of PcG and trxG complexes during cellular differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Ruthenburg1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Mikkelsen1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, experiments that are based on chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to DNA microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) and the more recent ChIP-seq, in which enriched DNA is directly sequenced, reveal an association between the intensity of the H3K4me3 epigenetic mark at the promoter and active transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Mikkelsen1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Conversely, the presence of the H3K27me3 mark is associated with gene repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Mikkelsen1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. These data suggest that PcG and trxG proteins play a role in establishing lineage-specific genetic programs through induction of chromatin modifications.</p><p>The trxG protein group includes members of the MLL/SET1 family of histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) and their associated proteins. The MLL/SET1 family consists of six members, Mixed Lineage Leukemia 1 (MLL1), MLL2 (ALR), MLL3 (HALR), MLL4, SET1A and SET1B, which share a catalytic SET domain that has been shown to have H3K4 methyltransferase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Milne1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Wysocka1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Goo1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Lee1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. MLL/SET1 proteins exist in multimeric complexes that contain three highly conserved subunits: Ash2l, RbBP5 and WDR5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Dou1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, it had been reported that these subunits are important for regulating the enzymatic activity of the SET domain-containing factor. Ash2l, in particular, was shown to be critical for H3K4me3 as downregulation of Ash2l leads to a genome-wide decrease in this epigenetic mark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Steward1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We recently reported that the gene-specific transcription factor Activating protein 2&#x003b4; (Ap2&#x003b4;) is important for the recruitment of MLL2 to the <italic>Hoxc8 locus during embryogenesis and that this recruitment leads to H3K4me3 and subsequent gene activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Tan1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Ap2&#x003b4; is a member of the Ap2 family of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, which consists of Ap2&#x003b1;, -&#x003b2;, -&#x003b3;, -&#x003b4; and -&#x003b5;. Ap2 proteins bind a GC-rich consensus sequence that is found on a variety of cellular and viral enhancers. Ap2&#x003b4; is considered the most divergent family member, as it has a unique transactivation domain (TAD) that has been shown to specifically bind Ash2l. Additionally, Ap2&#x003b4;'s gene, Tcfap2d, has a highly restricted expression pattern and is found in the developing myocardium, central nervous system and retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Zhao1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</italic></p><p>To search systematically for Ap2&#x003b4;- and Ash2l-regulated targets, we assessed the transcriptome using cDNA microarrays to identify genes whose expression was significantly decreased when either protein was diminished and then filtered those results using the criterion of an evolutionarily conserved Ap2-binding site in the promoter. To identify true targets of Ap2&#x003b4; and Ash2l-containing complexes among several candidates, we tested for the presence of Ap2&#x003b4; and Ash2l at their promoters. Among the genes we tested, we identified <italic>Fgfr3</italic> as a direct target of Ap2&#x003b4; and Ash2l given that both proteins were present at the <italic>Fgfr3</italic> promoter and that downregulation of either Ap2&#x003b4; or Ash2l resulted in a decrease of <italic>Fgfr3</italic> expression. Thus, we provide evidence suggesting that Ap2&#x003b4; plays an important role in altering the epigenetic landscape of a set of developmentally regulated targets through recruitment of Ash2l-containing HKMT complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of Ap2&#x003b4; and Ash2l Target Genes by cDNA Microarray Analysis</title><p>To identify targets of Ap2&#x003b4; and Ash2l, we performed whole genome analysis of cDNA expression levels obtained from Neuro2a cells treated with either <italic>Tcfap2d-</italic> or <italic>Ash2l</italic>-specific RNAi or a scrambled control.

Triplicate microarray experiments were performed comparing signals obtained from cells treated with either <italic>Tcfap2d</italic>- or <italic>Ash2l</italic>-specific RNAi to those of cells treated with a scrambled control. Signal values were calculated using the MAS5 and PLIER statistical algorithms. Genes that had a significance level of p&#x0003c;0.05 and a fold change greater than 1.1 were selected for analysis. Using signal values obtained from the MAS5 probe summarization algorithm, we identified 917 and 806 genes that were differentially expressed when Ap2&#x003b4; or Ash2l, respectively, was downregulated. Comparison of these two groups yielded 76 genes whose expression was significantly altered when <italic>Tcfap2d</italic> and <italic>Ash2l</italic> were knocked down individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008535-g002">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Given that Ap2&#x003b4; and Ash2l form a complex that is involved in H3K4me3, we assumed that a reduction in either Ap2&#x003b4; or Ash2l would lead to decreased expression of their direct targets. Hence, to identify candidate targets of the Ap2&#x003b4;-Ash2l complex, we focused solely on genes that were downregulated when they were reduced. Of the 76 genes whose expressed was significantly changed when Ap2&#x003b4; and Ash2l were decreased, 33 genes with known function were downregulated. To determine whether we could identify additional targets that had not been previously identified by MAS5, we applied an alternative method using the PLIER probe summarization algorithm to obtain signal values. Through this method, we identified 9 additional genes that were downregulated when Ap2&#x003b4; and Ash2l levels were decreased.

Moreover, a significant portion of these candidate genes (21 out of 42) contained evolutionarily conserved Ap2-binding sites. We demonstrated that one of the three candidate genes we assessed, <italic>Fgfr3</italic>, was indeed a direct target of Ap2&#x003b4; and Ash2l given that both proteins co-localized at the promoter and that downregulation of Ap2&#x003b4; or Ash2l resulted in decreased <italic>Fgfr3</italic> expression. Given that we had only assessed a limited window for Ap2-binding sites and only those sites for Ap2&#x003b4;-Ash2l binding, it should be noted that the genes for which we did not find any Ap2 binding sites might have binding sites further up- and downstream of the regions that we had assessed. As such, genes that were downregulated but for which we failed to find an Ap2-binding site are not necessarily false positives or indirectly regulated.</p><p>A growing body of evidence has shown that Fgfr1, -2 and -3 play important roles in the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs). Immunocytochemical studies with NSCs derived from E15 rat striatum showed that expression of these receptors is developmentally regulated and cell lineage-specific. During the first day of culture, 50&#x00025; and 70&#x00025; of the NSCs or early precursors expressed <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and -<italic>2</italic>, respectively, while a restricted population expressed <italic>Fgfr3</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Reimers1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. After 10 days in culture, the number of cells expressing <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and -<italic>2</italic> was significantly decreased to 15&#x00025; of the total cell number whereas those expressing <italic>Fgfr3</italic> comprised a significant portion of the population suggesting that <italic>Fgfr3</italic> is increased during the process of cellular differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Reimers1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. These results indicate that Fgfr3 may play a critical role in terminal differentiation while Fgfr1 and -2 may be important for earlier events, such as cell specification. Additionally, these Fgfr-positive cells were probed with various cell-lineage markers to determine whether there was an enrichment of a specific Fgfr in a particular cell lineage. <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and -<italic>2</italic> were detected in early oligodendroglial precursors whereas <italic>Fgfr3</italic> was detected in early oligodendroglial precursors, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Reimers1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. These data suggest that Fgfr1&#x02013;3 play specific roles in the differentiation of NSCs into neurons, oligodendrocytes and astroctyes. To demonstrate that Fgfr1, 2 and 3 have roles in neuronal differentiation, NSCs were treated with basic FGF (bFGF), which is a ligand for these receptors. As predicted, treatment with exogenous bFGF resulted in increased proliferation of NSCs and an increased number of oligodendrocytes after seven days in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Reimers1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Altogether, these data imply that Fgfr1, -2 and -3 play important roles in the ability of NSCs to self-renew and differentiate into distinct neuronal cell types. Moreover, their expressions in the developing CNS overlap with that of <italic>Tcfap2d</italic> confirming the role of Ap2d in <italic>Ffgr3</italic> regulation during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008535-Blak1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, these roles are consistent with those of trxG proteins whose functions have been linked to cell differentiation and memory.</p><p>Although we identified several Ap2&#x003b4;- and Ash2l-regulated genes, a vast majority of differentially expressed genes did not overlap when the gene expression profiles were compared between cells treated with <italic>Tcfap2d</italic>-specific RNAi and those treated with <italic>Ash2l</italic>-specific RNAi. Given that Ash2l and its associated proteins are expressed ubiquitously, we hypothesized that Ash2l achieved its specificity through interactions with developmentally regulated transcription factors, such as Ap2&#x003b4;. This would imply that Ash2l would have functions independent of those attributed to Ap2&#x003b4;. Indeed, we found that only 76 out of 806 differentially expressed genes in Ash2l RNAi-treated cells overlapped with those in Ap2&#x003b4; RNAi-treated cells. Similarly, Ap2&#x003b4; may also interact with other co-activators, such as histone acetyltransferases and lysine demethylases, to activate its downstream targets. Previously, it had been reported that Ap2 proteins interacted with Cited2 and CBP to activate their targets indicating that Ap2&#x003b4; may also associate with these factors in activating its downstream targets. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that interactions with Cited2 and CBP occur in regions of the Ap2 protein that are nearly identical among Ap2 family members including Ap2&#x003b4;. As such, Ap2&#x003b4;'s interaction with Ash2l may occur independently or in addition to its interaction with Cited2 and CBP. These interactions would, in turn, result in a repertoire of genes that are regulated by Ap2&#x003b4; independently of Ash2l. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis, as only 76 out of 917 differentially expressed genes in Ap2&#x003b4; RNAi-treated cells overlapped with those in Ash2l RNAi-treated cells.</p><p>It had been suggested that Ash2l and its associated proteins, including the MLL/SET1 subunits, are global regulators of gene expression given their expression patterns and developmental functions. As such, deletion of Ash2l or any of its associated proteins may result in either embryonic lethality or a pleiotropic defect that could potentially mask a variety of distinct developmental phenotypes. To circumvent this issue, one could potentially analyze the role of Ash2l through analysis of its various regulators, such as Ap2&#x003b4;. Our studies are, therefore, an initial step in elucidating the function of Ash2l <italic>in vivo</italic>, providing a library of genes and pathways that are potentially regulated by Ash2l when it interacts with Ap2&#x003b4;. Additionally, our studies in Neuro2a cells using endogenous proteins may reflect to a limited extent conditions similar to that of neural progenitors <italic>in vivo</italic>. Given that Neuro2a cells have oncogenic properties, these targets will need to be validated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a library of genes that are regulated by both Ap2&#x003b4; and Ash2l. A significant portion of these candidate target genes contains evolutionarily conserved Ap2-binding sites implying that several of them are direct targets of the Ap2&#x003b4; and Ash2l-containing HMT complexes. Among the targets we screened, we identified <italic>Fgfr3</italic> as a novel target of both Ap2d and Ash2l. Thus, we provide evidence that these candidate genes will be useful in elucidating the developmental roles of Ap2&#x003b4; and Ash2l.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture and Immunoblotting</title><p>Neuro2a cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10&#x00025; (v/v) fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen) at 37 &#x000b0;C with 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>.

Cross-linking reactions were reversed by heating at 65&#x000b0;C for 4 h. The DNA was recovered from immunoprecipitated material by proteinase K treatment at 55&#x000b0;C for 1 h followed by phenol/chloroform (1&#x02236;1) extraction, ethanol precipitation, and resuspension into 50 &#x000b5;l of nuclease-free water. Recovered DNA was analyzed by end-point and real-time PCR using the following loci-specific primers: Fgfr3 F1 <named-content
