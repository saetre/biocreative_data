Hedgehog signaling is of fundamental importance in the development of a wide variety of tissues and organ systems. Much of the initial functional analysis of Hedgehog signaling focused on the patterning of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> larval segments and imaginal discs, dorsoventral patterning of the vertebrate neural tube, and anterior&#x02013;posterior patterning of vertebrate limbs; in addition, many recent studies have illuminated the widespread and conserved role of Hedgehog signaling in development (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b01">1</xref>]). Misregulation of Hedgehog signaling has been implicated in several diseases and developmental abnormalities, including basal cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b04">4</xref>], medulloblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b07">7</xref>], pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b08">8</xref>], and holoprosencephaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b10">10</xref>].</p><p>After release from signaling cells, the activity and distribution of Hedgehog proteins are modulated by a variety of factors in the extracellular environment. In <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content>, diffusion of lipid-modified Hedgehog proteins is dependent on the action of <italic>tout velu,</italic> a gene involved in the synthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b12">12</xref>]. The diffusion of Hedgehog is also attenuated via sequestration by its receptor, Patched [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b13">13</xref>]. In vertebrates, Hedgehog proteins may be further regulated by binding to the <italic>growth-arrest specific</italic> gene product Gas1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b14">14</xref>], and Hedgehog-interacting protein Hip1, which is itself induced by Hedgehog signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b15">15</xref>]. Moreover, the ability of Hedgehog proteins to diffuse over significant distances in the developing vertebrate limb bud appears to depend on the cholesterol modification of the Hedgehog protein; this modification may facilitate the assembly of Hedgehog proteins into a multimeric structure, perhaps conferring increased stability or mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b17">17</xref>]. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that the low-density receptor-related protein Megalin may also play a role in Hedgehog signaling in vertebrates, perhaps by binding to Hedgehog proteins and facilitating their endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b19">19</xref>].</p><p>Hedgehog pathway function in zebrafish has been analyzed primarily in the context of skeletal muscle development and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b28">28</xref>]. In zebrafish embryos at 24 h post fertilization (hpf), skeletal muscle can be subdivided into two distinct classes based on morphological characteristics and gene expression. Slow muscle fibers are mononucleate, express characteristic slow muscle forms of myosin heavy chain, and show strong nuclear expression of the transcription factor <italic>prox1</italic>. In contrast, fast muscle fibers can be identified via their multinucleate morphology and lack of <italic>prox1</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b28">28</xref>]. Cell labeling experiments have demonstrated that slow muscle fibers derive from the adaxial cells that lie immediately adjacent to the notochord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b21">21</xref>]. As development progresses, a subset of these developing slow muscle cells migrates laterally through the myotome to form the superficial slow fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b28">28</xref>]. Slow muscle fibers that remain near the midline&#x02014;the muscle pioneers&#x02014;express high levels of Engrailed and organize the somites into their distinctive chevron shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b30">30</xref>]. The remaining muscle cells in the interior of the myotome form multinucleate fast muscle fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b28">28</xref>].</p><p>Many lines of evidence indicate that Hedgehog signals from axial tissues specify slow muscle in zebrafish. Slow muscle fibers are reduced or absent in embryos with Hedgehog pathway mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b33">33</xref>]. Conversely, slow muscle is expanded at the expense of fast muscle in embryos with increased Hedgehog pathway activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b34">34</xref>]. Moreover, addition of Hedgehog protein to cultured zebrafish myoblasts induces expression of slow-muscle-specific forms of myosin heavy chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b35">35</xref>].</p><p>Genetic screens have identified a number of mutations disrupting the Hedgehog pathway in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b41">41</xref>]. Many of these Hedgehog pathway mutants share characteristic defects, the most obvious of which is abnormal somite morphology resulting from disrupted slow muscle specification and the lack of horizontal myoseptum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b22">22</xref>]. These mutants are thus termed &#x0201c;<italic>you</italic>-class&#x0201d; mutants because of their U-shaped somites. Five of the seven <italic>you</italic>-class mutations have been cloned, and four of these genes, <italic>syu/shh, yot/gli2, smu/smoh,</italic> and <italic>con/disp1,</italic> encode members of the Hedgehog signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b39">39</xref>].

Careful analysis reveals differences between the <italic>ubo</italic> and Hedgehog pathway mutant phenotypes. For example, Hedgehog pathway mutants have defects in the lateral floor plate of the neural tube and the dorsal aorta, which are apparently normal in <italic>ubo</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b43">43</xref>]. Examination of Hedgehog-induced gene expression also reveals a clear distinction between Hedgehog pathway mutations and <italic>ubo:</italic> Hedgehog pathway mutations reduce or abolish expression of the Hedgehog target <italic>ptc1,</italic> whereas <italic>ptc1</italic> expression is normal in <italic>ubo</italic> mutants, indicating that they can receive Hedgehog signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b39">39</xref>].</p><p>Previous phenotypic characterization of mutants for the eponymous <italic>you</italic>-class gene, <italic>you,</italic> has revealed delayed development of the dorsal aorta and the absence of lateral floor plate marker expression in addition to slow muscle defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b43">43</xref>].

These results suggest that the <italic>you</italic> gene acts within the Hedgehog pathway itself rather than downstream of Hedgehog signaling in processes specific to slow muscle development. Prior to this study, the molecular identity of the <italic>you</italic> gene has remained unknown. We report the positional cloning of the <italic>you</italic> gene and show that it encodes a novel extracellular EGF-CUB (epidermal growth factor&#x02013;complement Uegf Bmp1) protein required for Hedgehog signaling. Functional studies provide evidence that <italic>you</italic> is essential for the transport or stability of Hedgehog signals in the extracellular environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>you</italic> Function Is Required for Hedgehog Signaling</title><p>In wild-type zebrafish embryos, the dorsal and ventral portions of each myotome converge at a point where the horizontal myoseptum forms, giving the somites their characteristic chevron shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030066-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). In contrast, <italic>you</italic> mutants lacked the horizontal myoseptum and exhibit the U-shaped morphology that defines mutants of the <italic>you</italic> class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030066-g001">Figure 1</xref>B; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b22">22</xref>]). The formation of the horizontal myoseptum in zebrafish depends on the proper development of slow muscle, a process that is defective in <italic>you-</italic>class mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b31">31</xref>]. Hedgehog activity in the context of slow muscle cell specification can be assayed by analyzing Engrailed expression in the muscle pioneers and adaxial <italic>myod</italic> expression during somitogenesis. Wild-type embryos at 24 hpf exhibit strong Engrailed staining in characteristic elongate nuclei of 2&#x02013;6 muscle pioneers&#x02014;slow muscle cells that develop along the prospective horizontal myoseptum&#x02014;per myotomal segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030066-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). In addition, weaker Engrailed expression can be observed in the typically more rounded nuclei of mulitnucleate fast muscle fibers, which are situated farther from the horizontal myoseptum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030066-g001">Figure 1</xref>C; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b30">30</xref>]). <italic>you</italic> mutant embryos completely lacked the strong Engrailed expression in the muscle pioneers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030066-g001">Figure 1</xref>D; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b22">22</xref>]), but very weak labeling was sometimes observed in a small number of cells.

We therefore adopted a positional cloning strategy to identify the gene disrupted by the <italic>you</italic> mutation. Using a marker linked with Z15270 on a contig from the Sanger Institute whole-genome shotgun assembly, we screened a pooled bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library and initiated a chromosome walk beginning with BAC zC172H20.

Analysis of the mutant phenotype, therefore, demonstrates that the <italic>you</italic> gene is essential for Hedgehog signaling in development of slow muscle and ventral spinal cord fates.</p><p>Current evidence indicates that EGF-CUB proteins, including You, have extracellular functions.

EGF and CUB domains are found together in a small but diverse group of extracellularly acting proteins, including the complement subunits C1s and C1r, the metalloproteinase Tolloid, the sea urchin extracellular matrix protein Fibropellin, the serum glycoprotein Attractin, and the scavenger receptor Cubilin. CUB domains have been implicated in mediating protein&#x02013;protein interactions and may confer specificity to ligand binding; for example, specific CUB domains in Cubilin have been implicated in facilitating the binding and subsequent endocytosis of specific ligands (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b54">54</xref>]).</p><p>Although <italic>you</italic> is essential for Hedgehog signaling, our analysis indicates that <italic>you</italic> mutant cells are able to produce and respond to Hedgehog signals. <italic>hedgehog</italic> gene expression in the embryonic midline is normal in <italic>you</italic> mutants, indicating that You acts downstream of <italic>hedgehog</italic> gene transcription (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030066-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Further evidence that <italic>you</italic> function is not required in cells generating Hedgehog signals derives from the analysis of chimeric embryos: muscle pioneers can differentiate in chimeras in which the notochord and floor plate are formed entirely from mutant cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030066-g008">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030066-t001">Table 1</xref>).

The analysis of chimeras also demonstrates that the presence of wild-type cells in the paraxial mesoderm and neural plate is sufficient to allow <italic>you</italic> mutant cells to respond to Hedgehog signals produced from <italic>you</italic> mutant notochord and floor plate. Thus, our epistasis and transplantation experiments provide evidence that You functions in the extracellular environment in the field of responding cells, likely acting to transport or stabilize Hedgehog signals. It is possible that You interacts with components of the extracellular matrix, some of which are known to regulate the action of Hedgehog signals in other systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b56">56</xref>].</p><p>Another possible model is that You activates the Hedgehog pathway indirectly, by inhibiting an extracellular pathway antagonist such as Hip1 or Gas1.

Because the primary cell types disrupted in <italic>you</italic> mutants all develop in close proximity to the notochord, it is possible that <italic>you</italic> gene function may be required for the transport or stability of Hedgehog signals in the vicinity of the developing notochord but not some other regions. The notochord is a defining feature of chordates, and a notochord-associated function would explain why no <italic>you</italic> counterpart is required for Hedgehog signaling in the fly. It is not clear, however, why Hedgehog signaling near the notochord would require a special extracellular mediator. Another possibility is that maternal <italic>you</italic> function could mask earlier requirements in zygotic <italic>you</italic> mutants; future work with maternal-zygotic <italic>you</italic> mutants is needed to address this possibility. A third explanation of the requirement for <italic>you</italic> in only a subset of Hedgehog-regulated processes is that additional factors with redundant functions may substitute for <italic>you</italic> in other regions of the embryo. Intriguingly, expression of another <italic>Scube</italic> gene in mouse&#x02014;<italic>Scube1&#x02014;</italic>is observed in many embryonic tissues known to require Hedgehog signaling for their proper development, including the ventral forebrain, limb bud, somites, and developing gonad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b48">48</xref>]. These results suggest that an additional zebrafish <italic>Scube</italic> gene may also play a role in the development of other areas of the embryo where Hedgehog signaling is active. Moreover, interactions between SCUBE proteins may be important for Hedgehog signaling; biochemical analysis suggests that SCUBE1 and SCUBE2 proteins can interact to form both homodimers and heterodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030066-b52">52</xref>].</p><p>In addition to its role in promoting Hedgehog signaling in the developing muscle pioneers, ventral neural tube, and dorsal aorta, the expression pattern of <italic>you</italic> suggests that the gene may act in other cell types and perhaps in other pathways.

Donor cells in the embryo shown in (I&#x02013;K) contributed primarily to muscle and to non-floor-plate identities within the neural tube; in addition, a group of seven floor plate cells derived from the wild-type donor was present in the tail of this embryo (not shown).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0030066.g008"/></fig><table-wrap id="pbio-0030066-t001" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Chimeras with Wild-Type Donor Cells in <italic>you</italic> Mutant Hosts</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0030066.t001"/><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>Rescue of muscle pioneers in wild-type&#x02192;<italic>you</italic> mutant chimeras was evidenced by the presence of mutant (i.e., host) cells with strong Engrailed expression in elongate nuclei at the proper position in 1&#x02013;8 somites.
