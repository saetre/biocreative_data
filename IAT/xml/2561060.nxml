To further examine the role of telomerase during vertebrate development, the zebrafish telomerase reverse transcriptase (zTERT) was functionally characterized. Upon zTERT knockdown, zebrafish embryos show reduced telomerase activity and are viable, but develop pancytopenia resulting from aberrant hematopoiesis. The blood cell counts in TERT-depleted zebrafish embryos are markedly decreased and hematopoietic cell differentiation is impaired, whereas other somatic lineages remain morphologically unaffected. Although both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis is disrupted by zTERT knockdown, the telomere lengths are not significantly altered throughout early development. Induced p53 deficiency, as well as overexpression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and E1B-19K, significantly relieves the decreased blood cells numbers caused by zTERT knockdown, but not the impaired blood cell differentiation. Surprisingly, only the reverse transcriptase motifs of zTERT are crucial, but the telomerase RNA-binding domain of zTERT is not required, for rescuing complete hematopoiesis. This is therefore the first demonstration of a non-canonical catalytic activity of TERT, which is different from &#x0201c;authentic&#x0201d; telomerase activity, is required for during vertebrate hematopoiesis. On the other hand, zTERT deficiency induced a defect in hematopoiesis through a potent and specific effect on the gene expression of key regulators in the absence of telomere dysfunction. These results suggest that TERT non-canonically functions in hematopoietic cell differentiation and survival in vertebrates, independently of its role in telomere homeostasis. The data also provide insights into a non-canonical pathway by which TERT functions to modulate specification of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells during vertebrate development.

We show that zTERT knockdown causes hypochromic anemia at the onset of circulation, and that this is accompanied by the impaired differentiation of blood cells and their eventual apoptotic cell death leading to a severe reduction of hematopoietic cells (&#x02018;pancytopenia&#x02019;), during embryogenesis. The phenotypes resulting from zTERT deficiency bear many of the hallmarks of MDS, rather than of aplastic anemia. In addition, although peripheral blood cytopenia was observed, we also detected dysplasia of blood cell development during hematopoiesis. Based on the alterations of hematopoietic cell differentiation markers, TERT deficiency in zebrafish may cause differentiation and maturation failure in both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis. The cytopenic phenotype, but not impaired differentiation, in the zTERT-deficient embryos is significantly reduced by the loss of p53 as well as by the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and E1B-19K. Intriguingly, the effects observed in zTERT deficient embryos appear to be independent of the telomere maintenance function of telomerase, and can be compensated by the overexpression of a telomerase activity-negative deletion mutant of zTERT lacking the TR-binding domain. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that zTERT promotes the development of hematopoietic cells through a non-canonical mechanism that is independent of the authentic telomerase activity of TERT and the role of this enzyme in telomere lengthening. Our zebrafish model should therefore provide new platforms with which to examine novel TERT functions and pathways related to human hematopoietic disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Induction of apoptosis, but not telomere shortening, by the ablation of TERT in zebrafish embryos</title><p>Sequence analysis and comparisons have confirmed a high degree of homology between the functional domains of zTERT and human TERT (hTERT).

In addition, the overall primary structure of zTERT, based on its amino acid sequence, has a high degree of homology to that of human, mouse, chicken, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, and Fugu TERT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s003"><bold>Figure S1</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s004"><bold>Figure S2</bold></xref>). zTERT is also significantly expressed during early development and also in multiple tissues in adult fish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s005"><bold>Figure S3</bold></xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Kishi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To analyze the functional roles of the TERT protein during vertebrate development, we performed knockdown analysis of the zTERT gene. To this end, we designed a morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (MO) targeting the translation initiation codon and 5&#x02032;-UT region of the zTERT gene to block translation of zTERT mRNA (zTERT-MO1), and injected this MO into zebrafish embryos at the 1&#x02013;2-cell stage. As an antibody that specifically recognizes or cross-reacts with the zTERT protein is not currently available, we generated a construct containing the translational initiation site of zTERT fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a transgene (in mimicry of zTERT) for introduction into zebrafish embryos to demonstrate that our zTERT-MO1 works in vivo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s006"><bold>Figure S4A</bold></xref>).

In contrast, injections of two types of control MOs (a 5-base mismatch MO1 as the Cont-MO1 and an inverse-sequence MO1 for the sequence of zTERT-MO1) had no significant effects on telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g001"><bold>Figure 1B, b, c</bold></xref>; not shown for the inverse-sequence MO1).</p><p>An additional zTERT-specific MO (zTERT-MO2) was also designed that creates aberrant splicing between exon 5 and exon 6 of this gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s006"><bold>Figure S4B</bold></xref>).

TERT-deficient and control embryos at 24 hpf were hybridized with a Cy3-labeled peptide nucleic acid (PNA) telomere-specific probe as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Herrera1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Leri1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. Telomere speckles in interphase nuclei can be easily visualized and quantified by WM-Q-FISH throughout the body of the test animals. Magnified images of these speckles were then used to quantify the relative telomere lengths. We compared zTERT morphants and control animals by measuring the telomere lengths in the eyes, brains, and muscles of the injected embryos by WM-Q-FISH. No decrease in the telomere lengths was detectable in any of these tissues at 24&#x02013;72 hpf after injection of zTERT-MO1 or zTERT-MO2 (data not shown). Moreover, we performed metaphase chromosome spreading to enable telomere FISH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s007"><bold>Figure S5A, B</bold></xref>), in addition to the originally performed interphase telomere FISH. We then compared not only average telomere lengths, but also determined the number of critically short telomeres and signal-free telomere ends. We found populations of cells that exhibited no critical telomere shortening, and there were no statistically significant differences between the corresponding low fluorescent signals from either the MO1- or MO2-injected embryos when compared with the controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s007"><bold>Figure S5B</bold></xref>). These findings significantly reduced the likelihood that short telomeres play any role in propagating the cell fate abnormalities that we observe in the TERT-knockdown zebrafish embryos.</p><p>We also measured telomere lengths by terminal restriction fragment (TRF) Southern blotting after digestion of the genomic DNA with the <italic>Hinf I</italic> and <italic>Rsa I</italic> restriction enzymes and hybridization with telomere probes. The mean zebrafish telomere length was determined to be 15&#x02013;20 kb in embryos and larval fish as well as in young adult fish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s007"><bold>Figure S5C</bold></xref>). Consistent with our earlier Q-FISH results, the TRF lengths were found to be unchanged in the zTERT-MO embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s007"><bold>Figure S5C</bold></xref>). To verify that telomere length changes were indeed detectable by TRF Southern blotting, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> TRF shortening by <italic>DNase I</italic> nuclease treatment of zebrafish genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s007"><bold>Figure S5C, a</bold></xref>), as compared with longer (high) and shorter (low) human telomeres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s007"><bold>Figure S5C, b</bold></xref>). We likewise checked the integrity of the 3&#x02032; G-strand overhangs, but did not find significant differences between the zTERT knockdown embryos and the controls (data not shown). It thus appears that the inhibition of telomerase in the zTERT morphants is not sufficient to elicit detectable telomere shortening during the early developmental stages of zebrafish embryos.</p><p>With regard to the morphological phenotypes associated with a zTERT knockdown, zTERT-MO-injected embryos appear normal throughout embryogenesis, although a slight growth retardation was observed until 24 hpf (data not shown). However, after 24 hpf, TERT morphants do not display marked gross morphological changes, and their growth and development proceeds at the almost the same rate as in the control animals. We compared the number of apoptotic cells in zTERT-MO-injected embryos with wild-type animals. Accordingly, in zTERT morphants, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end-labeling)-positive apoptotic cells can be observed throughout the head and trunk and in the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta (VW-DA) where the first definitive hematopoietic stem cells presumably emerge at 28 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g002"><bold>Figure 2A, a, b</bold></xref>), with a gradual reduction after this time period. However, at 48 hpf (up to 72 hpf) in the caudal venous plexus (CVP), TUNEL-positive cells are detectable again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g002"><bold>Figure 2A, c, d</bold></xref>). The detection of TUNEL-positive cells in zebrafish <italic>gata-1</italic>-promoter-driven GFP (<italic>gata-1<sup>GFP</sup></italic>) transgenic fish at 48 hpf revealed that apoptotic cells were indeed involved in the blood cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g002"><bold>Figure 2A, e</bold></xref>).

From 60 hpf, circulating blood cells are dramatically decreased in the heart and blood vessels of zTERT-MO1-injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g002"><bold>Figure 2B, g, k, o</bold></xref>).

The decrease of circulating blood cells in TERT-deficient animals continued up to 5 days post fertilization (dpf), but subsequently recovered by 7 dpf, due to the transient knockdown of zTERT using MO in this system (data not shown). zTERT-MO2 elicited this same spectrum of blood cell phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s008"><bold>Figure S6A&#x02013;E</bold></xref>).</p><p>We next examined whether the overexpression of zTERT could rescue the blood cell number and differentiation phenotypes in our system, hence relieving the embryonic cytopenia and anemia induced by zTERT-MO1 and -MO2.

Co-injections of zTERT-MO1 or -MO2 together with either the GFP-zTERT or control GFP vector were then performed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref> shows the blood circulation in the heart area (lateral view, arrowhead indicates the heart). A red color that is indicative of normal chromic blood cell circulation in the heart was not observed at 48 and 72 hpf in TERT-deficient embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g002"><bold>Figure 2B, c, g</bold></xref>). TERT-deficient animals were significantly rescued from this decrease of blood cell circulation following the co-expression of a zTERT vector, but not by a control GFP vector, at 72 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g002"><bold>Figure 2B, g, h, o, p</bold></xref>). Notably, the overexpression of zTERT in Cont-MO-injected embryos did not induce any significant changes such as over-proliferation of blood cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g002"><bold>Figure 2B, C, b</bold></xref>). These results provide strong evidence that both anemia and cytopenia induced by two different zTERT-MOs (MO1 and MO2) is caused by the specific inhibition of zTERT function (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s011"><bold>Figure S9</bold></xref> for MO2).</p><p>We speculated that blood progenitor cells in TERT-deficient animals may not differentiate appropriately into normal mature erythrocytes. We therefore analyzed, using whole-embryo staining with o-dianisidine, whether the red blood cells present in TERT-deficient animals were sufficiently differentiated to become hemoglobinized. We confirmed that there was a severe reduction in the erythroid hemoglobin content in TERT-knockdown embryos compared with control embryos from 32 to 96 hpf but that these levels subsequently recovered by 7 dpf, due to the transient nature of this knockdown system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g002"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref> for MO1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s008"><bold>Figure S6C, D</bold></xref> for MO2). Moreover, the intravenous microinjection of iron-dextran failed to rescue this impaired hemoglobin production (data not shown), indicating that inadequate levels of circulatory iron cannot account for the hypochromia of TERT-deficient embryos. These results suggest that the circulating erythrocytes in TERT-deficient embryos are likely to still be immature and have defects in hemoglobin synthesis and/or production. This hypothesis was confirmed when we analyzed the blood cells in the artery and veins by hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining of tissue sections at 33 and 48 hpf. The blood cells in zTERT morphants appeared blast-like, with large nuclei characteristic of immature erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g002"><bold>Figure 2E</bold></xref>). Wright-Giemsa staining of isolated blood cells at 48 hpf also revealed inefficient development of erythrocytes having a blastic (immature) phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g002"><bold>Figure 2E</bold></xref> for MO1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s008"><bold>Figure S6E</bold></xref> for MO2). Taken together, these results indicate that TERT function is likely to be required for progenitor blood cell differentiation, and could also be required for their specification, maturation, and survival. At 72 hpf, although peripheral blood cytopenia was obviously detectable, some non-circulating blood cells still existed around the CVP, as evident from a transverse section of a zTERT morphant (data not shown). This suggests that phagocytosis followed by apoptotic cell death due to ineffective hematopoiesis is still actively occurring in these areas.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The involvement of zebrafish TERT in both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis</title><p>To examine the requirement of the <italic>TERT</italic> gene during developmental hematopoiesis in zebrafish, the expression of multiple marker genes for both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis was analyzed by in situ hybridization.

(D) Schematic model of hematopoiesis in TERT-deficient zebrafish embryos. In zebrafish embryos, hematopoiesis occurs in primitive and definitive waves. The first primitive/embryonic wave mainly generates primitive erythrocytes from progenitor cells in the intermediate cell mass (ICM) (represented by the blue color in the 20 and 28 hpf embryo models). The second definitive/adult wave gives rise to hematopoietic stem cells which have the potential to differentiate into all hematopoietic lineages and possess the self-renewal ability to maintain their blood system throughout life. Definitive hematopoietic cells, including stem cells, first arise in the aorta gonad mesonephros (AGM) region (represented by the red color in the 48 hpf embryo model). Definitive hematopoietic stem cells are thought to subsequently colonize the kidney, thymus, and pancreas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Hsia1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Davidson1">&#x0005b;88&#x0005d;</xref>. Our current model suggests that zTERT deficiency affects both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish, and induces impaired differentiation of the blood cells, including the erythrocyte lineage, prior to maturation. An &#x02018;X&#x02019; next to the indicated gene denotes downregulated expression. The yellow &#x02018;X&#x02019; in this schematic indicates a somewhat impaired pathway and the red &#x02018;X&#x02019; designates a severely impaired pathway. (E) A TERT deficiency in the zebrafish embryo leads to abnormal differentiation and apoptosis, presumably of hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells. This subsequently leads to the circulation of immature blood cells with hypochromic anemia due to a disruption of both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis without telomere shortening. Non-canonical functions of TERT, i.e. authentic telomerase-independent roles, may thus regulate the differentiation of hematopoietic cells, as well as protect these cells from apoptotic cell death during hematopoiesis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0003364.g007"/></fig><p>The specific mutations generating substitutions of the aspartic acid and valine residues at positions 710 and 711 with alanine and isoleucine (D710A and V711I) in the RT motif A of hTERT result in the ablation of authentic telomerase activity and confer dominant-negative properties against the authentic telomerase activity and canonical function of TERT (DN-hTERT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Hahn1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Zhang1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>.

The embryos injected with this construct were not significantly protected from endpoint cytopenia, but still slightly recovered from the manifestation of a decreased heme intensity presumably through partial heme synthesis/production in insufficiently differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g007"><bold>Figure 7A, B</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s011"><bold>Figure S9</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s012"><bold>Figure S10</bold></xref>). These findings from both zTERT and hTERT rescue studies indicate that irrespective of its TR-binding ability and authentic telomerase activity, there are non-canonical functions of the RT domain of TERT which may be particularly essential for hematopoietic cell differentiation and survival. In addition, since &#x00394;TR-zTERT no longer specifically localizes in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g006"><bold>Figure 6B, d, d'</bold></xref>), but still rescues the hematopoietic phenotype, the activities of &#x00394;TR-zTERT in the cytoplasm may be capable of attenuating any blood cell abnormalities.</p><p>Finally, consistent with the results of our rescue experiments described above, cytomorphological abnormalities, such as large nuclei and the basophilic cytoplasms of immature erythrocytes, were found also to be restored by both &#x00394;TR-zTERT and WT-zTERT expression in the morphant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g007"><bold>Figure 7C</bold></xref>). Intriguingly, a moderate level of restoration of these aberrant morphologies in erythrocytes by CD-zTERT and &#x00394;TR-CD-zTERT was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g007"><bold>Figure 7C</bold></xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that a metal-binding-dependent certain novel &#x02018;catalytic&#x02019; function of zTERT is critical for the full maintenance of hematopoiesis, but also that other &#x02018;non-catalytic&#x02019; function(s) of TERT could be involved in hematopoietic cell differentiation at least in part because mutant TERT (CD-zTERT, &#x00394;TR-CD-zTERT, or DN-hTERT) having a disruption to its metal-binding function still retains a minor ability for this process in heme intensity and cellular morphology. Thus, the canonical TERT function as the authentic/conventional telomerase activity is presumably not essential for hematopoietic cell development observed in our current system. The results of our current study further indicate that an unknown and non-canonical (enzymatic) function(s) associated with the RT motifs of TERT are likely to be required for normal hematopoietic cell development during vertebrate embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s002"><bold>Table S1</bold></xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>A deficiency in TERT in zebrafish causes ineffective hematopoiesis accompanied by anemia, impaired specification and differentiation, hematopoietic cell apoptosis, and pancytopenia. Moreover, these phenotypes observed in TERT-knockdown zebrafish embryos resemble MDS in humans. Disabled differentiation in hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells may underlie both the apoptotic response and maturation defects which occur in both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis, although further studies will be required to definitively elucidate this relationship. The disruption of the hematopoietic cell lineages caused by the zTERT deficiency in our current study was observed in the absence of telomere length alterations, although both the apoptotic and cytopenic phenotypes in these mutants were still dependent, at least in part, upon p53 and Bcl-2 functions. Intriguingly, the overexpression of the RT domain of zTERT (without the TR-binding domain) as well as full-length zTERT rescues the TERT-deficient animals from pancytopenia, with a concurrent restoration of differentiation. Taken together, our data suggest that zTERT is involved in both the differentiation and survival of hematopoietic cells independently of its canonical role in telomere maintenance.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>A crucial role of TERT in hematopoietic cell differentiation and survival in vertebrates</title><p>It has been reported previously that the zebrafish Hspa9b/Mortalin-2 mutant shows a developmental blood defect that closely recapitulates the ineffective hematopoiesis seen in MDS patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Craven1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since MDS is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disease characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and peripheral cytopenias, TERT deficiency in zebrafish possibly recapitulates this disorder. During zebrafish hematopoiesis, definitive progenitors can be observed in the posterior ICM and in the dorsal aorta as early as 24 hpf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Orkin1">&#x0005b;79&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Thompson1">&#x0005b;80&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-KalevZylinska1">&#x0005b;81&#x0005d;</xref>. However, since it is unknown whether zebrafish hematopoietic stem cells continue to arise de novo, we cannot rule out the possibility that a failure of later arising stem cell populations to develop may lead to the actual blood cell reduction which we observe by 72 hpf.</p><p>Although there is accumulating evidence that apoptosis plays a crucial role in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell development, the precise mechanisms and roles of TERT in apoptotic signaling pathways have not so far been elucidated. Recent reports strongly suggest that p53, Puma, Slug, and Bcl-2 family members, including Mcl-1, play crucial roles in the agonistic versus antagonistic regulation of apoptosis in hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Wu1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. In our current zTERT morphants, decreases in the circulating blood cells were restored by either a p53 knockdown by MOs or a p53 mutant background. The overexpression of Bcl-2 or E1B-19K was also found to counteract the reduction in the number of blood cells due to cytopenia. Interestingly, caspase-3 activation was only detectable during primitive hematopoiesis in these TERT morphants from 19&#x02013;24 hpf, and not at later stages (data not shown). Furthermore, inhibition of this early caspase activation decreases the levels of TERT knockdown-induced apoptosis in the ICM primitive wave (&#x0223c;28 hpf), whereas a later apoptotic response observed in the CVP (48&#x02013;72 hpf) is unaffected by this caspase suppression (data not shown). Notably also, caspase inhibition does not appear to be effective in inhibiting the cytopenic phenotype of the zTERT morphants. Thus, the later apoptosis mediated by p53 in the CVP of the zTERT knockdown embryos may be independent of early caspase activation, but is presumably linked with the induction of cytopenia that is evident by 72 hpf. Further analyses will be required to determine the underlying mechanisms connecting the early and late phases of apoptosis during the transition stages from primitive to definitive hematopoiesis.</p><p>Importantly, none of the interventions (p53 deficiency, Bcl-2, and E1B-19K) used in our present experiments that inhibit apoptosis were capable of restoring the insufficient differentiation and maturation of erythrocytes in the zTERT morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g005"><bold>Figure 5E</bold></xref>, and data not shown), suggesting that TERT is an essential component of certain processes underlying hematopoietic cell differentiation, regardless of the survival pathways that may be initiated.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Differing functions of TERT in hematopoiesis among vertebrate species</title><p>The well documented and conventional function of TERT is its role as the catalytic component of telomerase which is indispensable for the maintenance of telomeres, and thus genome integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Autexier1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

This also means that the role of not only telomerase, but also TERT in hematopoietic cells is still incompletely understood.

However, one previous report has rather surprisingly showed that TR was still required for this function of TERT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Flores1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas another has demonstrated that a TR-unrelated function is essential for this alternative role of TERT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Sarin1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Most recently, Choi et al. further reported that a catalytically inactive mutant of TERT (TERT<sup>ci</sup>) retains the full activity of wild-type TERT in hair follicle stem cell activation and keratinocyte proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Choi1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Our current finding that the &#x00394;TR-zTERT rescues the effects of zTERT depletion is consistent with a TR-independent functional role (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s002"><bold>Table S1</bold></xref>). The evidence that CD-zTERT significantly loses its function in hematopoiesis further suggests that TR-independent unknown (catalytic) activities of TERT may be involved in hematopoietic cell differentiation and survival. Therefore, there are at least three types of telomere metabolism-independent non-canonical functions of TERT; the first of these still requires both TERT and TR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Flores1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, the second does not requires the catalytic activity of TERT (i.e., TERT<sup>ci</sup>) and TR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Sarin1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Choi1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, and the third that we have elucidated herein does not require the authentic (conventional) catalytic activity of TERT but requires TR-independent (catalytic) activities/functions of TERT.</p><p>When and how does TERT function non-canonically? It is possible that if the telomeres are longer than a certain minimal length, TERT may perform non-canonical functions at intracellular locations other than telomeres. Under these circumstances, TERT may be able to alternatively function in cellular proliferation and mobilization, or may be required for cellular differentiation and survival independent of telomere metabolisms. Our present findings support this notion. Hence, zTERT-deficient embryos exhibit severe anemia and cytopenia that presumably results from disruption of the primitive and definitive waves of hematopoiesis in the absence of alterations in telomere length. Furthermore, a zTERT deficiency likely causes defects in hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells. TERT might affect the self-renewal of stem cells as well as normal specification and differentiation of stem/progenitor cells during zebrafish hematopoiesis when these cells have telomeres of sufficient length and integrity. Although an extremely minor number of critically short telomeres may still affect the maintenance of hematopoietic lineages, it should be noted that we did not detect any significant differences in the lengths in critically short telomeres or the average telomere lengths in zTERT-deficient embryos. No pattern of short telomeres at the same chromosome ends was evident either in the zTERT morphants i.e. specific chromosome ends with short telomeres were essentially randomly distributed in both the control and zTERT-MO1- or MO2-injected embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003364.s007"><bold>Figure S5</bold></xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, our current results do not exclude the possibility that the telomere lengths themselves are also critical for the maintenance of hematopoietic cell lineages. In fact, it has been reported that wild-type mice derived from the late generation of <italic>mTR<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> heterozygous parents which had short telomeres display hematopoietic phenotypes resembling aplastic anemia and dyskeratosis congenita <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Hao1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our data strongly suggest that non-canonical TERT functions exist that are separate from its role in telomere maintenance via telomerase and regulate hematopoietic cell differentiation and survival, presumably without affecting telomere length.</p><p>In zebrafish embryos, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g007"><bold>Figure 7D</bold></xref>, hematopoiesis occurs in primitive and definitive waves. The first primitive/embryonic wave mainly generates primitive erythrocytes from progenitor cells in the ICM (represented by blue color in the 20 and 28 hpf embryo models). The second definitive/adult wave gives rise to hematopoietic stem cells which have the potential to differentiate into all hematopoietic lineages and possess the self-renewal ability to maintain the blood system throughout life. Definitive hematopoietic cells, including stem cells, first arise in the AGM region (represented by red color in the 48 hpf embryo model). Definitive hematopoietic stem cells are thought to subsequently colonize the kidney, thymus, and pancreas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Hsia1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Davidson1">&#x0005b;88&#x0005d;</xref>. Our current model suggests that zTERT deficiency affects both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish, and induces impaired differentiation of the blood cells, including the erythrocyte lineage, prior to maturation. Moreover, TERT deficiency leads to the abnormal differentiation and apoptosis presumably of hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells, subsequently leading to the circulation of immature blood cells with anemia, by disturbing normal hematopoiesis without obvious telomere shortening. Non-canonical functions of TERT other than telomerase may thus regulate the differentiation of hematopoietic cells, as well as protect them from apoptotic cell death during developmental hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003364-g007"><bold>Figure 7E</bold></xref>).</p><p>An important question that arises from our current data is the nature of the mechanism that underlies this non-canonical function of zTERT. In many other species, the RT domain of TERT has not been demonstrated to contribute to TR binding, although this has not been directly confirmed in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Xie1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Because TERT mutants bearing deletions in their TR-binding domain functionally rescue both the circulating blood cells and defective differentiation of hematopoietic cells in zTERT morphants, an unknown activity of the RT domain of TERT, other than telomerase activity, may be crucial for hematopoiesis. Our data thus encourage further studies to address three important questions: (1) the nature of the mechanisms by which TERT can regulate hematopoietic cell differentiation and survival without telomere regulation; (2) the intracellular locations and regions where these non-canonical functions operate within the cell; and (3) the precise target of the non-canonical function(s) of the RT domain of TERT.</p><p>In the phylogenetic tree of TERT and retroelements rooted with RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, the RT motifs in the RT family are universally conserved &#x0005b;including multicopy single-stranded DNA, group II introns, LTR or non-LTR (Long Terminal Repeat) retrotransposons, and viral RT&#x0005d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Peng1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;89&#x0005d;</xref>. Structural and functional analyses of viral RT and TERT have revealed striking degrees of conservation of important residues within the RT motifs involved in nucleotide binding, rNTP/dNTP discrimination, and nucleotide addition processivity between viral RT and TERT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Peng1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike all other RT family members, only TERT carries an N-terminal extension as its RNA-binding domain. Based on these facts, it is tempting to speculate that the high-affinity RNA-binding domain of TERT defines (or confines) telomere-interacting specificity, but the RT domain itself may function in a conventional way in certain genomic DNA structures. Alternatively, it has been recently demonstrated that both yeast and human TERT can function as a template- and RNA-independent terminal transferase (TT) for DNA synthesis in the presence of Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Lue1">&#x0005b;90&#x0005d;</xref>. Conceivably, this TT activity might underlie one of the functional roles of the TR-binding domain-deleted zTERT mutant. Although the intrinsic ability of TERT to act as an intracellular TT in vertebrates still needs to be demonstrated in vivo, a variety of DNA and RNA polymerases including RTs are well known to mediate template-independent nucleotide addition under certain conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Lue1">&#x0005b;90&#x0005d;</xref>. Irrespective of the telomere ends, such a template- and RNA-independent TT activity of TERT may be capable of functioning in the repair of broken terminal ends.</p><p>It is also possible that RT motifs themselves might interact with some regulatory non-protein-coding RNAs (regulatory RNAs), such as microRNAs, which have been shown to be involved in modulation of certain gene expressions at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Such regulatory RNAs participate in many mechanisms that regulate chromatin modification and transcription factor activity, and influence mRNA stability, processing, and translation, all of which are key factors in multiple aspects of differentiation and development, including hematopoiesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Wienholds1">&#x0005b;91&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Chen1">&#x0005b;92&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003364-Fazi1">&#x0005b;93&#x0005d;</xref>.

We measured each of the chromatids in a preselected quarter of a metaphase plate (i.e. the upper part of the metaphase between hours 12 and 3).
