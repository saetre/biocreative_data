HIV-1 Tat-specific factor 1 (Tat-SF1) is among these cofactors that were identified by <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted transcription reactions with immunodepleted nuclear extracts. At the onset of this work, the prevailing hypothesis was that Tat-SF1 was a required cofactor for the viral regulatory protein, Tat; however, this had not previously been formally tested <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>To directly address the involvement of Tat-SF1 in HIV-1 gene expression, we depleted Tat-SF1 in HeLa cells by conventional expression of shRNAs and in T- Rex -293 cells containing tetracycline-inducible shRNAs targeting Tat-SF1. We achieved efficient depletion of Tat-SF1 and demonstrated that this did not affect cell viability. HIV-1 infectivity decreased in Tat-SF1-depleted cells, but only when multiple rounds of infection occurred. Neither Tat-dependent nor basal transcription from the HIV-1 LTR was affected by Tat-SF1 depletion, suggesting that the decrease in infectivity was due to a deficiency at a later step in the viral lifecycle. Finally, Tat-SF1 depletion resulted in an increase in the ratio of unspliced to spliced viral transcripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Tat-SF1 is not required for regulating HIV-1 transcription, but is required for maintaining the ratios of different classes of HIV-1 transcripts.

Four T-Rex-293 cell lines were constructed containing four unique shRNAs that targeted Tat-SF1, which were expressed from tetracycline-inducible promoters (see Materials and Methods). This system minimized continuous expression of the shRNAs until tetracycline was added to the media, thus reducing selection based on shRNA expression. All of the cell lines were tested for shRNA-mediated Tat-SF1 depletion, and the two most efficient, Tat-SF1(A) and Tat-SF1(B), were used in all subsequent experiments. In addition, two control cell lines were made that stably integrated either an empty vector (no shRNA) or an shRNA targeting GFP. Tetracycline concentration and induction time were optimized to achieve the maximum level of knockdown. Analysis of cell lysates from induced cells shows that both cell lines that contain an shRNA targeting Tat-SF1 have significantly lower Tat-SF1 protein levels compared to the empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005710-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The knockdown of Tat-SF1 by either shRNA did not affect the levels of CCNT1, a direct binding partner of Tat-SF1, or the polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB), an unrelated splicing factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005710-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

Rather than having a role in transcription elongation of HIV-1 RNA, it seemed possible that Tat-SF1 could post-transcriptionally regulate viral gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we used Northern blots to analyze HIV-1 RNAs in control and knockdown cells. The pSG3&#x00394;Env plasmid was transfected into GFP control and Tat-SF1 knockdown T-Rex-293 cell lines, and total RNA was harvested 48 hours later. Hybridization was performed using an HIV-1 LTR-specific radiolabeled probe that detects all three classes of viral RNAs: unspliced (&#x0223c;9 kb), singly spliced (&#x0223c;4 kb), and fully spliced (&#x0223c;2 kb). A western blot of T-Rex-293 cell lysates confirms efficient knockdown of Tat-SF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005710-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005710-g005">Figure 5B</xref> shows the results of a representative Northern blot probing RNA from GFP control and Tat-SF1 knockdown cell lines 48 hours after transfection with the pSG3&#x00394;Env plasmid. In the mock transfected lane, no viral pre-mRNA signal is detected, indicating that the bands seen in the other lanes are HIV-1-specific. Quantification of each RNA class demonstrates that intron-containing unspliced and singly spliced transcripts were elevated and fully spliced transcripts were reduced when Tat-SF1 was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005710-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This corresponds to an unspliced/fully spliced ratio of &#x0223c;0.7 in GFP control cells and &#x0223c;1.6 in Tat-SF1 depleted cells. Similar changes in ratios were observed when another viral plasmid, pNL-Luc-HXB, was transfected into Tat-SF1 depleted T-Rex-293 cells (data not shown). These data further suggest a post-transcriptional role for Tat-SF1.</p><fig id="pone-0005710-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005710.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Tat-SF1 maintains the levels of unspliced and spliced HIV-1 RNAs.</title><p>(A) Western blot analysis confirming knockdown in T-Rex-293 cells. (B) Representative Northern blot analysis of HIV-1 RNA classes. T-Rex-293 cells were transfected with pSG3&#x00394;Env 72 hours after tetracycline induction. At 48 hours post-transfection, total RNA was isolated for electrophoresis and Northern blotting. A DNA probe specific to the HIV-1 LTR detected the &#x0223c;9 kb unspliced, &#x0223c;4 kb singly spliced, and &#x0223c;2 kb fully spliced RNAs. Lane 1 contains RNA from mock-transfected GFP control cells, lane 2 from transfected GFP control cells, and lanes 3 and 4 from transfected Tat-SF1 shRNA cells. The lower panel shows the same membrane, stripped and reprobed for GAPDH. (C) Tat-SF1 depletion alters the levels of HIV-1 RNA classes. Values are reported as the mean proportion of each RNA class, relative to the GFP control cells from three independent Northern blot experiments. Error bars represent standard error. Statistically significant differences between GFP control and Tat-SF1 knockdown conditions are indicated with asterisks. (D) Tat-SF1 depletion does not alter total HIV-1 RNA levels. Levels of the 3 RNA classes quantified from triplicate Northern blots were totaled and normalized to GAPDH levels. Values are reported as the means relative to the GFP control cells from three independent experiments. Error bars represent standard error. (E) Tat-SF1 depletion results in an increase in unspliced HIV-1 transcripts. qRT-PCR was performed on the same RNA samples used for Northern blot experiments.

Indeed, total HIV-1 RNA levels were not significantly different between the control and Tat-SF1 knockdown cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005710-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>As an independent test of a change in the splicing pattern, the same RNAs used in the Northern blot experiments were analyzed by qRT-PCR. We attempted the specific amplification of the 9 kb, 4 kb and 2 kb classes using previously published oligos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Exline1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Nonetheless, separation the PCR products on an acrylamide gel revealed that, although the 9 kb primers produced one distinct band, the 4 kb and 2 kb primers produced multiple amplicons larger than the expected one (likely including unspliced RNAs). In addition, the qPCR melting curves indicated more than one product for the 4 kb amplification. In fact, careful inspection of the design of the oligos used in a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Exline1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> suggests that the reported RNA-class specificity would be exceedingly difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, the quantification of the unspliced RNAs over all initiated transcripts confirmed that there was an increase in the 9 kb, unspliced transcripts upon Tat-SF1 knockdown, in concordance with the Northern blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005710-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). This change in the viral splicing pattern suggests that Tat-SF1 plays a post-transcriptional role in regulating the ratio of unspliced to spliced HIV-1 RNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results presented here shed new light on the mechanism by which the human protein, Tat-SF1, functions in HIV-1 replication. The first important conclusion was that Tat-SF1 was not required for basal or Tat-dependent transcription from the HIV-1 LTR <italic>in vivo</italic>. This contradicts previously reported conclusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Zhou2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Kim1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>; however, careful reevaluation of the published data suggests concerns about these earlier inferences. First, as part of a multiprotein complex, immunodepletion of Tat-SF1 from nuclear extract may have resulted in co-depletion of other proteins essential for Tat transactivation, most notably, cyclin T1, which directly binds Tat-SF1. As a subunit of P-TEFb, co-depletion of cyclin T1 could certainly affect levels of transcription. Equally, RNAi-mediated depletion of CA150, which we previously hypothesized would be a Tat cofactor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Sune1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and which is also known to interact with P-TEFb, did not show any effect on basal or Tat-dependent transcription from the HIV-1 LTR (data not shown). In light of these RNAi-mediated depletion experiments, it seems very possible that the identification of both Tat-SF1 and CA150 as Tat cofactors from Tat-affinity column experiments could be explained by their association with P-TEFb.</p><p>A previous report on Tat-SF1 function showed a small increase in Tat transactivation when Tat-SF1 was overexpressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Zhou2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. As described earlier, this change was primarily due to a decrease in basal transcription, however, even this effect was not reproduced using a different promoter to drive expression of Tat-SF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Kim1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data indicated that Tat-SF1 was not present at an integrated HIV-1 LTR-driven reporter gene during Tat transactivation <italic>in vivo</italic>, while RNAPII and P-TEFb were <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Bres1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. This finding is difficult to reconcile with Tat-SF1 being a required Tat cofactor. Nonetheless, when a cell line harboring integrated proviral DNA was utilized for ChIP experiments, Tat-SF1 was detected at the promoter-proximal region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Zhou4">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. In light of our data, we propose that the presence of viral splice sites or other elements in the HIV-1 transcripts explains the recruitment of Tat-SF1 to the proviral locus.</p><p>An alternative explanation for the different conclusions drawn from previous overexpression and our knockdown studies is that lack of functioning Tat-SF1 can be compensated by another cellular protein. SPT5 has also been reported to stimulate Tat transactivation when overexpressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Kim1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and inhibits transactivation when immunodepleted from nuclear extract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-WuBaer1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> or depleted by RNAi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Ping1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. CA150 did not compensate for Tat-SF1 depletion, as a double knockdown of both proteins did not affect HIV-1 transcription (data not shown). Our findings do not eliminate the possibility that Tat-SF1 plays some role in Tat transactivation, although it is not absolutely required. A similar caveat, which can be leveled against all silencing experiments, is that a knockdown is not tantamount to a knockout, and the remaining level of the silenced gene product is sufficient for activity. Nonetheless, depletion of Tat-SF1 did result in the reduced viral replication and altered ratios of viral transcripts, so the preponderance of the evidence strongly suggests that Tat-SF1 is not a required Tat stimulatory factor.</p><p>Another important and novel finding presented here is that Tat-SF1 depletion increased the ratio of unspliced to spliced viral transcripts. It should be noted that splicing patterns of HIV transcripts among different cell lines are highly uniform, suggesting that the tight regulation of these transcript ratios is crucial for the viral lifecycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Sonza1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Purcell1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Gorry1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Careful investigation of the changes in HIV-1 spliced ratios over time showed that accumulation of unspliced and singly spliced RNAs and reduction of fully spliced RNAs did not occur until 48 hours post-transfection (data not shown). These data highlight the importance of timing when analyzing HIV-1 spliced RNAs. Thus, we have focused our efforts for determining Tat-SF1's role in maintaining RNA ratios to later time points.</p><p>While an effect on transcript ratios can be explained by several different mechanisms, we propose that Tat-SF1 regulates alternative splicing of HIV-1 RNAs. This is consistent with previous data regarding the yeast protein CUS2, which is structurally similar to human Tat-SF1. Both proteins contain two RRMs in their N-terminus, but Tat-SF1 has a large acidic C-terminus that is absent in CUS2. The first RRMs of these proteins are 37&#x00025; identical and 59&#x00025; similar. The second RRMs are 30&#x00025; identical and 56&#x00025; similar. CUS2 associates with U2 snRNA in splicing extracts and co-immunoprecipitates PRP11, which is a subunit of SF3a. When anti-Tat-SF1 antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation, the human homologue of PRP11, SF3a66(SAP62), was also immunoprecipitated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Yan1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. An effect of Tat-SF1 depletion on HIV-1 RNA ratios is also consistent with recent unpublished data from our laboratory that demonstrate that Tat-SF1 depletion changes the relative levels many alternatively spliced transcripts in human cells without affecting the total amount of these transcripts (H.B. Miller <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished results). An effect on splicing could be direct, as proposed for CUS2. Thus, Tat-SF1 could help in the folding and activity of splicing factors such as U2 snRNAs, but it could also rework the folding of the HIV transcripts leading to efficient splicing. Tat-SF1 may also have an indirect effect on HIV-1 pre-mRNA splicing by regulating the processing of transcripts encoding other HIV dependency factors (HDFs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Brass1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Konig1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Zhou5">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, we analyzed the HDFs published by the Brass <italic>et al.</italic> and Konig <italic>et al.</italic> screens and found approximately 2-fold enrichment over chance alone in genes that also had evidence of Tat-SF1-regulated alternative splicing (p-values of 0.02 and 0.05, respectively) (H.B. Miller <italic>et al</italic>, unpublished results). Tat-SF1 could also be involved in virion packaging. The decrease in infectivity in Tat-SF1 depleted cells could be explained if Tat-SF1 was a chaperone protein, helping fold the viral pre-mRNA genome into productive virions. Such a role in viral RNA packaging would be consistent with Tat-SF1's role in influenza virus replication. Tat-SF1 was identified as a stimulatory host factor, possibly aiding in the formation of RNA-nucleoprotein complexes by acting as a molecular chaperone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Naito1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. It remains to be seen whether Tat-SF1 binds HIV-1 pre-mRNA and helps package viral genomes into virions. An increase in the unspliced RNA upon Tat-SF1 knockdown could also be explained by Tat-SF1 having a role in RNA export from the nucleus, although this has not yet been tested. Additionally, Tat-SF1 may play a role in regulating the levels of unspliced and spliced HIV-1 RNAs by affecting their stability. The virus may rely on Tat-SF1 to destabilize unspliced RNAs in order to maintain an optimal ratio of unspliced and spliced RNAs.</p><p>Other studies that support a role for Tat-SF1 in HIV replication found that Tat-SF1 was upregulated in either HIV-1 gp120 stimulated primary T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Misse1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref> or HIV-1 Nef overexpression in T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Simmons1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. The strongest validation of Tat-SF1's role in the HIV-1 lifecycle was revealed when it was identified in a large-scale, RNAi-based screen for HIV-dependency factors (HDFs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005710-Brass1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the fact that these studies refer to Tat-SF1 as a Tat cofactor, their findings remain consistent with this protein being involved in the post-transcriptional control of HIV-1 RNA levels and further support the idea that Tat-SF1 depletion has a negative effect on the viral life cycle <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Hal Bogard, Dr. Jennifer Lin Umbach, and Dr. Bryan Cullen for valuable reagents and technical advice.
