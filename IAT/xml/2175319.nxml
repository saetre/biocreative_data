Here we report that the addition of actinomycin D to <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> cultures triggers the expression of the <italic>radA</italic> paralogue <italic>sso0777</italic>. Furthermore, a specific retarded band is observed when electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with crude <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> cell extracts and the <italic>sso0777</italic> promoter were carried out. The protein that binds to this promoter was isolated and identified as Sta1. Footprinting experiments have shown that the Sta1 DNA-binding site is included in the ATTTTTTATTTTCACATGTAAGATGTTTATT sequence, which is located upstream the putative TTG translation starting codon of the <italic>sso0777</italic> gene. Additionally, gel electrophoretic mobility retardation experiments using mutant <italic>sso0777</italic> promoter derivatives show the presence of three essential motifs (TTATT, CANGNA and TTATT) that are absolutely required for Sta1 DNA binding. Finally, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments confirm that Sta1 functions as an activator for <italic>sso0777</italic> gene expression being the first identified archaeal regulatory protein associated with the DNA damage-mediated induction of gene expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Transcription in archaea has been studied for several years, and has similarities with transcription in both eukarya and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The basal transcriptional apparatus of archaea (RNA polymerase and transcriptional factors) has an eukaryal nature, while transcriptional regulation resembles that of bacteria. For the basal transcription initiation, the archaeal RNA polymerase needs two factors: TBP and TFB. TBP binds in a sequence-specific manner to the TATA-box, a T/A-rich sequence located &#x0223c;24 bp upstream of the start codon. TFB has its counterpart in the eukaryotic TFIIB and it binds specifically to a purine-rich B-recognition element (BRE) located immediately upstream of the TATA-box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). This element is crucial for the orientation of the transcription pre-initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The recruitment of the RNA polymerase takes place by interaction with the amino terminal domain of TFB once TBP and TFB are bound to the promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Some archaea have several homologues of TFB and/or TBP which points to the possibility of gene expression regulation by differential usage of these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). However, it is worth noting that this is not the only way to regulate gene expression in archaea since they have multiple putative regulators similar to bacterial ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Many of them belong to the bacterial Lrp-like regulator family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), nevertheless none of these regulators have been related to DNA damage regulation.</p><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the DNA damage response is well defined, and it is known that more than 40 genes are involved in the SOS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). DNA repair in archaea is still poorly understood and its regulation has not been elucidated. The increasing number of sequenced archaeal genomes showed that most of the DNA-repair proteins are more similar to eukarya rather than bacteria, but many DNA repair-related proteins are absent from their genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Recently, several microarray studies with <italic>Halobacterium</italic> NRC-1 and <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> have shed light on this area showing that not many DNA repair-related genes are upregulated after DNA damage in these organisms, suggesting that a SOS-like response does not exist for archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In such microarray studies some transcriptional regulators were upregulated but their function is still unknown. Here we report the first transcriptional regulator clearly implicated in DNA damage regulation.</p><p>The RecA protein family, which includes RadA in archaea and Rad51 in eukarya, is one of the most highly conserved DNA-repair proteins known, and plays a fundamental role in DNA strand exchange during homologous recombination and double-strand break repair. In <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> and related species, there are two clear homologues of RecA, the well-characterized RadA protein (Sso0250) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>) and a less-conserved RadA paralogue of unknown function named Sso0777 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In this work, we describe the effect in the expression of <italic>S. solfataricus radA</italic> and <italic>sso0777</italic> genes of actinomycin D, which binds to DNA duplexes interfering with transcription, replication and DNA/RNA processing also being able to induce DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). We also show that <italic>in vitro</italic>, the Sta1 protein, which has been recently described as an activator of some promoters from the <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> rudivirus SIRV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), positively regulates the expression of <italic>sso0777</italic> in this organism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Microbial strains growth and actinomycin D treatment</title><p>The <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> strain P2 used in this work was a generous gift from Prof. Francesca M. Pisani (Instituto di Biochimica delle Proteine, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Napoli, Italy). <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> cultures were grown in DSM 182 medium with glucose (0.1%), being its pH adjusted to 3.7 with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and incubated at 70&#x000b0;C with vigorous shaking. For DNA damage induction experiments, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml of actinomycin D (Sigma) was added to 10 ml culture when OD<sub>600</sub> reached 0.3 and incubated for 2 h at 70&#x000b0;C. As a negative control, the same procedure was carried out with another culture without actinomycin D. All plasmid constructions and cloning experiments were performed in <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Protein overexpression was carried out using either <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus RIL or <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) Rosetta cells as described below. <italic>E. coli</italic> growth conditions were as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). When needed, antibiotic concentrations were used for each bacterial strain as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA purification and RT-PCR experiments</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The resultant RNA was treated with RNAse-free DNAse I (Roche) and the absence of residual DNA was determined by PCR. RNA integrity was tested by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified spectrophotometrically. RT-PCR experiments were performed using Titan One Tube RT-PCR System (Roche) with the suitable oligonucleotides (listed in Table S1), following the supplier instructions. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of total RNA was carried out in a LightCycler apparatus (Roche), using the LCRNA master SYBR green I kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 23S RNA, radA, <italic>sso0777</italic> and <italic>sta1</italic> reverse and forward oligonucleotides (Roche) are shown in Table S1 of Supplementary Data. The 23S ribosomal RNA gene was used as a control as its expression is not affected by DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The concentration of total RNA of both treated and untreated cultures were adjusted to the same value, and the genes to be tested, as well as the control, were assayed simultaneously using a set of standard samples for each one.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays</title><p>DNA probes were generated by PCR using one of the primers labelled at its 5&#x02032; end with digoxigenin (DIG) (Table S1). After PCR, electrophoresis in a 2&#x02013;3% low-melting-point agarose gel was performed and the PCR amplicons were purified using Wizard PCR preps DNA purification Resin (Promega). Binding reactions (20 &#x003bc;l) containing 20 ng of the DIG-DNA-labelled probe and 1 &#x003bc;l of <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> crude extract (0.5 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l) or 100 ng of purified Sta1 protein were incubated 10 min at 65&#x000b0;C using the previously described binding buffer: 10 mM <italic>N</italic>-2-Hydroxyethyl-piperazine-<italic>N</italic>&#x02032; 2-ethanesulphonic acid (HEPES), NaOH (pH 8), 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8), 5% glycerol, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 50 &#x003bc;g/ml BSA and 1 mg/ml of salmon DNA that was added to the binding mixture to avoid the activity of either non-specific DNA-binding proteins or nucleases present in the crude extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), and loaded onto a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel buffered with Tris&#x02013;glycine (25 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.5), 250 mM glycine, 1 mM EDTA). DNA&#x02013;protein complexes were separated at 100 V for 90 min, and transferred to a Biodine B nylon membrane (Pall Gelman Laboratory). DIG-labelled DNA&#x02013;protein complexes were detected following the manufacturer's protocol (Roche). For the competition EMSA experiments, a 300-fold molar excess of either specific or non-specific unlabelled competitor DNA was also included in the mixture. All EMSA were repeated a minimum of three times to ensure reproducibility of results. For EMSA studies using either the <italic>radA</italic> or the <italic>sta1</italic> probe, other described experimental conditions were also tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27">24&#x02013;27</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of crude <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> cell extracts and identification of the <italic>sso0777</italic> promoter-binding protein</title><p>A <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> culture (120 ml) was grown to mid-exponential phase, pelleted and sonicated in 1.5 ml of sonication buffer (50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA) plus protease inhibitors (Complete Mini; Roche). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the soluble fraction was quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>A DNA oligonucleotide containing two copies of the <italic>sso0777</italic> promoter region (from &#x02212;63 to + 1 position with regard to the TTG translational start codon) was constructed, and used as a template for a PCR with biotinylated primers. The crude extract binding capacity of this PCR fragment was tested in a competition EMSA assay. The PCR product was purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and 400 ng of this DNA was bound to 50 &#x003bc;l of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (10 mg/ml) (Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin; Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's description for 15 min at room temperature. After washing with the previously described binding buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), the beads were incubated for 15 min at 65&#x000b0;C, in 150 &#x003bc;l of binding mixture containing 50 &#x003bc;l of <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> cells crude extract (0.5 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l) and binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with binding buffer containing 2.5 M KCl. Eluted proteins were desalted with Microcon YM-3 (Amicon; Millipore), loaded in a 15% SDS&#x02013;PAGE gel, and stained with either Brilliant Blue G Colloidal (Sigma) or Bio-Rad Silver Stain kit (Bio-Rad). As a control, the same process was carried out using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads with no biotinylated DNA bound to the beads. In all cases, the whole process was repeated three times and the same bands were always detected.</p><p>The identification of the eluted proteins was done in the <italic>Servei de Prote&#x000f3;mica i Bioinform&#x000e0;tica</italic> (SepBio) of the Universitat Aut&#x000f2;noma de Barcelona. The eluted proteins gel bands were in-gel digested with trypsin. Montage In-Gel Digest<sub>zp</sub> Kit manufacturer's recommendations were followed for band destaining and digestion. Peptide elution was performed by centrifugation and the eluted peptides were stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until they were analysed by mass spectrometry. For MALDI-MS analysis, a microlitre of the sample was mixed with the same volume of a solution of a-cyano-4-hydroxy-transcinnamic acid matrix (0.3 mg/ml in ethanol: acetone 6 : 3) and spotted onto a 600 &#x003bc;m AnchorChip MALDI target plate (Bruker) and allowed to air dry at room temperature. MALDI-mass spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode on an Ultraflex time-of-flight instrument. Ion acceleration was set to 25 kV. All mass spectra were externally calibrated using a standard peptide mixture. For PMF analysis, the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science. London, UK) was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of recombinant Sso0110 and Sso048 proteins</title><p>The <italic>sta1</italic> (<italic>sso0048</italic>) and <italic>sso0110</italic> genes were amplified by PCR using either SSO0048Nde and SSO0048Bam primers or SSO0110Nde and SSO0110Bam oligonucleotides, respectively (Table S1), containing the suitable endonuclease restriction sites and were cloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega) followed by the subcloning into a pET15b expression vector.

Upstream and in very close proximity to the <italic>S. solfataricus radA</italic> gene (<italic>sso0250</italic>), there are two open-reading frames (<italic>sso0251</italic> and <italic>sso0252</italic>). Each of these genes overlaps the following one. Several RT-PCR experiments were carried out to determine the transcription pattern of this region using a subset of primers (see Table S1 in Supplementary Data). mRNA was reverse transcribed and amplified when using primers annealing to consecutive genes (data not shown). These data demonstrated that <italic>radA</italic>, <italic>sso0251</italic> and <italic>sso0252</italic> are part of the same transcriptional unit as they were transcribed as a single polycistronic message (data not shown). For this reason, a fragment containing the upstream region of the <italic>sso0252</italic> ORF was used in the EMSA experiments. Nevertheless, no change in the electrophoretic mobility of this fragment was detected in the presence of <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> crude extracts (data not shown). However, and to further discard the existence of internal promoters within this transcriptional unit, the upstream region of either <italic>sso0251</italic> or <italic>radA</italic> ORFs were also analysed as probes in EMSA experiments. None of these fragments changed their electrophoretic mobility pattern under our experimental conditions (data not shown), which are those usually employed for <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> in these kind of experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B24 B25 B26 B27">5,24&#x02013;27</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, a change in the electrophoretic mobility of the <italic>sso0777</italic> upstream region was detected when incubated in the presence of crude <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The presence of the unlabelled competitor <italic>sso0777</italic> DNA fragment in the reaction mixture did prevent the band shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), while the addition of 300-fold of unlabelled competitor DNA from the T6 promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) did not affect the retardation band formation, confirming the binding specificity. Regarding all of these data, we attempted to identify the protein(s) responsible for the change in the mobility pattern of the <italic>sso0777</italic> promoter region as well as its (their) DNA-binding sequence. For that purpose, several fragments of different lengths of the promoter region were generated and designated as FrgA (&#x02212;107 to +61), FrgB (&#x02212;63 to +61) and FrgC (&#x02212;23 to +61) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). A retarded band was observed when FrgA and FrgB fragments were incubated in the presence of crude <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> cell extracts, in contrast the mobility of the fragment covering positions from &#x02212;23 to +61, FrgC, was unaffected under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 3</xref>B). Taken all these data together, the region spanning from &#x02212;63 to &#x02212;23 is the minimal region required for the band shift of <italic>sso0777</italic> promoter. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>EMSA of the <italic>S. solfataricus sso0777</italic> promoter in the absence or in the presence of crude <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> cell extracts.

This fragment was tested in a competitive EMSA assay against FrgB and, as expected, it abolished the retardation of FrgB (data not shown). Afterwards, this fragment was amplified by PCR using biotinylated primers, and bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads; Dynal Biotech), following manufacturer's instructions with slight modifications as indicated above (see Materials and Methods section). These beads were incubated with both whole-cell extracts of <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> and 20 &#x003bc;g of sonicated herring sperm DNA as a non-specific competitor. After washing, bound proteins were eluted with 2.5 M KCl and loaded on two independent SDS&#x02013;PAGE gels. One of them was stained using Bio-Rad Silver Stain kit and is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. Two bands showing an approximate molecular weight of 14 and 35 kDa were detected. The second gel was stained with Brilliant Blue G Colloidal (Sigma) to avoid any stain interference with the subsequent procedures. In this gel, the same bands were observed (data not shown). Both protein gel bands were in-gel digested with trypsin. Eight and seven peptides were identified using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for the 14 and 35 kDa gel bands, respectively. These peptides corresponded to <italic>sso0048</italic> and <italic>sso0110</italic> ORF products that have been annotated as a hypothetical transcriptional regulator and a hypothetical conserved protein, with a score of 90.8 and 90.2 (using the MASCOT search engine, Version 2.1), respectively. The experiment was repeated three times, with the same gene products identified on each occasion. The predicted products of those two genes are proteins of 14.3 and 33.5 kDa molecular weight, respectively, in agreement with the apparent molecular mass seen on SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Both proteins were overexpressed and purified and their binding ability to <italic>sso0777</italic> promoter region was tested through EMSA assays. Data obtained showed that only the Sso0048 protein was able to reproduce specifically the shift band observed when the crude extract from <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, the fact that the purified Sso0048 protein was able to bind to the sso0777 labelled promoter fragment generating the same mobility shift as crude cell extracts indicates that it does not need prior binding of the TBP protein to bind to that promoter region. However, to obtain the shift mobility it was necessary to add a great amount of recombinant Sta1 protein, probably because, as it has been reported, the native Sta1 protein is modified by N-terminal acetylation in <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), a modification that does not occur in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>The <italic>sso</italic>0048 gene product has been recently described as the Sta1 protein (<italic>Sulfolobus</italic> Transcription Activator 1) a transcriptional regulator with an overall structure similar to that of both Mj233 and multiple antibiotic resistance proteins as MarR (PF01047).

Data obtained indicated that the ATTTTTTATTTTCACATGTAAGATGTTTATT sequence was protected by the Sta1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The above-mentioned sequence contains the previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) consensus-binding site for Sta1 to the SIVR1 viral promoters (ATNTN<sub>10</sub>AT). However, the precise role of each nucleotide of the protected sequence had not been previously determined. For this reason, and to further characterize the Sta1-binding sequence and to know the most important nucleotides that are recognized by this protein, EMSA experiments using probes with specific point mutations in the protected region of the <italic>sso0777</italic> promoter were performed. As it is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, several motifs seem to be essential for Sta1 binding. First, two spaced TTATT motifs, one located between &#x02013;42 and &#x02013;38 and the other placed between &#x02013;21 and &#x02013;17 nucleotides relative to the TTG start codon.

To determine this, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays, using highly purified <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> RNAP and purified recombinant <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> TBP and TFB, were performed on the <italic>sso0777</italic> and T6 promoters, with increasing concentrations of Sta1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>).

As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, the yield of transcripts from the <italic>sso0777</italic> promoter was stimulated 3- to 4-fold by the addition of increasing concentrations of Sta1 whilst the T6 promoter, as expected, was insensitive to the addition of Sta1. Moreover, it is worth noting that despite expression of Sta1 increases in the presence of actinomycin D showing an induction factor of 5.75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A), it is unlikely to be autoregulated since Sta1 is unable to bind to its own promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B). <fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Actinomycin D-mediated induction of <italic>S. solfataricus sta1</italic> measured by quantitative RT-PCR.

However, the DNA damaging agent actinomycin D has been recently shown to induce transcription of a variety of DNA repair associated proteins in <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In concordance with this, in this work, we have observed an increased expression of the <italic>S. solfataricus radA</italic> and <italic>sso0777</italic> genes in the presence of actinomycin D.</p><p>Furthermore, we have identified here the positive regulation of the <italic>sso0777 gene</italic>, a <italic>radA</italic> paralogue, by the Sta1 transcriptional regulator that had been previously described as an activator of some genes of the <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> rudivirus SIRV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). EMSA experiments performed using sso0777 derivative mutant promoters showed that, in fact, three essential motifs are required for the Sta1 binding to that promoter: TTATT, CANGNA and TTATT. These motifs match with some of the nucleotide sequences included in the generic Sta1-binding region for SIRV1 promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). <italic>In silico</italic> searches using the PredictRegulon server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) of the defined Sta1-binding motif throughout the <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> genome have not revealed the presence of that binding sequence in any other <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> gene promoter region (data not shown), suggesting that Sta1 controls a small regulon in comparison to that described for bacterial DNA damage response regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>Thus, Sta1 is the first archaeal transcriptional regulator related to the DNA damage response described to date. It is worth noting that in archaea, as in eubacteria, DNA damaging agents (like UV or Mitomycin C) also induce virus production in lysogenic strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Furthermore, the fact that <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> Sta1 protein controls both viral and cellular genes is reminiscent, in some aspects, of the eubacterial SOS response where both chromosomal (controlled by LexA repressor) and viral (controlled by cI lytic cycle repressor) genes are induced after the detection of the DNA lesions by RecA which then adopts an active conformation that produces the autohydrolysis of these two molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). On the other hand, neither <italic>sta1</italic> nor <italic>sso0777</italic> gene expression are stimulated following UV irradiation of <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), suggests that perhaps several types of DNA damage elicit different transcriptional responses in this organism.</p><p>In archaea, the pathway detection of DNA lesions and the signal that activates the putative repair processes have not been clearly identified. Thus, most of the archaea lack MutS protein for mismatch detection. Besides, and although archaea have several homologues to the eukaryotic nucleotide excision repair proteins are present, they lack the damage detection proteins XPA and XPC that activate the NER pathway in those organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Likewise, recent work points to the possibility that SSB may play a role in the detection of DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In this respect, pull-down experiments have demonstrated that SSB has the ability to bind to repair-related proteins like the eukaryotic XPB1 helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). However, the precise mechanism for detecting DNA lesions in archaea is still unclear.</p><p>Although the <italic>radA</italic> and <italic>sta1</italic> genes are upregulated after actinomycin D treatment, neither promoter binds Sta1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and no gel retardation was observed using their promoter regions as a probe in EMSA experiments with crude <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> cell extracts. Thus, and although Sta1 is here reported as the first transcriptional regulator clearly involved in DNA damage response, other mechanisms must exist in <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> to control the expression of those genes whose transcription is increased after actinomycin D and other DNA damage agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Further work is needed to delineate the genetic networks controlled by different regulators as well as the interactions existing among them to understand the global DNA damage response in archaea.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm782_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm782_nar-01735-w-2007-File011.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was funded by Grants BFM2004-02768/BMC from the Ministerio de Educaci&#x000f3;n y Ciencia (MEC) de Espa&#x000f1;a, 2005SGR533 from the Generalitat de Catalunya, and by the BBSRC in the White laboratory.
