However, the underlying mechanisms of the latter remain unclear. In this study, we have investigated the role of the mammalian homologue of <italic>aspergillus nidulans</italic> NudE, Ndel1, emergently viewed as an integrator of the cytoskeleton, in axon regeneration. Ndel1 was synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> and upregulated in crushed and transected sciatic nerve axons, and, upon injury, was strongly associated with neuronal form of the intermediate filament (IF) Vimentin while dissociating from the mature neuronal IF (Neurofilament) light chain NF-L. Consistent with a role for Ndel1 in the conditioning lesion-induced neurite outgrowth of Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurons, the long lasting <italic>in vivo</italic> formation of the neuronal Ndel1/Vimentin complex was associated with robust axon regeneration. Furthermore, local silencing of Ndel1 in transected axons by siRNA severely reduced the extent of regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>.

In these conditions, Vimentin nicely co-immunoprecipitated with Ndel1 from PBS-isolated axoplasm of sciatic nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002014-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>).

Using RT-PCR and Western blots, we first confirmed the upregulation of Vimentin within hours following sciatic nerve crush in rats. From 3 and 12 hours after injury, Ndel1 and Vimentin mRNAs and soluble proteins were synthesized and up-regulated in both distal and proximal stumps of injured nerves, when compared to the contralateral non-injured sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002014-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).

The degree of augmentation in Ndel1 levels also correlated with higher levels of GAP-43, a neuronal marker for axonal regeneration, and with stabilization of NF-L, a marker for advanced regeneration and maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002014-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The stabilization of NF-L and increased GAP-43 did not correlate with the formation of the truncated fragments of Vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002014-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, graph). Importantly, in both proximal and distal segment of injured nerves, enhanced formation of neuronal Ndel1/Vimentin complex was observed after injury, as indicated by immunoprecipitations with Ndel1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002014-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>).

All procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Calgary in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Sciatic nerve transection was performed at mid-thigh level on the left side under anesthesia with pentobarbital (65mg/kg, intraperitoneum injection). A T-chamber was placed in most of the rats undergoing this injury, as described below. Rats were given analgesic (butorphanol, 2mg/kg, subcutaneous injection) at 0.5&#x02013;1 and four hours after the surgery to prevent autotomy and suture opening. Three days post surgery (72 hours), nerve tissues (proximal/distal stumps, 0.5&#x02013;1 cm), the 5<sup>th</sup> lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and the spinal cord dorsal column at the L5 spinal level) were harvested from both the transectioned and the untouched contralateral sides. Tissues to be used for mRNA detection were placed in Trizol , while tissues to be used for protein isolation and quantification were fresh frozen in liquid nitrogen. In both of these cases, tissues were maintained at &#x02212;80 degrees Celsius post-harvest. Tissues to be used for immunohistochemistry, consisting of the proximal and distal segments of sciatic nerves were placed into Zamboni's fixative (2.0&#x00025; PFA, 15&#x00025; picric acid, 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3) or PBS PFA 4&#x00025; overnight. The nerves were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and placed inside Cryomolds (Tissue-Tek). Then, the specimens were covered in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (OCT, Tissue-Tek) and frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for at least one hour and kept frozen thereafter. In a second surgery, five rats had the left sciatic nerve crushed twice in succession, at angles perpendicular to one another, each for 30 s (total of 60 s) at a site 20 mm proximal to the trifurcation of the sciatic nerve branching, using a hemostat forceps. The site of injury was marked with a non-absorbent suture in adjacent muscle for later site identification. Animals were monitored post-operatively for signs of infection or other complications of surgery. Tissues were harvested as described above. Tissues were immediately processed for mRNA, protein isolation and immunoprecipitation. Tissues were processed as described above.</p><p>For later immunohistochemical investigations embedded nerves were cut into 14 &#x000b5;m sections using a cryostat (HM500, Microm) at &#x02212;25&#x000b0;C and placed onto glass slides (SuperFrost White, VWR). On the day of staining, the tissues were post-fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 4 &#x00025; paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4. After washing with PBS, the sections were incubated for 2 hr with blocking solution (PBS containing 3 &#x00025; BSA and 0.2 &#x00025; Triton X-100, pH 7.4). After rinsing, they were incubated overnight at 4 degrees Celsius in a humidified chamber with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. After washes with PBS, the sections were incubated for 2 hr with secondary antibodies (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories) and 4&#x02032;-6&#x02032;-diamino-2&#x02032;-phenylindole (DAPI, 2 &#x000b5;g/ml, Sigma) solution.

For DRG neurons, siRNAs were transfected for 24 to 48 hours using HiperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagan, Mississauga,ON) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Shortly before transfection, injured DRG neurons were resuspended in Advanced DMEM (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON) and seeded on Poly-L-lysine coated coverslips in 6- well plates. siRNAs were diluted in 100 &#x000b5;l Advanced DMEM without serum and 16 &#x000b5;l of HiperFect transfection reagent was added to each of the diluted siRNA. The siRNA complexes were added dropwise on the cells and the plate was swirled gently to ensure even distribution of the transfection complexes. Immunofluorescence staining was performed according to Nguyen et al. 2004. For <italic>in vivo</italic> injections, 6.43 &#x000b5;l of siRNA (2000 ng or 120 nmol) were mixed with 20 &#x000b5;l HiPerfect Transfection Reagent and 73.57 &#x000b5;l Ringer's solution. An injection of 100 ul of siRNA preparations was administrated to each rat.
