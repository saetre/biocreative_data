Since LVP is a constant feature of chronically infected patients, we asked whether purified LVP could interfere with the immune response by acting directly on dendritic cell (DC) function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We have analyzed the impact of LVP on the maturation monocyte-derived DC induced by TLR3 or TLR4 ligands. Following incubation with LVP, immature DC supported weak transient HCV-RNA replication and type I IFN synthesis. This, however, did not lead to viral particle production nor to maturation of DC. LVP-treatment prior to TLR3 stimulation by polyI:C only enhanced the secretion of IL-12, IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1; yielding typical mature DC. In contrast, LVP-treated DC activated by the TLR4 ligand LPS yielded phenotypically mature DC with reduced capacity to secrete both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Their ability to stimulate allogeneic T lymphocytes was strongly affected since activated T cells produced IL-5 and IL-13 instead of IFN&#x003b3;. Addition of IFN&#x003b1; prevented the effect of LVP on DC function. Restoration of IFN&#x003b3; secretion by T cells was obtained by blocking ERK activation in DC, while induction of IL-5 and IL-13 secretion was inhibited by blocking the p38-MAPK pathway in DC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>LVP can interfere with TLR4-triggered maturation of DC, inducing a shift in DC function that stimulates Th2 cells instead of Th1, by a mechanism that is ERK- and p38-MAPK-dependent. The effect of LVP on DC polarization was reversed by IFN&#x003b1;, providing an additional rationale for the interferon therapy of chronically-infected patients. By acting on TLR4 pathway with LVP, HCV may thus exploit a natural protective mechanism of the liver and the intestine normally used to control inflammation and immunity to commensal microorganisms.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>HCV infection is a major public health problem because of the high incidence of chronicity which often leads to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Hoofnagle1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. HCV is a single stranded RNA virus which has remained poorly characterized due to the lack of an efficient cell culture system and purification procedure but the replicon systems now allowing production of viral particles offer promising tools to help understanding the biology of this virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Reed1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Zeisel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The density of plasma HCV-RNA containing particles is surprisingly heterogeneous and the unusually low density of some of these particles suggests an association of the virus with plasma lipoproteins. HCV may simply bind to circulating lipoproteins but an interference occurring during lipoprotein synthesis by infected hepatocytes may also lead to the generation of a hybrid-virus like particle. One form of HCV-RNA containing structures with low density has indeed been purified from plasma of chronically-infected patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Andre1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Nielsen2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

These particles can enter human hepatocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> through the interaction of apolipoprotein B and E with lipoprotein receptors. The presence of LVP is a constant feature of chronicity but their role in HCV infection and disease progression remains elusive. Quasi-species analysis, the presence of HCV proteins in the enterocytes of chronically-infected patients and the biochemical composition of LVP strongly suggest that LVP can originate from both the liver and the intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Andre1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Andre2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Price1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Deforges1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Beside the intriguing question of the generation of such a viral structure, LVP is of particular interest because of their lipoprotein nature and the complex mixture of lipids it can contain. Many immunomodulatory properties have been assigned to native and modified lipids and the immunological properties of native and oxidized lipoproteins are influenced by their content in anti- and pro-inflammatory lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Bochkov1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Shaw1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. For instance, we and others have shown that oxidative modifications of lipoproteins can be detected by dendritic cells (DC) and lipids generated during oxidation can either induce or inhibit DC maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Coutant1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-PerrinCocon2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Many lipids have also been shown to interfere with bacteria LPS and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling. The overall data from the literature suggest that natural modification of lipids leads to the formation of both positive and negative regulators of adaptive immune responses.</p><p>These immunomodulatory properties of lipids have been exploited by many parasites to subvert and escape the immune system. Lysophosphatidylserine from eggs of Schistosoma mansoni inhibits IL-12 production by DC stimulated with IL-1 and TNF&#x003b1; and induces IL-10-secreting regulatory T cells by a TLR2-dependent process. By contrast, DC treated with the inflammatory cocktail and phosphatidylserine from eggs of the parasite induce IL-4-secreting Th2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-vanderKleij1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

The excretory-secretory product-62 (ES-62) is a phosphorylcholine-substituted secreted glycoprotein of Acanthocheilonema viteae that exerts immunomodulatory functions via TLR-4. In vitro and in vivo exposure of macrophages, DC and their precursors to ES-62 renders the cells unable to respond normally to LPS, polarizing their differentiation towards a Th2/anti-inflammatory phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Goodridge1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Goodridge2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>There are increasing evidences showing that viruses can interact with TLR signaling. Viral components can either bind to TLR and activate their signaling pathway or block TLR function by interfering with intracellular intermediates. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is generated during viral replication and TLR3 activation can be triggered by the synthetic analog of dsRNA polyinosine-deoxycytidylic acid (poly I:C). Moreover, the HCV serine protease NS3/4A can specifically degrade the adaptor protein TRIF (Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain&#x02013;containing adaptor inducing IFN&#x003b2;) resulting in inhibition of TLR3 signaling in HeLa cells containing replicating HCV RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Li1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Although TLR4 is well-known for its capacity to detect bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), this receptor can also recognize viral components such as the fusion protein from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-KurtJones1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> and the envelope protein of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Rassa1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

ERK has also been shown to be phosphorylated upon TLR4 signaling, but its involvement in TLR4 maturation is still controversial, depending on the culture system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Ardeshna1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Rescigno1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-PuigKroger1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. We thus examined the effect of different kinase inhibitors on the ability of DC to stimulate allogeneic T cells. SB203580 is a specific inhibitor of p38-MAPK and PD98059 inhibits MEK activation and prevents ERK phosphorylation. The inhibitors are added at d 5, 30 minutes before LVP. Non-infected DC treated with the inhibitor of p38-MAPK before TLR stimulation were not able to stimulate IFN&#x003b3; secretion by T lymphocytes. Therefore it was not possible to correlate the action of LVP on DC following LPS stimulation (absence of induction of IFN&#x003b3; secretion by T cells) to the activation of this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000330-g007">figure 7a</xref>). In contrast, blocking p38-MAPK pathway in non-infected DC has no significant effect on IL-5 and IL-13 secretion by T cells. Blocking p38-MAPK pathway in LVP-treated DC yielded cells that lost their ability to stimulate IL-5 and IL-13 secretion by T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000330-g007">figure 7b</xref>). Moreover, blocking MEK-ERK pathway in DC before LVP incubation and LPS treatment yielded cells with a restored ability to stimulate IFN&#x003b3; secretion by T cells without affecting IL-5 and IL-13 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000330-g007">figure 7c, d</xref>). These data strongly suggest that LVP could influence DC polarization following TLR4 stimulation by interfering with both p38-MAPK and MEK/ERK pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Several groups have reported that DC from chronically infected patients may have impaired function in vivo and reduced maturation capacity ex vivo but this has been challenged by others who reported that DC from patients could normally function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Anthony1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Kanto3">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Although differences in the experimental procedures could explain this discrepancy, it is likely that DC remain globally functional during the infection because the patients appear immunologically competent. Rather, a precise function of DC could be targeted during the infection that would specifically impair HCV clearance without affecting global immunity. In this study, purified LVP were used to demonstrate that HCV clinical isolate can interfere with the function of DC from non-infected donors in a discrete manner. LVP interfere with the TLR4 pathway to generate mature DC that fail to stimulate production of IFN&#x003b3; by T cells while that of IL-5 and IL-13 was induced. This Th2 bias observed in these specific conditions is not in favor of efficient HCV-specific CTL responses and could favor chronic infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Fang1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Lauer1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. This process can be reversed by IFN&#x003b1;. Although the precise mechanism for TLR4 pathway interference by LVP has not yet been identified, the data show that the engagement of the MEK-ERK and p38-MAPK pathways is involved in the inhibition of IFN&#x003b3; production and stimulation of IL-5 and IL-13 synthesis, respectively. This is consistent with previous studies showing the relative contribution of these two pathways in DC polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Arrighi1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-PuigKroger1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Agrawal1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>LVP entry into DC leads to incomplete infection cycle that ends after a transient RNA replication and protein synthesis. LVP induce various amounts of IFN&#x003b2; production by DC but IFN&#x003b1; was never detected. We do not have the molecular explanation for the lack of IFN&#x003b1; production but it is known that monocyte-derived DC are weak producers of IFN&#x003b1; in response to virus or TLR stimulation while they produce substantial amounts of IFN&#x003b2;, probably because the express low levels of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Coccia1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Several groups have reported a default in IFN&#x003b1; production in chronically-infected patients essentially by looking at the frequency and functionality of plasmacytoid DC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Longman2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Kanto2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Goutagny1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Murakami1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. The effect of LVP on DC was reversed by IFN&#x003b1; in vitro but to what extend IFN&#x003b1; therapy can prevent the effect of LVP on DC in vivo remains to be determined.</p><p>Infectious agents have evolved strategies that disrupt signaling pathways normally leading to a protective cellular reaction. TLR3 signaling is not significantly disrupted by LVP and DC appear even more reactive to the TLR3 ligand polyI:C, leading to increased secretion of cytokines. This is an additional indication that LVP do not really infect DC stricto sensus and that the HCV NS3/4A protease is not expressed at a level allowing an efficient cleavage of the TLR3 adaptor protein TRIF that would inhibit TLR3 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Li1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the triggering of TLR3 by dsRNA can result in attenuation of the TLR4 pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Jiang1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. The stimulation of TLR3 by HCV dsRNA could theoretically occur and interfere with the TLR4 pathway but is very unlikely regarding the weakness of HCV-RNA replication in DC. Direct interference with TLR4 signaling may impair anti-viral innate reaction of an infected cell. Interference with TLR2 signaling has already been reported with HCV protein core in human monocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Dolganiuc1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Although no binding of an HCV protein to TLR4 has yet been reported, this possibility cannot be excluded.</p><p>Lipid remodeling occurs during HCV infection but has not been studied from an immunological point of view. One aspect of this remodeling is the presence of LVP in the blood and infected organs of chronically-infected patients. Although the precise biochemical composition of LVP has not yet been elucidated, we and others have described the lipoprotein-like structure of these particles and their enrichment in triglycerides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Andre1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Diaz1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Because modified endogenous or exogenous lipids are detected by DC and can interfere with TLR4 signaling, one intriguing possibility is that LVP could interfere directly with the TLR4 pathway via some of its lipid components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Goodridge1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Goodridge2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Bluml1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Walton1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, LVP could interfere with TLR4 signaling by modifying the lipid composition of the plasma membrane of DC similarly to what has been described for polyunsaturated fatty acids that inhibit the induction of Th1 responses possibly by insertion in the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Zeyda1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. The identification of bioactive lipids that could be involved in the effect of LVP on DC is in progress but is a complex task because of the likely possibility that DC may react globally to LVP by integrating different quality signals delivered by various categories of lipids. Our preliminary lipidomic analysis confirmed the lipoprotein-like structure of LVP with some features not found in normal low density lipoproteins.</p><p>A growing list of apparently unrelated molecules can interfere with TLR4 signaling. Among those are microbial products from bacteria, viruses, and parasites. This underlines the crucial role of TLR4 pathway in the innate recognition of pathogens but may also reveal microbial strategies evolved to facilitate infection. Physiological relevance of TLR4 signaling interference by LVP may relate to the origin of these particles and their biochemical composition. The liver lies directly downstream of the gut and is therefore constantly exposed to antigens and microbial products derived from the intestine. Control of liver inflammation and tolerance to gut-derived antigens (food antigens and commensal bacteria) are likely to rely, at least in part, on functional characteristics of hepatic and intestinal antigen presenting cells. One of these characteristics is the modulation of TLR4 signaling under the dual pressure of protecting the host from pathogenic infections and coexistence with the myriad commensal organisms. Many mechanisms are involved to limit TLR4 responses to these commensal bacteria: decreased expression of TLR4, decreased IL-1 receptor-activated kinase (IRAK) activity, increased expression of molecules involved in TLR4 negative signaling (Toll-interacting protein (Tollip), single immunoglobulin IL-1-related receptor (SIGIRR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors &#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Abreu1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. Several lines of evidence suggest that the intestine and more specifically enterocytes can be infected by HCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Deforges1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and that LVP could derive from both the liver and the intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000330-Diaz1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. By acting on TLR4 pathway with LVP, HCV may thus exploit a natural protective mechanism of the liver and the intestine normally used to control inflammation and immunity to commensal microorganisms. Accordingly, intestinal inflammation has not been reported in HCV chronically-infected patients and, for the vast majority of these patients, no sign of hepatic inflammation can be detected despite the constant and unquestionable viral production in this organ.</p><p>Regulatory mechanisms that are induced or exploited by chronic infectious agents may be viewed as an additional way to balance the host-pathogen interaction whereby host tissue damage is restricted and pathogen survival is favored. It is tempting to speculate that interference with TLR4 may be a way in which a specific form of circulating HCV particles contributes to chronicity while preventing infected organs from destructive inflammation and immunity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Prof. C.
