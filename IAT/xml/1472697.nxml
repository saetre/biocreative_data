Inflammation-eliciting activity of A-SAA was investigated in human adipose stromal vascular cells, coronary vascular endothelial cells and a murine monocyte cell line. We demonstrate that A-SAA was highly and selectively expressed in human adipocytes. Moreover, A-SAA mRNA levels and A-SAA secretion from adipose tissue were significantly correlated with body mass index ( <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.47; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.028 and <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.80; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0002, respectively).

SAA treatment of vascular endothelial cells and monocytes markedly increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, e.g., interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. In addition, SAA increased basal lipolysis in adipose tissue culture by 47&#x00025;. </p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A-SAA is a proinflammatory and lipolytic adipokine in humans. The increased expression of A-SAA by adipocytes in obesity suggests that it may play a critical role in local and systemic inflammation and free fatty acid production and could be a direct link between obesity and its comorbidities, such as insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. Accordingly, improvements in systemic inflammation and insulin resistance with weight loss and rosiglitazone therapy may in part be mediated by decreases in adipocyte A-SAA production.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editor"><sec id="st4"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec id="st4a"><title>Background.</title><p>Obesity often alters an individual's overall metabolism, which in turn leads to complications like diabetes, high blood pressure, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (disease of the heart and blood vessels, such as stroke or heart attacks). Having established a strong link between inflammation and cardiovascular disease, scientists now think that obesity might cause persistent low-level inflammation, and that this is the reason for the cardiovascular problems seen in many obese people. By better understanding the links between obesity, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease, the hope is that scientists may be able to find medications that can be given to obese people to reduce their risk of heart attacks and strokes.</p></sec><sec id="st4b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Previous research had suggested that a substance in the blood called A-SAA, which is raised by inflammation, might be a &#x0201c;missing link&#x0201d; between inflammation and cardiovascular disease, since an individual's baseline level of A-SAA is associated with the risk for cardiovascular disease (in other words, the higher the A-SAA, the higher the risk of cardiovascular disease). In the new study, researchers wanted to know whether the reason that obese people have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease is because they have higher blood levels of A-SAA.</p></sec><sec id="st4c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>They found that obese people had higher levels of A-SAA in their blood. A-SAA appears to be produced in fat cells (or adipocytes) and then released into the blood. Obese people have higher numbers of fat cells, which could by itself account for the higher blood levels of A-SAA, but the researchers also found that the average fat cell from an obese individual produces and secretes higher levels of A-SAA than fat cells from lean individuals. When the researchers studied people who underwent weight loss, they found that A-SAA levels fell in response to weight loss, and this was associated with improvements in their metabolism. They then studied obese individuals who received the diabetes drug rosiglitazone (which is known to reduce inflammation). They found that even though these individuals did not lose weight, their A-SAA levels dropped as their metabolism improved. Trying to get at the mechanisms by which A-SAA might cause inflammation and diabetes, the researchers found that exposure to A-SAA can stimulate the activation of proinflammation molecules in a number of different cells, including blood vessel cells. It can also stimulate cells to break down fat stores and release fats, which could lead to metabolic complications and ultimately contribute to diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="st4d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>Together with similar results from other studies, the findings here suggest that A-SAA could promote inflammation, and that elevated levels of A-SAA in obese individuals could contribute to the chronic low-level inflammatory state that puts them at higher risk for cardiovascular complications. The authors speculate that drugs that reduce the blood levels of A-SAA might be useful as treatments for obese patients (to lower their risk of heart attacks and strokes). However, as they acknowledge, additional studies are needed to establish that A-SAA is indeed a causal link between obesity and inflammation and whether it plays a major role before it could be considered a promising drug target.</p></sec><sec id="st4e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030287">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030287</ext-link>. </p><p>&#x02022;&#x02009;MedlinePlus pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/obesity.html">obesity</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/heartdiseases.html">cardiovascular disease</ext-link></p><p>&#x02022;&#x02009;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity">obesity</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/doc.do/id/0900f3ec802720b8">cardiovascular disease</ext-link></p><p>&#x02022;&#x02009;Wikipedia pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity">obesity</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease">cardiovascular disease</ext-link> (note: Wikipedia is a free Internet encyclopedia that anyone can edit) </p></sec></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Higher levels of Acute-phase serum amyloid A (A-SAA), a proinflammatory adipokine, in obese individuals may contribute to the chronic low-level inflammatory state that puts them at higher risk for cardiovascular complications.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Complications of excess fat mass, particularly central or visceral adipose tissue, include insulin resistance and resulting hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a prothrombotic state.

Excess and/or dysfunctional adipose tissue is associated with chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, which is also associated with CVD. For example, a modest elevation in C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute-phase reactant protein produced by the liver and a long-known marker of inflammation, has been shown to be predictive of CVD risk and events &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.

Whether these acute-phase reactant proteins are directly involved in inflammation and the atherosclerotic process or simply markers of these processes is not known. </p><p>Adipose tissue is &#x0201c;inflamed&#x0201d; in obesity, with decreased expression of the anti-inflammatory adipokine adiponectin and increased secretion of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines, e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), interleukin (IL)-6, and prothrombotic factors such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.

In a systematic search of differentially expressed genes between adipocytes and stromal vascular cells, we noted that serum amyloid A1 and A2 (SAA1 and SAA2, collectively called A-SAA) were highly expressed in human adipocytes, which was unexpected but in agreement with recent publications &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.

All participants were healthy according to medical history, physical examination, and laboratory testing unless otherwise specified in the protocols. The individuals studied showed no clinical or laboratory evidence of acute inflammation such as fever or elevated white blood cell counts. Abdominal adipose tissue samples were obtained from overnight-fasted participants by aspiration with a 4-mm cannula under local anesthesia with lidocaine as previously described &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; or obtained from nondiabetic participants undergoing intra-abdominal surgeries.

Initially, A-SAA levels were measured in plasma samples from 19 sex- and age-matched (age within 5 y) sets of nondiabetic sibling pairs with a discordance in body mass index (BMI) of at least 3 kg m <sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. These 38 individuals were then included in an expanded set of 134 nondiabetic individuals with BMIs ranging from 17.0 to 41.8 kg m <sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. Blood samples for A-SAA measurements were obtained from an antecubital vein after an overnight fast. </p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Effect of weight loss on A-SAA and insulin sensitivity.</title><p>Thirty-three sedentary, overweight or obese (BMI 32.3 &#x000b1; 4.0 kg m <sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, mean &#x000b1; standard deviation &#x0005b;SD&#x0005d;), postmenopausal (58 &#x000b1; 5.7 y, mean &#x000b1; SD) women were studied before and after a 6-mo weight loss program. The intervention consisted of weekly outpatient classes with a dietitian on the principles of a hypocaloric dietary program that followed the American Heart Association (AHA) Step I guidelines with restriction of caloric intake by 250&#x02013;350 kcal d <sup>&#x02212;1</sup> as previously described &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Fat mass was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Model DPX-L; Lunar Radiation, Madison, Wisconsin, United States) using the 1.3z DPX-L extended analysis program. Fasting serum levels of A-SAA were measured before and after the intervention in all participants. Subcutaneous abdominal fat biopsies were obtained at baseline in a subset of 31 participants under local anesthesia for the ex vivo studies of adipose A-SAA expression and/or secretion (described below). Eight of the participants underwent 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies at baseline and after completion of the weight loss program to assess changes in insulin sensitivity. Women were weight-stabilized (&#x0003c; 1 kg) for at least 2 wk prior to metabolic testing before and after weight loss. All testing was performed in the morning after a 12-h overnight fast. Arterialized blood was obtained from a dorsal heated hand vein. Basal plasma glucose and insulin levels were measured in the fasted state. A 10 min priming with insulin followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of insulin (240 pmol m <sup>&#x02212;2</sup> min <sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, Humulin, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States) was performed for 180 min. Glucose was infused at a variable rate to keep the plasma glucose, measured every 5 min, at the basal (fasting) level. Blood was also drawn every 10 min for the determination of plasma insulin levels. Plasma glucose was measured with the glucose oxidase method (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, California, United States). Insulin was determined by radioimmunoassay (Linco, St. Louis, Missouri, United States). </p><p>The mean concentration of glucose and insulin was calculated for each sample time point. The trapezoidal rule was used to calculate the integrated response over 30-min intervals from 30 to 180 min for each participant. The integrated response was divided by its time interval to compute mean concentrations. Plasma glucose and insulin levels during the clamps averaged 5.17 &#x000b1; 0.10 mmol l <sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 474 &#x000b1; 14 pmol l <sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively. This was 97.7&#x00025; &#x000b1; 0.2&#x00025; of the desired goal with a coefficient of variation of 5.2&#x00025; &#x000b1; 0.4&#x00025; in all clamps. Glucose utilization (M) for the 120- to 180-min interval was calculated from the amount of glucose infused after correction for glucose equivalent space (glucose space correction). </p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>Effect of treatment with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist rosiglitazone on A-SAA.</title><p>Eight healthy, nondiabetic, overweight or obese participants (age 44.7 &#x000b1; 9.1 y, BMI 30.8 &#x000b1; 3.1 kg m <sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, mean &#x000b1; SD) were recruited and treated with rosiglitazone 4 mg d <sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 4 wk, followed by 8 mg d <sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 8 wk.

All other RNAs were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, California, United States). Total RNA (15 &#x003bc;g) extracted from the specified mouse (C57BL) or human tissue was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted onto Nylon membranes using standard methods. Human SAA2 cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 1&#x02013;536 of BC020795, and murine SAA2 cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 1&#x02013;565 of U60438, were used as probes. These probes are 97&#x00025; (human) and 95&#x00025; (mouse) identical to SAA1 sequence and thus would be expected to hybridize to both SAA1 and SAA2. By contrast, the mouse SAA2 probe was only 62&#x00025; identical to SAA3 mRNA and thus would not be expected to hybridize to SAA3 mRNA under the stringent wash conditions used. The probes were random-labeled (Stratagene, La Jolla, California, United States) with <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP, and hybridization was carried out at 65 &#x000b0;C in Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States). Blots were washed twice with 0.5&#x000d7; SSC/1&#x00025; SDS at 65 &#x000b0;C (stringent wash), and visualized by PhosphoImager (Amersham Biosciences). </p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>RT-PCR Analysis</title><p>For semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis, reverse transcription was carried out in a reaction containing 1 &#x003bc;g of total RNA, poly-dT primer, and MMLV reverse transcriptase using the Advantage kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, California, United States). PCR was performed under conditions typically consisting of 28 cycles of 94 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, 55 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, and 72 &#x000b0;C for 60 s. For detection of human A-SAA mRNA in fractionated adipocytes and SVCs, primers 5&#x02032;- GAGAGAAGCCAATTACATCGGC -3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;- AGTATTTCTCAGGCAGGCCAGC -3&#x02032;, which fully match both SAA1 and SAA2, were used. In addition, human SAA1 and SAA2 mRNAs were quantitated individually by RT-PCR using a common forward primer 5&#x02032;- ATGGGGCTCGGGACATGTGGAG -3&#x02032;, which was paired with reverse primer 5&#x02032;- AGTCCTCCGCACCATGGCCTGT -3&#x02032; (SAA1-specific) or 5&#x02032;- AGTCCTCCGCACCATGGCCAAA -3&#x02032; (SAA2-specific). Human &#x003b2;-actin was amplified as a control with primers 5&#x02032;- TTAATGTCACGCACGATTTCC -3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;- AGACCTTCAACACCCCAGCCA -3&#x02032;. RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1&#x00025; agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized by UV transillumination. </p><p>The level of adipose A-SAA mRNA expression was more accurately quantitated by real-time PCR.

To distinguish between these possibilities, adipose tissue samples were obtained from healthy premenopausal women over a range of BMIs, and A-SAA mRNA expression and secretion were measured.

We measured serum A-SAA levels before and after weight loss with a hypocaloric diet program in 33 obese (BMI 32.3 &#x000b1; 4.0 kg m <sup>&#x02212;2</sup>; mean &#x000b1; SD) postmenopausal women. A mean (&#x000b1; SEM) weight loss of 6.0 &#x000b1; 0.7 kg or 7.1&#x00025; was associated with a 13.8&#x00025; reduction in SAA levels ( <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.006, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 33; paired <italic>t</italic>-test). Significantly, the relative changes in serum A-SAA concentration correlated with relative changes in BMI ( <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.39, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.03, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 33) and body fat mass ( <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.35, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.04) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030287-g004">Figure 4</xref>), but not with changes of fat free mass ( <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.23, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.30). Eight of these participants also underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps before and after the weight loss intervention. In response to weight loss, increases in insulin sensitivity were correlated with decreases in A-SAA ( <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; &#x02212;0.74, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.034). These findings suggest that A-SAA falls in response to weight loss and that a decrease in A-SAA partially predicts the increase in insulin sensitivity seen with weight loss in obese postmenopausal women. </p><p>We next reasoned that if A-SAA was an inflammatory adipokine involved in the metabolic consequences of obesity, other interventions that influence inflammation and insulin sensitivity might alter A-SAA concentrations. Eight overweight or obese nondiabetic individuals (BMI 30.8 &#x000b1; 3.1 kg m <sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, mean &#x000b1; SD) were treated for 12 wk with rosiglitazone, a drug with insulin sensitizing and anti-inflammatory actions. There were no statistically significant changes in body weight or fat mass in these individuals during the 12-wk intervention. Nevertheless, serum A-SAA levels decreased by a mean of 37&#x00025; after treatment ( <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.033) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030287-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Moreover, the secretion of A-SAA from adipose tissue explants obtained by aspiration from these same participants was significantly reduced after rosiglitazone treatment ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030287-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). The extent of serum A-SAA decrease tended to correlate with that of adipose A-SAA secretion, although the correlation was not statistically significant, presumably due to the small sample size. Notably, one participant (green line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030287-g005">Figure 5</xref>) responded to rosiglitazone with a marked reduction in A-SAA. Exclusion of this individual changed the <italic>p</italic>-values for serum and adipose SAA secretion from 0.033 and 0.034 to 0.001 and 0.055, respectively. Thus, rosiglitazone reduced adipose A-SAA secretion and lowered serum A-SAA levels with no significant change in BMI or fat mass. </p><p>The mechanism by which rosiglitazone decreases adipose A-SAA secretion could be direct, through action on adipose tissue, or indirect, through its effects on circulating hormones or other factors. Thus, we further investigated whether rosiglitazone acted directly on adipose tissue to decrease A-SAA secretion. Adipose tissue obtained from nondiabetic participants was cultured ex vivo. Incubation of the fat explants for 2 d with insulin or dexamethasone resulted in an SAA accumulation in the medium, and combination of the two hormones was additive in the stimulatory effect. Addition of rosiglitazone in the presence of insulin and dexamethasone reduced A-SAA secretion into the medium by 70&#x00025; ( <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.002) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030287-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

These proinflammatory cytokines are predominantly products of SVCs within adipose tissue &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. By contrast, A-SAA, like leptin and adiponectin, is a product of adipocytes and not SVCs ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030287-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Our finding that SAA potently stimulates the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in adipose SVCs suggests that adipocyte A-SAA acts as a paracrine factor to enhance cytokine production by SVCs. In addition, obesity is associated with increased infiltration of adipose tissue by macrophages &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, which may also be target cells of SAA action. SAA may also be a chemoattractant for macrophages, raising a possible link for the association of fat cell size with macrophage infiltration in obese adipose tissue &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, A-SAA may act locally to alter cytokine production and fat metabolism as well as systemically on liver, muscle, cells of the immune system, and the vasculature, to impact insulin resistance and atherosclerosis ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030287-g009">Figure 9</xref>). </p><p>The signaling pathways of the A-SAA-mediated inflammation response are not well studied. In neutrophils, SAA induces IL-8 production through the formyl peptide receptor-like 1/lipoxin A4 receptor and activates nuclear factor kappa B &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. The same signaling pathway recently has been shown to be an important mediator of inflammation-associated insulin resistance &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. Whether the induction of cytokine production by A-SAA in vascular endothelial cells and SVCs, as we have shown here, occurs through the same mechanism remains to be determined. </p><p>Our findings that rosiglitazone treatment significantly reduces A-SAA secretion and serum A-SAA levels suggest that <italic>SAA1</italic> and <italic>SAA2</italic> may be target genes of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. Both in vitro and in clinical studies, rosiglitazone exhibits anti-inflammatory properties &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;, which are likely to be beneficial in slowing or reversing atherosclerosis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the suppression of A-SAA may be a significant component of the anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic action of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonists, providing evidence that agents that inhibit A-SAA secretion or action may be efficacious for treatment of the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. </p><p>Obesity is associated with increased basal lipolysis in adipose tissue &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d; and elevated circulating FFAs that are thought to elicit systemic insulin resistance &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. We also discovered that SAA, like IL6 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d; and TNF &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;, has a long-term effect in stimulating basal lipolysis. The lipolytic activity of SAA can be an autocrine feedback mechanism by which increased SAA production ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030287-g003">Figure 3</xref>) from enlarged adipocytes limits further triacylglycerol accumulation. The resulting increased release of FFA into the circulation may contribute to insulin resistance. The mechanism of SAA-mediated lipolysis is under investigation. A recent study indicated that SAA binds CLA-1 (CD36 and LIMPII Analogous-1), resulting in activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation is involved in TNF-&#x003b1;-induced lipolysis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. CLA-1 is highly expressed in adipose tissue (unpublished data). Thus, SAA may act through CLA-1 and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway to stimulate lipolysis directly. Alternatively, increased lipolysis by SAA might be indirect, through its stimulation of other lipolytic cytokines, e.g., IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;. </p><p>Recent studies suggest that in addition to its role in inflammation, A-SAA may play a direct physiological role in cholesterol metabolism. SAA is an apolipoprotein and a component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. The interaction of SAA with HDL may impair the function of HDL as an antiatherogenic molecule &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d; and facilitate its degradation &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Dyslipidemia, including low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), is a metabolic consequence of obesity and a component of the metabolic syndrome &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the increase of adipose-derived SAA in obesity that we observed may be a mechanistic link between obesity, low HDL-C, and increased CVD risk ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030287-g009">Figure 9</xref>). </p><p>CRP is an acute-phase reactant produced in the liver and a marker of chronic low-grade inflammation. Modest elevation in CRP is associated with increased CVD risk in epidemiological studies &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast to A-SAA, CRP is barely expressed in adipose tissue in humans (unpublished data). If A-SAA is a direct mediator of obesity-associated inflammation and its metabolic and cardiovascular consequences, might serum A-SAA be a better indicator of obesity-associated CVD risk than CRP? Ridker et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; showed that both CRP and A-SAA levels confer similar risk for CVD events in participants of the Women's Health Study. Similarly, in the Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) Study, Johnson et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030287-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; recently reported that SAA is independently associated with angiographic coronary artery disease and highly predictive of 3-y cardiovascular events. These studies did not specifically address the relationship between BMI and A-SAA (or CRP) in predicting CVD events. Our studies suggest that A-SAA may be a valuable diagnosticand prognostic marker of obesity-associated CVD risk and possibly of the effects of interventions such as weight loss and rosiglitazone therapy. Additional studies are needed to better define the biology and clinical utility of A-SAA and to further establish A-SAA as a causal link between obesity and inflammation and their cardiovascular consequences. </p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sg001"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S1</label><caption><title>Chinese Translation of the Abstract by RZY and DWG</title><p>(21 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0030287.sg001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Nikki Glynn for her technical assistance.</p><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> RZY, MJL, ASR, BJN, APG, ARS, SKF, and DWG designed the study.

A-SAA-stimulated lipolysis increases circulating FFA concentrations, further contributing to insulin resistance in muscle and liver. Finally, A-SAA incorporation into HDL accelerates its degradation and impairs its function, resulting in decreased HDL and accelerated atherosclerosis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pmed.0030287.g009"/></fig></sec><fn-group><fn id="n3" fn-type="other"><p>Citation: Yang RZ, Lee MJ, Hu H, Pollin TI, Ryan AS, et al.
