In the striatum, more than 95&#x00025; of neurons are GABAergic medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs), which form two intermingled populations distinguished by their projections and protein content. Those expressing dopamine D<sub>1</sub>-receptors (D1Rs) project preferentially to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), whereas those expressing dopamine D<sub>2</sub>- receptors (D2Rs) project preferentially to the lateral part of the globus pallidus (LGP). The degree of segregation of these populations has been a continuous subject of debate, and the recent introduction of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice expressing fluorescent proteins driven by specific promoters was a major progress to facilitate striatal neuron identification. However, the fraction of MSNs labeled in these mice has been recently called into question, casting doubt on the generality of results obtained with such approaches. Here, we performed an in-depth quantitative analysis of striatal neurons in <italic>drd1a-</italic>EGFP and <italic>drd2-</italic>EGFP mice. We first quantified neuronal and non-neuronal populations in the striatum, based on nuclear staining with TO-PRO-3, and immunolabeling for NeuN, DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein Mr&#x0223c;32,000), and various markers for interneurons. TO-PRO-3 staining was sufficient to identify MSNs by their typical nuclear morphology and, with a good probability, interneuron populations. In <italic>drd1a</italic>-EGFP/<italic>drd2</italic>-EGFP double transgenic mice all MSNs expressed EGFP, which was driven in about half of them by <italic>drd1a</italic> promoter. Retrograde labeling showed that all MSNs projecting to the SNr expressed D1R and very few D2R (&#x0003c;1&#x00025;). In contrast, our results were compatible with the existence of some D1R-EGFP-expressing fibers giving off terminals in the LGP. Thus, our study shows that nuclear staining is a simple method for identifying MSNs and other striatal neurons. It also unambiguously confirms the degree of segregation of MSNs in the mouse striatum and allows the full exploitation of results obtained with BAC-transgenic mice.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Basal ganglia form a complex neural network involved in the selection and execution of action through interactions with multiple brain areas that process sensorimotor, emotional and cognitive information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Groenewegen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

MSNs expressing dopamine D<sub>1</sub>-receptors (D1Rs), dynorphin and substance P, project to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and entopeduncular nucleus (direct striatonigral pathway), while MSNs expressing dopamine D<sub>2</sub>-receptors (D2Rs) and enkephalin, project to the lateral part of the globus pallidus (LGP) (indirect striatopallidal pathway) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Gerfen1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-LeMoine1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the only previous study which examined whether all the MSNs express either D1R or D2R, concluded that an important fraction of MSNs (39&#x02013;50&#x00025;) did not express fluorescent proteins in BAC transgenic mice with <italic>drd1a</italic> and <italic>drd2</italic> promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Shuen1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. These results could be due to a failure to detect neurons with low expression levels of fluorescent protein. Alternatively, they could indicate the existence of a population of MSNs expressing neither D1R nor D2R. At any rate, such results cast doubt on the generality of the conclusions of all the above studies. Therefore, we undertook a study to unquestionably clarify the pattern of expression of EGFP under the control of D1R and D2R promoters in MSNs. By using a variety of markers, we validate a simple method for identifying MSNs and other striatal neurons, based on their nuclear morphology. We then show that all MSNs are labeled in double <italic>drd1a-</italic> and <italic>drd2-</italic>EGFP transgenic mice and that only neurons expressing D1R project to the SNr.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>A total of 17 animals were used in this study.

We assessed the capacity of four unaware observers to identify striatal neurons on the basis of their nuclear morphology after TO-PRO-3 staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004770.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).

However, these conditions were not always satisfied. Altogether, our results show that nuclear morphology allows the identification of MSNs with a high success rate and is a good marker for interneuron subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Identification of MSNs based on DARPP-32 immunoreactivity and nuclear morphology</title><p>We used the tools validated above to accurately estimate the proportion of MSNs in the striatum, taking into account both DARPP-32 immunoreactivity and nuclear morphology. We determined the total number of cells in striatal sections by double staining with the pan-neuronal marker NeuN and TO-PRO-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004770-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), or with DARPP-32 and TO-PRO-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004770-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

In parallel we counted the number of neurons in categories A&#x02013;E defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004770-t001">Table 1</xref>. The percentage of NeuN positive cells was 70&#x000b1;0.4&#x00025; in the dorsal striatum, 80&#x000b1;1.4&#x00025; in the core of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and 75&#x000b1;3.1&#x00025; in the shell (means&#x000b1;SEM, 3 mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004770-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).

Thus, as expected, DARPP-32-positive neurons formed the largest population of striatal neurons (i.e. about 97&#x00025; of the neurons in the 3 striatal regions). Similar results were obtained when classification of all nuclei was done following the five categories described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004770-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Note that the percentages of cells in category A was consistently slightly lower than those obtained with DARPP-32 immunolabeling because identification on the basis of nuclear morphology required a section in which the nucleus was well visible and its features identifiable, which was not the case in all DARPP-32-positive cells. However, it should be pointed out that when the nucleus of DARPP-32-positive cells was clearly visible it always had the typical morphology described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004770-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>. All nuclei classified in category A were DARPP-32-immunolabeled (100&#x000b1;0&#x00025;) and virtually no DARPP-32-positive neuron was misclassified into the other categories (1&#x000b1;1&#x00025;).

Appearance of chromatin is often casually used on electron micrographs to identify neuronal populations, but, to our knowledge, nuclear staining has not been exploited for systematic identification of striatal neurons. Comparison with DARPP-32 immunoreactivity, a well-established marker for MSNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Ouimet1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Ouimet2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Ouimet3">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, showed that these neurons have a distinct nuclear appearance following DNA staining, in comparison to other striatal cells. This appearance is sufficiently characteristic to allow their accurate identification. Other striatal neurons also have distinct nuclear staining patterns, which allow a good prediction of their nature. This simple method may be useful to identify striatal neurons in tissue sections and potentially in living tissue, using vital DNA fluorescent dyes. Since the intensity of TO-PRO-3 fluorescence reflects DNA concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Stoica1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Oomman1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, the intensely labeled areas presumably correspond to heterochromatin, which is more condensed than euchromatin. Thus, it is interesting to note that various neuronal types have distinct nuclear organizations, likely to reflect distinct different functional states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Bishop1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-DiFiglia1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The relatively low abundance of condensed heterochromatin, reduced to 3&#x02013;5 small clumps in MSNs may suggest that a larger repertoire of genes is accessible to transcription in these neurons than in other cell types. Similar nuclear appearances were observed for principal neurons in other brain regions such as pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex (data not shown). However, further studies are necessary to determine whether nuclear staining can be used for reliably identifying cell populations outside of the striatum, as we could predict.</p><p>Although it is clear that most striatal neurons are MSNs which project to the SNr or the LGP and express distinct proteins, the degree of segregation of these two populations has been intensely debated. Many studies in the last 20 years have attempted to quantify the proportion of MSNs expressing D1R, D2R or both by using various approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-LeMoine1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Gerfen3">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Surmeier1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, some results have suggested the existence of a fairly high degree of overlap between the expression of D1R and D2R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Levesque1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The recent introduction of <italic>drd1a</italic>-EGFP and <italic>drd2</italic>-EGFP BAC transgenic mice allows an easy identification of D1R-expressing and D2R-expressing neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Gong1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Lobo1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Gong2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The use of markers of various types of striatal neurons showed that EGFP was expressed in striatonigral MSNs of <italic>drd1a</italic>-EGFP mice, whereas striatopallidal MSNs and cholinergic interneurons were labeled in <italic>drd2</italic>-EGFP mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Lee1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-BertranGonzalez1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies showed that approximately half of the MSNs were labeled with either probe, but they did not assess whether all the MSNs expressed one or the other. This information is critical, however, to estimate the number of MSNs expressing both receptors. Such measurement requires the expression of markers for D1R and D2R in the same animal. A recent paper elegantly addressed this question by using the <italic>drd1a</italic> promoter to drive the expression of tdTomato, a red fluorescent protein, in BAC transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Shuen1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However, when these authors crossed <italic>drd1a</italic>-tdTomato and <italic>drd2</italic>-EGFP mice, they estimated that up to 39&#x00025; of MSNs did not express either fluorescent protein in the F1 progeny. The proportion of unlabeled neurons was even higher (50&#x00025;) when they crossed <italic>drd1a</italic>-EGFP and <italic>drd2</italic>-EGFP mice. These results implied that either the fluorescent protein expression was too low to be detected in a large proportion of the neurons for some technical reason, or that a substantial number of MSNs did not express D1R or D2R. In any case, they casted doubt on the generality of the results obtained in BAC transgenic mice. They also implied that it was impossible to use the lack of expression of a marker as a means to identify a neuronal population. In light of our results, it appears that a major limitation of the study of Shuen <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Shuen1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> was that the identification of neuronal populations in the striatum and distinction between neurons and glia was not convincingly done. In addition it is possible that some weakly fluorescent <italic>drd1a</italic>-EGFP expressing neurons were overlooked. Therefore the reported estimates may have been inaccurate. In the present study we carefully quantified striatal neuronal populations, using antibodies for NeuN, DARPP-32, various interneuron markers and nuclear staining patterns. We obtained convergent results with these various approaches which clearly showed that all MSNs expressed either D1R or D2R or both.</p><p>It is interesting to compare the quantifications of neurons carried out by various techniques. DARPP-32 antibodies were reported to label 96.4&#x00025; of medium-sized neurons of the rat striatum (cell bodies 10&#x02013;15 &#x000b5;m) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Ouimet2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In complete agreement with these results, we find that about 97&#x00025; of neurons (NeuN-positive cells) were DARPP-32 positive. In our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-BertranGonzalez1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> we estimated that 52&#x00025; of the MSNs in the dorsal striatum, 53&#x00025; in the NAc core and 47&#x00025; in the shell expressed only D1R. These numbers are very similar to those obtained in the present study (51.1&#x00025;, 51.4&#x00025;, and 46.9&#x00025;, respectively). Moreover, the demonstration that all MSNs express one or the other dopamine receptor allows us to conclude that the numbers previously calculated to estimate the proportion of neurons expressing both types of receptors (5&#x00025;, 6&#x00025;, and 17&#x00025;, in the dorsal striatum, core, and shell, respectively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-BertranGonzalez1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>) are not underestimations but are likely to reflect the real proportions. It should be kept in mind, however, that all these numbers are based on the expression of a reporter protein, EGFP, and not of receptors themselves.</p><p>Although striatonigral and striatopallidal pathways are distinct and mostly formed by different MSNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Gerfen3">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, anatomical and electrophysiological studies suggest the existence in rat and monkey of neurons which project to both SNr and GP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Kawaguchi2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Levesque1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Having demonstrated that all MSNs express D1R or/and D2R, we used a retrograde neuronal tracer locally injected into the SNr to determine which population of neurons projected to the SNr. As expected, we found that all retrogradely labeled striatonigral neurons were EGFP-positive in <italic>drd1a</italic>-EGFP mice, whereas only very few (&#x0003c;1&#x00025;) retrogradely labeled neurons expressed EGFP in <italic>drd2</italic>-EGFP mice. These observations demonstrate that striatonigral neurons all express D1R and that only a very tiny fraction may also express D2R. On the other hand, observations in our and other laboratories support the existence of a small fraction of D1R-neuron projections to the pallidum, since weak but noticeable staining is present in the LGP of <italic>drd1a</italic>-Cre, <italic>chrm4</italic>-EGFP and <italic>drd1a</italic>-EGFP mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Lobo1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-BertranGonzalez1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Gong2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Since striatonigral fibers cross the pallidum, it would be difficult to completely rule out the artefactual labeling of some of these fibers using retrograde staining. However, analysis of the LGP of <italic>drd1a-</italic>EGFP mice revealed a light interlace of fibers that could account for sparse terminals of striatonigral neurons in the pallidum. Such fibers might account for the few branched neurons projecting to both SNr and GP reported in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Kawaguchi2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Levesque1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, our findings clearly show that the overwhelming majority of D2R-expressing neurons do not project to the SNr, in agreement with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Kawaguchi2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004770-Gerfen3">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The present study provides evidence that a simple nuclear staining method can be sufficient to identify MSNs, and also to recognize the various striatal interneurons with a good predictive value. The precise analysis of BAC transgenic mouse lines shows that 100&#x00025; of the MSNs express D1R or D2R or in a minority of cases both. This shows that the use of a single transgenic line in combination with DARPP-32 staining or a nuclear marker is sufficient for the correct distinction of striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons in histological analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004770.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Identification of striatal neurons based on their nuclear morphology.
