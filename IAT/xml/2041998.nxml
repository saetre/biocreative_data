Less clear is the effect that they have had on the establishment of the endogenous proviruses resident in the human and mouse genomes. We used the mouse genome sequence to study diversity and genetic traits of nonecotropic murine leukemia viruses (polytropic &#x0005b;Pmv&#x0005d;, modified polytropic &#x0005b;Mpmv&#x0005d;, and xenotropic &#x0005b;Xmv&#x0005d; subgroups), the best-characterized large set of recently integrated proviruses. We identified 49 proviruses. In phylogenetic analyses, Pmvs and Mpmvs were monophyletic, whereas Xmvs were divided into several clades, implying a greater number of replication cycles between the integration events. Four distinct primer binding site types (Pro, Gln1, Gln2 and Thr) were dispersed within the phylogeny, indicating frequent mispriming. We analyzed the frequency and context of G-to-A mutations for the role of mA3 in formation of these proviruses. In the Pmv and Mpmv (but not Xmv) groups, mutations attributable to mA3 constituted a large fraction of the total. A significant number of nonsense mutations suggests the absence of purifying selection following mutation. A strong bias of G-to-A relative to C-to-T changes was seen, implying a strand specificity that can only have occurred prior to integration. The optimal sequence context of G-to-A mutations, TTC, was consistent with mA3. At least in the Pmv group, a significant 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; gradient of G-to-A mutations was consistent with mA3 editing. Altogether, our results for the first time suggest mA3 editing immediately preceding the integration event that led to retroviral endogenization, contributing to inactivation of infectivity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Vertebrate genomes are littered with remnants from earlier retroviral infections, in the form of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Cellular host defenses against retroviruses, including the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases, have been described previously. APOBEC3 proteins have been shown to edit some retroviruses and other retrotransposing elements during their replication by deamination of C to U during negative-strand synthesis, resulting in G-to-A mutations in the sense strand. Here, we studied the possible effects that the APOBEC-protein family might have had in the establishing ERVs. We identified 49 endogenous (nonecotropic) murine leukemia viruses, divided into three groups; polytropic, modified polytropic, and xenotropic, in the sequenced C57BL/6J mouse genome. We analyzed genetic variation within and among subgroups and found mutation patterns consistent with APOBEC3 editing of Pmv and Mpmv, but not Xmv proviruses. Evidence such as (i) significantly higher G-to-A mutation frequencies compared to controls and large fractions leading to inactivating stop mutations, (ii) optimal sequence contexts surrounding the mutation positions, and (iii) editing gradient following the time course of retroviral replication, implicate APOBEC3 as a factor contributing to inactivation of these ERVs in the mouse genome.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Jern P, Stoye JP, Coffin JM (2007) Role of APOBEC3 in genetic diversity among endogenous murine leukemia viruses.

BLAST analyses with these flanking sequences demonstrate the presence of sequences corresponding to these provirus host junctions within the pool of sequences assembled to generate the whole mouse genome sequence. However, they are present only on very small contigs that have not been assigned within the whole assembly. Moreover, the flanking sequences in Xmv44 also yield multiple high similarity hits within a cluster of zinc finger repeat genes present on mouse Chromosome 4. The Xmv14 flank also yields a multitude of high similarity hits but with different genomic regions. We speculate that the absence of Xmv14 and 44, and by extension the other missing proviral loci, results from difficulties in assembling final genome sequence in regions containing lengthy repeats.</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis of the complete coding regions of the nonecotropic proviruses revealed a grouping into clades partially consistent with that inferred from the use of a single probe. The Pmv and Mpmv proviruses each form a single well-supported clade, and share a common ancestor relative to the Xmvs. The Xmvs, by contrast, form three well-supported clades, one of which appears to have given rise to the other two groups. Thus, the common ancestor for the whole group was most likely an Xmv-like provirus, possibly with some additional recombination involving the <italic>env</italic> genes (our unpublished data) and there appear to have been considerably more cycles of viral replication separating the Xmv proviruses than the other two groups, a conclusion supported by their greater diversity and relatively low <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> ratios, particularly in the internal branches of the phylogenetic tree. The low <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> ratios in the terminal branches of the Xmv proviruses imply that these branches represent both repeated cycles of virus replication as well as events proximal to and following integration of each individual provirus. Of the three groups, only the Xmvs have been seen to give rise to infectious virus, although functional Pmv and Mpmv <italic>env</italic> genes have been recovered in polytropic viruses derived by recombination with ecotropic MLV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Examination of the sequences of the recovered proviruses implies that, at least in part, this difference is due to much higher rates of nonsynonymous mutation in the latter groups: more than half (20/35) of the undeleted Pmv and Mpmv proviruses have one or more G-to-A mutations leading to stop codons, while only one of eight undeleted Xmv proviruses has been so affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030183-g002">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030183-st001">Table S1</xref>). Of the remaining Pmvs and Mpmvs, all have suffered G-to-A mutations relative to the likely ancestor, (an average of seven and five nonsynonymous changes per provirus, respectively). While the effects of each of these mutations on the function of the virus genes is unknown, it is likely that the net effect is to reduce or eliminate the ability of most or all of these proviruses to yield replication-competent virus.</p><p>The high frequencies of G-to-A changes in the Pmv and Mpmv groups led us to consider a possible role for mA3-mediated deamination in the generation of genetic diversity among the proviruses. Previous studies of A3 editing have been done mainly in lentiviruses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, and mostly with hA3 (for a recent review see Holmes et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;). mA3 has been shown to restrict retrotransposition of endogenous MusD and IAP mobile elements in mouse cells in culture, although there is less evidence for its action on the corresponding endogenous proviruses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. mA3 activity has also recently been shown to partially restrict infection with mouse mammary tumor virus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, there is evidence for mA3 editing of murine betaretrovirus-like elements.</p><p>In the present study, we observed mutation patterns indicative of mA3 editing in some gammaretroviruses, as well; specifically, the nonecotropic Pmv and Mpmv subgroups. Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that a large fraction of the mutations that distinguish the individual proviruses from their consensus were caused by mA3 editing. First, the high ratios (9:1 and 3:1) of G-to-A relative to C-to-T changes and the absence of purifying selection subsequent to mutation imply that most of the mutations arose during the last cycle of reverse transcription prior to integration of each provirus, and that, like human and mouse A3, deamination was specific for single-stranded DNA. Second, the inferred consensus sequence for C deamination (on the minus strand), TTC, is identical to that observed for mA3 in more direct experiments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Third, at least in the Pmv group, there is a clear 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; gradient of G-to-A (but not C-to-T) mutations across the provirus. As has been pointed out before &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;, such a gradient reflects the facts that A3 can only deaminate single-stranded DNA, and that minus-strand DNA near the 3&#x02032; end of the genome remains single stranded for a longer time than 5&#x02032; DNA during reverse transcription. We should note that, although we consider mA3 to be the most likely mediator of the G-to-A mutations observed, we cannot exclude participation of other cytidine deaminases, such as APOBEC1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d; in these modifications. Experiments to examine the expression of the various APOBECs in germ line cells may help to resolve this issue.</p><p>The Xmv proviruses, with at least one infectious member, exhibit none of the mutational characteristics suggestive of mA3 editing and have evolved differently from Pmv and Mpmv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030183-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030183-t001">Table 1</xref>). Indeed, in contrast to the other two groups, Xmv proviruses exhibit a significantly higher ratio of C-to-T relative to G-to-A changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030183-g002">Figure 2</xref>), possibly reflecting effects of purifying selection during their replication as viruses. This difference is not due to masking of G-to-A mutation by the higher overall diversity in the Xmv group. Thus, it appears that either (i) the xenotropic MLVs evolved a function to block the activity of mA3, perhaps by exclusion from virions, or (ii) the Pmv and Mpmv have lost this function. Given that the Xmv proviruses represent the ancestral group, the latter possibility seems much more likely. Loss of such a function might also provide a partial explanation for previous failures to isolate infectious Pmvs/Mpmvs from mouse cells by coculture despite the presence of multiple ERVs with a full complement of ORFs. A third possibility, given the complex origin of inbred mice and of their coevolution with murine retroviruses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;, is that germline integration of the Pmv and Mpmv proviruses occurred in a subspecies that expressed mA3 in the germline, while the host for the Xmvs did not. We are initiating studies to examine these possibilities, as well as the possibility that deaminase independent effects &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d; might also have played a role in endogenous provirus formation.</p><p>In other retroviral genera, evasion of A3 activity is related to the ability of the virus to prevent incorporation of A3 into virions. For example, at least some lentiviruses and spumaviruses encode proteins (Vif and Bet) for this purpose, and deltaretroviruses, such as HTLV-1, use a C-terminal extension of NC to prevent interaction of APOBEC and RNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. Variation of mA3 packaging into MLV virions has been proposed as a probable cause of observed variation in editing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, but these results are controversial, since other studies showed no inhibition of MLV by mA3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. This effect has been attributed to both its exclusion from the virion and proteolytic processing of the APOBEC that does get incorporated. The evasion of A3 deamination by MLV is specific for mA3, since MLV is not resistant to hA3G &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;, analogous to the sensitivity of HIV to mA3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030183-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In an attempt to identify differences that might contribute to the variation of mA3 editing among the provirus groups, we parsed the NC region of the alignment used to construct the maximum likelihood tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030183-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Variable positions in Gag, particularly in NC, are being evaluated for possible roles in preventing mA3 activity.</p><p>In summary, to our knowledge, we have shown here for the first time mA3 editing immediately preceding the integration event of endogenous gammaretroviruses. This activity is likely to have contributed to the inactivation of infectivity of two of the three nonecotropic MLV subgroups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting
