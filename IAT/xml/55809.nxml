A major end product of ROS damage to DNA is the formation of apurinic&#x0002f;apyrimidinic (AP) sites, which without removal are known to halt mRNA and DNA synthesis, or act as non-coding lesions resulting in the increased generation of DNA mutations. In human cells, the major enzyme in correcting the deleterious effects of AP sites in DNA is through the participation of AP endonuclease (APE), which initiates the removal of baseless sites in DNA through the catalytic scission of the phosphodiester bond 5&#x02032; and adjacent to an AP site. Interestingly, APE also possesses an activity (Ref-1) that controls the redox status of a number of transcription factors including Fos and Jun. The means by which APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 is directed to carry out such disparate roles are unknown. The presence of a number of phosphorylation sites scattered throughout both functional domains of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 however offered one possible mechanism that we reasoned could play a role in dictating how this protein responds to different stimuli. Here we show that the <italic>in vitro</italic> redox activity of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 is stimulated by PKC phosphorylation. Furthermore, when human cells were exposed to the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, an increase in redox activity was observed that corresponded to an increase in the phosphorylation status of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1. Importantly, human cells exposed to the oxidizing agent hypochlorite, followed by methyl methanesulfanate, responded with an increase in redox activity by APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 that also involved an increase in PKC activity and a corresponding increase in the phosphorylation of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1. These results suggest that the ability of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 to perform its <italic>in vivo</italic> redox function is correlated to its susceptibility to PKC phosphorylation that notably occurs in response to DNA damaging agents. </p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Apurinic&#x0002f;apyrimidinic (AP) sites can arise in DNA under a variety of circumstances. For example, certain alkylating agents as well as free radicals are known to destabilize purines and increase the likelihood of their loss from DNA; in some cases these lesions can further lead to the formation of 3&#x02032; phosphate and phosphoglycolate residues that block DNA synthesis. AP sites can also be formed as an intermediate in base excision repair initiated by a DNA glycosylase. Notably, AP sites can also arise spontaneously, where it has been estimated that 10 000 purines and 200 pyrimidines are lost each 24 h cell cycle in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c1">1</xref>). If left unchecked, the presence of AP sites is known to block DNA synthesis, or lead to mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c2">2</xref>).</p><p> In view of the deleterious consequences that baseless sites can have on genomic integrity, it is not surprising to find the ubiquitous presence of enzymes that act in their removal. The major activity, at least quantitatively, in human cells is an endonuclease (AP endonuclease or APE) that hydrolytically cleaves DNA 5&#x02032; and adjacent to an AP site to initiate its removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c4">4</xref>). A second activity is needed for the actual excision of the AP site, which is most likely accomplished through the action of a deoxyribophosphodiesterase. Importantly, DNA polymerase &#x003b2; possesses this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c5">5</xref>). Since DNA polymerase &#x003b2; and APE have been shown to act together in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c6">6</xref>), it can be concluded that these two activities are critical for the repair of baseless sites in DNA.</p><p> The gene that encodes human APE has been cloned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c8">8</xref>) and shown to have sequence similarities to the Exonuclease III family of APEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c8">8</xref>).</p><p> Several years after its cloning, human APE was discovered to also contain vigorous redox activity (Ref-1) through its ability to promote the binding of Jun&#x0002f;Jun homodimers or Fos&#x0002f;Jun heterodimers to a synthetic oligonucleotide containing an AP-1 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c9">9</xref>). The observed activation of AP-1 binding is through the use of a domain within APE that exists at the N-terminus of APE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke430f1">1</xref>) and is specifically involved in converting AP-1 transcription factors to a reduced, active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c10">10</xref>). This is accomplished by the use of a cysteine residue at position 65, the loss of which abolishes redox activity. More recent evidence indicates that AP-1 transcriptional activity is regulated by a direct association between APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 and the redox-active compound thioredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c11">11</xref>).</p><p> A number of other transcription factors have since been identified that are also subject to redox regulation by APE&#x0002f;Ref-1. These include the p50 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B (Nuclear Factor kappa B), CREB, Myb, HIF-I&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c12">12</xref>) and Pax-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c13">13</xref>), a transcription factor important for the correct development of the thyroid gland.</p><p> Perhaps the most surprising find in regard to APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 is the recent discovery that it also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, in which APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 acts in converting it from an inert form to an active form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c14">14</xref>). The events in this case, however, appear to be both redox dependent and independent. It is important to note that p53, like APE&#x0002f;Ref-1, is an important factor in preserving genomic integrity under stressful conditions. For example, in response to DNA-damaging agents, p53 plays an integral role in either arresting cell-cycle progression or inducing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c15">15</xref>).</p><p> Attempts to alter the endogenous levels of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 in response to stress, unlike p53, have for the most part met with little success. One exception is a study in which human cells exposed to different DNA damaging agents showed an increase in APE activity that corresponded with an increase in the amount of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c16">16</xref>). Specifically, when HeLa cells were first exposed to sublethal doses of the oxidizing agent hypochlorite for 12 h, followed by a second treatment with methyl methanesulfonate (1 h), an increase in both the amount of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 and a corresponding rise in APE activity was detected in what was described as an &#x02018;adaptive response&#x02019;.</p><p> We have previously shown that APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 contains several putative phosphorylation sites including CK II and PKC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke430f1">1</xref>), and that the <italic>in vitro </italic>phosphorylation of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 by CK II inhibited APE activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c17">17</xref>). However, when we turned to a number of pharmacological agents known to alter the <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of CK II, none were shown to reproducibly alter the <italic>in vivo</italic> expressed APE activity possessed by APE&#x0002f;Ref-1. Since we had not yet examined the redox activity of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1, we tested what effect the phosphorylation by CK II, CK I or PKC had on this activity. It was apparent from these early experiments that, while two of the three kinases had little if any effect on redox activity, PKC phosphorylation of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 was found to enhance the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of Fos and Jun to AP-1 oligonucleotides<bold>. </bold>Furthermore, we also show here that the conditions described above to elicit an adaptive response lead to a rise in PKC activity, which in turn leads to an increase in the phosphorylation of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1. The end result is an increase in redox activity without a change in the amount of the APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cells and cell culture</title><p>Human myeloid leukemia cell line K562 was used in the studies described here since its expression of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 is low when compared to other cell lines in our possession.

The results are presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke430f2">2</xref>, in which our original experiments showed that the addition of PKC-phosphorylated GST&#x02013;APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 to reactions measuring redox activity (lane 5) exhibited less activity than that observed by the addition of unphosphorylated GST&#x02013;APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 (lane 3). However, if the unincorporated ATP used in the PKC kinase reaction was removed by dialysis prior to redox reactions, phosphorylated GST&#x02013;APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 in fact produced a modest increase in redox activity (lane 6) when compared to unphosphorylated GST&#x02013;APE&#x0002f;Ref-1. If GST&#x02013;APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 was phosphorylated in the presence of an activator&#x0002f;stabilizer of PKC, phosphatidyl serine (lane 7), even greater amounts of redox activity were observed. The addition of phosphatase to PKC-phosporylated GST&#x02013;APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 (lanes 8 and 9), on the other hand, reduced the amount of redox activity seen in lanes 6 and 7. Since the phosphatases used to dephosphorylate purified GST&#x02013;APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 could have also affected the phosphorylation status of Fos and Jun present in extracts of K562 cells, we added phosphatase inhibitors after de-phosphorylating GST&#x02013;APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 and prior to its addition to extracts of K562 cells. No changes from that reflected in reactions resolved in lanes 8 and 9 were observed, confirming that the reduction in redox activity after phosphatase treatment was due to a loss of phosphate groups associated with APE&#x0002f;Ref-1, and not those associated with Fos and Jun.</p><p> The inhibition of GST&#x02013;APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 mediated redox activity by ATP was unexpected.

Western analysis using a monoclonal antibody against APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 showed, however, that the amount of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 protein did not change either in the presence or absence of PMA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke430f3">3</xref>A).</p><p> We next questioned whether the <italic>in vivo</italic> redox activity of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 could be altered using the conditions employed above.

As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke430f3">3</xref>B, short-term exposure to PMA (lane 1) led to an increase in redox activity of roughly 1.4-fold when compared to cells not exposed to PMA (lane 3).</p><p> The specificity of the complex formed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke430f3">3</xref>B was determined in two ways. First, when cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 monoclonal antibody prior to conducting EMSAs, the AP-1 complex failed to form for both PMA treated cells (lane 2) as well as untreated cells (lane 4). The loss of DNA binding activity was also noted when a 100-fold excess of unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide was added to reactions prior to performing the EMSA (not shown). Taken together, the formation of the DNA binding complex observed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke430f3">3</xref>B was dependent upon APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 and the AP-1 DNA binding site.</p><p> It should be noted that the preceding experiments with PMA showed no change in APE activity (not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>An &#x02018;adaptive response&#x02019; to DNA damaging agents causes stimulation of PKC, increased phosphorylation of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1, and enhanced redox activity</title><p>We next turned to a procedure that has been reported to increase the amount of endogenous APE activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c16">16</xref>) to see if the same experimental procedure could influence redox activity as well. Briefly, cells were challenged with a non-toxic dose of a DNA damaging agent, and then subsequently exposed to a secondary DNA damaging agent that, together, was described as eliciting a so-called &#x02018;adaptive response&#x02019; in human cells. The agents used to elicit this response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c16">16</xref>) were an original challenge with hypochlorite, followed by exposure to MMS. We attempted to execute the same type of experiment as previously described, and in addition we also included an analysis of the phosphorylation status of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 and any redox changes that might result from exposure to the aforementioned DNA damaging agents. Specifically, stably transfected K562 cells were first exposed for 12 h to hypochlorite (130 nM), and then to MMS (200 &#x000b5;M) for an additional 1 h. Under these conditions, we found that the amount of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 did not change (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke430f4">4</xref>B), nor did the amount of APE activity (not shown). On the other hand, an increase in redox activity was evident (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke430f4">4</xref>A). Furthermore, the increase in redox activity was correlated with an increase in the phosphorylation status of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke430f4">4</xref>B). Both were highest in cells exposed to both hypochlorite and MMS. Exposure to hypochlorite and MMS also stimulated a large increase in PKC activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke430f4">4</xref>B) that presumably was responsible for the increase in APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 phosphorylation.</p><p> The preceding experiments were also performed in untransfected wild-type K562 cells, which revealed an identical pattern of response as that seen in transfected K562 cells (not shown). The levels of redox activity in wild-type cells were however roughly 30&#x00025; less than that observed in HA&#x02013;APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 transfected cells, which should be expected if the source of increased redox activity brought on by DNA damaging agents was indeed due to changes in the phosphorylation status of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 and not some other protein, or proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We previously reported on the presence of a number of potential phosphorylation sites that are scattered throughout the APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c17">17</xref>). In view of the diverse functions that are possessed by APE&#x0002f;Ref-1, we reasoned that these phosphorylation sites may play a role in regulating the protein:protein or protein:DNA interactions involved in redox and DNA repair. Although we were originally encouraged by our <italic>in vitro</italic> results that CK II phosphorylation might control APE activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c17">17</xref>), we have been unable to show any modification of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 under a variety of <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions when the expression of CK II was altered. On the other hand, it appears that PKC phosphorylation does influence the redox activity possessed by APE&#x0002f;Ref-1, and that this conclusion is corroborated by both <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies.</p><p> The <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 has been suggested, but not directly shown, in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c19">19</xref>). The involvement of a single CK II site at position 121&#x02013;125 and two CK I sites at positions 123&#x02013;127 and 158&#x02013;162 were the only potential phosphorylation sites identified by this study, all of which reside in the DNA repair domain of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1.</p><p> The results presented here directly show that the phosphorylation of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 results in enhanced redox activity but, unlike those of Fritz and Kaina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c19">19</xref>), point to the involvement of PKC. This conclusion was established under a variety of conditions that first began by showing that the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of AP-1 to its cognate binding site was substantially enhanced in the presence of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 that had been phosphorylated by PKC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke430f2">2</xref>). This result was especially evident when ATP was removed prior to performing EMSAs. The inhibition of the redox activity of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 by ATP was unexpected since we would not have anticipated a nucleotide to interfere with protein:protein interactions involved in the redox control of Fos and Jun. The inhibition of the APE activity possessed by APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 by small molecules containing a DNA base has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c3">3</xref>), and seems reasonable since it may interfere with the binding of the repair enzyme to nucleotides present in DNA.</p><p> Our <italic>in vitro</italic> results showing that PKC stimulates the redox activity of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 were corroborated by two <italic>in vivo</italic> assays. First, with the use of the pharmacological agent PMA, which is known to induce PKC activity shortly after cellular exposure, increases in redox activity over that for cells not exposed to PMA was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke430f3">3</xref>). Changes in redox activity were also tested in cells exposed to non-toxic doses of DNA damaging agents that previous studies had concluded elicited an adaptive response in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c16">16</xref>). The outcome of those earlier experiments concluded that exposure to hypochlorite (an oxidizer), and MMS (an agent that increases the presence of AP sites in DNA), produced an increase in the amount of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 in exposed cells. An increase in APE activity was also observed. We have examined a variety of cell lines using the same techniques established by Ramana <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c16">16</xref>) in an attempt to reproduce not only their observed changes in APE&#x0002f;Ref-1, but to also determine if those changes somehow correlated with alterations in the phosphorylation status of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1. The conditions chosen by Ramana<italic> et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c16">16</xref>) in our hands did not yield results similar to theirs, but did point to an intriguing change in the redox activity possessed by APE&#x0002f;Ref-1. Specifically, long time exposure to the oxidant hypochlorite (12 h), followed by a 1 h incubation with MMS, resulted in cellular changes much like that observed for cells exposed to PMA. For example, exposure to hypochlorite and MMS brought about an increase in PKC activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke430f4">4</xref>B). An increase in the phosphorylation of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 was also observed. Lastly, elevated redox activity was generated by exposure to hypochlorite and MMS, yet the amount of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 did not change from that observed in unexposed cells. These results are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke430f5">5</xref>, which shows that increases in PKC activity are correlated with a rise in APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 phosphorylation and enhanced redox activity that stimulates AP-1 DNA binding activity.</p><p> Oxidative stress is known to elicit a translocation of cytoplasmic thioredoxin to the nucleus, where its direct association with APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c11">11</xref>). This complex is thought to control redox-sensitive transcription factors such as AP-1. Importantly, a recent study shows that ionizing radiation elicits an increase in nuclear thioredoxin that is accompanied by an increase in AP-1 binding activity dependent on the presence of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c20">20</xref>). </p><p> It is known that oxidants stimulate PKC activity by reacting with its regulatory domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c21">21</xref>). This most likely played a role in producing the increases in PKC activity we observed in cells exposed to the oxidizing agent hypochlorite, which in turn leads to an increase in the phosphorylation of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1. This remains somewhat speculative, however, until we have specifically determined the APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 site(s) that is subject to <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> phosphorylation. Furthermore, it remains possible that the phosphorylation of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 has a more important function other than its effect on redox activity, such as it being linked to APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 translocation to the nucleus.</p><p> The results presented here nevertheless suggest the involvement of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 in a signaling pathway that is mediated by a specific kinase that ultimately leads to the more effective redox binding of AP-1 transcription factors to their specific DNA binding sites. Notably, changes in the redox function of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 appear to result from challenges brought on by agents known to damage DNA. This includes the ones used in this study, as well as the recent observation in cells exposed to ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke430c20">20</xref>). It therefore appears that both functional domains of APE&#x0002f;Ref-1, although appearing to be catalytically diverse, may share a common characteristic in protecting and preserving the integrity of human DNA. </p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke430f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Potential PKC phosphorylation sites possessed by APE&#x0002f;Ref-1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gke43001"/></fig><fig id="gke430f2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><italic>In vitro</italic> phosphorylation of GST&#x02013;APE&#x0002f;Ref-1 by PKC increases redox activity as shown by EMSA.
