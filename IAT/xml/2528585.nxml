Studies over the past years have revealed that these various steps, including gene activation, transcription, 5&#x02032; capping, 3&#x02032; end processing and polyadenylation, splicing, mRNA surveillance/quality control, and export of mRNPs are tightly coupled (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reed and Cheng, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sommer and Nehrbass, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the THO&#x02013;transcription export (TREX) complex and the Sac3&#x02013;Thp1&#x02013;Sus1&#x02013;Cdc31 (TREX-2) complex are involved in transcription-coupled mRNA export (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reed and Cheng, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">K&#x000f6;hler and Hurt, 2007</xref>). The THO&#x02013;TREX complex is thought to be recruited to the elongating RNA polymerase II complex via the THO subunits (Hpr1, Tho2, Mft1, and Thp2), which preferentially function in transcription and packaging of nascent mRNA, whereas the other TREX factors Sub2 and Yra1 are involved in recruiting the Mex67-Mtr2 export receptor to the mRNP, thereby coupling mRNP biogenesis with mRNA export (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reed and Cheng, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">K&#x000f6;hler and Hurt, 2007</xref>). The TREX-2 complex potentially coordinates Spt/Ada/Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA)&#x02013;mediated transcription of certain genes at the inner nuclear side of the nuclear pore complex (NPC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Navarro et al., 2004</xref>). A key factor of TREX-2 is the Sac3 subunit, a multidomain protein that binds the remaining complex members. Sac3 associates with Thp1, which was initially found to be involved in transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallardo and Aguilera, 2001</xref>), and with Sus1 and Cdc31 via its CID (Cdc31-interacting domain) motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, Sac3 can also directly bind to the export receptor Mex67-Mtr2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lei et al., 2003</xref>). In vivo, the TREX-2 complex is predominantly located at the NPC, which requires the nuclear basket nucleoporin Nup1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>). Notably, the TREX-2 factor Sus1 is also a component of the chromatin-bound SAGA complex involved in transcription initiation of a subset of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Navarro et al., 2004</xref>) and part of a SAGA module, which is involved in deubiquitination of H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">K&#x000f6;hler et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, Sus1 could be a bridging factor between the SAGA transcription machinery and the NPC-associated TREX-2 complex.</p><p>Historically, the nuclear periphery was known as a zone that harbors silenced regions of the genome and thus was believed to be an area of transcription repression. However, recent studies have revealed that genes can be recruited to the nuclear periphery upon their transcriptional activation (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar and Gasser, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">K&#x000f6;hler and Hurt, 2007</xref>). Thus, activating and repressing chromatin environments coexist but appear to be spatially partitioned. Whereas the heterochromatin, like telomeres and the mating-type locus, line the nuclear envelope, the active chromatin domains are in the vicinity of the NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Taddei et al., 2004</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar and Gasser, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Gene recruitment to the nuclear periphery involves components of the nuclear basket and associated factors implicated in transcription and mRNA export, including SAGA and TREX-2 factors as well as Mex67. Regarding the mechanism, gene gating requires the nascent transcript or posttranscriptional events. However, other studies suggest that gene gating can also be independent of transcription and is then mediated by direct interaction of the gene with components of the nuclear periphery (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar and Gasser, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">K&#x000f6;hler and Hurt, 2007</xref>). In general, gene recruitment to the periphery could allow access to a favorable environment, including chromatin remodeling, transcription, and export machineries, thereby optimizing gene expression and mRNA export (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar and Gasser, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">K&#x000f6;hler and Hurt, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we found Src1 (also called Heh1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">King et al., 2006</xref>) in genetic screens using mutants of the THO&#x02013;TREX and TREX-2 complexes. Src1 exhibits a domain organization similar to higher eukaryotic LEM2 and MAN1, which are integral inner nuclear membrane proteins that consist of an N-terminal LEM domain, two transmembrane-spanning sequences, and a Man1-Src1 C-terminal (MSC) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mans et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brachner et al., 2005</xref>). LEM proteins (named after LAP2, emerin, and MAN1) can interact with the nuclear lamina and/or chromatin-binding factors, thereby providing anchoring sites for chromatin at the nuclear periphery and modulating higher order chromatin structure (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gruenbaum et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wagner and Krohne, 2007</xref>). Our analyses further revealed that Src1 is an integral membrane protein that spans the inner nuclear membrane twice, thereby exposing the putative DNA-binding N and C domains to the nucleoplasm. As shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)&#x02013;on-chip analysis, Src1 is associated with subtelomeric regions that are located at the nuclear periphery. Moreover, the regulation of expression of genes located in the subtelomeric regions (e.g., <italic>PHO11</italic>, <italic>PHO12</italic>, and <italic>PHO84</italic>) is altered in cells lacking Src1. These data suggest that Src1 functions at the interface between chromatin organization of subtelomeric genes at the inner nuclear membrane and TREX-dependent mRNA export.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>TREX factors interact genetically with <italic>SRC1</italic></title><p>To unravel the genetic network in which TREX factors carry out their function in vivo, we performed synthetic lethal screens with the mutant strains <italic>hpr1</italic>&#x00394; (a THO&#x02013;TREX factor), which is thermosensitive for growth at 37&#x000b0;C, and <italic>thp1</italic>&#x00394; (a TREX-2 factor). Each screen yielded a synthetic lethal mutant that was complemented by <italic>SRC1</italic> (unpublished data). DNA sequencing of the <italic>SRC1</italic> allele recovered from the <italic>thp1</italic>&#x00394; synthetic lethal mutant indeed revealed that Src1 was inactivated in the synthetic lethal strain by a premature stop codon at amino acid 455 (unpublished data). <italic>SRC1</italic> was previously identified as an intron-containing gene involved in sister chromatid segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Navarro et al., 2002</xref>). In another study, Src1/Heh1 was shown to be located at the inner side of the nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">King et al., 2006</xref>).

This analysis indicated that <italic>SRC1</italic> is genetically linked to another TREX-2 factor <italic>SAC3</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) but not to <italic>SUS1</italic> or <italic>CDC31</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and not depicted). This correlates with the fact that <italic>src1</italic>&#x00394; is not synthetic lethal with <italic>sac3</italic>&#x00394;CID, where the binding site for Sus1 and Cdc31 is deleted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Unexpectedly, the other THO&#x02013;TREX mutants <italic>tho2</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>mft1</italic>&#x00394;, and <italic>thp2</italic>&#x00394; were not found to be genetically linked to <italic>src1</italic>&#x00394; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and not depicted).

In contrast, a synthetically enhanced growth inhibition was observed between <italic>src1</italic>&#x00394; and the <italic>sub2-85</italic> allele (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Collectively, these genetic studies indicated that <italic>SRC1</italic> is functionally linked to factors of the THO&#x02013;TREX and TREX-2 complex, and thus, Src1 might functionally overlap with an upstream step in the formation of an export-competent mRNP.</p></sec><sec><title>Two forms of Src1 protein generated by alternative splicing are functionally not equivalent</title><p>To study the in vivo role of Src1 with respect to its genetic linkage to TREX factors, we sought to tag chromosomal <italic>SRC1</italic> at the C terminus with the tandem affinity purification (TAP) and GFP tag to perform affinity purification and subcellular location experiments, respectively. However, C-terminal tagging was not straight forward because <italic>SRC1</italic> contains an intron that can be alternatively spliced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Navarro et al., 2002</xref>). Specifically, the <italic>SRC1</italic> intron has two alternative 5&#x02032; splice sites, which could potentially encode two different Src1 proteins: a long form with 834 (Src1-L) and a shorter form with 687 amino acids (Src1-S). Importantly, Src1-L and Src1-S would differ in their amino acid sequences at the C-terminal end because the alternative 5&#x02032; splice sites shift the reading frame in the 3&#x02032; exon (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Alternative splicing of <italic>SRC1</italic> results in two different spliced protein forms.</bold> (A) Schematic overview of pre-mRNA, mRNA, and protein products upon alternative splicing. Either a 126- or a 130-nt intron can be excised by using two alternative 5&#x02032; splice sites. In the latter case, a frame shift results in an earlier stop codon and, therefore, in a shorter protein with a different amino acid sequence at the C terminus compared with Src1-L. Conserved domains (HEH/LEM and MSC) and transmembrane domains (M) are indicated. Numbers represent amino acid residues.

The double-disruption strains were transformed with empty vector, GFP-Src1 splice variants, and the respective TREX component.

Both Src1-L and Src1-S were detected in about equimolar amounts in whole cell lysates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Moreover, N-terminal TAP tagging of Src1 showed that both Src1 splice forms were coexpressed in similar ratios (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Notably, Src1-L and Src1-S do not have identical functions, as the long form of Src1 complements the synthetic lethal phenotype of THO&#x02013;TREX and TREX-2 mutants significantly better than the short form (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p><p>To find out whether both Src1s have a similar subcellular location, we performed fluorescence microscopy. Both Src1-L and Src1-S tagged at the N terminus with GFP exhibited a distinct concentration at the nuclear envelope with no apparent staining of other cellular membranes (Fig. S1, left, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803098/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803098/DC1</ext-link>). Moreover, Src1-L and Src1-S did not cluster with NPCs in the NPC-clustering <italic>nup133</italic>&#x00394; mutant (Fig. S1, right). Thus, Src1-L and Src1-S are located at the inner nuclear membrane and appear not to have stable physical contact to the NPCs, although a transient interaction cannot be excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Src1-L and Src1-S are integral inner nuclear membrane proteins with different topology</title><p>Biocomputational analysis suggested that Src1-L could be a membrane protein with two membrane-spanning sequences, but only the first transmembrane span has a strong prediction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). To experimentally verify that Src1-L is an integral membrane protein, whole cell lysates containing Src1-TAP were extracted under different conditions, and the partitioning of Src1-TAP into soluble and insoluble (membrane) fractions was tested and compared with the behavior of a peripheral membrane protein (Nsp1) and an integral membrane protein (vacuolar Vam3). Whereas high salt (1 M NaCl) or pH 11.5 treatment did not release Src1-L and Src1-S, detergent (Triton X-100) efficiently solubilized both Src1-TAP splice variants, as with Vam3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Thus, the biochemical behavior of Src1 is typical of an integral membrane protein.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Src1-L and Src1-S are integral membrane proteins.</bold> (A) Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis (with a 19&#x02013;amino acid window size; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kyte and Doolittle, 1982</xref>) revealed two putative hydrophobic transmembrane-spanning regions (M1 and M2) for Src1-L but only one region with significant transmembrane potential for Src1-S. The hydrophobicity scores are plotted against the window number. (B) Crude membrane fractions from cells expressing Src1-L&#x02013;TAP or Src1-S&#x02013;TAP were extracted using four different conditions: 150 mM NaCl, 1 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, or pH 11.5. Equivalent amounts of fractions from lysate (L), membrane (P1), soluble (S1), and, after ultracentrifugation, insoluble pellet (P) and supernatant (S) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with antibodies against ProtA, Vam3, and Nsp1.

Western blots were probed with an anti-ProtA antibody (bottom).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820897f03"></graphic></fig><p>Because the putative transmembrane span M2 (residues 708&#x02013;725) of Src1 has a lower hydrophobicity than transmembrane span M1 (residues 450&#x02013;474) and M2 is absent from the Src1-S form because of alternative splicing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), we wanted to analyze the topology of both Src1 forms within the inner nuclear membrane in living cells (see models in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Thus, we developed a novel in vivo assay to probe for the topology of Src1-L and Src1-S within the inner nuclear membrane. Src1 was genomically TAP tagged at the N terminus (protein A [ProtA]&#x02013;tobacco etch virus [TEV]&#x02013;calmodulin-binding peptide&#x02013;Src1) or C terminus (Src1&#x02013;calmodulin-binding peptide&#x02013;TEV-ProtA). The accessible TEV cleavage site in these constructs could be exploited to test whether it is cleaved by an inducible TEV protease carrying an NLS and a myc tag. We anticipated that the TEV protease should remove the ProtA moiety only from those Src1 constructs in which the epitope is exposed to the nucleoplasm but not when hidden in the perinuclear space (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, left). When cells were grown in glucose (no TEV expression), all Src1 constructs retained the ProtA epitope, as shown by Western blotting with anti-ProtA antibodies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, lanes 1, 3, and 5). When cells were shifted to galactose to induce the TEV protease, both short and long N-terminally tagged Src1 as well as C-terminally tagged Src1-L lost their ProtA tags, suggesting that the N terminus of Src1-L and Src1-S and the C terminus of Src1-L are facing the nucleoplasm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, lanes 2 and 4). However, the TEV protease could not remove the ProtA epitope from the C-terminally tagged Src1-S (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, lane 6). Altogether, these data suggest that Src1-L spans the inner nuclear membrane twice with the N and C domain exposed to the nucleoplasm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, boxed in red). In contrast, Src1-S spans the membrane once with the N domain located in the nucleoplasm and a short C-terminal domain hidden in the perinuclear space (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, boxed in red).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Src1-L is a double-pass integral membrane protein, and Src1-S is a single-pass integral membrane protein.</bold> (A) The six possible topological orientations for Src1-L and the two for Src1-S are shown.

Biochemical studies revealed that Src1&#x00394;M2 behaved like an integral membrane protein, whereas Src1&#x00394;M1 was no longer inserted into the membrane and became soluble (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Thus, M1 is necessary and sufficient for membrane insertion of Src1. However, M2 alone could not confer a stable membrane insertion and only integrated into the nuclear membrane in the context of full-length Src1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Thus, the first transmembrane domain in Src1 is necessary for membrane insertion, whereas the second membrane span alone cannot confer integral insertion into the membrane but develops insertion activity when M1 is present.</p><p>To study the role of the transmembrane sequences M1 and M2 and of other domains for nuclear envelope targeting of Src1 in vivo, GFP-tagged Src1 mutant constructs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>) were analyzed for their subcellular location by fluorescence microscopy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). This analysis showed that GFP-Src1&#x00394;M2 was still located at the nuclear envelope, in contrast to GFP-Src1&#x00394;M1, which was detached from the nuclear periphery and mislocalized to the nucleoplasm.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Src1 domain analysis.</bold> (A) Schematic representation of Src1 deletion constructs.

The reciprocal construct, GFP-Src1&#x00394;N, was still targeted to the nuclear envelope, albeit with lower efficiency, and was partly found to be associated with other membranes (cortical ER or plasma membrane). Deletion of only the N-terminal LEM domain (&#x00394;LEM) did not affect the nuclear envelope location of Src1. Notably, the Src1&#x00394;N&#x00394;M1 construct was also located in the nucleoplasm with occasional perinuclear spots. Altogether, the data suggest that the N domain and, to a lesser extent, also the C domain of Src1-L contribute to nuclear targeting, whereas the first transmembrane domain is necessary and sufficient to insert Src1 into the inner nuclear envelope.</p><p>To assess which Src1domains are functionally important, we tested the ability of the different truncated Src1 forms to complement the synthetic lethal phenotype of the <italic>src1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>thp1</italic>&#x00394; double mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>).

Thus, although Src1&#x00394;M2 apparently is targeted to and inserted into the nuclear membrane, it is not functional in our complementation assay. Notably, the C-terminal domain of Src1-L is exposed to the nucleoplasm (see previous section), but in the Src1&#x00394;M2 strain it is hidden in the lumen of the perinuclear space (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Thus, the C-terminal domain of Src1 performs a crucial role with respect to the Thp1 function and has to be both targeted to the membrane and exposed to the nucleoplasm.

Moreover, Src1 localizes also to other heterochromatin-like regions such as the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus, the mating-type loci (within subtelomeric regions of chromosome III), and, albeit only to a minor degree, to centromeric regions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Most of the other locations to which Src1 maps to a minor extent are likely to be unspecific, as those loci are also enriched in the ProtA control.

Importantly, Src1 is associated with subtelomeric chromatin and thus can help to organize this region of the chromosomes. In previous studies, Src1 was shown to contain an intron with the possibility of alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Navarro et al., 2002</xref>). Our study revealed that both splice forms localize to the nuclear periphery and are integral inner nuclear membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">King et al., 2006</xref>). However, both proteins are not functionally equivalent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that two forms of a protein generated by alternative splicing in yeast have different functions.</p><p>The N domain of Src1 mediates nuclear targeting, and insertion into the nuclear membrane requires the first transmembrane span. These findings are consistent with studies of vertebrate LEM2 and MAN1 in which nuclear envelope targeting and retention are also dependent on the first transmembrane domain and the N terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brachner et al., 2005</xref>). Previously, it has been shown that Src1 is imported to the inner nuclear membrane by the Kap60&#x02013;Kap95 pathway in a RanGTP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">King et al., 2006</xref>). Replacing the entire N terminus of Src1 with the classical SV40 NLS, however, was not sufficient to restore its normal localization at the inner nuclear membrane (unpublished data). This suggests that besides an NLS, additional targeting/retention information is retained within the N domain of Src1.</p><p>Src1 is preferentially associated with heterochromatin such as subtelomeric and telomeric chromatin. As both N- and C-terminal domains of Src1-L face the nucleoplasm and each harbors a potential DNA-interacting domain (LEM and MSC), it is possible that the interaction with DNA is direct, but adaptor proteins could also be involved in chromatin binding. LEM domain proteins in higher eukaryotes are able to associate with chromatin either directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caputo et al., 2006</xref>) or via the chromatin-associated barrier to autointegration factor (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wagner and Krohne, 2007</xref>). However, a homologue of barrier to autointegration factor does not exist in yeast, and we were unable to find stoichiometric protein interaction partners of Src1.</p><p>Telomeres are anchored to the nuclear periphery in yeast by redundant mechanisms involving the heterodimeric yKu complex and Sir4, which associates with the membrane-associated Esc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hediger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Taddei et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, the SUN domain protein Mps3 assists in Sir4-dependent telomere tethering and silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bupp et al., 2007</xref>). Whether Src1 functions directly in silencing remains open. <italic>SRC1</italic> is not genetically linked to <italic>ESC1</italic> or <italic>YKU70</italic> (unpublished data), and telomere silencing was not affected in <italic>src1</italic>&#x00394; cells. However, disruption of <italic>SRC1</italic> affected telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Askree et al., 2004</xref>), and a synergistically reduced silencing of subtelomeric genes was observed when <italic>src1</italic>&#x00394; was combined with the <italic>yku70</italic>&#x00394; allele.</p><p>In addition to telomeres, Src1 is also associated with the rDNA locus. Both consist of repetitive sequences, which have to be protected from uncontrolled homologous recombination to maintain genomic integrity. Notably, Src1 was copurified with Lrs4, a factor located at the rDNA locus with a role in rDNA silencing and suppression of rDNA recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2006</xref>). Lrs4 together with cohesin are thought to prevent the formation of chromatid junctions, and Src1 could aid in this step locally at the inner nuclear membrane. In line with a function together with cohesin, Src1 has been reported to be involved in sister chromatid separation and is genetically linked to S<italic>CC1</italic> and <italic>ESP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Navarro et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Our study further reveals that Src1 is required for proper gene expression of subtelomeric genes, such as several <italic>PHO</italic> genes, that are associated with the inner nuclear membrane. Transcription of <italic>PHO</italic> genes in response to the phosphate concentration is regulated by the phosphorylation status of the transcription factor Pho4, which in turn affects its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O'Neill et al., 1996</xref>). Our data suggest that the subtelomeric <italic>PHO</italic> genes may exhibit, besides specific control by Pho4, a global regulation as a result of their association with the inner nuclear membrane, which is repressive for gene expression. By which mechanism Src1 could affect subtelomeric gene expression remains unclear. It is known that in contrast to telomere silencing mediated by the Sir complex, silencing of genes within subtelomeric/HAST (Hda1-affected subtelomeric) domains depends on the local nucleosome structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wyrick et al., 1999</xref>). This is characterized by histone H3 hypomethylation and hypoacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robyr et al., 2002</xref>). Whether Src1 specifically affects histone modifications in subtelomeric regions remains to be determined, but its role in gene expression could be envisaged in a broader sense (e.g., by interfering with different types of mechanisms that activate or repress gene expression). The effect of both up- and down-regulation of genes observed in the <italic>src1&#x00394;</italic> mutant could be caused by transcription factors concentrated at the nuclear periphery that act as both activators and repressors. Lack of Src1 might restrict the access of these factors to subtelomeric loci as a result of an altered chromatin structure. The macroarray data also show that expression of some genes that are not located at subtelomeric regions, but randomly across the chromosomes, were affected by loss of <italic>SRC1</italic>. Because Src1 did not interact significantly with these genes according to ChIP-on-chip, the effect could be indirect (e.g., caused by misregulation of subtelomeric genes, which in turn alter expression of genes located elsewhere in the genome).</p><p>The finding that Src1 is genetically linked to factors of the THO&#x02013;TREX and TREX-2 complexes suggested an involvement in transcription and/or export. However, the disruption of <italic>SRC1</italic> did not cause an mRNA export defect. Thus, Src1 could be connected to the transcription-assisted (upstream) functions of these TREX complexes. It is well established that mutations in these TREX factors (e.g., in Thp1, Sac3, and Hpr1) not only inhibit transcription elongation but also induce transcription-dependent hyperrecombination and genome instability (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reed and Cheng, 2005</xref>). Src1 is not genetically linked to all of the subunits of THO&#x02013;TREX and TREX-2, which suggests that the subunits within the TREX complexes may have different roles with respect to Src1 function. For example, Sub2, a subunit of THO&#x02013;TREX, not only functions in transcription, splicing, and mRNA export but was also shown to be localized to telomeres and to affect heterochromatic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lahue et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, the simplest model of how Src1 functions as an integral inner nuclear membrane protein is to help in recruiting and organizing the peripheral (telomeric and subtelomeric) chromatin, perhaps by directly binding to specific DNA sequences or nucleosomes (see above). By organizing subtelomeric and telomeric DNA in a distinct nuclear compartment, the nuclear periphery, Src1 could help to cluster a group of genes in a zone in which silencing factors, transcription activators, and repressors cooperate for regulated gene expression and which also has access to an efficient mRNA export pathway via the TREX machineries associated with NPCs. Subtelomeric and telomeric chromatin and the rDNA locus are repetitive, and their preservation is crucial for maintaining genome integrity. Thus, localization of this chromatin to the nuclear membrane could also play a role in preventing unwanted recombination. Many of these described functions attributed to Src1 can now be tested by exploiting <italic>src1</italic> mutants in different functional assays.</p><p>Last but not least, Src1 is related to higher eukaryotic LEM domain&#x02013;containing inner nuclear membrane proteins that were shown to interact with transcription regulators (e.g., R-Smads and HDAC3) and thus affect gene expression and signal transduction by recruitment of transcription regulators to the nuclear periphery (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gruenbaum et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wagner and Krohne, 2007</xref>). Our study showed that the LEM domain protein Src1 is associated with subtelomeric chromatin and affects gene expression in this region. Thus, Src1 could serve as a model protein to gain further insight into the complex role of inner nuclear membrane proteins, including their involvement in diseases such as laminopathies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and plasmid constructs</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains and plasmids are listed in Table S2 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803098/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803098/DC1</ext-link>).
