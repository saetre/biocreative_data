However, inconsistencies of commercially available APC antibodies have limited the exploration of APC function. APC is implicated in spindle formation by direct interactions with tubulin and microtubule-binding protein EB1. APC also interacts with the actin cytoskeleton to regulate cell polarity. Until now, interaction of APC with the third cytoskeletal element, intermediate filaments, has remained unexamined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We generated an APC antibody (APC-M2 pAb) raised against the 15 amino acid repeat region, and verified its reliability in applications including immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence in cultured cells and tissue. Utilizing this APC-M2 pAb, we immunoprecipitated endogenous APC and its binding proteins from colon epithelial cells expressing wild-type APC. Using Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we identified 42 proteins in complex with APC, including &#x003b2;-catenin and intermediate filament (IF) proteins lamin B1 and keratin 81. Association of lamin B1 with APC in cultured cells and human colonic tissue was verified by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization. APC also colocalized with keratins and remained associated with IF proteins throughout a sequential extraction procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We introduce a versatile APC antibody that is useful for cell/tissue immunostaining, immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. We also present evidence for interactions between APC and IFs, independent of actin filaments and microtubules. Our results suggest that APC associates with all three major components of the cytoskeleton, thus expanding potential roles for APC in the regulation of cytoskeletal integrity.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Mutation of Adenomatous Polyposis Coli <italic>(APC</italic>) is an early event in colorectal carcinogenesis. The various subcellular localizations and binding partners of APC implicate this tumor suppressor in a wide variety of cellular functions in normal cells. The most well characterized function of APC is to inhibit Wnt-&#x003b2;-catenin signaling by forming a multi-protein complex which targets cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin for destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A role for APC in the regulation of cytoskeletal integrity has also been proposed.</p><p>APC linkage with the actin network was demonstrated by both direct interaction of APC with actin and by actin-dependent membrane-localization of APC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Ectopic expression of APC, truncation of APC by mutation, and APC loss all result in aberrant cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Identification of APC in a complex with IQGAP, a scaffolding protein that binds to growing microtubules and regulates actin filament elongation, provides evidence that APC participates in cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Depletion of either APC or IQGAP1 inhibits actin polymerization and cell polarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. APC also positively affects ASEF, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor specific for Cdc42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A truncated APC protein similar to those associated with colon cancers was unable to activate ASEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. APC interaction with the microtubule cytoskeleton has also been established. Early localization studies identified APC at the plus ends of microtubules, implicating APC in cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The functional interaction of APC with the microtubule network is strengthened by the finding that APC directly interacts with tubulin and the microtubule-binding protein, EB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Depletion of APC destabilizes microtubules and inhibits spindle formation and cellular protrusions, thereby compromising cellular migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Actin-containing microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments (IFs), constitute the three main cytoskeletal elements that act coordinately to regulate cell structure, polarity and migration. IFs function as a scaffold to maintain cell and tissue integrity and defects in IF impact a number of diseases (see review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]). In the present study, we provide further evidence for the involvement of APC in the regulation of cytoskeletal structure through interaction with IFs. Using purified polyclonal sera raised against the 15 amino acid repeat region of APC (referred to APC-M2 pAb), we identified interactions between APC and IF proteins lamin B1, lamin B2, keratin 81 and keratin 82. We verified the lamin B1 interaction with APC by co-immunoprecipitation as well as by immunofluorescence microscopy in both cultured cells and human colonic tissue. Nuclear lamins are type V IFs that form a spherical mesh lining the nuclear envelope, providing attachment sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The keratin/APC interaction was further supported by protein co-localization in cultured cells. Keratins are type I and II IFs that are predominantly found in epithelial cells, providing structural integrity to those cells so that they can withstand mechanical stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Identifying an interaction between APC and IFs expands the potential role of APC in cytoskeletal regulation. Although APC expression and functions have been widely studied in basic research and clinical settings, recent reports have raised questions about the accuracy and reliability of many commercially available antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Therefore, an APC antibody that accurately determines levels and subcellular localizations of APC in cells and especially in tissues is extremely important. Our characterization of the APC-M2 pAb validates its use in a variety of applications including detection of APC protein in mouse and human tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Intermediate Filament protein lamin B1 co-precipitates with APC using the new APC-M2 pAb</title><p>As a multi-functional tumor suppressor protein, APC has been widely analyzed regarding its subcellular localization and its interaction with other proteins. Most commercial antibodies, which were raised against either the N- or C-terminus of APC, recognize proteins other than APC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This cross reactivity makes it difficult to obtain reliable data using standard molecular and cellular biology techniques to study APC. Thus, we injected rabbits with purified protein corresponding to the central domain of APC (amino acids 959-1338, Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) and we affinity-purified sera from these rabbits (referred to hereafter as APC-M2 pAb). Our initial analysis of APC-M2 pAb in cultured cells utilized HCT116&#x003b2;w colon epithelial cells that possess only the wild-type &#x003b2;-catenin allele and thus differ from the parental HCT116 cells that contain one wild-type and one mutant &#x003b2;-catenin allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. APC-M2 pAb recognizes full-length APC which appears as a single band of ~310 kDa in lysates from HCT116&#x003b2;w cells and truncated mutant APC (~150 kDa) in lysates from SW480 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). No band was detected in lysates from HCA46 cells which are essentially null for APC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Both full-length and truncated APC were efficiently precipitated using APC-M2 pAb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). A well established binding partner of APC, &#x003b2;-catenin, was also co-precipitated with full-length APC from HCT116&#x003b2;w cell lysates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Thus, we confirmed the reliability of APC-M2 pAb for use in immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Lamin B1 co-precipitates with endogenous APC using APC-M2 pAb</bold>.

Many of APC's functions are only beginning to be elucidated. Identifying novel binding partners for APC is a step toward fully understanding APC's involvement in the maintenance of cellular integrity. Therefore, APC-M2 pAb was used to co-immunoprecipitate APC and its associated proteins from HCT116&#x003b2;w cell lysates. Nine protein bands that were unique to the APC co-precipitation and not observed using preimmune sera as a control were visualized by colloidal blue staining (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). These bands and corresponding regions from the control lane were separately isolated, pooled and analyzed by Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Forty-three potential APC binding proteins that precipitated with APC antisera and not with preimmune sera were identified as having cross-correlation scores (x-corr) of &#x02267;2 for 2+ ion and &#x02267;2.5 for 3+ ion (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). These 43 proteins could be grouped in eight broad categories, the largest two being cytoskeletal regulation and RNA processing/translation. From the most abundant potential APC-binding proteins found, we chose to examine the interaction of APC with intermediate filaments in more detail. IF proteins identified were lamin B1, lamin B2, keratin 81 and keratin 82 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Initially, we focused on the most abundantly APC-associated protein of the four, lamin B1.

APC-M2 pAb recognizes APC at cell-cell junctions, in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of U2OS cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). This pattern showed considerable overlap with that of one of the most frequently utilized commercially available APC antibodies, ali12-28, which was raised against amino acid 135-422. Moreover, APC-M2 pAb effectively detected a truncated APC protein expressed as a GFP-fusion in HCT116&#x003b2;w cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Because the exogenous GFP-fused APC was greatly over-expressed, the exposure time for the APC-M2 pAb signal was shortened to reveal the overlapping pattern. In contrast, APC-M2 pAb did not recognize GFP fused to the SV40 Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>APC-M2 pAb recognizes endogenous and exogenous APC protein by immunofluorescence microscopy</bold>.

Cells expressing the negative control shRNA plasmid displayed no alteration in APC signal intensity using APC-M2-pAb for immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In contrast, cells expressing either of two <italic>APC</italic>-specific shRNA plasmids displayed a marked reduction in both cytoplasmic and nuclear APC signal intensity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

In single confocal slices, APC appeared in puncta that partially overlapped lamin B1 and aligned with some keratin filaments (data not shown). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> shows APC and either keratin or laminB1 signals each captured in 20 z-plane images and projected into a single image. Because the APC signal did not completely coincide with that of keratin or laminB1, quantitation of the overlap was performed by determining the Pearson's correlation coefficient from ~700 individual confocal images representing &#x0003e;65 individual cells captured in three-dimensions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Correlation coefficients of APC/lamin B1 and APC/keratin pairs were significantly higher than that of negative control samples stained with only the secondary antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4C</xref>). On average, 11% of the APC signal overlapped that of keratin and 27% overlapped that of lamin B1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, images were analyzed for random overlap by shifting the green and red signals by 20 pixels in the x-direction. Offset in either direction resulted in a decrease in the correlation, indicating that the overlap is not a chance occurrence from two relatively abundant signals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, 1<sup>st </sup>and 3<sup>rd </sup>panels). In addition, the cross-correlation coefficient for keratin or lamin B with a randomized APC signal was low and showed multiple peaks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, 2<sup>nd </sup>and 4<sup>th </sup>panels). Results from the image analysis validated the observed co-localization of APC with both lamin B and keratin. As an alternative approach to further investigate this co-localization, full length APC was expressed as a GFP fusion. In single confocal slices, the GFP signal displayed partial overlap with both keratin and lamin B1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Taken together, the observed cellular co-localization is consistent with an association between APC and IF proteins keratin and lamin B1.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>IF proteins lamin B1 and keratins colocalize with endogenous and exogenous APC in cultured cells</bold>.

Because APC also associates with actin and microtubules, it is possible that the co-immunoprecipitation of IF proteins with APC is due to precipitation of a large complex of cytoskeletal components. To determine whether the APC/IF interaction was dependent on actin-containing microfilaments and microtubules, we performed a traditional solubilization and extraction of both tubulin- and actin-containing microfilament proteins from cells, leaving behind predominantly insoluble IFs and desmosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. After sequential extraction, the cytoskeletal proteins tubulin and actin were efficiently removed from cells as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). APC, however, remained cell-associated, as did IF proteins lamin B1 and keratin. Colocalization of APC with keratins was apparent in extracted cells, with the APC appearing as puncta along the keratin filaments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). That APC remains cell-associated following this extraction procedure suggests a stable interaction between APC and IFs, independent of actin-containing microfilaments and microtubules.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>APC remains associated with IF proteins following extraction of actin and tubulin</bold>.

To validate the use of APC-M2 pAb in animal studies, frozen sections of mouse small intestinal tissue were probed with APC-M2-pAb and then APC was visualized using confocal microscopy. The staining of APC was most intense in cells at the top of villi, with less APC in cells near the crypt base (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>).

APC-M2 pAb is versatile and can be used to detect APC in immunostaining, immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Using this antibody, we identified a novel interaction between APC and IFs. The APC and IF protein interactions were confirmed by co-precipitation and colocalization using both endogenous and GFP-tagged exogenous APC in cultured epithelial cells. Association of APC with IFs is not dependent on actin-containing microfilaments and microtubules.</p><p>APC mutations are found in over 80% of all colorectal cancers and have been assessed for screening and prognosis purposes in the clinical setting. For such research, access to an APC antibody that accurately depicts levels and subcellular localizations of APC in cells and especially in tissues is extremely important. According to Wakeman <italic>et. al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], many commercially available antibodies also recognize an unidentified protein that localizes to the apical region of polarized epithelial cells. Most currently available commercial APC antibodies were raised against several hundred amino acids at either the N- or C-terminus of the APC protein. However, most of these antibodies have not been proven to be specific for APC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, many of these antibodies are only useful for a single application. For example, anti-APC Ab-7 is only effective when used for immunostaining. Therefore, we generated a new antibody against the 15 amino acid repeat region in the middle of APC (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The affinity-purified APC-M2 pAb recognizes junctional, cytoplasmic and nuclear APC by immunostaining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) without producing the non-specific apical staining pattern previously seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Although there was a great deal of overlap, immunofluorescent signals from APC-M2 pAb and anti-APC ali12-28 were not 100% coincident. The ali12-28 antibody was raised against a different portion of APC protein than M2-APC. The most likely explanation for the slight signal disparity is that the epitopes recognized by APC-M2 pAb are masked by APC folding, or the binding of another protein to a subset of the APC protein. In a similar manner, it would be expected that the epitope recognized by ali12-28 might be inaccessible in some fraction of the APC protein.</p><p>One of the most clinically relevant applications for APC antibodies is for immunohistochemical analysis of tissues. We have validated the use of APC-M2 pAb for immunostaining sections of frozen human colonic tissue and mouse small intestinal tissues. Previously, APC has been detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of human colonic tissue, with more prevalent cytoplasmic staining in colonic tumors compared to normal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In our study of human colon tissue, APC-M2 pAb revealed APC in both nuclei and at cell-cell junctions, partially colocalized with &#x003b2;-catenin, similar to previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). APC protein also appeared concentrated near the basal surface of epithelial cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. APC staining became most intense in cells at the top of villi in the mouse small intestine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A-B</xref>) and in cells at the luminal surface of the human colon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), consistent with a role for APC in differentiated cells. Most importantly, APC-M2 pAb did not recognize protein at the apical surface of intestinal tissues. Thus, APC-M2 pAb does not appear to exhibit the cross reactivity previously reported for some commercially available APC antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Taken together, the APC-M2 pAb is a useful antibody for future examination of APC in mouse and human tissue sections. At present, APC-M2 pAb does not appear to recognize APC in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (data not shown).</p><p>Intermediate filaments are essential components of cytoskeletal structure. Recent reports have implicated APC in the regulation of cellular structural integrity through affects on microtubule growth directionality and polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. APC also associates with microtubule-interacting protein EB1, and actin-associated protein ASEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Our own previous screen for APC-interacting proteins identified keratin 18 (Stecklein and Neufeld, personal communication). Although classified as a hair cuticle-specific keratin, keratin 81 is expressed in a wide variety of tissues including mammary gland and lung and in human embryonic kidney 293T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Keratin 82 is also thought to be expressed predominantly in hair and nail. However, when flag-tag specific antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate flag-tagged human homolog 3 of Drosophila Disc-large (hDlg) from human embryonic kidney 293 cells, keratin 82 was identified as a protein partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This observation is significant because it indicates that keratin 82 has a broader expression pattern than initially suggested and because hDlg protein itself is a binding partner of APC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Downregulation of &#x003b2;-catenin activity by APC is not limited to the cytoplasmic destruction complex. Association of APC with &#x003b2;-catenin in the nucleus appears to result in sequestration of &#x003b2;-catenin from the TCF/LEF transcription factor leading to inactivation of Wnt-responsive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that APC associated with the enhancer region of a Wnt-responsive gene in a similar temporal manner as several co-repressors, suggesting that APC can oppose a Wnt signal by associating with co-repressors at the transcription complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Given the emerging role of the nuclear lamina in gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], it is tempting to speculate that APC association with lamin B1 is yet another mechanism by which expression of Wnt-responsive genes is regulated. Moreover, finding APC associated with the nucleus after extraction suggests APC might be bound to the nuclear matrix. This observation is consistent with our previous finding that the majority of nuclear APC purified with the nuclear matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>As a vital part of the cytoskeleton, intermediate filaments are dynamic and can stabilize cellular organelles such as the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Mutations in genes encoding IF proteins are associated with a number of diseases such as Monilethrix (K81) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (LMNB1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], acquired partial lipodystrophy (LMNB2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and various other lipodystrophies and cardiomyopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. APC potentially cross-links IFs to improve their stability or binds IFs to other structures such as actin filaments or microtubules. Therefore, truncated APC found in the majority of colorectal cancers and also in other cancers, might have a compromised ability to link APC binding partners with different IF proteins. It is worth noting that full-length APC has been found near IFs in epithelial cells from human colon tissue using immunogold electron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Given the evidence for an association of APC with IFs, it is predicted that disruption of IFs would result in APC redistribution. Our attempts to disrupt IFs by treating cells with acrylamide led to cell shrinking, but not elimination of IFs (data not shown). Further study of this novel APC/IF interaction using a related approach might illuminate the underlying mechanisms of intermediate filament protein-associated diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we identified an interaction between APC and intermediate filament proteins lamin B1 and keratin using a novel antibody, APC-M2 pAb. The APC-M2 pAb antibody is specific for APC, versatile, and reliable, with potential value in the clinical setting and in translational research. By sequential extraction of cytoskeletal components, we have shown that the association of APC with IF proteins is not dependent on actin and tubulin. Finding APC associated with IF proteins confirms and expands upon the previous notion that APC is in close association with the cytoskeleton, raising the possibility that APC functions in the maintenance of cytoskeletal structure and integrity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture, transfection, and tissue preparation</title><p>HCT116&#x003b2;w (a generous gift from Bert Vogelstein) and U2OS cells (ATCC) were grown in McCoy's 5A media (Gibco) supplemented with 10% Fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone).
