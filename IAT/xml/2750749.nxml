We have previously reported a tubulin-mediated translocation of syndecan-1 to the nucleus. The transport route and functional significance of nuclear syndecan-1 is still incompletely understood. Here we investigate the sub-cellular distribution of syndecan-1, FGF-2, FGFR-1 and heparanase in malignant mesenchymal tumor cells, and explore the possibility of their coordinated translocation to the nucleus. To elucidate a structural requirement for this nuclear transport, we have transfected cells with a syndecan-1/EGFP construct or with a short truncated version containing only the tubulin binding RMKKK sequence. The sub-cellular distribution of the EGFP fusion proteins was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Our data indicate that syndecan-1, FGF-2 and heparanase co-localize in the nucleus, whereas FGFR-1 is enriched mainly in the perinuclear area. Overexpression of syndecan-1 results in increased nuclear accumulation of FGF-2, demonstrating the functional importance of syndecan-1 for this nuclear transport. Interestingly, exogenously added FGF-2 does not follow the route taken by endogenous FGF-2. Furthermore, we prove that the RMKKK sequence of syndecan-1 is necessary and sufficient for nuclear translocation, acting as a nuclear localization signal, and the Arginine residue is vital for this localization. We conclude that syndecan-1 and FGF-2, but not FGFR-1 share a common transport route and co-localize with heparanase in the nucleus, and this transport is mediated by the RMKKK motif in syndecan-1. Our study opens a new perspective in the proteoglycan field and provides more evidence of nuclear interactions of syndecan-1.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteoglycans (PGs) are highly sulfated macromolecules, whose protein cores bear covalently attached glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains.

The ability of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) to bind to fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) has been proven to depend largely on the presence of heparan sulfate (HS), which interacts with both FGF-2 and FGFR-1, stabilizing the ligand/receptor complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Rapraeger1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-SpivakKroizman1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Rahmoune1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Schlessinger1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Yayon1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The HS chains can be degraded by heparanase through enzymatic cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Ilan1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and in this way the HSPG-bound GFs can be liberated.

As syndecan-1 can bind both GFs and their GFRs, we aimed in this study to investigate the possibility of a regulated co-translocation of syndecan-1, FGF-2 and FGFR-1. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the syndecan-1/tubulin complex may not only act as a vehicle for the transport of GFs to the cell nucleus, but it may also constitute a functional entity in an intracrine route, which operates independently from the cell surface receptor function. Our experiments are designed to clarify the translocation of the syndecan-1/FGF-2/FGFR-1 complex, and the structural requirement for the nuclear transport of syndecan-1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell lines and cell culture conditions</title><p>Three cell lines of mesenchymal origin were used in this study.

In the mesothelioma cells we could detect a nuclear pool of syndecan-1 and FGF-2, whereas FGFR-1 remained exclusively perinuclear. In contrast to other cell types, this receptor never reached the nuclear compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Joy1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Maher1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Stachowiak1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Stachowiak2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results not only add to the growing literature showing a HS-mediated mechanism of nuclear translocation of FGF-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Roghani1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Hsia1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, but also identify a tubulin-mediated transport route for both syndecan-1 and FGF-2.</p><p>Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the co-localization of FGF-2 with syndecan-1 is associated with a physical interaction between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007346-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). We have recently proved by FACS analysis that syndecan-1 protein levels are increased 2-3 fold in these stable transfectants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Zong1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Our present data show that by overexpressing syndecan-1 the amount of nuclear FGF-2 increased approximately 2-fold, which provides evidence that syndecan-1 is needed for the nuclear transport of FGF-2. The presence of a greater amount of FGF-2 in the crude nuclear extract indicates that only part of the nuclear FGF-2 is bound to syndecan-1. This finding suggests that there also are other syndecan-1 independent routes for FGF-2 transport to the nucleus. Tubulin depolymerization prevents the nuclear transport of FGF-2 and syndecan-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007346-g003"><bold>Figure 3A, B</bold></xref>), and the fact that both components co-localize with the depolymerized tubulin indicates stable associations between them. They thus seem to share a common tubulin-dependent transport mechanism. In contrast, no nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007346-g001"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>) or co-localization with tubulin was observed for FGFR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007346-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>) pointing toward a divergent transport route for this molecule.</p><p>We have previously shown nuclear syndecan-1 in many other cell types besides malignant mesothelioma, including benign mesothelial cells, normal dermal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adenocarcinomas and neuroblastoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Brockstedt1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, we show that the cytoplasmic RMKKK sequence of syndecan-1 is acting as a nuclear localization signal. This sequence corresponds to the characteristic short sequence of positively charged amino acids like lysine (K) and arginine (R) that defines a nuclear protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Boulikas1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Hodel1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. It is located in the highly conserved C1 domain of syndecan-1, also known to be involved in the linkage to several cytoskeletal proteins, including tubulin, cortactin and ezrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Tkachenko1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Our findings show that this short motif of syndecan-1 is both necessary and sufficient for the nuclear translocation of a protein, as shown here fused to EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007346-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>). Transfection with the RMKKK/EGFP construct results in a rapid accumulation of the fusion protein in the cell nucleus, whereas no such nuclear accumulation is observed in the control EGFP-transfected cells. Furthermore, replacement of the one arginine is sufficient to substantially decrease the nuclear accumulation of the mutated fusion proteins. The mutants 1 and 2 share a common arginine mutation and give a dramatic decrease of nuclear translocation, which indicates that arginine is most crucial for this function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007346-g007"><bold>Figure 7</bold></xref>). However, the syndecan-1/EGFP construct, carrying the EGFP on the cytoplasmic tail, translocated to the nucleus much less efficiently than the native syndecan-1 or the RMKKK/EGFP construct. This indicates that the C-terminal region of syndecan-1 is important for the tubulin-mediated nuclear transport.</p><p>The EGFP fluorescence co-localizes both with newly synthesized syndecan-1 protein and HS at the cell membrane, revealing that the newly synthesized syndecan-1/EGFP fusion protein also carries HS chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007346-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>), which is important for its GF binding capacity. To what extent the HS chains are themselves important for the nuclear translocation process is still an open and challenging question. Chen L <italic>et al</italic> have recently shown that heparanase overexpression or addition of recombinant heparansae decreases the nuclear syndecan-1 in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the translocation is dependent to a significant extent upon the HS chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Chen1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It has been suggested that the interaction of syndecan-1 with GFs on the cell surface may assist the internalization and intracellular trafficking of these factors. This mechanism is not completely elucidated, but several lines of evidence indicate the importance of HSPG in this process. Furthermore, GFs like FGF-2 and PDGF can act by triggering second messenger systems in addition to their effects on gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Jans1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Studies show that internalized FGF-2 survives longer periods of time in cells expressing HSPGs than in HSPG-deficient cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Sperinde1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. The majority of GF/GFR complexes on the cell surface get internalized and degraded in lysosomes, perhaps as part of the receptor-turnover pathway (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Keresztes1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Kolset1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>). The HSPG/GF complex might serve as a reservoir for GFs protecting them from degradation and allowing later entrance into the nucleus. However, such transport of exogenous FGF-2 from the cell surface to the nucleus could not be verified in the mesothelioma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007346-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>). The finding that exogenously added GF never reached the nucleus in detectable amounts, contradicts the idea that this is a major route for FGF-2 present in the nucleus. In contrast, a substantial pool of endogenous FGF-2 is detected in the nucleus at the same time point by a parallel immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007346-g004"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>), suggesting an independent intracrine route, besides a tubulin/syndecan-1 mediated nuclear translocation.</p><p>Overexpression of syndecan-1 increased the amount of the nuclear FGF-2 in the crude nuclear extract and also co-immunoprecipitated together with the ectodomain of syndecan-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007346-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>), thereby emphasizing the role of syndecan-1 for this nuclear translocation.</p><p>Whether syndecan-1 follows an intracrine route or passes the cell membrane can not be answered from the present experimental results. The fact that syndecan-1 is seen in the nucleus before it accumulates in the cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Brockstedt1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> to some extent supports the hypothesis of an intracrine loop. Since there is a strict co-localization of both N- and C-terminal portions of the syndecan-1 core protein with the HS side chains, the nuclear syndecan-1 seems to be the entire HSPG, which therefore must have been processed by the Golgi apparatus for HS modification before being transported to the nucleus.</p><p>It is plausible that this PG may be directed to different cellular compartments at different situations. Syndecan-1 gives faint immunocytochemical staining at the cell surface of the mesothelioma cells, detectable amounts being seen only at cell confluence. It may be that in the confluent cultures the shedding of syndecan-1 decreases, allowing it to accumulate on the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007346-Brockstedt1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The finding that FGF-2 and syndecan-1 often, but not always, co-localize in the nucleus, and that their expression levels vary during the experiments, also leaves the possibility of alternative routes for the nuclear translocation of these two components. This variability may also depend on a dynamic molecular switch consisting of subsequent association and dissociation events, where the activity of the HS moieties is modulated by the co-localizing heparanase. Once in the nucleus, however, syndecan-1 may well bind GFs, as shown by their tight co-localization. Furthermore, the activity of the heparanase may counteract the formation of GFs/syndecan-1 complexes, thereby regulating their possible functions.</p><p>The presence of syndecan-1 inside the nucleus raises many challenging questions remaining to be elucidated, including the nuclear targets of syndecan-1 and their possible downstream effects. Studies on such effects of nuclear syndecan-1 have been initiated in our laboratory.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007346.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Characteristic staining pattern of syndecan-1 in malignant cells.
