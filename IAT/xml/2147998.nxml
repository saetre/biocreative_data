How these diverse functions are regulated remains obscure. Here, we report three new phosphoforms of the non-catalytic domain that confer distinct functional properties to UNG2. These are apparently generated by cyclin-dependent kinases through stepwise phosphorylation of S23, T60 and S64 in the cell cycle. Phosphorylation of S23 in late G1/early S confers increased association with replication protein A (RPA) and replicating chromatin and markedly increases the catalytic turnover of UNG2. Conversely, progressive phosphorylation of T60 and S64 throughout S phase mediates reduced binding to RPA and flag UNG2 for breakdown in G2 by forming a cyclin E/c-myc-like phosphodegron. The enhanced catalytic turnover of UNG2 p-S23 likely optimises the protein to excise uracil along with rapidly moving replication forks. Our findings may aid further studies of how UNG2 initiates mutagenic rather than repair processing of activation-induced deaminase-generated uracil at Ig loci in B cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>phosphodegron phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>replication forks</kwd><kwd>uracil-DNA glycosylase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Uracil is one of the most common base lesions in DNA and may result from misincorporation of dUMP instead of dTMP during replication or from deamination of cytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kavli <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). While U:A pairs generated from misincorporation of dUMP are not directly mutagenic, deamination of cytosine results in mutagenic U:G mispairs. In most cells, deamination occurs spontaneously. However in B cells, DNA cytosine at Ig loci may also be enzymatically deaminated to uracil by activation-induced deaminase (AID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Rada <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Dickerson <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). The importance of sanitation of genomic uracil is indicated by the ubiquitous presence of uracil DNA glycosylases (UDGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Krokan <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). In humans, UNG2 constitutes the quantitatively dominating UDG activity in the nucleus, and is the major enzyme for removal of both misincorporated uracil and deaminated cytosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kavli <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Moreover, UNG2 is the only known glycosylase involved in antibody diversification, by processing of AID-induced U:G pairs in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kavli <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Di Noia <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Finally, UNG2 appears to be involved in the assembly of CENP-A at centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Zeitlin <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), although its precise role in this context remains to be determined. Given the diverse roles of UNG2 in mammalian nuclei and its ability to initiate either repair or mutagenic processing of uracil, it is reasonable that the protein is subject to precise regulation. At the transcriptional level, two mRNAs are expressed from the UNG gene by the use of different promoters and alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Nilsen <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Haug <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). The UNG1 mRNA encodes a 304 aa protein translocated to mitochondria, while the UNG2 mRNA encodes a 313 aa protein that is translocated intact to nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Otterlei <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Both mRNAs are cell cycle regulated, reaching maximum levels just prior to the S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Slupphaug <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Haug <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). The C-terminal 220 residues of UNG2 form a compact, globular catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Mol <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Slupphaug <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">1996</xref>), while the N-terminal region constitutes a distinct regulatory domain that is not necessary for enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kavli <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). The 86 aa N-terminal non-catalytic domain furthermore confers biochemical properties to UNG2 that are not displayed by the catalytic domain alone, including a strong single-strand DNA preference of UNG2 in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kavli <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>), supporting a role for UNG2 in uracil removal from ssDNA, for example, in front of the replicative polymerase complex and in R-loops at Ig loci. A role for UNG2 in processing of uracil in ssDNA is substantiated by the presence of at least one replication protein A (RPA)-binding motif in the UNG2 N-terminal domain. Furthermore, a PCNA-binding motif located at the N terminus is likely important for the role of UNG2 in rapid postreplicative removal of misincorporated dUMP at the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Otterlei <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>).</p><p>UNG2 is the initiating factor in uracil-BER in the nucleus, as well as a central mediator in affinity maturation of antibodies. It is thus highly relevant to investigate to what extent the non-catalytic domain modulates UNG2 function, and the present work addresses the significance of phosphorylation in this context. It has previously been demonstrated that UNG2 exists as a phosphoprotein <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Muller-Weeks <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>) and that it apparently may be phosphorylated at T6 and T126 subsequent to UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Lu <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Here, we report three novel, major phosphorylation forms of UNG2 present in freely cycling HeLa cells, and demonstrate that these are regulated throughout the cell cycle. Combined with functional analysis of phosphomimicking and phosphoinhibiting UNG2 mutants and activity analysis of true UNG2 phosphoforms, our results support a model in which the total cellular level, the activity and the association of UNG2 with proteins at the replication fork are regulated by three consecutive phosphorylations in the non-catalytic N-terminal domain.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>UNG2 in freely cycling HeLa cells is stepwise phosphorylated at three Ser/Thr residues in the N-terminal non-catalytic domain</title><p>To identify potential UNG2 phosphoforms, UNG2 was precipitated from nuclear extracts of proliferating HeLa cells using UNG antibody PU059. Captured proteins were separated by isoelectric focusing in the pI range 7&#x02013;11 and subjected to second dimension SDS&#x02013;PAGE. Silver-stained spots in the expected pI and MW range of UNG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>) were excised and subjected to trypsination and MALDI-TOF MS peptide mass fingerprinting. Four of the spots were identified as UNG2 (forms 1&#x02013;4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). The peptide fingerprints revealed mass shifts corresponding to one phosphate in residues 20&#x02013;49 (in forms 2&#x02013;4), one phosphate in residues 51&#x02013;73 (in form 3) and two phosphates in the latter peptide in form 4. The presence of phosphates in forms 2&#x02013;4 was further verified by pretreatment of the immunoprecipitated UNG2 with calf intestine phosphatase prior to 2D PAGE and western analysis. This resulted in loss of all UNG2 forms except the most positively charged form 1 representing unphosphorylated UNG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To identify the phosphorylated residues more precisely, peptides from the four spots were analysed by MALDI Q-TOF MS/MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Stensballe and Jensen, 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A&#x02013;C</xref>). The analyses revealed the following UNG2 isoforms: form 1: unphosphorylated; form 2: monophosphorylated at S23; form 3: double phosphorylated at S23 and T60 and form 4 triple phosphorylated at S23, T60 and S64. Moreover, the lack of observed single phosphorylations at T60 and S64 suggests that the phosphorylations occur in a stepwise fashion from the N-terminus to the C-terminus of the regulatory domain. The localisation of the phosphorylated residues within the human UNG2 N-terminus is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref> together with known N-terminal sequences from other eukaryotic UNG2 proteins. The known PCNA- and RPA-binding regions in hUNG2 are also illustrated. The MS/MS sequencing results were entirely in agreement with the MALDI-TOF results and were also confirmed using the program DISPHOS 1.3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://core.ist.temple.edu/pred/information.html">http://core.ist.temple.edu/pred/information.html</ext-link>) using the entries from the Phospho.ELM database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Diella <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). This stringent predictor takes into consideration that intrinsic structural disorder in and around the potential target is a prerequisite for phosphorylation, and notably identifies S23, T60 and S64 in addition to S63 as potential phosphorylation sites. These Ser/Thr residues are the most conserved in the eukaryotic sequences outside the highly conserved PCNA- and RPA-binding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the second and third phosphorylations (at T60 and S64, respectively) create a motif that is very similar to the phosphodegrons observed in cyclin E, c-Myc, c-Jun, Notch1 and SREBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Welcker and Clurman, 2007</xref> and references therein) that serves as recognition motifs for their ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation subsequent to phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>). To investigate whether this apparent phosphodegron could be formed <italic>in vivo</italic> in the absence of a phosphorylated S23 residue, UNG2-EYFP and the phospho-negative mutant UNG2 S23A-EYFP were expressed in HeLa. 2D western analysis of total cell extracts using GFP antibodies revealed increased accumulation of the unphosphorylated proteins relative to that observed for endogeneous UNG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>). Moreover, WT UNG2-EYFP appeared to harbour a fourth and not yet identified phosphorylation. Nevertheless, UNG2 S23A-EYFP lacked only one of the phosphorylations observed in the unmutated protein, indicating that phosphorylation of S23 is not essential for phosphorylation at the T60 and S64 positions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phosphorylation of UNG2 at S23, T60 and S64 is cell cycle regulated and directs ubiquitinylation and proteolytic breakdown in late S/G2</title><p>UNG2 is several fold upregulated during late G1 and early S phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Slupphaug <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Haug <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Fischer <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). To investigate whether the UNG2 phosphorylations were also cell cycle regulated, HeLa cells were synchronised at the G1/S border by double thymidine block, and analysed at defined time points after release. Analysis of total cellular UNG2 by 1D PAGE and western analysis demonstrated maximum UNG2 protein in early S phase, while a pronounced reduction at the protein level was observed in late S and G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, separation of the proteins by 2D PAGE revealed a marked shift in the relative amounts of each of the UNG2 phosphoforms through the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). In early S (3 h), the un- and monophosphorylated forms of UNG2 dominate. Towards the end of S (6 h), the relative amount of the di- and triphosphorylated forms increases, while in late G2 (9 h) the latter forms dominate over the un- and monophosphorylated forms. Entry into the next G1 (12 h) is accompanied by reappearance of the un- and monophosphorylated forms, and the cycle is repeated (15&#x02013;21 h). The cell cycle data are summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>. Notably, the triphosphorylated form 4 increases in late S, and peaks in G2 concomitantly with the appearance of a fifth form of UNG2 (marked with an asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref> at 9 h) of higher molecular weight (HMW). Although the total UNG2 level in the cells is very low in G2, this HMW form dominates in late G2. The order of appearance of the HMW form suggests that it is generated by further modification of the triple-phosphorylated form 4. This is also supported by the migration in 2D PAGE of the HMW form relative to the triple-phosphorylated form 4, corresponding to an MW and pI shift that would be expected from a mono-ubiquitinylated form 4 UNG2. Ubiquitinylation of UNG2 has previously been reported to induce proteasome-mediated degradation of UNG2 in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Fischer <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). To further analyse the nature of the HMW form, western blots from 2D gels were doubly labelled with polyclonal anti-UNG PU059 and monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibodies prior to incubation with both Cy3- and Cy5-labelled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). A strong signal was obtained with both Cy3 and Cy5 over the HMW form of UNG2, strongly supporting that this form is mono-ubiquitinylated and triply phosphorylated UNG2. Notably, in contrast to UNG2 forms 1&#x02013;4, ubiquitinylated UNG2 could not be immunoprecipitated from cell extracts using anti-UNG PU059 antibodies. UNG2 was also not accessible when ubiquitin was targeted for immunoprecipitation, indicating that this form is unstable or transient in nature, or that affinity capture is hampered by ubiquitin or by other proteins binding to UNG2.</p><p>The doubly phosphorylated pT380/pS384 degron in cyclin E was recently demonstrated to be an optimal, high-affinity degron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Hao <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). To investigate whether the corresponding sequence in UNG2 also constitutes a degron, UNG2 T60 and S64 were mutated to alanine, and expressed as EYFP fusions in HeLa. The concentrations of the transfection constructs were reduced to avoid too high expression of the fusion proteins and saturation of the UNG2 processing machinery. The cells were co-transfected with ECFP as an internal standard to correct for potential differences in transfection efficiency. Subsequent to western analysis of total cell lysates using GFP antibodies, the Ala mutants were all detectable at 2.5- to 3-fold higher levels compared to WT UNG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results strongly indicate that the sequence encompassing T60 and S64 in UNG2 constitutes a phosphodegron.</p><p>Finally, to investigate whether specific phosphoforms of UNG2 were poorly extracted by our procedure, pellets remaining after the first extraction step were sonicated in high salt buffer to release proteins strongly binding to chromatin. This consistently revealed small amounts of unphosphorylated (form 1) and S23-phosphorylated (form 2) UNG2 that were not extracted in buffer containing 200 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>, right panels). Moreover, which of these two forms were most tightly associated with chromatin appeared to be dependent on the cell cycle stage. Thus, outside the S phase, unphosphorylated UNG2 was retained more in the chromatin relative to UNG2 p-S23, while in S phase a more selective binding of UNG2 p-S23 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>, arrows). These results indicate that S23-phosphorylated UNG2 has an increased affinity for replicating chromatin relative to the other UNG2 forms.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phosphomimicking mutations in the UNG2 regulatory domain modulate catalytic activity and association with RPA</title><p>To analyse functional implications of the observed UNG2 phosphorylations, each of the phosphoforms were mimicked by mutation of the corresponding Ser/Thr residues to Asp, and purified to apparent homogeneity (S23A and S23A/T60A/S64A were included as controls) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). The first attempts to purify the triple phosphomimicking UNG2 S23D/T60D/S64D as well as a UNG2 S64D mutant resulted in catalytically impaired proteins. However, by reducing the sonication energy during bacterial lysis, and performing all steps during purification on ice (including the Talon column step), we obtained fully active proteins. These findings indicate that a negative charge introduced at residue 64 in the UNG2 N-terminus introduces a local structural instability in the protein that may be of functional relevance, and further studies are now underway to determine the overall structural change in UNG2 following S64D mutation.</p><p>Interestingly, an overall increase in enzymatic activity was observed with the phosphomimicking mutants relative to WT, and the increase was most pronounced with ssDNA substrate. The increase was less pronounced with the Ala mutants, demonstrating that introduction of negative charges at the distinct positions in the UNG2 regulatory domain specifically stimulates the activity of UNG2. To analyse the activity stimulation in more detail, the phosphomimicking mutants were subjected to kinetic analyses. These analyses revealed that the mutations had a mixed effect upon affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) and turnover (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) of UNG2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). In general, the introduced negative charges mediated a marked increase in the catalytic turnover against both types of substrate, although also accompanied by a somewhat increased <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>. Notably, the single S23D mutation resembling the dominant S-phase phosphoform of UNG2 increased the catalytic turnover about two- and three-fold relative to WT against dsDNA and ssDNA substrates, respectively. Increased catalytic turnover could be of biological significance to optimise uracil excision at rapidly moving replication forks. Additional mutation of T60 and S64 mediated somewhat reduced catalytic turnover compared to the single S23D mutant. The primary function of these phosphorylations is thus likely to form a functional phosphodegron, although specific functions in uracil processing cannot be excluded.</p><p>To test whether phosphomimicking mutations affected binding to PCNA and/or RPA, purified UNG2 proteins were incubated with extracts from UNG-deficient human B-cell lines derived from hyper-IgM patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Imai <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kavli <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), immunoprecipitated using PU059 and analysed for coprecipitation of PCNA and RPA. Binding of UNG2 to PCNA was not markedly influenced by any of the mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). This was also supported by activity analyses of the UNG2 proteins in the presence of PCNA, in which a two-fold stimulation of all the UNG2 forms was observed (data not shown).</p><p>Conversely, the binding of UNG2 to RPA was markedly and differentially affected by the mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). Notably, the S23D mutation mediated a moderate but consistent increase in the binding of UNG2 to RPA in agreement with preferential binding of monophosphorylated UNG2 P-S23 to chromatin in S-phase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>). A similar increase in RPA binding of the S23A mutant suggests that alterations of the local UNG2 secondary structure, rather than the specific charge mediate increased binding. The additional T60D and S64D mutations mediated progressive loss of RPA binding, and the triple S23D/T60D/S64D mutant retained only about 40&#x00025; of the RPA-binding capacity relative to WT UNG2. Importantly, a corresponding loss was not observed with the triple Ala mutant, indicating that the negative charge in the putative phosphodegron mediates reduced RPA binding. In the solution NMR structure of the UNG2 peptide encompassing residues 73&#x02013;88 bound to the RPA32 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Mer <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), the UNG2 peptide adopts a helical structure upon binding to RPA32. Here, interaction of three arginines in UNG2 with four acidic residues in RPA32 contributes to the binding. Our results indicate that the region of UNG2 encompassing residues T60 and S64 may also contact RPA32, and that phosphorylation of these residues may contribute repulsive forces between the two proteins.</p><p>Given the high local concentration and crucial importance of RPA near the replication fork (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Fanning <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), the above findings prompted us to investigate if the presence of RPA modulated the kinetic properties of the UNG2 proteins. Whereas RPA stimulated catalytic turnover of WT UNG2 turnover against ssDNA substrate, the three phosphomimicking mutants displayed reduced turnover (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). Nevertheless, the S23D mutant still maintained the highest turnover among the four proteins. Conversely, RPA mediated a larger increase in the affinity (lowered <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) of the phosphomimicking mutants against ssDNA substrate, compared to WT.</p><p>Given the markedly reduced binding of UNG2 S23D/T60D/S64D to RPA, we wanted to investigate whether the phosphorylation status of UNG2 affected its localisation to replication foci. WT UNG2, phosphomimicking mutants as well as phosphoinhibiting (Ala) mutants were thus transiently expressed in HeLa cells as EYFP fusion proteins together with ECFP-PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>). The intracellular localisation of UNG2-EYFP, UNG2 S23D/T60D/S64D-EYFP and UNG2 S23A/T60A/S64A-EYFP together with ECFP-PCNA is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>. Notably, the subcellular localisation of the mutants in replication foci was not altered compared to WT UNG2. Identical results were obtained subsequent to transfection with single (S23) and double (S23/T60) mutants to Asp/Ala (data not shown). Thus, the overall localisation of UNG2 to nuclei and replication foci is apparently not directly controlled by cell cycle-regulated N-terminal phosphorylations. This is in accordance with the fully competent PCNA binding of the phosphomimicking mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>), which likely contributes to their localisation in replication foci. No overt reduction in the overall level of the triple phosphomimicking mutant could be observed. However, this likely reflects that under conditions of overexpression, the specific ubiquitinylation apparatus becomes saturated. Alternatively, phosphomimicking mutants cannot directly substitute phosphoserines or phosphothreonines in the contact of the docking site to the ubiquitin ligase.</p><p>Finally, it should be mentioned that we have not been able to produce stably transfected HeLa cell lines producing UNG2 under the strong CMV promoter, whereas we have successfully produced such a cell line producing UNG2 under it own cell cycle-regulated promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kavli <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) and under an inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Akbari <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). However, induction of high UNG2 expression results in an increased fraction of cells in the S/G2 stage of the cell cycle compared with the control cell line (data not shown). This underscores that tightly regulated expression of UNG2 is of vital importance for the cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> phosphorylation of UNG2 by cyclin-dependent kinases stimulates UNG2 catalytic activity</title><p>Both their regulation in the cell cycle and their position immediately N-terminus to prolines in the primary amino-acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>) indicate that the N-terminal UNG2 phosphorylation sites may be targeted by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). To investigate this in more detail, we first reprobed 2D western blots of UNG2 immunoprecipitates using CDK1 and CDK2 antibodies. Of these, CDK2 was clearly identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). We then tested the effect of the CDK inhibitors olomoucine and roscovitine on the phosphorylation pattern of UNG2. However, since this treatment also affected the distribution of cells in the cell cycle, the results could not be interpreted in terms of direct effects of individual CDKs on UNG2 activity (data not shown). As an alternative approach, we investigated the ability of four active CDK/cyclin pairs to phosphorylate UNG2 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Of these, CDK4/cyclin D1/D3 is active in G1, CDK2/cyclin E in late G1/S, CDK2/cyclin A in late S/G2 and CDK1/cyclin B in M. When UNG2 was subjected to <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation by either of these sets of CDK/cyclins, multiple phosphorylated forms of UNG2 were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). Mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the &#x02018;early' CDK4/cyclin D and CDK2/cyclin E kinases were able to phosphorylate all three UNG2 Ser/Thr residues observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (only CDK2/cyclin E shown). Of these, only S64 was phosphorylated by the &#x02018;late' CDK2/cyclin A and CDK1/cyclin B kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>, upper panels) in agreement with the accumulation of this phosphorylation in G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, (unspecific) phosphorylation by all kinases was observed at S12 and S14. To avoid interference from phosphorylations at these residues, an S12A/S14A mutant was purified and subjected to <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation by the above kinases. This yielded the same pattern of phosphorylations as in WT UNG2, except at the mutated sites. PCNA was also added in parallel reactions since PCNA has been shown to act as a connector to target CDK/cyclins to specific DNA replication proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Koundrioukoff <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). No change in the phosphorylation pattern was observed in the presence of PCNA (data not shown). Although differential quantification of the phosphorylations was not possible by our analyses, the results indicate an overlapping function of the various CDK/cyclins in the cell cycle regulation of UNG2.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>, phosphorylation by each of the kinases mediated a significant (20&#x02013;30&#x00025;) increase in UNG2 activity. Although these analyses did not allow quantification of the precise activity of each of the true UNG2 phosphoforms as observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, the results clearly demonstrate that phosphorylation of the N-terminal regulatory domain stimulates the catalytic activity of UNG2, in support of the results from phosphomimicking mutants.</p><p>Finally, the activity increase observed in the phosphomimicking mutants was corroborated by phosphatase treatment of HeLa cell extracts. When total extracts from cells in G1/S phase were subjected to dephosphorylation using calf intestine phosphatase, the total UDG activity was reduced by about 25&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>). In this extract, the p-S23 form of UNG2 is the quantitatively dominating form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>; 0 h) and the major part of the activity reduction is likely attributed to dephosphorylation of this form. However, the actual reduction in UNG2 p-S23 activity is likely higher, since the cell extracts also contain appreciable amounts of non-phosphorylated UNG1, which would remain unaffected by the phosphatase treatment. In summary, the <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation and the phosphatase experiments strongly support that UNG2 phosphomimicking mutants are valid models for studying the functional consequences of <italic>in vivo</italic> UNG phosphorylation.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that phosphorylation of DNA base excision repair proteins plays a key role in fine tuning of DNA repair as well as in coordination of DNA repair with other cellular processes such as DNA replication (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Fan and Wilson, 2005</xref>). However, the precise phosphoforms of the proteins existing <italic>in vivo</italic>, the kinases involved and the functional implications of the phosphorylations in BER, remain poorly understood for most BER proteins.</p><p>Here, we present the first precise identification of three cell cycle-regulated phosphoforms of UNG2, and provide evidence that these may be generated by distinct CDK/cyclins. Moreover, the phosphorylations regulate cellular turnover of the UNG2 protein, association with RPA and modulates catalytic activity. Ubiquitin-dependent breakdown of UNG2 observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Fischer <italic>et al</italic> (2004)</xref> and their finding that breakdown is inhibited by the CDK inhibitor roscovitine is corroborated by our results. We furthermore find that the maximum level of apparently mono-ubiquitinylated and triple-phosphorylated form of UNG2 occurs in G2, concomitantly with the lowest level of total UNG2. This, the migration in 2D gels of ubiquitinylated UNG2 relative to triple-phosphorylated UNG2, and the increased cellular accumulation of the S64A-containing mutants in the putative phosphodegron, strongly indicate that the triple-phosphorylated protein serves as a precursor for ubiquitinylation and breakdown in late S/G2. Interestingly, very recent work from the laboratory of Primo Sch&#x000e4;r has demonstrated that TDG, another member of the UDG superfamily, is downregulated upon entry of the S phase and upregulated in G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Hardeland <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). This inverse regulation of UNG2 and TDG implies that the two uracil-DNA glycosylases have non-redundant functions that must be coordinated through the cell cycle. Apparently, the presence of TDG in the S phase is incompatible with cell cycle progression and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Hardeland <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). One potential explanation for this is the exceptional strong binding of TDG to product AP sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Waters <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>) that could obstruct replication. It is less clear however, why UNG2 is degraded in late S/G2, since deamination of cytosine to uracil also is likely to occur during G2. One clue might come from our recent findings that removal of uracil at <italic>Xenopus</italic> centromeres apparently mediates loading of CENP-A, a central component in kinetochore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Zeitlin <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Although speculative, it is possible that a strictly regulated level of UNG2, or specific phosphoforms of UNG2, may be necessary to confine uracil excision to centromere regions during G2. Alternatively, the cellular level of UNG2 is reduced during G2 to allow temporary persistence of deaminated cytosines serving as initiator sites for CENP-A loading.</p><p>The increase in the UNG2 catalytic activity subsequent to phosphorylation by CDK/cyclins may be of special functional importance, since UNG2 attached to the replication machinery should be able to cope with the speed of the replication fork to efficiently recognise and remove uracils. Association of UNG2 to PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Otterlei <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>) and the doubling of the catalytic turnover of monophosphorylated relative to WT UNG2 against dsDNA likely support rapid removal of misincorporated uracil (U:A) from the newly synthesised strand. Conversely, virtually nothing is known about uracil processing in the single-stranded DNA region in front of the replicative polymerase. Deamination of cytosine occurs 200- to 300-fold faster in ssDNA than in dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Lindahl, 1993</xref>), and likely poses a significant mutagenic threat when occurring immediately in front of the replicative polymerases. Increased binding of monophosphorylated (p-S23) UNG2 to RPA during S phase, concomitant with markedly (three-fold) increased catalytic turnover against single-stranded uracils conform with a role of UNG2 in prereplicative removal of uracil. It is less clear if the di- and triphosphorylated forms of UNG2 possess additional functional characteristics that aid replicative uracil removal. Rather, we hypothesise that the main function of these phosphorylations is to create a phosphodegron that initiates ubiquitinylation. This is also supported by the reduced binding of the fully phosphorylated UNG2 to RPA, that likely release UNG2 and facilitates recognition by an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It can furthermore not be excluded that ubiquitinylation may be regulated by additional factors than mere phosphorylation status. One possibility is that fully phosphorylated UNG2 released from chromatin upon termination of replication forks is targeted for ubiquitinylation. Alternatively, PCNA may serve as an adaptor for UNG2 ubiquitinylation, since the PCNA-binding capacity of UNG2 is retained in the phosphomimicking mutants. PCNA-dependent ubiquitinylation and proteolysis were recently reported for the <italic>Xenopus</italic> replication licensing factor Cdt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Arias and Walter, 2006</xref>). Notably, Cdt1 binds to PCNA via the same conserved PCNA-binding motif as in UNG2. Work is now in progress to identify the E3 ligase responsible for UNG2 ubiquitinylation. This work may shed new light upon the mechanisms underlying UNG2 protein turnover during the cell cycle, and the potential consequences of dysregulated turnover.</p><p>In activated B cells, excision of AID-deaminated cytosines from the template strand of the replication fork was recently proposed to act as a specific trigger of translesion synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Di Noia <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). This could explain the mutagenic outcome of uracil excision rather than faithful repair. However, it is not clear why such translesion synthesis across AP sites should be triggered in activated B cells and not in other replicating cells. Given the results presented here, the role of distinct functional modifications of UNG2 in activated B cells should provide an attractive area for future investigations.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reagents</title><p>Primary antibodies were PU059 recognising the catalytic domain of UNG2 (0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml), anti-RPA (Abcam ab2175), anti-PCNA (Abcam ab29), anti-actin (Abcam ab8226), anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz sc-8017), anti-CDK1 (Santa Cruz sc-747), anti-CDK2 (Santa Cruz sc-748) and anti-GFP (prepared in-house).

Individual residues are coloured according to ClustalX colour coding. Highest degree of conservation is observed in the regions corresponding to the PCNA- and RPA-binding motifs of hUNG2. Among the serines and threonines outside these motifs, S23, T60 and S64 are the most conserved. The boxed sequences in (D) illustrate phosphodegrons in other human proteins, which share sequence homology to UNG2. (<bold>E</bold>) Phosphorylation of T60/S64 may occur in the absence of S23 phosphorylation.

(<bold>E</bold>) Phosphoinhibiting (S/T &#x02192; A) mutations in the putative UNG2 phosphodegron result in increased cellular accumulation of UNG2. HeLa cells were transfected with pUNG2-EYFP and phosphoinhibiting mutants thereof in the putative phosphodegron.
