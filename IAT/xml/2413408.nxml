In this study, DN, DP and SP precursors appeared to be normally represented in <italic>Pbx1NT</italic> TG mice. However, further analysis of DN subpopulations revealed an increase of DN3 and DN4 subpopulations best explained by the higher <italic>in vivo</italic> proliferation rate of DN2 and DN4 TG subpopulations. Thus the accumulation of DN cell subsets closely resembles the one found in the <italic>Prep1<sup>i/i</sup></italic> mice, in which the higher rate of DN cell proliferation was not revealed, possibly because of the further differentiation defects. In spite of the increased number of proliferating DN2 and DN4 precursors, the total number of DN cells was comparable in <italic>Pbx1NT</italic> TG and wt littermates, and normal T cell development appeared to be preserved at later stages. This is best explained by the observation that <italic>Pbx1NT</italic> TG DN thymocytes had a higher propensity to undergo cell death when compared to control cells. Thus a higher rate of cell proliferation, and of cell death might account for the transient developmental defects observed in <italic>Pbx1NT</italic> TG mice. The Prep1 dependent molecular events underlying these events remain to be fully elucidated.</p><p>The thymic and peripheral immune phenotypes of <italic>Pbx1NT</italic> TG and <italic>Prep1<sup>i/i</sup></italic> mice were not completely overlapping, although in either case Prep1-dependent DNA binding activity was absent. In particular, while earlier stages of thymic development were impaired in both <italic>Prep1<sup>i/i</sup></italic> hypomorphic and <italic>Pbx1NT</italic> TG mice, thymocyte maturation beyond the DN stage was normal in <italic>Pbx1NT</italic> mice but not in <italic>Prep1<sup>i/i</sup></italic> hypomorphic mice. Furthermore, while the number of mature T cells was significantly reduced in <italic>Prep1<sup>i/i</sup></italic> hypomorphic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002424-Penkov1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, it was normal in <italic>Pbx1NT</italic> mice. The reasons for the diversities could be explained by the fact that the <italic>Pbx1NT</italic> transgene is controlled by the proximal Lck promoter, which might be less active in mature T cells. However, we found that <italic>Pbx1NT</italic> expression was detectable in the periphery. It is important to point out that in <italic>Prep1<sup>i/i</sup></italic> hypomorphic mice <italic>Prep1</italic> expression was reduced to a very low level in all cellular compartments, while in <italic>Pbx1NT</italic> TG mice Prep1 representation was reduced in the nucleus, but not in the cytoplasm. Thus while genetic inactivation of the <italic>Prep1</italic> gene might abrogate Prep1 (and Pbx2) transcriptional activity, the functional sequestration of the protein might favor some unknown cytoplasmic functions. We thus favor the possibility that Prep1 plays multiple roles during maturation and/or that nuclear and cytoplasmic Prep1 have different functions.</p><p>As in the case of <italic>Prep1</italic> hypomorphic mice, functional inactivation of Prep1 (by cytosolic sequestration) caused a reduction in the levels of Pbx2 protein. This was likely due to a reduction of protein stability, as comparable Pbx2 mRNA levels were found, and possibly due to increased proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002424-Longobardi1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The finding that Pbx2 was reduced to comparable extents in <italic>Pbx1NT</italic> and <italic>Prep1<sup>i/i</sup></italic> hypomorphic mice, which only share some of the abnormalities of thymic development, suggests that Prep1 and Pbx2 might have non redundant roles and/or Prep1 might exert a Pbx2-independent function in determining the T cell fate.</p><p>How Prep1, Pbx2 and/or Prep1/Pbx2 dimers control early stages of T cell development remains to be elucidated. We found that surface expression of the pre-TCR and the intracellular expression of the TCR&#x003b2; are normal in <italic>Pbx1NT</italic> TG thymocytes. Thus, these transcription factors do not seem to participate to early T cell commitment. However, they might be targeted by pre-TCR-driven events. Accordingly, both proliferation and survival of developing thymocytes appeared to be altered in the absence of functional Prep1 and/or Pbx2. It is also possible that Prep1 and/or Pbx2 control IL-7 responsiveness, the most important pro-survival cytokine at DN2 stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002424-Pallard1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002424-Barata1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Alternatively, Prep1 may play a role at some steps immediately downstream of IL-7 activation.</p><p>In conclusion, our data complement the analysis of <italic>Prep1</italic> hypomorphic mice, and further support a role for Prep1 and/or Pbx2 in determining T cell fate.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0002424-Moens1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moens</surname><given-names>CB</given-names></name><name><surname>Selleri</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><year>2006</year><article-title>Hox cofactors in vertebrate development.</article-title><source>Dev.
