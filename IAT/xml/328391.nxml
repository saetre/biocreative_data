The presence of L factor caused no detectable abnormalities to the plasmid-bearing cells. We determined the total DNA sequence of the L factor I (and a part of L factor II) and compared it with that of polyoma DNA. Both DNA are common to the general construction of DNA frames such as early, late and noncoding regions, suggesting the two to be closely related. On the other hand, the L factor DNA sequences differ substantially from that of polyoma in the DNA sequences corresponding to the polyoma large T antigen, capsid proteins and a portion of the enhancer region. In order to investigate the mechanism of plasmid establishment of L factor, we compared the enhancer activity, capacity of DNA replication and efficiency of plasmid establishment of L factor with those of polyoma. The results indicate that L factor enhancer activity and DNA replication capacity were considerably lower than those of polyoma, suggesting that these altered (lowered) activities associated with L factor contribute to the plasmidal establishment and stable maintenance of L factor.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0152-a" xlink:role="3636"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0153-a" xlink:role="3637"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0153-b" xlink:role="3637"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0154-a" xlink:role="3638"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0154-b" xlink:role="3638"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3633"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3634"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0151.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3635"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0152.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3636"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0153.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3637"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0154.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3638"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0155.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3639"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
