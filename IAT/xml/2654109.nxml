It was previously reported that this &#x0201c;cryptic&#x0201d; transcription occurs preferentially in long genes, and in genes that are infrequently transcribed. Here, we mapped the transcripts produced in an <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain lacking Set2, and applied rigorous statistical methods to identify sites of cryptic transcription at high resolution. We find that suppression of cryptic transcription occurs independent of gene length or transcriptional frequency. Our conclusions differ with those reported previously because we obtained a higher-resolution dataset, we accounted for the fact that gene length and transcriptional frequency are not independent variables, and we accounted for several ascertainment biases that make cryptic transcription easier to detect in long, infrequently transcribed genes. These new results and conclusions have implications for many commonly used genomic analysis approaches, and for the evolution of high-fidelity RNA polymerase II transcriptional initiation in eukaryotes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A primary function of eukaryotic genomes is to serve as the template for RNA transcripts that encode proteins.

When Set2 or other components of this process are disabled, inappropriate transcripts arise from within coding regions. The origin and potential function of these cryptic initiation sites has been the subject of intense investigation. One foundational study concluded that &#x0201c;cryptic&#x0201d; transcription occurs preferentially in long genes and in genes that are infrequently transcribed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Li2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. These conclusions suggest that particular gene types are more dependent on the Set2/Rpd3S pathway for their function than others. If true, this conclusion would imply that this class of genes is under a special selective pressure to suppress cryptic transcription, with potentially wide-ranging implications for the evolution of eukaryotic genomes. Here, we performed new experiments to re-examine the findings of earlier studies. We conclude that the &#x0201c;cryptic&#x0201d; transcription normally suppressed by the Set2/Rpd3S pathway occurs throughout the genome and does not appear to be associated either positively or negatively with gene length or transcriptional frequency.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Systematic ascertainment bias in previous characterizations of cryptic transcription may have influenced data analysis</title><p>It has been reported that longer genes, and genes that are infrequently transcribed, are particularly dependent on a mechanism of chromatin-mediated protection against cryptic transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Li2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. To identify genes that relied on the Set2/Rpd3S pathway to suppress cryptic transcription, Li <italic>et al.</italic> directly compared RNA prepared from <italic>set2&#x00394;</italic> and wild-type strains using DNA microarrays. The authors then predicted the occurrence of cryptic transcripts by comparing the ratio of probe values measured at the 5&#x02032; end of the gene to the ratio of probe values at the 3&#x02032; end of the gene. A higher ratio at the 3&#x02032; end indicated an aberrant transcript that initiated somewhere downstream of the natural 5&#x02032; promoter. Based on the set of genes identified in this manner, it was concluded that cryptic transcription occurs preferentially in long genes, and in genes that are infrequently transcribed.</p><p>However, the previous experiments and analyses did not account for several important factors in collecting and analyzing the data. First, if cryptic transcription occurs at random along the genome, then it is more likely to occur in longer genes. Second, by the same reasoning, longer genes are more likely to contain multiple cryptic initiation sites. This would make microarray detection of cryptic initiation easier for longer genes, especially when the number of probes per gene is low, because multiple initiation events may be detected and interpreted as a single event. Third, a cryptic initiation event that is flanked on either side by a larger number of microarray probes, as occurs in longer genes, will be easier to detect because more measurements are taken on either side of the initiation event. Finally, cryptic transcription is inherently easier to detect on genes that are transcribed at low levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Cheung1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Consider two equally-sized genes, both of which have a cryptic promoter in the same position along the gene. In both cases, assume that cryptic promoter produces 5 mRNAs per hour. However, one of the genes is transcribed from its natural promoter at 1 mRNA per hour, and the other is transcribed at 50 mRNAs per hour. Assuming equal mRNA stabilities, the ratio produced at the 3&#x02032; end by the cryptic transcript of the highly expressed gene will be 55/50&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.1, while the ratio at the 3&#x02032; end of the infrequently transcribed gene will be 6/1&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6. Therefore cryptic transcription that occurs in frequently transcribed genes (ratio 1.1) is much more difficult to detect than a cryptic promoter of equal strength from an infrequently transcribed gene (ratio 6). This would be especially true if the level of transcription at a given cryptic promoter is generally independent of the level of transcription from the natural promoter, as appears to be the case <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Carrozza1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Given these potential biases, we were motivated to revisit the previous experiments with a higher-resolution detection platform, and to develop an analysis method that explicitly accounted for the confounding factors described above.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>At the level of raw data, new higher-resolution maps of Set2-dependent cryptic initiation are consistent with previous maps</title><p>As in the previous study, we prepared RNA from <italic>set2&#x00394;</italic> and wild-type strains, and labeled them for direct comparison through microarray hybridization (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><bold>Methods</bold></xref>). In our case, the samples were applied to DNA microarrays containing 385,000 probes, which corresponds to an average start-to-start probe spacing of 31 bp, and an average of 51 probes per open reading frame (ORF). In the previous experiments, the arrays contained 40,174 probes, which corresponds to an average start-to-start spacing of 261 bp and an average of 4.6 probes per ORF. The higher resolution in the new study is critical: in the previous study 676 ORFs contained only a single probe, meaning that it was impossible to detect cryptic transcription in those genes, and 983 contained only two probes, meaning a call would be dependent on the value from a single probe. The higher resolution of our data afforded us the opportunity to call multiple cryptic initiation events within a single gene, rather than being limited to identifying genes in which one or more initiation events may have occurred. We therefore employed a statistically principled change-point detection algorithm to identify the step-like transitions in the log intensity ratios across a transcription unit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Bai1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. These &#x0201c;transitions&#x0201d; represent putative cryptic initiation events.</p><p>The algorithm operates on a gene-by-gene basis, and in a sequential fashion to detect the existence and location of potential cryptic initiation events. At each probe within a gene, it compares the measured values (Z-scores) to the left and the right of the probe using a standard F-test. If the maximum F-statistic along the gene exceeds a pre-defined significance threshold (for the given gene length), the location at which the maximum is achieved is identified as a transition point. The search procedure is then recursively applied to the observations lying to the left and to the right of the transition point. Further details of the algorithm and the scaled <italic>supF</italic> statistic are presented in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><bold>Methods</bold></xref>.</p><p>We selected two significance thresholds which led to family-wise error rates of roughly 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup> and 10<sup>&#x02212;26</sup>, and identified 1193 and 429 genes, respectively, with at least one cryptic initiation event (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004886.s001"><bold>Table S1</bold></xref>). Individual genes identified by the algorithm as containing cryptic initiation events typically exhibit internal transitions that are clear by visual inspection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004886-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>).

Thus in small genes, which are represented by fewer probes, transitions are more difficult to detect. We wondered if this ascertainment bias might explain the observed higher rate of cryptic transcript detection in longer genes. To investigate this, we took all of the cryptic initiation sites we detected, and computationally reduced the number of probes surrounding each transition. In each case, this was accomplished by examining a shrinking window centered on each transition point. Despite these transitions being called significant when the full gene length is used, when the shrinking window was applied, statistical confidence was reduced, often below our selected cutoffs, as the window size approached 500 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004886-g002"><bold>Figure 2B&#x02013;2E</bold></xref>).</p><p>We conclude that our method, and indeed any statistically-principled method for cryptic initiation analysis using discrete expression-based probes, can more readily identify sites of cryptic initiation in long genes, where more probes flank every putative site.

To test this, for each gene over 500 bp in length, we artificially broke that gene into as many non-redundant approximately 500 bp &#x0201c;subgenes&#x0201d; as possible (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><bold>Methods</bold></xref>). We then re-ran our detection algorithm on these newly created &#x0201c;subgenes&#x0201d;, which were of relatively uniform length. To see if longer genes really harbored more cryptic initiation events, we computationally stitched the genes back together, binned the genes according to their length, and again calculated the rate of cryptic initiations per base. This treatment of the data holds constant both the probe-number bias and the bias caused by multiple cryptic initiations in the same gene, both of which favor detection of cryptic initiation events in longer genes. We found that after this treatment, long genes no longer harbor more cryptic initiation events. Indeed, they may harbor fewer cryptic initiation events per unit length (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004886-g002"><bold>Figures 2A and 2F</bold></xref>). Therefore, controlling ascertainment biases inherent in transcript-based detection by microarray eliminated the relationship between the occurrence of cryptic initiation events and gene length.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sites of cryptic initiation are distributed randomly with regard to gene length</title><p>Our analysis of cryptic initiation events is consistent with such events being distributed throughout transcription units without respect to their length. To test this hypothesis, we assigned each detected transition at random to an ORF probe, and compared several features of the randomly assigned transitions to these same features under the observed (not randomized) transition locations. As was the case with the observed locations, and as expected, when transitions were randomly distributed, longer genes contained more transitions. However, when the transition rate <italic>per base</italic> was calculated using the random assignments, there is no relationship between transition rate and length, which is nearly identical to what we observe with real data when the cryptic initiation calls are made using uniform-length subgenes, which control probe-number ascertainment bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004886-g002"><bold>Figure 2G</bold></xref>; compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004886-g002"><bold>Figure 2F</bold></xref>). The fact that randomly assigned transitions, which do not depend on a detection algorithm, so closely mimic the observations made with real data when length biases are controlled, strongly suggests that real cryptic initiation events are distributed randomly in relation to gene length.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Sites of cryptic initiation are distributed randomly with regard to transcription rate</title><p>Previous studies reported that infrequently transcribed genes are especially prone to cryptic initiation events in the absence of Set2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Li2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as has been noted by others, gene length and transcription rate are not independent variables <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Rao1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Holstege1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In particular, long genes tend to be transcribed less frequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004886-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). We sought to determine if any relationship between transcription rate and cryptic initiation rate remained after controlling for ascertainment biases due to gene length. First, we binned genes according to their transcription rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Holstege1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, and plotted the number of cryptic initiations per base for each of the bins according to our full-length gene analysis. Consistent with the previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Li2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, we observed an apparent inverse relationship between cryptic initiation rate and transcription rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004886-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>). However, we noted that the plot looked very similar to the relationship between gene length and transcription rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004886-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). Next, we performed the same analysis, but this time using our subgene analysis. As described above, the subgene analysis controls the probe-number bias that favors detection in long genes. With this bias controlled, we now find that more heavily transcribed genes are, if anything, more likely to contain cryptic initiation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004886-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>), in contradiction to the previously reported results. Furthermore, this increased rate of cryptic initiation among highly transcribed genes cannot be accounted for by differences in probe coverage among this class of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004886-g003"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004886-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004886.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Cryptic initiation events occur without regard to transcriptional frequency.</title><p>(A) Infrequently transcribed genes tend to be long.

These biases are exaggerated by the popular &#x0201c;modified average gene analysis&#x0201d; method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Li2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Huarte1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Pokholok1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Li4">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, which unnaturally forces every gene into a unit length, despite variations in real gene length of over an order of magnitude. Not only are such representations of dubious biological relevance, they are also suspect from a statistical standpoint because the number of data points underlying the &#x0201c;modified average gene&#x0201d; vary dramatically depending on real gene length. We are optimistic that technologies such as next-generation DNA sequencing will partially overcome the ascertainment biases we report here, but when transcripts are analyzed, even these approaches will be susceptible to such effects since longer and more frequently transcribed genes will accumulate more sequence reads.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The hypothesis that infrequently transcribed long genes are particularly dependant on the Set2/Rpd3S pathway for accurate transcription is not supported by our data. Instead, our analysis indicates that Set2 suppresses cryptic transcription in wild-type cells across the genome in a manner that is, to first order, independent of gene length and gene frequency. This is a significant conclusion because it is consistent with previous reports that H3K36 methylation levels in yeast are largely independent of transcription rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Rao1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, and because it obviates the need to posit a biological or evolutionary mechanism that accounts for a link between suppression of cryptic transcription and gene length or transcriptional frequency. It appears more likely that cryptic transcripts arise due to chance occurrences of DNA sequences that have the capacity to inappropriately recruit transcription initiation factors, or initiate transcription, for example sequences resembling a TATA box <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Kaplan1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> or nucleosome-excluding elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Anderson1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Ioshikhes1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Segal1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, sites of cryptic transcription could be distributed arbitrarily relative to length and transcription rate, but still represent functional internal promoters that are conditionally active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Cheung1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. While to date there is no evidence of a function for cryptic transcripts in yeast, the use of alternative start sites is extremely widespread in eukaryotic genomes, and it is likely that the Set2/Rpd3S pathway influences the evolution of alternative promoters in more complex eukaryotes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>RNA preparation</title><p>Wild type (BY4741) and <italic>set2&#x00394;</italic> (BY4741) strains were grown at 30&#x000b0;C in YPD (1&#x00025; yeast extract, 2&#x00025; peptone, 2&#x00025; dextrose) to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6&#x02013;0.8.

The algorithm is applied independently to each gene and operates in a sequential fashion. At each probe within a gene, the algorithm compares the average measured probe values (<italic>z</italic> scores) to the left and to the right of the probe using a standard F-statistic. We then calculate the maximum F statistic appearing along the gene, which is known as the <italic>supF</italic> statistic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004886-Andrews1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, and compare a scaled version of this statistic to one of two pre-defined significance thresholds. If the scaled <italic>supF</italic> statistic exceeds a significance threshold, the corresponding location of the observed maximum F-statistic is identified as a cryptic initiation point. The search procedure is then applied separately and independently to the observations lying to the left and to the right of the detected cryptic initiation point. This process of splitting and searching for potential cryptic initiations continues until no significant transition (as judged by the scaled <italic>supF</italic> statistic) can be found in a given interval.</p><p>The number of probes varies greatly across genes, ranging from few to several hundreds. The moderate number of probes for most genes does not allow us to use the asymptotic distribution of the <italic>supF</italic> test statistic. For each gene length <italic>n<sub>g</sub></italic>, we estimated the distribution of the <italic>supF</italic> statistic under the null model of no transition points by calculating the <italic>supF</italic> statistic for 100,000 samples of <italic>n<sub>g</sub></italic> independent standard normal random variables. In many cases the observed <italic>supF</italic> statistic was substantially larger than all 100,000 simulated values. To be able to directly compare the observed <italic>supF</italic> statistics, we divide them by the corresponding 0.1&#x00025; quantile of the simulated distribution. The resulting scaled <italic>supF</italic> statistics have more similar distributions across different gene lengths n<italic><sub>g</sub></italic> under the null model. To achieve higher power and consistent asymptotic properties of the test, we required the cryptic initiation points to be at least &#x003b1;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5&#x00025; of the gene probes apart of each other and the ends of the gene.</p><p>Although the distribution of the scaled <italic>supF</italic> statistic is unknown, we are able to obtain an upper bound for the probability that <italic>supF</italic> is larger than a given number A.

With these thresholds, we identified 1193 and 429 genes respectively with at least one cryptic initiation.
