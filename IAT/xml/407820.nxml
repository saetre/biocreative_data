FMRP contains two K-homology (KH) domains and one RGG box that are landmarks characteristic of RNA-binding proteins. In agreement with this, FMRP associates with messenger ribonucleoparticles (mRNPs) within actively translating ribosomes, and is thought to regulate translation of target mRNAs, including its own transcript. To investigate whether FMRP might chaperone nucleic acid folding and hybridization, we analysed the annealing and strand exchange activities of DNA oligonucleotides and the enhancement of ribozyme-directed RNA substrate cleavage by FMRP and deleted variants relative to canonical nucleic acid chaperones, such as the cellular YB-1/p50 protein and the retroviral nucleocapsid protein HIV-1 NCp7. FMRP was found to possess all the properties of a potent nucleic acid chaperone, requiring the KH motifs and RGG box for optimal activity. These findings suggest that FMRP may regulate translation by acting on RNA&#x02013;RNA interactions and thus on the structural status of mRNAs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of inherited mental retardation in humans resulting from the absence of the FMR1 gene product, the FMR1 protein &#x0005b;fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c2">2</xref>). FMRP is a protein of 632 amino acids composed, in N-terminus to C-terminus order, of a protein-interacting domain (PPId), two K-homology (KH) motifs, a phosphorylation sequence and an RNA recognition sequence called the RGG box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c3">3</xref>). FMRP is widely expressed, but most abundant in testes and brain, which are the organs strongly affected by the syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c5">5</xref>).</p><p>The cellular role of FMRP remains poorly understood and the current view is that it regulates mRNA transport and translation in a manner critical for the development of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c7">7</xref>). To achieve its function, FMRP is thought to be engaged in a number of interactions with cytoplasmic nucleic acid and protein partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c15">15</xref>) in association with messenger ribonucleoparticles (mRNPs) in actively translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c17">17</xref>), however, the exact role of FMRP in translation remains elusive. Several studies have shown that FMRP can act as a negative regulator of translation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c20">20</xref>) and it has been proposed that in neurons a small fraction of FMRP acts as a repressor for the RNA to be transported and to be delivered at the budding dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c20">20</xref>). Indeed, while the great majority of FMRP has been observed in the neuron cell body, a small fraction was detected at distal locations such as neurites, dendrites and synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c22">22</xref>). A series of neuronal mRNAs have been isolated either by immunoprecipitation approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c8">8</xref>), or by the use of a new technique called &#x02018;APRA&#x02019; for antibody positioned RNA amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c24">24</xref>). In addition, several target mRNAs have been isolated by differential display, by oligonucleotide (ODN)-based and by cDNA-SELEX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c26">26</xref>). Also it has been reported that FMRP interacts with small noncoding RNAs such as BC1 and BC200, which in turn mediates their binding to specific mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c27">27</xref>). These observations clearly indicate that FMRP has affinity to RNAs, however, it is not clear whether all these target mRNAs bind directly to FMRP or if FMRP protein interactors are required.</p><p>In view of the binding of FMRP to mRNAs and small non-coding RNAs, we addressed the question as to whether FMRP might be a nucleic acid chaperone protein. So-called nucleic acid chaperones bind in a cooperative manner to one or more nucleic acid molecules and promote the formation of the most stable structure while at the same time preventing folding traps that may preclude function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c29">29</xref>). Importantly, nucleic acid chaperones do not require ATP to function and once the most stable nucleic acid structure is achieved, their continued binding is no longer required to maintain the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c29">29</xref>). Canonical nucleic acid chaperones, such as retroviral NC proteins, are able to anneal, under physiological conditions <italic>in vitro</italic>, a specific primer tRNA to a complementary sequence at the 5&#x02032; end of genomic viral RNA; a prerequisite for the initiation of reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c31">31</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we examined the ability of FMRP to chaperone the annealing of DNA with complementary sequences as well as strand exchange in a duplex nucleic acid structure <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, we investigated whether FMRP is capable of enhancing ribozyme-directed cleavage of an RNA substrate <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our results show that FMRP is a potent chaperone protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Recombinant proteins</title><p>The full-length FMRP and six deleted variants &#x00394;PPId, &#x00394;KH1, &#x00394;KH2, &#x00394;KHT (&#x00394;KH1 plus &#x00394;KH2), &#x00394;PhD and &#x00394;RGG FMRP with a C-terminal (His)6-tag were produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA Probond beads (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol as previously described (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c3">3</xref>).</p><p>HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein NCp7 and mutant NC(12&#x02013;53) were synthesized by the fmoc/opfp chemical method and purified to &#x0003e;98&#x00025; purity by high-pressure liquid chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c30">30</xref>).

HIV-1 NCp7 and its truncated version denoted &#x00394;NC(12&#x02013;53) were synthesized and purified according to a published procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c30">30</xref>).

To confirm that FMRP stably binds nucleic acids and RNA in particular, we examined by native gel electrophoresis the formation of nucleoprotein complexes between FMRP and either tRNA<sup>Lys,3</sup>, BC1 or BC200, at concentrations of 10<sup>&#x02013;8</sup> M. Results of the gel shift experiments show that FMRP binds RNA (Supplementary fig. 1) and clearly has a high affinity for structured RNA molecules such as tRNA<sup>Lys,3</sup> (lanes 2&#x02013;4 A), BC1 RNA (lanes 6&#x02013;8 A) and BC200 RNA (lanes 10&#x02013;12 A) in a manner similar to YB-1/p50 (Supplementary fig. 1E). Under the present ionic conditions, <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> was estimated to be 25 nM. Deletion of the KH motifs caused a strong reduction of FMRP RNA-binding activity (Supplementary fig. 1B).

This effect is not simply due to enhanced molecular crowding, since at the same protein concentration, BSA did not enhance duplex formation (data not shown). Also, the propensity of FMRP to anneal the TAR substrates is not simply a general feature of DNA binding proteins, since at similar concentrations, the single-stranded DNA binding protein T4gp32 was unable to enhance duplex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c37">37</xref> and data not shown).

Indeed, FMRP was able to hybridize the cellular tRNA to the viral RNA (Supplementary fig. 2; lanes 2&#x02013;5).</p></sec><sec><title>FMRP has DNA strand exchange activity</title><p>Another property of nucleic acid chaperones is to direct the formation of the most stable nucleic acid conformation. This can be assayed by examining the strand exchange activity of the protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f3">3</xref>A). An imperfect DNA duplex with two partially complementary ODNs is formed by heating at 62&#x000b0;C. Then, the chaperone is added together with another ODN with the potential to form a perfect duplex with one of the two initial ODNs. After incubation under physiological conditions, the protein is removed and the ratio of the two DNA duplexes, the perfect duplex and the one containing seven mismatches, is assessed by native gel electrophoresis.

Chaperones can enhance the rate of ribozyme cleavage by activating the annealing of the substrate RNA to the hammerhead ribozyme (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f4">4</xref>A, step 1) and the release of the RNA products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f4">4</xref>A, step 3), thus allowing cyclic reuse of the ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c38">38</xref>). The ribozyme cleavage assay intends to investigate whether FMRP enhances ribozyme cleavage of an RNA substrate in a manner similar to NCp7 and hnRNP A1 chaperone proteins (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f4">4</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c38">38</xref>).</p><p>We selected the R3 hammerhead ribozyme and two RNA substrates, namely S14, with a 14 nt substrate ribozyme duplex length (7 nt either side of the cleavage site) and S20, with 10 nt either side of the cleavage site. The above RNA substrates were selected due to their likely biological relevance, as indicated by the similarity of data obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c33">33</xref>). <sup>32</sup>P-labelled RNA S14, the hammerhead ribozyme and FMRP were mixed, incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 25 min, protein removed by phenol extraction and RNA products recovered and analysed by PAGE under denaturing conditions. In the absence of a nucleic acid chaperone, ribozyme-directed cleavage of the RNA substrate occurred slowly at 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f4">4</xref>B, top, lanes 1 at 4&#x000b0;C and 2 at 37&#x000b0;C; <sup>32</sup>P-RNA substrate is S14 and upon cleavage it is &#x00394;S14). In agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c33">33</xref>), HIV-1 NCp7 caused extensive ribozyme-directed cleavage of S14 RNA (lanes 3&#x02013;5). On the other hand, NC(12&#x02013;53) was poorly active (lanes 6&#x02013;8). Interestingly, FMRP showed a clear enhancement of ribozyme-directed cleavage of S14 RNA (lanes 9&#x02013;11). Deleted versions of FMRP, namely &#x00394;PPId and &#x00394;KHT were found to poorly enhance ribozyme-directed cleavage of S14 RNA (lanes 12&#x02013;14 and 15&#x02013;17, respectively). The &#x00394;RGG deleted version of FMRP proved to be &#x0223c;3-fold less active than complete FMRP (lanes 18&#x02013;20).</p><p>Next, we examined the effects of FMRP using RNA substrate S20, which is able to form an extended duplex of 20 nt with the hammerhead ribozyme (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f4">4</xref>A) and which prevents activation of ribozyme cleavage by HIV-1 NCp7 or hnRNP A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c38">38</xref>). In the absence of a chaperone, only minimal ribozyme-directed cleavage of RNA S20 was observed at 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f4">4</xref>B, bottom, lanes 1 and 2) in contrast to what was seen with RNA S14 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f4">4</xref>B, top). NCp7 did not enhance ribozyme cleavage of RNA S20, in agreement with previous data (lanes 3&#x02013;4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c31">31</xref>). FMRP and deleted versions were also found to exhibit very little, if any, enhancing activity using RNA S20 (bottom, lanes 7&#x02013;14).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>FMRP is not only an RNA-binding protein (Supplementary fig. 1), but is also a nucleic acid chaperone, thus providing nucleic acid remodelling properties for this cellular protein. This conclusion is supported by several lines of evidence. FMRP promotes the hybridization of complementary DNAs under low ionic strength conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f2">2</xref>), directs formation of the most stable duplex structure by achieving strand exchange and, once nucleic acid molecules have been refolded into their most stable structure, the protein is no longer required to maintain the structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f3">3</xref>). FMRP enhances ribozyme-directed cleavage of an RNA substrate, most probably by activating substrate RNA annealing to the ribozyme in physiological relevant conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f4">4</xref>). In agreement with these findings, FMRP can promote the hybridization of replication primer tRNA<sup>Lys3</sup> to a complementary sequence at the 5&#x02032; end of the HIV-1 genomic RNA, called the primer binding site (Supplementary fig. 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c35">35</xref>). According to these criteria, FMRP resembles the YB-1/p50 protein, which is a ubiquitous cellular chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c32">32</xref>) bound to mRNPs, involved in mRNA metabolism and in the regulation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c39">39</xref>) including its own transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c40">40</xref>).</p><p>Deleted variants of FMRP, namely, &#x00394;PPId, &#x00394;KH1, &#x00394;KH2, &#x00394;KH1/KH2 (&#x00394;KHT), &#x00394;Phd and &#x00394;RGG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f1">1</xref>), were examined for their ability to activate the annealing of complementary sequences, the strand exchange process and for their ability to enhance ribozyme cleavage of an RNA substrate (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f4">4</xref>). The results of these analyses on the chaperoning properties of the deleted variants of FMRP reveal that all the aforementioned domains are required for full activity. More precisely, deletion of only the PPId domain or the two KH motifs caused the strongest reduction in nucleic acid chaperoning directed by FMRP (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f4">4</xref>). These results suggest that several domains of FMRP may need to simultaneously make contact with a nucleic acid molecule to effectively direct its transconformation, in common with the viral nucleocapsid protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c35">35</xref>). Since the PPId domain is required for full activity, FMRP probably achieves nucleic acid chaperoning when it is in a dimeric form. If two or more RNA/DNA species with complementary sequences are present, binding of FMRP will generate a network of protein&#x02013;nucleic acid and protein&#x02013;protein interactions to induce refolding and hybridization of the RNA/DNA molecules involved (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh535f4">4</xref>).</p><p>FMRP is associated with mRNPs complexes, which shuttle between translating ribosomes and cytoplasmic granules in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c20">20</xref>). The emerging picture proposes that FMRP modulates translation through a network of protein&#x02013;RNA and protein&#x02013;protein interactions. According to our findings, FMRP should also act on mRNA metabolism and translation by means of RNA&#x02013;RNA interactions. These interactions might be under the control of non-coding RNA, as proposed for BC1 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c27">27</xref>), or by causing mRNA dimerization by intermolecular G-quartet formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c15">15</xref>). By analogy with YB-1/p50, a major cellular chaperone associated with mRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c39">39</xref>), it can also be envisioned that a low level of FMRP should stimulate translation, whereas a high level of FMRP should mask the mRNA and hence inhibit its translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c29">29</xref>). In support of this notion, recruitment of FMRP into mRNPs and polyribosomes <italic>in vivo</italic> is abolished upon deletion of either the PPId domain or the KH motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh535c3">3</xref>). Interestingly, these very same domains are important determinants of the nucleic acid chaperoning activities of FMRP <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that FMRP needs all its nucleic acid binding and chaperoning activities to exert its chaperone function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results open new perspectives on the functional role(s) of FMRP in RNA metabolism. Further analyses are required to investigate these functional aspects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_32_7_2129__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_32_7_2129__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh535f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Scheme of the FRMP protein and deleted variants.
