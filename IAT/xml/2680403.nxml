They participate in a variety of cell physiological functions such as metabolism, differentiation, morphogenesis, development and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Large numbers of miRNA have been identified in almost all genetically dissected species including animals, plants, and viruses (miRBase Release 12.0). Experimental evidence implies that miRNAs can regulate tumor susceptibility genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and expression profiling assays have uncovered characteristic miRNA signatures in human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. MicroRNA-induced transcriptional gene silencing through <italic>de novo </italic>DNA methylation or chromatin modification has been demonstrated in yeast and plants[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Although it has been reported that exogenous siRNAs can mediate transcriptional inhibition through promoter methylation in human cells and miRNA could act as a cis-regulator to modulate gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], transcriptional inhibition directed by endogenous small noncoding RNAs remains to be reported.</p><p>Homeobox genes are a group of evolutionarily conserved members that regulate animal morphological diversity at the organismal and evolutionary level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Computational analyses have identified most vertebrate and invertebrate <italic>Hox </italic>genes as putative miRNA targets. It is believed that knowledge about the relationship between <italic>Hox </italic>genes and miRNAs is important for the understanding of the <italic>Hox </italic>gene regulatory mechanism in animal development as well as in tumor invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The human hsa-miR-10a locus maps upstream of <italic>hoxb4 </italic>and the hsa-miR-10b locus is similarly situated in the promoter region of <italic>hoxd4 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). Hsa-miR-10a and hsa-miR-10b deviate in only one nucleotide located at the center of their sequence, and the miR-10 family exhibits strong evolutionary conservation across a number of animal species such as human, mouse, zebrafish, <italic>Drosophila</italic>/fly and chicken (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). The zebrafish miR-10a and miR-10b loci are not always coordinately expressed with their downstream <italic>hox </italic>gene suggesting that they have independent transcriptional initiation systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. When expressed, the primary hsa-miR-10b transcript would be equivalent to a promoter-associated RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] which could be targeted by miR-10a and thereby mediate induction of transcriptional gene silence of the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>locus.

The <italic>hoxd4 </italic>expression is high in MDA-MB-231 cells, but low in MCF-7 cells and MCF10A cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). This expression pattern is similar to that of the adjacent miR-10b locus, and is consistent with the possibility that these two loci are coordinately regulated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). The expression of miR-10a is higher than of miR-10b in MCF7 cells, but lower than the miR-10b expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>), and the expression of miR-10a varies inversely with the expression of <italic>hoxd4 </italic>in all six cell types. This negative correlation indicates that miR-10a might play a role in modulating <italic>hoxd4 </italic>gene expression in these cells. The observation that miRNAs 10a and 10b do not always present similar expression profiles as their adjacent genes resemble similar findings in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and could indicate that under some conditions the miRNAs may be regulated independently of their adjacent <italic>hox </italic>genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c, d</xref>).</p><p>To establish that miR-10a inhibits <italic>hoxd4 </italic>gene expression, we first performed <italic>in vitro </italic>loss-of-function analyses by silencing the miRNA with antisense oligonucleotides and assessing <italic>hoxd4 </italic>gene expression. Quantitative PCR showed that unlike negative control 2'-O-methyl oligos (N.C.) or anti-miR-196a, the transfection of a modified 2'-O-methyl miR-10a antisense oligonucleotide (anti-miR-10a) resulted in a 2-fold increase in <italic>hoxd4 </italic>mRNA levels MDA-MB-231 cells and a 4-fold increase in <italic>hoxd4 </italic>mRNA levels in MCF7 cells(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>). No change was observed in the expression levels of the adjacent <italic>hoxd3 </italic>and <italic>hoxd8 </italic>loci (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref>), indicating that the miR-10a-induced <italic>hoxd4 </italic>gene suppression did not affect other regions on the same chromosome. Nor was there any change in hoxd4 protein expression levels when MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with negative control 2'-O-methyl oligos (N.C.) or anti-miR-196a (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1g</xref>), suggesting the observed increase in <italic>hoxd4 </italic>expression is a specific effect of the endogenous miR-10a.</p></sec><sec><title>MicroRNA-10a decreases <italic>hoxd4 </italic>gene expression through transcriptional inhibition</title><p>To determine whether miR-10a over-expression would influence the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>mRNA expression level, 100 nM miR-10a duplex was transfected into MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). In both cell lines, the result was a five to eight fold decrease in the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>mRNA levels 48 hrs after transfection. Western blot analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells showed that the Hoxd4 protein levels were consistent with the results obtained with qPCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). It has been reported that miR-10a could target the 3'UTR sequence of the <italic>hoxd10 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], but based on current algorithms (miRanda) there are no likely miR-10a target sites in the 3'UTR of the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>mRNA. We assessed the levels of miRNA silencing by cloning the 3'UTRs of these two genes into a luciferase reporter. We found that transfection of 100 nM miR-10a duplexes into MCF7 cells caused a 50% decrease in luciferase activity in the reporter containing the <italic>hoxd10 </italic>3'UTR while no changes was detected in cells expressing the reporter with the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>3'UTR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). However, upstream of the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>transcription initiation site there is a site with near perfect complementarity to the miR-10a sequence. An intriguing question is therefore whether miR-10a could regulate <italic>hoxd4 </italic>gene expression in a transcriptional manner. To establish that the loss of <italic>hoxd4 </italic>expression was due to transcriptional silencing by miR-10a, we carried out nuclear run-on experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). <italic>Hoxd4 </italic>transcription was almost abolished in MCF7 nucleii when treated with miR-10a duplexes, whereas no changes were observed when MCF7 was transfected with the siRNA si<italic>d4 </italic>designed to target the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>mRNA for cleavage. When MCF7 cytoplasmic extracts were treated similarly, both miR-10a and si<italic>d4 </italic>significantly reduced <italic>hoxd4 </italic>mRNA levels, suggesting that the miR-10a induced <italic>hoxd4 </italic>gene downregulation is achieved at the transcriptional level.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>MiR-10a modulates <italic>hoxd4 </italic>gene expression</bold>.

All six cell types showed a similar tendency towards reduced <italic>hoxd4 </italic>expression when transfected with 100 nM miR-10a (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>). To determine which part of the miRNA sequence is most important for the observed effects, we mutated the miR-10a sequence in either the first (or 5'most) five basepairs (G5'), in the middle five basepairs (M), or in the last (or 3'most) five basepairs (G3'), and analyzed the effects of the mutant miR-10a duplexes in MCF7 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f</xref>). Transfection with miR-10a-G5' and miR-10a-M inhibited <italic>hoxd4 </italic>mRNA expression to the same extent as did wildtype miR-10a, however, transfection with miR-10a-G3' produced nearly no inhibition of the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>mRNA expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2g</xref>). These data indicate that miR-10a specifically decrease <italic>hoxd4 </italic>expression through transcriptional inhibition, and suggest that the 3'most portion of miR-10a is most important for this activity.</p></sec><sec><title>MicroRNA-10a-induced transcriptional inhibition of <italic>hoxd4 </italic>is related to promoter-associated ncRNAs</title><p>The human miR-10a and miR-10b sequences deviate in only one nucleotide, and the mature miR-10a could in principle regulate <italic>hoxd4 </italic>by targeting the primary miR-10b transcript. Expression of intergenic ncRNA loci has been shown to influence the expression of other, nearby loci in the human genome, and several noncoding RNAs have been detected upstream of <italic>hoxd4 </italic>locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. To assess whether miRNA-induced transcriptional inhibition of the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>locus depends on the target site being located within a promoter-associated transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], several RNA duplexes complementary to the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>promotor were designed. The duplexes were designed to target <italic>nc-hoxd4-34</italic>, <italic>nc-hoxd4</italic>-<italic>35</italic>, or <italic>nc-hoxd4</italic>-<italic>36 </italic>loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] (si-nc34, si-nc35, si-nc36, respectively) or the non-transcribed sequence spacing these loci (siD1, siD2) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). In accordance with the idea that RNA expression is required for promoter targeting, we found that two of the siRNAs targeting ncRNA loci (si-nc34 and si-nc36) in MCF7 cells inhibited <italic>hoxd4 </italic>expression, whereas the siRNAs targeting the intervening non-transcribed sequence siD1 and siD2 had almost no effect in <italic>hoxd4 </italic>expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). Further analysis of the effect of the siRNAs showed that both si-nc34 and si-nc36 clearly reduced the levels of their respective noncoding transcript targets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>), whereas si-nc35 did not affect the expression level of <italic>nc-hoxd4</italic>-<italic>35</italic>, possibly also explaining the failure of this siRNA to affect <italic>hoxd4 </italic>expression. To explore whether the secondary structure of the promoter-associated RNA target would influence the observed transcriptional inhibition, two RNA duplexes was designed to target the pri-miR-10b transcript either at the stem region (siP1) or the loop region (siP2; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>).

The data thus suggest that miRNA-induced transcriptional inhibition is mediated through interference with promoter-associated transcripts, and that the secondary structure of the promoter-associated ncRNAs can influence the inhibitory effect.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>MiR-10a-induced transcriptional inhibition of <italic>hoxd4 </italic>is related to promoter-associated ncRNAs</bold>.

Specific siRNAs targeting Agos 1&#x02013;4 (siAgo1, siAgo2, siAgo3 and siAgo4) and Dicer (siDicer) were shown to knock-down the corresponding Argonaute and Dicer mRNA efficiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Each of these siRNAs was transfected into MCF7 cells, either alone or in combination with the miR-10a duplex. Co-transfected with the miR-10a duplex, siAgo1 or siDicer almost completely prevented the reduction in <italic>hoxd4 </italic>expression induced by miR-10a (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3f</xref>). SiAgo3 produced a similar, but less pronounced effect. These data show that AGO1 and AGO3 are required for the induction of transcriptional inhibition by endogenous small noncoding RNAs. The effect of Dicer knockdown further suggests involvement of this protein in DNA methylation of the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>promotor.</p></sec><sec><title>MicroRNA-10a-induced inhibition of transcription is associated with DNA methylation of the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>promotor</title><p>Transcriptional silencing is commonly associated with epigenetic chromatin modifications. To test whether miR-10a suppresses <italic>hoxd4 </italic>expression by <italic>de novo </italic>DNA methylation, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 5 days with 0.75 &#x003bc;M 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), a DNA methylotransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. In MCF7 cells, the 5-aza-dC treatment clearly upregulated the expression of the <italic>p15 </italic>gene, whose promotor is normally methylated, but did neither affect the expression of the unmethylated <italic>gapdh </italic>gene nor affect the expression of miR-10a (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). Treatment with 5-aza-dC increased the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>mRNA level about 5-fold in MCF7 cells, compared to only 2-fold in MDA-MB-231 cell lines for 5 days (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>).

To determine whether miR-10a could induce these repressive histone modifications, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to screen the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>promoter for H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 at regions overlapping the miR-10a target site (Chip Box1: -1081 ~ -972) and the bisulphite sequencing PCR (BSP) detection site (Chip Box2: -330 ~ -122). Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 in the promoter region of the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). After transfection with miR-10a, an increase in H3K27me3 in the two analysed regions (Box1 and Box2) was observed in both MCF7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e</xref>). We next analysed the DNA methylation status by performing bisulphite sequencing of the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>promoter. Aberrant methylation is often observed in cancer cells. CpG and CpNpG methylation are both strongly correlated with gene silencing in plants. CpNpG methylation is rare in the human genome, and no functional implications for gene silencing have ever been documented[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Consistents with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we found no CpNpG methylation in the our bisulfite-sequenced region (BSP Sequencing Region: -330 ~ -122). Cultures treated with mock duplexes presented CpG methylation in this region, but consistent with the observation that the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>mRNA level is lower in MCF7 than in MDA-MB-231 cell lines, the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>promoter region was clearly more densely methylated in MCF7 cells than in MDA-MB-231 cells. When the cultures were transfected with miR-10a duplexes, the extent of methylation increased compared to cultures treated with control RNA duplexes. Contrarily, when cells were treated with 2'-O-methyl-miR-10a (anti-miR-10a), we found that the extent of methylation decreased and was accompanied by upregulation <italic>hoxd4 </italic>expression in both cells types (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4f</xref>). These results thus indicate that the miR-10a-induced inhibition of <italic>hoxd4 </italic>transcription is accompanied by <italic>de novo </italic>DNA methylation and H3K27me3 formation in the targeted promoter region.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We demonstrate that an endogenous small noncding RNA involved in transcriptional gene regulation in human cells. This observation gives new insights into the mechanisms by which an increase in the miR-10a expression leads to a concomitant reduction in the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>expression. Bidirectional transcription leading to two functionally different miRNAs originating from the same genomic locus has been reported in flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Here, we show that two miRNAs, miR-10a and miR-10b, mapping to two different chromosomes, can target each other's primary transcipts to repress the expression of neighboring <italic>hox </italic>genes. Antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing and <italic>de novo </italic>methylation of CpG islands in the promoter have been demonstrated in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanisms by which small RNAs mediate DNA methylation of targeted promoter regions in the human genome remains to be elucidated. Some groups have observed siRNA-directed DNA methylation at targeted promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] whereas others have not found such an effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A recent report has showed that miR-10a could bind the 5'UTR of ribosomal protein mRNAs and enhance their translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. One possible explanation for this observation might that non-coding RNAs are expressed in the target region. It has been demonstrated that promoter-associated noncoding RNAs can be recognized by miRNAs and direct epigenetic silencing complexes to the corresponding targeted promoters, thereby mediating transcriptional inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the case of the <italic>hoxd4 </italic>locus, the adjacent pri-miR-10b could serve as a promoter-associated non-coding RNA, mediating induction of transcriptional silencing when targeted by miR-10a.</p><p>Recently, Dicer has been reported to attenate abnormal promoter DNA methylation in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our results define the first case in which an endogenous miRNA targets and methylates a promoter region through Dicer action. In plants, methylation is a crucial step in microRNA biogenesis, and depends on HEN1, a methyltransferase that adds a methyl group to the 3'-most nucleotide of small non-coding RNAs in both plants and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. miRNAs that regulate <italic>Rbl2</italic>-dependent DNMT expression in mouse embryonic stem cells have also been detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Ago1 and Ago4 has been shown to be involved in siRNA-directed chromatin modification, including histone methylation and non-CpG DNA methylation in plants and yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Ago1 is required for both siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing and the recruitment of histone methyltransferase activity to H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 at a siRNA-targeted promoters in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and Ago3 has the ability to interact with methyltransferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Here we show that Ago 1 and Ago3 participate in miRNA-mediated <italic>de novo </italic>DNA methylation in human cancer cells, further implicating both the miRNA machinery and the chromatin remodelling complexes in RNA directed transcriptional gene silencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our data support the notion that an RNA-operated system is involved in transcriptional regulation of genes in human cells. Endogenous small non-coding RNAs might control or fine-tune gene expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. An understanding of such a regulatory system could prove valuable in targeted approaches to specific control of gene expression and treatment of human cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>Human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A, human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa, human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line HepG2, human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD).
