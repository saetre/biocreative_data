Each family has at least one member that plays a functional role in vascular development. Our study focuses on the Roundabout (Robo) family of axon guidance genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Robos are cell surface transmembrane receptors that have been identified in most species to mediate repulsion-guidance mechanisms in axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Four robo receptor genes (<italic>robo1-4</italic>) have been identified in mammals, and their function vary widely depending on the tissue where they are expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Robo4, the fourth member of the Robo family is expressed in both the neural and vascular systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Robo4 knockdown zebrafish embryos display intersomitic vessel (ISVs) sprouting defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. More recently, <italic>robo4</italic><sup><italic>AP/AP </italic></sup>knockout mice show defects in vascular integrity that exacerbates pathological conditions associated with vascular leakage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Robo1 and Robo4 are the two endothelial relevant Robos. Robo1 has been functionally implicated in the vasculature; in the context of tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Robo1 and Robo4 share similar domains in both extracellular and intracellular cytoplasmic regions, but they differ widely in the number and spatial organization of these domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Robo1 contains five-immunoglobulin (IgG) and three-fibronectin domains compared to three and two respectively for zebrafish Robo4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Human Robo4 differs slightly from zebrafish Robo4 in that it only contains two IgG and two fibronectin domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In the intracellular region, Robo1 and Robo4 share two of the four conserved cytoplasmic (CC) motifs CC0 and CC2. Robos are known to homo- and hetero-dimerize, and dimerization is responsible for mediating signal transduction in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Slits are ligands for Robos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Slit2 has been implicated as the vascular-specific Slit and has been studied extensively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Contradictory results are reported in the literature regarding Slit2's role in migration of endothelial cells. Two groups report that Slit2 inhibits migration of endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and other groups report that Slit2 mediates positive stimulus on endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Axon guidance molecules are well known to show such dual function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. For example, Slits were originally identified as attractants of sensory axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and were later identified as repellents for Robo<sup>+ </sup>axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>To date, the functional output of Robos in endothelial cells is unresolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Some reports indicate that Slit2 binds to Robo1 in endothelial cells and promotes migration of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, in neurons, Slit-Robo1 interaction primarily mediates repulsive signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the case of Robo4, the Slit2-Robo4 interaction is implicated to inhibit migration of endothelial cells <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We have demonstrated that Robo4 also induces positive signal in endothelial cells and have implicated attraction mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Interestingly, soluble Robo4 shows anti-angiogenic effects <italic>in vitro </italic>supporting for this possibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>To facilitate clarity with Robos' function in endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, we have initiated a loss-of-function study of Robos' <italic>in vitro</italic>. To investigate the loss of function phenotype for <italic>robo1 </italic>and <italic>robo4 </italic>in vitro, we have used Dicer siRNA technology to knock down endogenous <italic>robo </italic>transcripts in endothelial cells. <italic>Robo1 </italic>and <italic>Robo4 </italic>siRNAs specifically knocks down the respective Robo RNAs and proteins in endothelial cells without affecting the other. <italic>Robo4 </italic>siRNA knockdown endothelial cells did not respond to serum but <italic>Robo1 </italic>siRNA knockdown cells do. Slit2 binds to endothelial cells expressing both Robos but does not bind to <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown endothelial cells. Interestingly, <italic>robo4 </italic>siRNA cells display pro-migratory response to Slit2 despite lack of binding of Slit2. This suggests an alternative migration induced by Slit2 in the absence of Robo4. Indeed, Slit2 displays chemotactic and chemokinetic activity on <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown endothelial cells. Serum, on the other hand displays an exclusive chemotactic activity on endothelial cells, which is abolished in the absence of Robo4.</p><p>We had previously implicated Rho GTPases in Robo4-induced migration signaling complex in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Here, we show that <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown endothelial cells contain increased Rho GTPase level, which is restored by transfecting back zebrafish Robo4 suggesting that any perturbation of Robo4 levels on endothelial cell surface results in alteration of Rho GTPase homeostasis. Importantly, this restoration is critical for endothelial cell chemotaxis to serum. Slit2 treatment of endothelial cells does not induce Rho GTPases suggesting that the mechanism of Slit2 inhibition of endothelial cell migration is Rho GTPase independent.</p><p>To explain the mechanism used by Robos for directing endothelial cell migration, we have identified that Robo1 and Robo4 interact with each other and share several molecules. They both bind to Slit2, Mena [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and Vilse, a Cdc42-GAP. In addition, we implicate IRSp53, a Cdc42 target that is down-regulated in <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown cells that show no organized actin stress fiber arrangements. Our data suggests that a complex of proteins (Cdc42-GTP, IRSp53, Mena, Vilse) are part of a serum mediated Robo4 signaling axis that is responsible for directional migration of endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title><italic>Robo4 </italic>siRNA specifically knocks down <italic>robo4 </italic>RNA and protein</title><p>We have first determined the expression levels of endothelial Robos in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).

To knockdown endogenous <italic>robo4</italic>, we have utilized the RNA interference technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] that relies on Dicer enzyme, which converts double stranded RNA into small interfering RNA (siRNA). We used the Dicer method of generating pooled <italic>robo4 </italic>small interfering RNA (siRNA) for a Robo4 region that was distinct from other Robos since it is difficult to predict <italic>a priori </italic>which region of Robo4 is optimal for targeting using siRNA. Increasing concentrations (125&#x02013;500 ng) of <italic>robo4 </italic>siRNA resulted in a dose dependant reduction of <italic>robo4 </italic>transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lanes 8&#x02013;13) with minimal change in <italic>robo1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;7) or <italic>actin </italic>transcript levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lanes 14&#x02013;19).

Taken together, these results suggest that we have generated specific knockdown reagents that can selectively target Robo1 and Robo4 in endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Serum-mediated migration responses are selectively abrogated in <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown endothelial cells</title><p>To investigate the <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown phenotype in endothelial cells, we have performed modified Boyden chamber migration assays in the presence of serum in the bottom chamber using endothelial cells transfected with <italic>robo4 </italic>siRNA (125&#x02013;750 ng) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) or control <italic>lacZ </italic>siRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

Robo1 induces actin fibers that are long and thin while Robo4 induces short and thick actin bundles along with membrane ruffles. Therefore, it is possible that Robo1 and Robo4 serve different functions in endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Slit2 binds to human endothelial cells</title><p>Human Slit2 has been previously suggested to be a ligand for Robo4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and is proteolytically processed into 140 kDa N-terminal and 55&#x02013;60 kDa C-terminal fragments in both cell culture and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

Similar results are observed in mouse <italic>robo4 </italic>knockout cells. Mouse <italic>robo4 </italic>knockout endothelial cells migrate to VEGF-A better than control cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These results argue that irrespective of the stimulus, VEGF or Slit2, <italic>robo4 </italic>siRNA or <italic>robo4 </italic>knockout endothelial cells show a pro-migratory response.</p><p>To investigate why <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown cells migrate to a Slit2 gradient, we have determined whether the migration response was chemotactic or chemokinetic. Chemotaxis is referred to directional movement towards or away from a gradient while chemokinesis is a cellular response associated to speeding up or slowing down movement and is gradient independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. To differentiate between the two types of migration, we have performed the Boyden chamber assay with control <italic>lacZ </italic>siRNA and <italic>robo4 </italic>siRNA transfected cells to serum or Slit2. Previous reports of Slit2 on leukocyte migration clearly showed that irrespective of where Slit2 was present, upper, lower or both chambers, Slit2 inhibited SDF-1&#x003b1; induced leukocyte migration arguing for a chemokinetic and chemotactic inhibitory activity for Slit2 in this system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that Slit2 behaves similarly in endothelial cell migration.</p><p>Slit2 in the upper, lower or both chambers showed similar increased motility of <italic>robo4 </italic>siRNA cells relative to that of control <italic>lacZ </italic>siRNA cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, Slit2 bars). Therefore, the positive response to Slit2 is chemokinetic. In contrast, serum stimulated only chemotactic motility of control cells. Chemotaxis to serum was blocked in <italic>robo4 </italic>siRNA cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, FBS bars), and this blockade was only detected when serum was in the bottom chamber. The serum response of <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown cells therefore excludes the possibility that <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown cells by themselves display random movement. The Slit response on the other hand is a combination of chemotaxis and chemokinesis. Therefore, our data indicate that Slit2 shows both chemotactic and chemokinetic effects on endothelial cells, and the chemotactic response is in part through Robo4 while serum mediates an exclusive chemotactic response on <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism of Slit2 inhibition of endothelial migration is independent of the Rho GTPase pathway</title><p>Previously, we had shown that Rho GTPases were activated by Robo4 in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. To investigate whether active Rho GTPases are modulated by Slit2 treatment of endothelial cells, we have checked by pulldown assay for Cdc42-GTP levels in control endothelial cells. Slit2 was incubated for 5, 10 (data not shown) and 15 min with control endothelial cells and pulldown analysis was performed on lysates from the treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). We did not convincingly notice an up-regulation of Cdc42-GTP levels in endothelial cells treated with Slit2 in either 5 or 15 min incubation times. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, compare lanes 1 &#x00026; 3 with 2 &#x00026; 4 respectively). Since Slit2 treated endothelial cells do not migrate and show no activation of Rho GTPases, the mechanism of Slit2 inhibition of endothelial migration is most likely independent of the Rho GTPase pathway. It is important to note that our data supports the conclusions of Park [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and Seth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]<italic>et al</italic>., that Slit2 inhibits migration of endothelial cells. However, removal of Robo4 alters the Slit2 response dramatically in that the cells move independent of the Slit gradient. This data can also be interpreted as the "removal of the brake" scenario where once the cellular brake is removed the cells begin to move randomly to Slit2 but not to serum suggesting the presence of an as yet unidentified ligand to Robo4 in serum that mediates a specific chemotactic positive response via Robo4. The mouse <italic>robo4 </italic>knockout endothelial cell when compared to mouse wild-type lung microvascular endothelial cell also show a similar pro-migratory response to VEGF-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and therefore suggests a common chemokinetic response to single growth factors by <italic>robo4 </italic>loss-of-function endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Vilse, a Cdc42-GAP interacts with Robo4 cytoplasmic tail</title><p>Robo4 over-expressing endothelial cells show high levels of Cdc42-GTP and Rac-GTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] proteins. Whether the Cdc42-GTP up-regulation was a result of a guanine exchange factor (GEF) up-regulation or a GTPase activating protein (GAP) sequestering was not known. We made an educated guess on Vilse (Cdc42-GAP), since Vilse interacts with the intracellular CC2 domain in Robo1 that is shared by Robo4 as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Vilse indeed interacts with Robo4 cytoplasmic tail (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lane 3) at least in HEK293T cells. Following Slit2 treatment, a slight increase in Robo4 pulldown levels is noticed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lane 4) but this increase is not observed in a consistent basis and therefore Vilse's interaction and its role in Slit2-Robo4 signaling is not clear. However, since serum was present in the pull-down assays, it is conceivable that Vilse interaction to Robo4 cytoplasmic tail is triggered by serum. Therefore, it is possible that serum mediated recruitment of Vilse, a Cdc42-GAP to Robo4 cytoplasmic tail is responsible for Rho GTPase activation. In terms of Slit2, we hypothesize that Rho GTPase independent mechanisms are in play for Slit2 inhibition of endothelial cell migration.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Vilse and Robo1 interact with Robo4 and Rho GTPase homeostasis is important for Robo4 mediated directional migration</bold>. <bold>A </bold>shows the interaction between Robo4 and Vilse in 293 cells.

Since Robos are known to homo- or hetero-dimerize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], we investigated if Robo1 and Robo4 interact with each other by immunoprecipitation (IP) and western blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In one set of experiments, we transfected HA-tagged rat Robo1 and V5-tagged human Robo4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, left panel), while in a second set of experiments, we transfected HA-tagged rat Robo1 construct and mouse Robo4 constructs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, right panel) into HEK293T cells either alone or together.

This data suggests that both mouse and human Robo4 interact with rat Robo1 and that similar to neuronal Robos, vascular Robos also interact.</p></sec><sec><title>Rho GTPase homeostasis is essential for Robo4-induced migration</title><p>To investigate the active Cdc42 and Rac levels in <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown cells, we have performed biochemical pull down analysis for Cdc42-GTP and Rac-GTP in the <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown endothelial cells. Unexpectedly, the knockdown cells showed increased levels of Cdc42 and Rac-GTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, lane 2), which return to baseline in cells transfected with zebrafish Robo4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, lane 3). When combined with migration rescue experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, R4siRNA + zfRobo4 black bar), this result suggests that restoring the balance of active vs. inactive Rho GTPases in an endothelial cell is required for chemotaxis. It is also worth noting that the previously published pull down data showed lower amounts of active Cdc42 and Rac in <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which was performed from whole embryo lysates and not from endothelial cells in the embryo.</p><p>Although <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown endothelial cells contain high levels of Cdc42-GTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, lane 2), they do not migrate to serum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). This result suggests that Cdc42-GTP level alone is not enough for directional migration but the interaction of active Cdc42 presumably with other proteins involved in filopodia formation or migration is important for this function. One such protein previously implicated in Cdc42-GTP induced filopodia formation is insulin receptor substrate protein 53 (IRSp53), a SH3 domain-containing adaptor molecule. IRSp53 protein interacts with Cdc42-GTP to promote filopodia formation in COS or Swiss 3T3 cells via an IRSp53 effector protein Mena, an Ena/VASP family member [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It is known that interaction of Cdc42 with the CRIB motif of IRSp53 relieves an intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction with the N terminus, allowing the recruitment of Mena to the IRSp53 SH3 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The IRSp53:Mena complex initiates actin filament assembly into filopodia. Since Robo4 interacts with Mena [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], we asked whether IRSp53 protein, a target of active Cdc42 was involved in Robo4 signaling in endothelial cells. In <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown endothelial cells co-transfected with myc-IRSp53 construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, lane R4), we noticed that the IRSp53 protein levels were lower when compared to samples of control <italic>lacZ </italic>siRNA transfected cells with myc-IRSp53 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, lane Con). We have stained for F-actin phalloidin in <italic>robo4 </italic>siRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>) and control <italic>lacZ </italic>siRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>) cells and clearly noticed a loss of organized actin stress fibers in <italic>robo4 </italic>siRNA transfected cells. So, taking the IRSp53 stability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), actin phalloidin staining (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>) and activated Rho GTPase in <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) data together, a strong correlative argument can be made that in the absence of Robo4, IRSp53 is unavailable for active Cdc42-GTP interaction resulting in blocking of downstream events that lead to actin nucleation and filopodia formation. Further, the zebrafish Robo4 co-transfected sample (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, lane 3) shows Rho GTPase levels comparable to baseline thus allowing for endothelial cell chemotaxis to serum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). This data also suggests that stabilization of IRSp53 protein may allow for excess Cdc42-GTP to be used for actin nucleation, and that a one to one correlation between IRSp53 and Cdc42-GTP molecules in a given cell may dictate the actin nucleation and filopodia formation process.</p></sec><sec><title>Proposed mechanism of Robo4 function in endothelial cell migration</title><p>Taking all the results in this study together, we propose a working model (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) that is built on previous models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In this model, we will integrate the following molecules: Robo1, Robo4, Slit2, Non-Slit ligand, Cdc42-GTP, IRSp53, Vilse and Mena. Here, two assumptions are in place: (1) Slit mediated migration is chemotactic and chemokinetic in nature while serum (non-Slit) mediated migration is exclusively chemotactic in nature, (2) Signaling outputs of ligand-receptor complex is context dependent and active switching between Robo1 and Robo4 at cell surface dictates directional migration of endothelial cell.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Model depicting Robo1 and Robo4 mechanism of action in endothelial cell guidance</bold>. <bold>Cell A</bold>: In resting state, in the absence of ligand (serum or Slit2), Robo1 and Robo4 interact and stay in an inactive conformation. On ligand binding, Vilse, a Cdc42-GAP is recruited to CC2 domain of Robo1 and Robo4 resulting in an increase in intracellular Cdc42-GTP levels. The Cdc42-GTP binds to CRIB domain in IRSp53, which changes conformation of IRSp53 from inactive to active state. The active conformation of IRSp53 allows Mena to interact with the exposed SH3 domain of IRSp53. <bold>Cell B</bold>: In an activated state, Mena recruits the complex to CC2 domain of Robo4's cytoplasmic tail or directly mediates actin nucleation resulting in filopodia formation and directional migration. This cartoon is a working model and is not conclusive.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-9-61-5"/></fig><p>In situation when chemokinesis and chemotaxis are required concomitantly such as wound healing, the Slit pathway is active. In the resting state i.e., in the absence of Slit, cell surface Robos physically interact with each other, which may keep both Robos in an inactive state. Another possibility is that only one Robo is expressed at any given time on the cell surface and acts singularly since we know that Robo levels on the cell surface are tightly regulated. Therefore, the physical interaction is a safety mechanism of aberrantly activating Robos on cell surface. Slit binds to Robo1 and Robo4, and it is not clear if this interaction is dependent on the presence of the other Robo. Two consequences can be predicted: (a) a direct negative stimulus emanates from Robo1 or (b) the positive stimulus from Robo4 is blocked. Both the predictions involve a Rho GTPase independent mechanism in down stream signaling events. The net output is migration of the endothelial cell forward or away from the target site.</p><p>In situation where you require exclusive chemotaxis such as during development of ISVs during embryonic development, a non-Slit pathway is active. Again, in the resting state Robo cell surface levels are tightly regulated by one of three ways: (1) physical interaction between the two Robos or, (2) one Robo is selectively down-regulated or, (3) only the particular Robo of relevance is expressed on the cell of interest in this case the tip cell. To continue a directional path for the tip cell such as along the chevron of the somite, a non-Slit ligand binds to Robo4 resulting in recruitment of Vilse, the net result is activation of Cdc42. The activated Cdc42 interacts with the stabilized IRSp53 in the endothelial tip cell allowing the SH3 domain of IRSp53 to interact with Mena (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This complex of Cdc42-GTP-IRSp53-Mena results in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement leading to filopodia formation and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Robo4 function in tip and stalk cells</title><p>Robos were originally identified as axon guidance molecules and therefore a vascular Robo, Robo1 or Robo4 was expected to function in a growth cone analogous structure in endothelial cells namely tip cells. The retinal vascular bed has been shown to contain two distinct cell types in the developing vasculature namely the tip cell and the following stalk cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In the retinal vasculature, it was shown that tip cells do not proliferate but merely guide the following proliferative stalk cell by a VEGF-dependant process. The combined tip and stalk cell activity is thought to extend the developing endothelial sprouts. Recent evidence in zebrafish has challenged the notion that tip cells don't proliferate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] since zebrafish trunk ISV tip cells do. This result argues that tip cells function is tissue dependant. In zebrafish, we have noted that <italic>robo4 </italic>is expressed along the entire length of the intersomitic sprout comprising of both the tip and stalk cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and functions in a manner that is anticipated for axon guidance molecules in that <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown embryos display ISV defects. Whether proliferation of ISV cells has altered in <italic>robo4 </italic>knockdown embryos is not known and is being investigated. Recent result of <italic>robo4 </italic>expression in mouse stalk cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] raises the issue whether higher vertebrates, in particular mammals have adapted Robos for other functions besides guidance. This is particularly possible given the fact that <italic>Robo4</italic><sup><italic>AP</italic>/<italic>AP </italic></sup>mouse did not show developmental vascular defects in the ISVs or cephalic vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Other reasons include, Robo4 stalk and tip cell function are species specific, vascular permeability is different in mouse and zebrafish. In the <italic>Robo4</italic><sup><italic>AP</italic>/<italic>AP </italic></sup>mouse it was shown that Slit2-Robo4 signaling intercepted the VEGF permeability-signaling axis and is conceivable that the Robo4-stalk cell-permeability function is Slit dependant while the Robo4-tip cell-guidance function is non-Slit dependant. The <italic>in vivo </italic>expression pattern of Slits in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and our data in this study that shows serum mediates positive chemotactic response via Robo4 provides supporting evidence for the latter.</p><p>This study raises numerous questions. What mechanisms are in play for a cell to recognize when to invoke chemotaxis vs. chemokinesis pathways? The fine details of the model proposed here (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) raise several questions. Is Mena released from Robo4 cytoplasmic tail on ligand binding? What is the ligand that mediates this action? What is the order of Mena and Vilse recruitment to the Robo4 cytoplasmic tail? Does IRSp53 protein stability control the levels of active Cdc42-GTP in endothelial cells? How do these complexes promote filopodia formation in endothelial cells? These and other issues form the basis of future work in the laboratory.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggests that endothelial cells utilize Robos in a context dependant manner and signals from surrounding milieu [Serum (non-Slit) vs. Slit2] dictate different responses and perhaps signals in endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>RNA isolation, RT-PCR, Real Time PCR and Reagents</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from HUVECs 48 h post transfection by the Trizol method.
