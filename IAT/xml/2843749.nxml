To address possible functional redundancies and reveal functional roles of C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; in postnatal skin, mouse models were developed in which either family member could be acutely ablated alone or together in the epidermis and sebaceous glands of adult mice. Acute removal of either C/EBP&#x003b1; or C/EBP&#x003b2; alone in adult mouse skin revealed modest to no discernable changes in epidermis or sebaceous glands. In contrast, co-ablation of C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; in postnatal epidermis resulted in disruption of stratified squamous differentiation characterized by hyperproliferation of basal and suprabasal keratinocytes and a defective basal to spinous keratinocyte transition involving an expanded basal compartment and a diminished and delayed spinous compartment. Acute co-ablation of C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; in sebaceous glands resulted in severe morphological defects, and sebocyte differentiation was blocked as determined by lack of sebum production and reduced expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD3) and melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R), two markers of terminal sebocyte differentiation. Specialized sebocytes of Meibomian glands and preputial glands were also affected. Our results indicate that in adult mouse skin, C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; are critically involved in regulating sebocyte differentiation and epidermal homeostasis involving the basal to spinous keratinocyte transition and basal cell cycle withdrawal.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are six members of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family: C/EBP&#x003b1;, C/EBP&#x003b2;, C/EBP&#x003b3;, C/EBP&#x003b4;, C/EBP&#x003b5; and C/EBP&#x003b6;.

The K14 promoter directs the expression CreER<sup>tam</sup> to the basal layer of the epidermis, ORS follicular keratinocytes of the hair follicle as well as the progenitor and proliferative populations of sebocytes of the sebaceous gland of mouse skin. The activity of CreER<sup>tam</sup> is regulated through topical treatment with the synthetic ER antagonist, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT). While the overall goal was to simultaneously acutely ablate C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; in adult mouse skin, it was first necessary to characterize the epidermis of adult mice in which C/EBP&#x003b1; or C/EBP&#x003b2; were individually acutely ablated. While the phenotypes of the epidermal specific germline knockouts of C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; have been previously characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009837-Loomis1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009837-Zhu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, it could not be assumed that acute ablation in fully-developed adult skin would mimic the germline embryonic knockouts where developmental compensatory events could have occurred in the embryo to mask a postnatal phenotype. Moreover, in order to accurately define and interpret the phenotype of the double knockout it was important to determine the phenotype of single C/EBP knockouts in the same experimental model system.</p><p>K14-CreER<sup>tam</sup>;C/EBP&#x003b1;<sup>ff</sup> mice and K14-CreER<sup>tam</sup>;C/EBP&#x003b2;<sup>ff</sup> mice were generated and we first analyzed K14-CreER<sup>tam</sup>;C/EBP&#x003b2;<sup>ff</sup> mice (hereafter referred to as (inducible knock out) IKO&#x003b2; mice). Before treating mice with 4OHT, the levels of C/EBP&#x003b2; protein in the epidermal homogenates of untreated IKO&#x003b2; and untreated C/EBP&#x003b2;<sup>ff</sup> mice (&#x003b2;<sup>ff</sup>) were examined. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated epidermal C/EBP&#x003b2; levels were similar in the two genotypes indicating the CreER<sup>tam</sup> fusion protein was not significantly active in the absence of 4OHT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). 4OHT treatment (1.0 mg 4OHT/day for days 1&#x02013;5 and 13&#x02013;17; skin was collected on day 21), had no significant effect on C/EBP&#x003b1; or C/EBP&#x003b2; levels in floxed-&#x003b2; mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), however, 4OHT treatment resulted in near complete ablation of C/EBP&#x003b2; in IKO&#x003b2; epidermis and this was consistently accompanied by a modest increase in C/EBP&#x003b1; levels suggesting possible compensatory upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). C/EBP&#x003b2; is expressed in three forms (LAP&#x0002a; (39 kD), LAP (36 kD) and LIP (20 kDa) due to the use of alternative translation initiation sites and all forms of C/EBP&#x003b2; were decreased in 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b2; mice (data not shown). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for C/EBP&#x003b2; confirmed the loss of C/EBP&#x003b2; in the IFE and revealed the loss of C/EBP&#x003b2; in the ORS follicular keratinocytes of the hair follicle and sebocytes of sebaceous gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). The 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b2; epidermis displayed a moderate increase in: epidermal thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g001">Fig. 1E</xref> right), the number of nucleated cell layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>) and the number of BrdU positive basal keratinocytes following a 1 hour pulse was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g001">Fig. 1G</xref> first panel). Overall, with the exception of the epidermal thickness and the increase in nucleated cell layers, the morphology of the IFE, ORS of the hair follicle and sebaceous glands of the 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b2; epidermis were indistinguishable from 4OHT-treated &#x003b2;<sup>ff</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>).

Both isoforms of C/EBP&#x003b1; ((p42 (42 kD) and p30 (30 kD)) were similarly decreased after treatment with 4OHT (data not shown). IHC staining for C/EBP&#x003b1; demonstrated the loss of C/EBP&#x003b1; in the IFE, ORS cells of the hair follicle and sebocytes in 4OHT treated IKO&#x003b1; animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

Loss of C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; in the IFE, ORS follicular keratinocytes and sebocytes was demonstrated by co-IF staining for C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; in 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; and 4OHT-treated &#x003b1;<sup>ff</sup>&#x003b2;<sup>ff</sup> mouse skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). In normal IFE, basal keratinocytes progress upwards through morphologically distinct spinous and then granular suprabasal layers, eventually ending in the production of a nonviable stratum corneum or cornified layer.

In addition, the basal and spinous layers of the 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; epidermis were dysplastic as characterized by the disorganization of the layers and by highly abnormal variations in cell and nucleus size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g003">Fig. 3G&#x00026;H</xref>). There were also focal and regional areas of moderate to severe hyperplasia of the follicular infundibular epithelium and ORS keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>) in the 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; epidermis. In contrast to the disorganized basal and spinous layers, the granular layer of keratinocytes in 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; mice appeared less affected and keratohyalin granules, a hallmark of granular layer, were present at levels similar to 4OHT-treated control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g003">Fig. 3I-J</xref>).

Small reserve cells, (proliferative undifferentiated sebocytes) were less numerous and were peripheral in the glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). In the skin of 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; mice, hair follicles contained distinct sebaceous gland lobules in the typical location on the hair follicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>); however, these glands contained unusual looking sebocytes that appeared undifferentiated, had reduced cytoplasmic volume and lacked clear fine vacuolation supportive of lipid accumulation. Affected glands had an increased cellular density with more closely apposed nuclei and the cells were morphologically reminiscent of the reserve undifferentiated cells. To determine whether other sebaceous type glands were similarly affected, we examine the Meibomian and preputial glands for C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; expression and for alterations in 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; mice. Meibomian glands are found at the rim of the eyelid of mammals and the Meibomian sebocytes produce and release a sebum-like substance onto the eye that functions to prevent the evaporation of the tear film on the eye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009837-Butovich1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The preputial gland, found in some male mammals and located in the subcutaneous tissue of the inguinal area, is involved in the production and secretion of pheromones and lipids. Co-IF staining revealed C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; were co-expressed in sebocytes of both the Meibomian and preputial glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g006">Fig. 6C&#x00026;D</xref>). Gross examination of 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; mice revealed that eyes of these mice appeared dry, swollen, and partially closed. Histological analysis revealed atrophied Meibomian glands characterized by greatly reduced lobule size and diminished numbers of differentiated sebocytes with clear vacuolated cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>). In addition, there was severe regional epidermal hyperplasia of the haired skin eyelid epidermis as well as hyperplasia of the Meibomian ducts and follicular infundibula, which was similar to skin epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g006">Fig. 6E right panel</xref>). In contrast, eyes of 4OHT-treated &#x003b1;<sup>ff</sup>&#x003b2;<sup>ff</sup> mice were normal and the mice contained normal appearing Meibomian glands and ducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>). Preputial glands from 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; mice were also abnormal. The 4OHT-treated &#x003b1;<sup>ff</sup>&#x003b2;<sup>ff</sup> mice displayed preputial glandular cells with typical, abundant, clear, finely vacuolated, translucent cytoplasm and distinct round nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g006">Fig. 6F</xref> circle). In contrast, 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; mice had marked atrophy of preputial gland lobules and decreased numbers of clear finely vacuolated sebocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g006">Fig. 6F</xref> right). Thus, the acute lost of C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; severely impairs sebaceous, Meibomian, and preputial gland homeostasis and results in the loss of morphologically distinct differentiated sebocytes in all of these glands. To provide biochemical evidence for altered sebocyte differentiation, histological sections of skin of 4OHT-treated &#x003b1;<sup>ff</sup>&#x003b2;<sup>ff</sup> and 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; mice were subjected to Oil Red O staining. Oil Red O stains lipid and sebum and positive Oil Red O staining of sebaceous glands is a hallmark of sebocyte differentiation. In 4OHT-treated &#x003b1;<sup>ff</sup>&#x003b2;<sup>ff</sup> mice, Oil Red O stained all sebaceous glands, demonstrating the presence of terminally differentiated sebum producing sebocytes associated with nearly every hair follicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g006">Fig. 6G</xref>). In contrast, the sebaceous gland lobules associated with hair follicles in 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; mice did not stain with Oil Red O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g006">Fig. 6G</xref> right and bottom right panels) indicating the absence of sebum and terminally differentiated sebocytes. To further characterize the sebaceous gland defect in 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; mice, we examined K14, fatty acid synthase (FASN), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD3) and melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R). K14 is expressed in the basal IFE keratinocytes and is also expressed in the undifferentiated peripheral sebocytes in sebaceous glands, while SCD3 and MC5R have been characterized as specific markers of sebocyte differentiation. Within the sebaceous glands of 4OHT-treated &#x003b1;<sup>ff</sup>&#x003b2;<sup>ff</sup> mice, K14 is appropriately expressed in the undifferentiated sebocytes around the periphery of sebaceous gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g006">Fig. 6I</xref>). In contrast, the entire 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; sebocyte lobule uniformly expressed K14 suggesting that the lobule may be composed of a population of undifferentiated sebocytes. To further identify these cells within the lobule as sebocytes we conducted IHC staining for FASN. Sebaceous glands in 4OHT-treated &#x003b1;<sup>ff</sup>&#x003b2;<sup>ff</sup> mice expressed FASN as did 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; sebocyte lobules indicating that the lobules are comprised of sebocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g006">Fig. 6J</xref>). The intense FASN staining of 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; sebocyte lobules compared to control glands is likely due to reduced cytoplasmic volume of IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; sebocytes. FASN mRNA levels were similar in skin between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009837-g006">Fig. 6H</xref>). SCD3 and MC5R are markers of terminally differentiated sebocytes and real time quantitative PCR revealed mRNA of both were greatly reduced in 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2;. Collectively these morphological, biochemical and molecular results indicate that acute co-ablation of C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; in adult mice results in a significant sebaceous gland defect in which sebocyte terminal differentiation and lipid production is impaired.</p><fig id="pone-0009837-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0009837.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Co-ablation of C/EBP&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; results in morphological and molecular defects in sebaceous, Meibomian and preputial glands.</title><p>(A) H&#x00026;E staining of sebaceous glands/lobules of 4OHT-treated &#x003b1;<sup>ff</sup>&#x003b2;<sup>ff</sup> and (B) 4OHT-treated IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; mice.

For example, sebaceous glands of C/EBP&#x003b1; or C/EBP&#x003b2; knockout mice were indistinguishable from wild type sebaceous glands. In contrast, the co-ablation of C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; resulted in severe sebaceous gland morphological defects and a failure of sebocyte differentiation. Likewise, acute co-deletion of C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; produces profound changes in epidermal homeostasis not seen in single KOs that involves the disruption of stratified squamous differentiation, disorganization of the epidermis and the hyperproliferation of the IFE keratinocytes as well as ORS follicular keratinocytes. Thus the co-ablation of C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; has revealed previously unknown functional roles for these transcription factors in sebocyte biology and has confirmed and eclipsed earlier studies in C/EBP&#x003b2; knockout mice that indicated a role for C/EBP&#x003b2; in early events of keratinocyte differentiation involving K1/K10 expression and growth arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009837-Zhu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results indicate that functional redundancies exist between C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; and/or these two transcription factors cooperate to regulate basal keratinocyte cell cycle withdrawal and early differentiation in keratinocytes and sebocytes.</p><p>Sebaceous glands are formed from a sebocyte progenitor that expresses Blimp 1, keratin 14 (K14) and K5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009837-Horsley1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, and these cells produce a proliferative population of sebocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009837-LoCelso1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009837-Arnold1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> which in turn differentiate into the lipid/sebum producing cells. Through the inducible conditional co-ablation of C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; we unmasked novel roles for these transcription factors in sebaceous gland differentiation. Sebocytes lacking C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; were morphologically altered and sebum production was blocked. IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; mice retained distinct sebaceous gland lobules, but these cells did not produce sebum, a hallmark of sebocyte differentiation. It appears the proliferating cells located on the periphery of the gland continued dividing but their progeny were unable to initiate terminal differentiation. Our observation that the cells in the lobules of IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; mice express K14 and FASN is consistent with this idea, providing compelling evidence that the cells within the lobule are sebocytes. In addition, we observed decreased levels of SCD3 and MC5R, two markers of differentiated sebocytes. Our results indicate the adipogenic transcription factors, C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2;, also have critical roles in sebocyte differentiation through the regulation of lipogenesis and sebum production. The critical importance of these transcription factors in sebocyte homeostasis was further strengthened by the profound effect of their co-ablation on the specialized sebocytes of the Meibomian and preputial glands. Meibomian glands of mice lacking C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; were severely disorganized, dysplastic and there was evidence of bacterial infection. Posterior blepharitus is a human disease often characterized by improper sebum production by Meibomian glands, lending an environment favorable for bacterial growth, and accompanied by inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009837-Dougherty1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Acne, seborrheic dermatitis, blepharitis, and sebaceous cancer are among several human health conditions involving altered sebocyte homeostasis. It seems plausible the transcription factors C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; could have involvement in these disease conditions.</p><p>Molecular analysis of IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; epidermis revealed that K5 and K14, markers of basal keratinocytes, were expressed throughout the basal and suprabasal layers, while suprabasal markers K1 and K10 were delayed or weakly expressed. A concomitant increase in hyperproliferative basal and suprabasal IFE keratinocytes was observed in IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; epidermis. These results indicate an expansion of the basal compartment and reduced ability of these basal keratinocytes to initiate the early events of stratified squamous differentiation involving K1 and K10 expression and cell cycle withdrawal. Both C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; can bind to and activate the K10 promoter and C/EBP binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009837-Maytin2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> have been identified in both the K1 and K10 promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009837-Zhu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> suggesting differences in K1 and K10 expression could be regulated directly by C/EBPs at the promoter level. Chromatin immuno-precipitation experiments will be required to resolve these issues.</p><p>In general, the granular layers of IKO&#x003b1;&#x003b2; epidermis appeared less affected; keratohyalin granules were present and involucrin and filaggrin were expressed, albeit at increased levels. These changes in increased involucrin and filaggrin expression could be a response to the disruption of epidermal homeostasis due to the defective basal to spinous transition or it is possible that C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; contribute to the suppression of granular differentiation as has been reported for Hes1 in epidermal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009837-Moriyama1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Mechanisms of epidermal development and postnatal differentiation are not necessarily synonymous.

Recently the co-deletion of C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; in developing mouse skin produced mice that died soon after birth, and the analysis of epidermis from these mice revealed hyperplasia, decreased expression of spinous and granular markers of differentiation and a role for E2F in the hyperplastic epidermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009837-Lopez1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. While we observed similar changes in basal cell hyperproliferation and defects in spinous markers of differentiation, we did not observe the granular changes reported in developing skin. For example, we did not observe diminished keratohyalin granules, filaggrin, and involucrin expression in adult epidermis and we did observe an uncoupling of involucrin and loricrin expression in adult epidermis. Collectively, these results indicate that there are significant differences between the effects of co-deletion of C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; in embryonic development and postnatal differentiation.</p><p>Notch signaling is important in both the early and later stages of epidermal development where it regulates the basal to spinous transition in a Hes1 independent manner and the spinous to granular transition in a Hes1 dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009837-Blanpain2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009837-Rangarajan1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Likewise our current study provides evidence for functional redundancies between C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; in epidermal and sebocyte homeostasis. However, in terms of skin tumorigenesis, these family members have unique functions.
