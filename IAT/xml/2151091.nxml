Numerous isolates from diverse areas of the world's oceans have been studied and shown to be physiologically and genetically distinct. All isolates described thus far can be assigned to either a tightly clustered high-light (HL)-adapted clade, or a more divergent low-light (LL)-adapted group. The 16S rRNA sequences of the entire <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> group differ by at most 3&#x00025;, and the four initially published genomes revealed patterns of genetic differentiation that help explain physiological differences among the isolates. Here we describe the genomes of eight newly sequenced isolates and combine them with the first four genomes for a comprehensive analysis of the core (shared by all isolates) and flexible genes of the <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> group, and the patterns of loss and gain of the flexible genes over the course of evolution. There are 1,273 genes that represent the core shared by all 12 genomes. They are apparently sufficient, according to metabolic reconstruction, to encode a functional cell. We describe a phylogeny for all 12 isolates by subjecting their complete proteomes to three different phylogenetic analyses. For each non-core gene, we used a maximum parsimony method to estimate which ancestor likely first acquired or lost each gene. Many of the genetic differences among isolates, especially for genes involved in outer membrane synthesis and nutrient transport, are found within the same clade. Nevertheless, we identified some genes defining HL and LL ecotypes, and clades within these broad ecotypes, helping to demonstrate the basis of HL and LL adaptations in <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>. Furthermore, our estimates of gene gain events allow us to identify highly variable genomic islands that are not apparent through simple pairwise comparisons. These results emphasize the functional roles, especially those connected to outer membrane synthesis and transport that dominate the flexible genome and set it apart from the core. Besides identifying islands and demonstrating their role throughout the history of <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>, reconstruction of past gene gains and losses shows that much of the variability exists at the &#x0201c;leaves of the tree,&#x0201d; between the most closely related strains. Finally, the identification of core and flexible genes from this 12-genome comparison is largely consistent with the relative frequency of <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> genes found in global ocean metagenomic databases, further closing the gap between our understanding of these organisms in the lab and the wild.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p><italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>&#x02014;the most abundant photosynthetic microbe living in the vast, nutrient-poor areas of the ocean&#x02014;is a major contributor to the global carbon cycle. <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> is composed of closely related, physiologically distinct lineages whose differences enable the group as a whole to proliferate over a broad range of environmental conditions. We compare the genomes of 12 strains of <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> representing its major lineages in order to identify genetic differences affecting the ecology of different lineages and their evolutionary origin. First, we identify the core genome: the 1,273 genes shared among all strains. This core set of genes encodes the essentials of a functional cell, enabling it to make living matter out of sunlight and carbon dioxide. We then create a genomic tree that maps the gain and loss of non-core genes in individual strains, showing that a striking number of genes are gained or lost even among the most closely related strains. We find that lost and gained genes commonly cluster in highly variable regions called genomic islands. The level of diversity among the non-core genes, and the number of new genes added with each new genome sequenced, suggest far more diversity to be discovered.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Kettler CG, Martiny AC, Huang K, Zucker J, Coleman ML, et al.

Although <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> and <italic>Synechocococcus</italic> coexist throughout much of the world's oceans, <italic>Synechococcus</italic> extends into more polar regions and is more abundant in nutrient-rich waters, while <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> dominates relatively warm, oligotrophic regions and can be found at greater depths &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. The <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> group consists of two major ecotypes, high-light (HL)-adapted and low-light (LL)-adapted, that are genetically and physiologically distinct &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d; and are distributed differently in the water column &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Given their relatively simple metabolism, well-characterized marine environment, and global abundance, these marine cyanobacteria represent an excellent system for understanding how genetic differences translate to physiological and ecological variation in natural populations.</p><p>The first marine cyanobacterial genome sequences suggested progressive genome decay from <italic>Synechococcus</italic> to LL <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> to HL <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>, characterized by a reduction in genome size (from 2.4 to 1.7 Mb) and a drop in G &#x0002b; C content from &#x0223c;59&#x00025; to &#x0223c;30&#x00025; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Notably, genes involved in light acclimation and nutrient assimilation appeared to have been sequentially lost, consistent with the niche differentiation observed for these three groups &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. This comparison suggested that the major clades of marine cyanobacteria differentiated in a stepwise fashion, leading to patterns of gene content that corresponded to the isolates' 16S rRNA phylogeny.</p><p>Recently, however, molecular sequence data and physiology studies have revealed complexity beyond the HL/LL paradigms. Within the LL ecotype, for instance, some but not all isolates can use nitrite as a sole nitrogen source &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, and the LL genomes range widely in size &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, the distribution of phosphate acquisition genes among <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> genomes does not correlate to their rRNA phylogeny but instead appears related to phosphate availability: strains isolated from low-phosphate environments are genetically better equipped to deal with phosphate limitation than those from high-phosphate environments, regardless of their 16S rRNA phylogeny &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, while the HL/LL distinction has held up both phenotypically and genotypically, there are other differences among isolates that are not consistent with their rRNA phylogeny. Thus, to understand diversification and adaptation in this globally important group, we must characterize the underlying patterns of genome-wide diversity.</p><p>Lateral gene transfer (LGT) is one mechanism that creates complex gene distributions and phylogenies incongruent with the rRNA tree. The question of whether a robust organismal phylogeny can be inferred despite extensive LGT is still hotly debated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. If a core set of genes exists that is resistant to LGT, then gene trees based on these core genes should reflect cell division and vertical descent, as has been argued for the gamma <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Others argue that genes in a shared taxon core do not necessarily have the same evolutionary histories, making inference of an organismal phylogeny difficult &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. In spite of this debate, the core genome remains a useful concept for understanding biological similarity within a taxonomic group. Recent comparisons within the lactic acid bacteria, cyanobacteria, and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptococcus agalacticae</named-content> groups, for instance, have each revealed a core set of genes shared by all members of the group, on top of which is layered the flexible genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. The vast majority of genes in the core genome encode housekeeping functions, while genes in the flexible genome reflect adaptation to specific environments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; and are often acquired by LGT. Thus the core and flexible genomes are informative not only in a phylogenetic context, for understanding the mechanisms and tempo of genome evolution, but also in an ecological context, for understanding the selective pressures experienced in different environments.</p><p>To further understand diversification and adaptation in <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>, we obtained sequences of eight additional genomes representing diverse lineages, both LL- and HL-adapted, spanning the complete 16S rRNA diversity (97&#x00025; to 99.93&#x00025; similarity) of cultured representatives of this group &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b018">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030231-t001">Table 1</xref>). Comparing these genomes with available genomes for <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> and marine <italic>Synechococcus</italic>, our goal was to reconstruct the history of vertical transmission, gene acquisition, and gene loss for these marine cyanobacteria. In particular we identified functions associated with the core and flexible genomes and analyzed the metabolic pathways encoded in each. This analysis reveals not only what differentiates <italic>Synechococcus</italic> from LL <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> from HL <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>, but also informs our understanding of how adaptation occurs in the oceans along gradients of light, nutrients, and other environmental factors, providing essential biological context for interpreting rapidly expanding metagenomic datasets.</p><table-wrap id="pgen-0030231-t001" content-type="1col" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>General Characteristics of the <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> and <italic>Synechococcus</italic> Isolates Used in This Study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0030231.t001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Core Genome</title><p>The genomes of 12 <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> isolates, representing all known major phylogenetic clades, range in size from 1.6 Mbp (MIT9301) to 2.7 Mbp (MIT9303) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030231-t001">Table 1</xref>).

To understand the divergence of marine <italic>Synechococcus</italic> and <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> since their last common ancestor, we looked for genes present in all <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> but absent from some or all <italic>Synechococcus</italic>.

Eight of these <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>-only genes have been assigned putative functions including one HL inducible protein (MED4&#x02032;s <italic>hli11</italic>, which responds only slightly to light stress &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;), a possible sodium-solute symporter, an iron-sulfur protein, and a <italic>deoR</italic>-like transcription factor, but it is unclear what role these genes have in distinguishing <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> from <italic>Synechococcus</italic>. Perhaps more importantly, the differentiation between these two groups is defined by the absence in <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> of 140 genes that are present in all four sequenced marine <italic>Synechococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030231-st003">Table S3</xref>).

If the core genome provides for central metabolic needs shared by all isolates, it should be possible to reconstruct those pathways with the core genes alone. Therefore we asked whether the core genome encodes all the biochemical pathways needed for growth from the nutrients available to <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> using Pathway Tools &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; and compared the resulting map with the manually curated, but less detailed, metabolic map for <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> SS120 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. The automated approach is more detailed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030231-sg001">Figures S1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030231-sg004">S4</xref> and see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://procyc.mit.edu">http://procyc.mit.edu</ext-link>), but the results recapitulate the previous manual effort.</p><p>We have identified core genes responsible for nearly all the reactions in the central metabolism, from the Calvin Cycle to the incomplete TCA cycle, including pathways to synthesize all 20 amino acids, several cofactors, and chlorophylls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030231-sg001">Figures S1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030231-sg004">S4</xref>). Among the genes that were assigned functions in the <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> SS120 core metabolic model, all but seven are found to be part of the core genome in this study. Five of these seven additional genes in SS120 are transporters: SS120&#x0005f;12271, an iron or manganese transporter; SS120&#x0005f;15671, a sodum/alanine symporter; and SS120&#x0005f;06831&#x02013;06851, three genes encoding an ABC-type amino acid transporter. The other two, <italic>sdhA</italic> and <italic>sdhB</italic>, are putatively responsible for the conversion of fumarate to succinate in the incomplete TCA cycle, but they have no apparent orthologs in many <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> isolates. Importantly, <italic>sdhAB</italic> in the TCA cycle and <italic>pdxH</italic> in pyridoxal phosphate synthesis are the only cases in which one of the pathways examined could be reconstructed in some strains, but not in the core genome. An additional case, the phosphorylation of pantothenate in coenzyme A synthesis, is incomplete in the core and pan reconstructions, indicating that we have most likely failed to identify the gene or an alternate pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030231-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). This observation supports the view in which essential life functions are unchanging across all <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>, while nonessential or environment-specific functions are found in the flexible genome (see below). The functions of the latter, then, may relate to niche-specific adaptations that are not required for growth under optimal conditions, but that provide a fitness advantage in particular habitats.

Our new data identify MED4 as the exception, since the other five HL isolates share a second copy in the same well-conserved neighborhood. Surprisingly, there is huge variation in the number of genes encoding HLIPs, ranging from nine in eMIT9313 to 41 in eNATL2A. Even at the leaves of the tree, within the HL clades, HLIPs range in copy number from 15 to 24.</p><p>A second copy of the core photosystem II gene <italic>psbA</italic> also appears in more than half the genomes. This gene is especially interesting because it is also found in all <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>-infecting myoviruses and podoviruses sequenced to date &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. While it is possible that <italic>psbA</italic> might have been inserted into the genome by those viruses, much as the genes in genomic islands are thought to have been &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;, the similarity between <italic>psbA</italic> copies in the same genome suggests they are the result of intragenomic duplication events, not transduction. Indeed, in all of these strains the two copies are identical or nearly identical in nucleotide sequence, suggesting that they result from a very recent duplication event. Furthermore, while extra <italic>psbA</italic> copies sometimes appear in islands, they do not always. In MIT9515, for example, the two copies lie in tandem but not in an island. It is not clear why <italic>psbA</italic> is subject to such duplication events while other photosystem genes are not. The most likely reason is that the PsbA protein (D1) has an exceptionally brief half-life due to light-induced damage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;, and therefore two gene copies help ensure sufficient product via a gene dosage effect and/or by promoter differences leading to expression under different conditions.</p><p>The complement of nutrient assimilation genes also varies among the most closely related isolates, suggesting frequent gain and loss events. Such variability was recently described for genes involved in phosphorus assimilation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Within the eMIT9312 clade, for instance, the isolates AS9601 and MIT9215 are lacking the <italic>phoBR</italic> two-component system, the <italic>phoE</italic> porin, and several related genes that are present in MIT9312 and MIT9301. Now equipped with whole genomes for 12 isolates, we see a similar situation for nitrogen assimilation genes. MED4 is the only HL isolate with cyanate lyase, and likewise MIT9515 exclusively carries a second ammonia permease gene. In contrast, MIT9515 is the only HL isolate lacking urea transport and metabolism genes. This variability may reflect the available nitrogen sources in the local environment where these isolates originated, as has been hypothesized for phosphorus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Chromosomal Location of the Flexible Genome</title><p>Previous work comparing the genomes of two closely related <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> isolates has highlighted the importance of highly variable island regions in genomes as the sites of genomic variation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. These variable genome segments appear to contain genes that could be important for adaptation to local conditions, and include many of the functions encoded in the flexible genome analyzed here, such as outer membrane synthesis. Thus, we analyzed the chromosomal geography of the flexible genome. Are flexible genes preferentially located in island regions, and if so are the most recently acquired genes more likely to be island genes?</p><p>To answer these questions, we plotted the timing of gene gain events against their chromosome positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030231-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030231-sg005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030231-sg006">S6</xref>). In HL isolates, the islands contain the majority of gained genes. Furthermore, the islands include not only recent acquisitions but also genes that were gained long ago, based on their presence in divergent modern isolates. However, particular islands show different levels of gain or loss events throughout the evolution of <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>. Apparently, these sites have been important for adaptation throughout the history of most <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> lineages.</p><fig id="pgen-0030231-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Gene Acquisitions Confirm Known, and Identify Novel, Genomic Islands in <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic></title><p>The dot plots indicate the location on the chromosome and the ancestor node in which the gene is estimated to be gained.

Among LL isolates, this approach is difficult because the genomes are more divergent, and numerous rearrangements have disrupted synteny, even for core genes. Plotting gene gain events along the chromosome, however, reveals island structure in several LL genomes. MIT9211 and SS120 have clearly defined islands much like the HL isolates, while NATL1A and NATL2A have one large potential island and several much smaller sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030231-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030231-sg005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030231-sg006">S6</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, this approach is less helpful in the two large genomes, MIT9313 and MIT9303, which have apparently gained a large number of genes throughout the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030231-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In their organization and content, the large genomes are exceptional among <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> in three ways: they share a large number of genes with <italic>Synechococcus</italic> that the other isolates do not, they gain additional genes not shared with any other <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> or with marine <italic>Synechococcus</italic>, and those genes do not cluster in discernible islands. The first two differences mean that their genome sizes are much greater than those of the other isolates. The lack of islands together with the larger genome size could indicate that these isolates have acquired genes through a different mechanism that does not direct them toward islands. The relative lack of pressure towards genome reduction in the evolution of eMIT9313 may also play a role. However, additional sequenced genomes may provide better coverage of the eMIT9313 clade and clarify the timing of gene gain events.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The Frequency of Core and Flexible Genes in Wild Populations</title><p>Because <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> is very abundant in many regions of the oceans that have recently been sampled and subjected to metagenomic analysis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b062">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;, we have an opportunity to test the robustness of our distinction between core and flexible genes in <italic>Prochlorococcus.</italic> If the core genome we have defined, based on the genomes of 12 isolates, is reasonably universal and core genes are generally single copy per genome, we would expect to find core genes represented with equal frequency in the ocean; the occurrence of non-core genes, in contrast, would be more variable. To test this hypothesis, we used the MIT9301 core and flexible genomes as queries against the Global Ocean Survey dataset &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;, as MIT9301 often shares the highest sequence similarity with GOS sequences. As expected, the core genes, after normalization to gene size, are represented in roughly equal abundance in the database, with only a few exceptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030231-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). In the case of non-core, or flexible genes, many had few or no hits, and a few were even more abundant than the average core gene, suggesting more than one copy per genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030231-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Seven core genes are underrepresented in the GOS dataset relative to other core genes, and all seven are located in a genomic island in MIT9301 largely related to cell surface biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030231-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). The most abundant flexible genes encode HLIPs and hypothetical proteins and are also found in islands in MIT9301 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030231-g005">Figure 5</xref>B).

We have learned, for example, that many genes involved in adaptation to different light intensities and DNA repair were apparently fixed before the modern clades diverged, and as a result, the HL-/LL-adapted dichotomy has persisted both genetically and phenotypically. The eNATL2A clade appears to be a refinement on the HL/LL paradigm, as its isolates grow optimally at light intensities typical of the LL ecotype, but have the photoprotective abilities of the HL ecotype. More recent changes in genome content, i.e., those occurring at the tips of the phylogenetic tree, involve cell surface features that are likely under selection pressure via predators and phage and transporter composition, which likely plays a role in both defense from toxins and differences in nutrient availability. The latter is consistent with our earlier observation that genes involved in phosphorus acquisition are distributed among <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> isolates not according to phylogeny, but rather the P concentrations in their ocean of origin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. However, despite the clear evidence for common gene gains and losses throughout the evolution of <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>, we still observed a significant correlation between genome content and phylogeny. This suggests an important contribution of vertically inherited genes to the overall genome content that cannot be easily substituted through lateral gene transfer or lost altogether.</p><p>The core genome of <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>, with 81&#x00025; of the 1,273 genes having an inferred function, is now reasonably well understood and appears to encode a viable cell. That this could be circumscribed through the analysis of only 12 genomes is encouraging, and likely emerges from the reasonably small evolutionary distance between these isolates. The close agreement between manually curated core pathway reconstruction for one isolate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, and the automatic reconstruction of the core metabolism shared by all 12 isolates in our study, promises to help streamline the analysis of new genomes. To date, discussions of minimal genomes to support life have focused on the set of genes that enable heterotrophic cells to replicate on rich organic media, where they benefit from nutrients that must have been synthesized by other organisms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;. Here, however, we are approximating the minimum number of genes necessary to convert solar energy, carbon dioxide, and inorganic nutrients to living biomass.</p><p>The <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> flexible genome is still only loosely defined, as over 70&#x00025; of the orthologous groups in this category have no known homolog in MicrobesOnline and no inferred function. Moreover, as the last genomes are added to the analysis, they each add roughly 150 new genes to the <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> pan-genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030231-g001">Figure 1</xref>); thus it appears that the global pool of genes that are residing, at this moment, in a <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> cell cannot even be approximated from this dataset. Therefore, one of the most daunting unanswered questions is: How many <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> genotypes truly exist in the ocean, and what fraction of these has differential fitness at any point in time?</p><p>The level of diversity found in the flexible genes, and the steady increment of genes added to the <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> pan genome with each new genome, suggests that we have barely begun to observe the extent of micro-diversity among <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> in the ocean. Although the sequencing of 12 genomes represents one of the larger sequencing projects of closely related isolates to date, each isolate undoubtedly represents a subclade of a very large number of cells&#x02014;especially considering the approximately 10<sup>25</sup><italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> cells in the ocean &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030231-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.

An orthologous group includes all genes that are orthologous to any other gene in the group. The most common challenge of clustering orthologous genes is the risk of merging paralogous genes into one group. However, our method yields only 127 paralog-containing groups. In those cases, gene neighborhoods were also compared. Because a single missing ortholog effectively removes a gene from the core genome, the clusters that are absent in only one or two genomes were verified by BLAST search.</p><p>While the COG categories alone provide enough information to draw these conclusions about the membrane synthesis enzymes, there are some shortcomings. Some <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> orthologous groups can be annotated with a gene name but not a COG (for example the LPS synthesis gene wcaK, or many photosystem genes like psbA), where literature searches show that they are likely involved in LPS synthesis.
