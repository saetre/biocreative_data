It takes place mainly during the embryonic period but a significant number of neurons migrate after birth, well into adulthood. Appropriate migration is essential for the construction of functional synaptic circuitries in the brain. A classical example is the migration of neurons related to sexual behaviours, such as the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH<sup>+</sup>) neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], through the olfactory compartment and into the hypothalamus. GnRH<sup>+ </sup>neurons can be analysed <italic>in vitro </italic>using the immortalized and highly motile murine GN-11 cell line, which represents an ideal model to study the molecular bases of neuronal migration.</p><p>The AP-2&#x003b1; transcription factor is abundant in GN-11 cells and it is known to play a major role in controlling neuronal gene expression and nervous system development as demonstrated by several investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In particular, genetic models such as zebrafish and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] showed that AP-2&#x003b1; is essential for neural crest cell migration and its mutation results in apoptosis within this cell population. AP-2&#x003b1; is a member of the AP-2 family which consists of five closely related proteins of Mr 50,000, AP-2&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;, &#x003b4; and &#x003b5; (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]) encoded by distinct genes. These transcription factors can form homodimers or heterodimers via helix-span-helix motifs and transactivate their target genes by binding to GC-rich consensus sequences in the promoter regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Dopamine &#x003b2;-hydroxylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], human proenkephalin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], acetylcholinesterase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], rat luteinizing hormone receptor (LHRH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and neuropeptide Y receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] are key genes for central nervous system biology which are known to be transcriptionally regulated by AP-2 proteins. In addition, AP-2 proteins regulate genes involved in certain neuropathologies, such as the presenilin-1 gene, involved in Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and the huntingtin gene, involved in Huntington's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A role for AP-2&#x003b1; protein in the biology of LHRH neurons has been demonstrated <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]; in fact, LHRH expression was greatly decreased in AP-2&#x003b1; knock-out mice compared with controls. However, the mechanism leading to the inhibition of LHRH expression was not elucidated since a direct regulation for AP-2&#x003b1; on the LHRH promoter was not demonstrated.</p><p>Here we present data showing the importance of AP-2&#x003b1; in the transcriptional regulation of genes that coordinate GN-11 neuron migration. We knocked down AP-2&#x003b1; expression by RNA interference (RNAi) and analysed migration and motility. We performed a microarray analysis to identify the genetic programme activated by AP-2&#x003b1; and observed the modulation of a master regulator of GnRH<sup>+ </sup>neuron migration, the Adhesion Related Kinase (<italic>Ark</italic>) also called <italic>Axl</italic>. We proved that Axl is essential for GN-11 cell movement and that AP-2&#x003b1; directly regulates <italic>Axl </italic>transcription by binding to canonical AP-2 binding sites present in the promoter of this gene. In addition, we present data demonstrating an essential role for AP-2&#x003b1; in mouse embryo fibroblast migration via the modulation of a distinct set of genes compared with GN-11 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Production of stable AP-2&#x003b1; knock-down GN-11 cells</title><p>GN-11 neurons were manipulated by RNAi to down-regulate AP-2&#x003b1;, the only AP-2 family member that they express (data not shown). Four different siRNA sequences were cloned in either pSilencer 1.0-U6 or pSUPERretro.puro expression vectors and expressed in GN-11 neurons following transfections and puromycin selection. The pIRES.puro2 selection plasmid was cotransfected with the pSilencer 1.0-U6-based vectors. After selection 10 empty control clones (five containing the pSilencer 1.0-U6; five containing the pSUPERretro.puro) as well as 26 clones expressing shRNA-&#x003b1;1, shRNA-&#x003b1;2, shRNA-&#x003b1;3 or shRNA-&#x003b1;4 (six, seven, seven and six clones, respectively) were isolated. Each clone was analysed for vector integration in the genome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR; data not shown). Silencing was verified by Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for all clones (data not shown). Clones &#x003b1;1-b, &#x003b1;1-c, &#x003b1;2-a, &#x003b1;4-b and &#x003b1;4-c showed the best AP-2&#x003b1; down-modulation compared with controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) and were further used for biological assays and gene expression profiling.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>AP-2&#x003b1;-dependent proliferation, migration and motility in GN-11 neurons and mouse embryo fibroblasts</bold>. (a) Stable GN-11 control clones named pSil-empty and pSUPER-empty or AP-2&#x003b1;-silenced clones named &#x003b1;1-a, &#x003b1;1-c, &#x003b1;2-a, &#x003b1;4-b and &#x003b1;4-c were analysed for their AP-2&#x003b1; protein levels by Western blot (WB). mAb 3B5 was used to detect AP-2&#x003b1; protein expression and actin expression was evaluated as protein loading control. The percentage values correspond to the amount of AP-2&#x003b1; protein present in each clone. (b) Proliferation was analysed in control pSil-empty or AP-2&#x003b1;-silenced &#x003b1;1-b, &#x003b1;1-c, &#x003b1;2-a GN-11 clones. Cells were plated and starved for 24 hours in serum-free medium, then 10% foetal calf serum (FCS) was added to cells. Cells were fixed and stained at the indicated time and optical density was measured. The experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated twice. (c) Migration was analysed in transwell assays for pSil-empty or pSUPER-empty or AP-2&#x003b1;-silenced &#x003b1;1-b, &#x003b1;1-c, &#x003b1;2-a, &#x003b1;4-b and &#x003b1;4-c GN-11 clones as well as for three independent preparations of AP-2&#x003b1; +/+, +/- and -/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Cells were plated in serum-free medium in the upper chamber and allowed to migrate over the medium containing 10% FCS for 18 hours. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated twice. (d) pSil-empty or &#x003b1;1-b, &#x003b1;1-c, &#x003b1;2-a GN-11 clones were used to analyse motility in wound healing assays. Cells were grown at 90% confluency, serum starved for 24 hours, then a wound (cross) was made in the cell layer. 10% FCS medium was added and cells were allowed to migrate for 18 hours. Pictures of the right arm of the cross were taken at <italic>t </italic>= 0 hours and at <italic>t </italic>= 24 hours. Quantitations were performed as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Differences were statistically significant as measured by a two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic>-test (***, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05).

Two of the three analysed clones showed increased proliferation rate at 72 hours, proportional to the level of AP-2&#x003b1; expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). In particular, the &#x003b1;2-a clone, which expressed the lowest level of AP-2&#x003b1;, showed a 3-fold increase in proliferation, 72 hours after starvation, suggesting that AP-2&#x003b1; controls GN-11 cell proliferation in a negative way. To understand the role of AP-2&#x003b1; in cell movement we compared the migration of control pSil-empty or pSUPER-empty clones with low AP-2&#x003b1;-expressing clones in response to 10% foetal calf serum (FCS) by transwell assays. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref> reduced migration was observed for all AP-2&#x003b1; silenced clones, in particular &#x003b1;2-a and &#x003b1;4-c clones showed a 3-fold and a 1.5-fold reduction, respectively. Slighter reductions were observed for the other clones. A similar reduction in migration was observed when comparing AP-2&#x003b1; null versus wild-type or heterozygous mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). Motility was monitored in GN-11 neurons for control pSil-empty and &#x003b1;1-b, &#x003b1;1-c and &#x003b1;2-a clones by wound healing assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). After wounding, cells were allowed to migrate for 18 hours to recover the wound. A 40&#x02013;80% reduction in motility was observed in AP-2&#x003b1; low-expressing clones compared with control cells. In particular, the &#x003b1;2-a clone showed an 80% decrease in motility, while a slighter decrease was observed for the other clones.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of potential AP-2&#x003b1; regulated genes by microarray analysis</title><p>In order to identify which AP-2&#x003b1; regulated genes were involved in GN-11 neuron or MEF migration, microarray analyses were performed. For GN-11 cells total RNA was extracted from pSUPER-empty and &#x003b1;4-c clones and subjected to transcriptome analysis on Illumina Ref-8 BeadChips. Differential gene expression analysis revealed 510 modulated transcripts (305 decreased and 205 increased) in AP-2&#x003b1; silenced cells compared with controls (see Methods). A complete list of genes is shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. A partial list of the most relevant genes is shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, where genes are distributed in different Gene Ontology (GO) categories, such as cell cycle (i.e. <italic>Ccnd1</italic>, <italic>Cdk5rap3 </italic>and <italic>Cetn3</italic>), apoptosis (i.e. <italic>Siva</italic>, <italic>Birc5 </italic>and <italic>Tnfrsf12a</italic>), development (i.e. <italic>Emp1</italic>, <italic>Wisp1</italic>, <italic>Ryk</italic>), extracellular matrix (ECM)/cell adhesion (i.e. <italic>Col5a1</italic>, <italic>Col6a1</italic>, <italic>Mfge8</italic>) and cell migration (i.e. <italic>Axl</italic>, <italic>Rtn4</italic>, <italic>Nup62</italic>). Microarray data were validated by qRT-PCR for 13 genes shown to be involved in migration from the literature with a fold change greater than 2.0 (<italic>Axl</italic>, <italic>Col5a1</italic>, <italic>Col6a2</italic>, <italic>Emp1</italic>, <italic>Fbln2</italic>, <italic>Lmna</italic>, <italic>Plec1</italic>, <italic>Ryk</italic>, <italic>Timp1</italic>, <italic>Tnfrsf12a</italic>, <italic>Timp2</italic>, <italic>Tgfbi</italic>, <italic>Wisp1</italic>) on two different RNA preparations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Data were normalized using the 18S or GAPDH gene as internal controls. Gene expression was analysed in AP-2&#x003b1; +/- and -/- MEFs on Agilent Whole Mouse Genome 44 K platform and 1492 modulated transcripts (878 decreased and 614 increased) were found (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). These results were validated by qRT-PCR for nine modulated genes randomly chosen (<italic>Mmp3</italic>, <italic>Mmp13</italic>, <italic>Pcdhb20</italic>, <italic>Nid2</italic>, <italic>PlxnA2</italic>, <italic>Cdh13</italic>, <italic>Catnal1</italic>, <italic>Ccl4</italic>, <italic>Stmn4</italic>) on three different RNA preparations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Also in this case the 18S or GAPDH housekeeping gene was used for qRT-PCR normalization data. An overlapping group of 26 genes was identified comparing the two datasets (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), suggesting that some common mechanisms could be present in the different cellular systems but that most of the AP-2&#x003b1;-driven genetic programmes are cell-specific.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Differentially expressed

Two main molecular networks were identified for GN-11 neurons (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The first network includes 29 genes associated with cellular movement (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), for instance tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (<italic>Timp1 </italic>and <italic>Timp2</italic>), metalloproteinases (<italic>Mmp2</italic>), the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl, the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7 (<italic>Ccl7</italic>) and the cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (<italic>Cyb5r3</italic>, also known as diaphorase-1). The second network is associated with cell growth and includes 27 genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), such as CDK5 regulatory subunit associated protein 3 (<italic>Cdk5rap3</italic>), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (<italic>Cdkn2a</italic>) and WNT1 inducible signalling pathway protein 1 (<italic>Wisp1</italic>). These results indicate that AP-2&#x003b1; first of all regulates a panel of genes involved in GN-11 migration and proliferation. When we performed the same analysis on the MEF gene datasets two main molecular networks were identified (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The first network is associated with cellular development and includes 31 genes such as Notch gene homologues 2 and 3 (<italic>Notch2 </italic>and <italic>Notch3</italic>), c-fos induced growth factor (<italic>Figf</italic>) and growth arrest specific-1 (<italic>Gas1</italic>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The second network includes 31 genes associated with cellular movement, for instance epidermal growth factor receptor (<italic>Egfr</italic>), wingless-related MMTV integration site 2 (<italic>Wnt2</italic>) and secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (<italic>Srfp1</italic>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).

In the organism GnRH<sup>+ </sup>neurons migrate from the olfactory placode to the developing forebrain, to the septum and preoptic area of the hypothalamus and this migration is fundamental for the development of the normal reproductive functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. For instance, in Kallmann's syndrome patients, olfactory axon development and migration of GnRH<sup>+ </sup>neurons are impaired and this leads to a complex molecular pathogenesis which includes hypogonodotropic hypogonadism. This phenotypic alteration is secondary to a deficiency of GnRH in the hypothalamus with consequent lack of release of the pituitary gonadotropin luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), involved in gonadal maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Understanding the molecular mechanisms coordinated by AP-2&#x003b1; in GN-11 neuron migration can elucidate the role of AP-2 in the control of reproduction. No data are available for a possible role of AP-2&#x003b1; in reproduction since the knock-out models die perinatally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. By knocking down AP-2&#x003b1;, the only AP-2 isoform present in GN-11 cells, we demonstrated that AP-2&#x003b1; controls cell proliferation and cell movement via the activation of sets of specific genes interconnected with each other as revealed by microarray analysis and IPA. In particular, we demonstrated that migration depends on adhesion related kinase (<italic>Axl</italic>) gene expression induced by AP-2&#x003b1; following direct binding of this transcription factor to the canonical AP-2 binding sites present on Axl promoter.</p><p>AP-2 proteins are known to play relevant roles in neuron gene expression regulation and nervous system development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Their expression coincides with specific developmental programmes such as the formation of the neural crest or the neural tube closure as demonstrated by AP-2&#x003b1; ablation in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Down-regulation of AP-2&#x003b1; in GN-11 neurons induces increased proliferation and the modulation of several genes known to be involved in cell cycle control such as cyclin D1 (<italic>Ccdn1</italic>), <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>, cell division cycle 2 homologue A (<italic>Cdc2a</italic>) and <italic>Wisp1</italic>. Interestingly, by comparing the microarray results obtained from GN-11 neurons and MEFs analyses we observed opposite modulations for genes involved in proliferation (i.e. <italic>Cdc2a, Skp2</italic>). These discrepancies could explain why the AP-2&#x003b1;-dependent modulation of proliferation we observed for GN-11 neurons was opposite to what was found for MEFs by Pfisterer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] suggesting that AP-2&#x003b1; is able to modulate the same genes in opposite directions depending on the cell context. However, our results are in line with previous AP-2&#x003b1; overexpression experiments which have shown induction of p21<sup>WAF/CIP </sup>and inhibition of DNA synthesis and colony formation in various cell systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The direct mechanism of migration regulation by AP-2&#x003b1; in GnRH<sup>+ </sup>neurons found in our work is perfectly in agreement with the observations presented previously in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Kramer et al. revealed a decreased number of LHRH neurons in the brain of AP-2&#x003b1;-null mice at E13.5&#x02013;E14.5 correlating with normal onset of AP-2&#x003b1; expression in LHRH neurons as they entered the central nervous system. One of the possibilities the authors suggested, among several, was that loss of AP-2&#x003b1; affected movement and migration of LHRH neurons to their appropriate target sites, however no molecular mechanism was presented at that time. From our microarray analysis in AP-2&#x003b1; silenced GN-11 neurons and AP-2&#x003b1; knock-out MEFs we learned that a large group of genes, much larger than we hypothesized, involved in cell growth and/or cell movement is modulated by AP-2&#x003b1;. Most of these genes were not known to be AP-2&#x003b1; direct or indirect targets therefore our investigation was essential in identifying gene expression profiles as well as the signal transduction pathways in which these genes operate. Known AP-2&#x003b1; regulated genes were identified correctly, i.e. <italic>Mmp2 </italic>(see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]).</p><p>Some modulated genes involved in GN-11 neuron migration were tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (<italic>Timp1 </italic>and <italic>Timp2</italic>), metalloproteinase 2 (<italic>Mmp2</italic>), stathmin 1 (<italic>Stmn1</italic>), procollagens (<italic>Col5a1 </italic>and <italic>Col6a1</italic>), <italic>Wisp1 </italic>and the receptor tyrosine kinase <italic>Axl</italic>. In AP-2&#x003b1; null MEFs, epidermal growth factor receptor (<italic>Egfr</italic>), wingless-related MMTV integration site 2 (<italic>Wnt2</italic>), coronin actin binding protein 1A (<italic>Coro1a</italic>) and secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (<italic>Sfrp1</italic>) genes turned out to be regulated. It is important to observe that the genetic programmes activated seem to be cell-type dependent. Since only a few genes, i.e. <italic>Timps</italic>, <italic>Mmps</italic>, <italic>procollagens </italic>and <italic>stathmin</italic>, turned out to be modulated in both GN-11 cells and MEFs. The fact that AP-2&#x003b1; silencing in GN-11 neurons or in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or AP-2&#x003b1; ablation in MEFs led to decreased cell movement demonstrates that motility is depending on AP-2&#x003b1; transcription modulation in all of the cell systems analysed, but via distinct gene expression programmes. The pathway connections which involve the various AP-2&#x003b1; regulated genes identified by IPA and specifically involved in cell movement are under investigation. In this work we focused, in particular, on the AP-2&#x003b1;-driven transcription for the <italic>Axl </italic>gene, in GN-11 neurons. It is known that this gene regulates GnRH<sup>+ </sup>cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and that it is differentially expressed in migratory GN-10 neuronal cells compared with the post-migratory GT1&#x02013;7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, the ligand of Axl, the growth arrest specific factor-6 (Gas6), is able to stimulate lamellipodial extension, membrane ruffling and chemotaxis of immortalized GnRH<sup>+ </sup>neuronal cells via the Axl receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We demonstrated that Axl is involved in serum-induced migration of GN-11 neuronal cells since down-modulation of Axl expression led to decreased migration in agreement with the recent data obtained in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We have presented data showing that the <italic>Axl </italic>promoter contains three AP-2&#x003b1; binding sites, which are all functional as demonstrated by the analysis of <italic>Axl </italic>transcription.

This suggests that Axl plays a major role in regulating AP-2&#x003b1;-driven migration in GN-11 cells, although Axl-dependent cell movement has already been demonstrated for other kind of cells, i.e. breast tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have shown that AP-2&#x003b1; regulates a large number of genes in cells expressing this transcription factor. However, the genetic programmes driven by AP-2&#x003b1; are different, depending on the cell type analysed. In particular, we proved that GN-11 neuron migration depends on Axl expression which is directly linked to the presence of AP-2&#x003b1;. It has been recently demonstrated that Axl and one of its family members, Tyro3, are able to modulate female reproduction by influencing GnRH<sup>+ </sup>neuron survival and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Based on these findings we can predict a connection between AP-2&#x003b1;, Axl and reproduction. Axl and AP-2&#x003b1; seem to co-localize in the various nuclei of the mouse adult brain analysed using the Allen Brain Atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

Briefly, 750 ng of total RNA were used to obtain labelled cRNA for each sample to hybridize the arrays following Agilent's protocol. Then, slides were scanned, and images were analysed using Feature Extraction software version 7.6 (Agilent Technologies). Raw data files containing feature and background intensities and related statistical parameters were then loaded on the Resolver SE System (Rosetta Biosoftware), together with the scan images and the Agilent Mouse Whole Genome pattern file. Data processing and normalization were performed using the Agilent Mouse Whole Genome platform-specific error model and yielded, for each sequence on the array, an expression fold-change and a p-value to assess the statistical significance of its modulation in the samples compared with references. Three independent preparations of AP-2&#x003b1; +/- and -/- MEFs were analysed in our experiments. By choosing a p-value of 0.01 a false discovery rate of about 5% was calculated. Weighted average was applied to replicate measures. To restrict the analysis to the most regulated genes, an additional filtering criterion was that the average expression fold-change between the AP-2&#x003b1; -/- and the AP-2&#x003b1; +/- MEFs had to be at least 1.5-fold, which lead to the identification of 1492 modulated transcripts (878 decreased and 614 increased).</p></sec><sec><title>IPA</title><p>The Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] is currently the world's largest database of knowledge on biological networks, with annotation curated by experts. We exploited this database to define the presence of functional associations within the genes detected by microarray analysis and to identify differences between the ontological gene classes that were enriched among differentially expressed genes. This ontological gene classification provides the controlled vocabulary to describe gene and gene product attributes.</p></sec><sec><title>Bioinformatic analysis of the Axl promoter</title><p>The <italic>Axl </italic>regulatory regions and the putative AP-2 binding sites were analysed by using the ENSEMBL bank database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and the canonical AP-2&#x003b1; PWM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].
