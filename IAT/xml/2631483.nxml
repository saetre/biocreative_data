They mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores by a coordinated action between 1,4,5 inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors (IP3R and RyR). The aim of this study was to explore the isoforms of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs expressed in mouse C57BL/6 NHsd granulosa cells, characterizing their intranuclear localization and the relation with other Ca2+-handling proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Ovarian tissue and granulosa cells were analyzed by multiphotonic and confocal microscopy to determine the intracellular presence of IP3R types 1, 2 and 3, RyR, thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+-ATPase, and endomembranes. Cellular fractionation and Western blot assays were also used to further confirm the nuclear occurrence of the three IP3R isoforms. Free nuclear and cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations were measured using Fluo-4 AM by confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>By using antibodies and specific fluorophores, was shown that granulosa cells endomembranes contain three isoforms of IP3R, the RyR, and the thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). Interestingly, all these proteins were also detected in the nuclear envelope and in well-defined intranuclear structures. Microsomal membranes depicted characteristic bands of the 3 types of IP3R, but also variants of lower molecular weight. Analysis of nuclear membranes and nucleoplasmic fraction confirmed the nuclear localization of the IP3R types 1, 2 and 3. We demonstrated ATP-induced Ca2+ transients in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Remarkably, the inhibitory effect on ATP-induced Ca2+ mobilization of brefeldin A was more accentuated in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings provide evidence that granulosa cells, including nuclei, express the Ca2+-handling proteins that allow Ca2+ mobilization. All three IP3R were also detected in ovarian slices, including the nuclei of granulosa cells, suggesting that these cells use the three IP3R in situ to achieve their physiological responses.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Granulosa cells are derived from a keratin-positive epithelium, and function supporting the process oocyte maturation. Granulosa cells are follicular somatic cells and the main source of steroids in the ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. They exert their actions by a combination of paracrine signaling and gap junction-mediated communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The physiological events characteristic of granulosa cells such as metabolic control, secretion, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, are regulated by numerous factors, but one of the most prominent is the modulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Ca<sup>2+ </sup>is an ionic and biochemical messenger that regulates a great number of cellular functions by acting as a coordinator and effector of metabolic responses among intracellular compartments, such as cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, and mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Ca<sup>2+ </sup>fulfills its physiological role when: 1) it enters the cell through plasma membrane ion- and receptor-channels, 2) it is released from intracellular stores by ion channels such IP<sub>3</sub>R and RyR, 3) it is extruded from the cell by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Na<sup>+ </sup>exchangers and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases (PMCA) or confined within organelles by others Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases (SERCA), and 4) it is mobilized from or transported into the mitochondria by proton motive force (For review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). Recently, nuclear Ca<sup>2+ </sup>handling has been the focus of reports which postulate new and original roles in Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling for this organelle, including the presence of invaginations inside the nucleoplasm with the ability to release Ca<sup>2+</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Albeit not much information is available regarding the physiological role played by nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup>, it has been reported that excitation-transcription coupling in myocites is regulated in a nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Some reports have suggested that this organelle could be acting as an independent and active Ca<sup>2+ </sup>pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Accordingly, mechanisms for Ca<sup>2+ </sup>uptake and release from the nucleus have been recognized in a variety of cells such as neurons, hepatocytes, pancreatic exocrine cells, and starfish oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling proteins, namely IP<sub>3</sub>R, RyR, and thapsigargin-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA), have been detected in the nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Further support for the notion that this organelle can handle Ca<sup>2+ </sup>by itself are the reports documenting the existence of a nucleoplasmic reticulum in which active IP<sub>3</sub>R, RyR, and SERCA were localized in discrete subnuclear regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Previous reports have established the expression of IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms in ovarian cells, including granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Having reported for the first time the expression and subcellular localization of RyR in granulosa cells, and the coordinated activity between RyR and IP<sub>3</sub>R that make possible the ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>mobilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], in the present study we further characterize the properties and the type of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling proteins present in these cells. We present experimental evidence that the three isoforms of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs are expressed in the ovarian tissue of C57BL/6 <italic>NHsd </italic>mice. In addition, we demonstrate the presence of all these isoforms in the nuclei of granulosa cells. We also find specific signals in the granulosa cell nuclei using fluorescent probes that recognize RyR, SERCA, and endomembranes. Suggestive evidence of a possible independent Ca<sup>2+ </sup>handling between compartments was obtained by showing a selective inhibitory action of brefeldin A on cytosolic, but not in the nuclear ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Insulin, apo-transferrin, penicillin, streptomycin, fetal bovine serum (FBS), Leibowitz medium (L-15), and &#x003b1;-minimal essential medium (&#x003b1;-MEM) were obtained from Gibco BRL (Gaithersburg, MD.

Subsequently the mice were decapitated; and the ovaries were removed and cleaned to eliminate the adjacent tissue, then incubated in PBS-40 mg/ml PFA for 4 h at room temperature. Isolated ovaries were transferred to PBS containing 300 mg/ml sucrose and incubated for 12 h at 4&#x000b0;C. Finally, the ovaries were put into Jung Tissue Freezing Medium and preserved at -20&#x000b0;C for 12 h. Cryostat sections of 8&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;m were used.

Anti-IP<sub>3</sub>R types 1, 2, and 3 antibodies diluted 1:200 with 50 mg/ml fat-free milk in PBS including 1 &#x003bc;l/ml Triton X-100 (PBST) (to block residual protein-binding sites) were added. The cells were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C and then washed three times with PBS. In order to detect the primary antibody, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-goat IgG-TR or anti-goat IgG (H-L) FITC-Conjugate, diluted 1:1000 in PBST for 1 h at room temperature, and washed six times in PBST. The coverslips were protected with DAPCO, an aqueous mounting medium. Visualization was performed in a confocal microscope with appropriate filters.

Briefly, mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the ovaries were dissected and gently homogenized with a silicon-coated glass homogenizer in SET buffer (containing in mM): 300 sucrose, 1 EDTA, 1, 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 Tris-HCl pH 8.0. The buffer was supplemented with the following peptidase inhibitors: 0.2 mM PMSF and 10 &#x003bc;g/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin or Protease inhibitor cocktail tablets. The homogenized tissue was centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min to remove residual tissue and heavy particles. The supernatant was recovered and then centrifuged at 105,000 g for 45 min. Microsomal precipitates were diluted in SET buffer. Membranes were kept at -80&#x000b0;C until use. Protein was determined according to the method of Lowry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Membrane fractions were boiled for 10 min and loaded onto 60 mg/ml SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Ovarian proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a Mini Trans Blot Semi dry transfer cell (BioRad, Hercules CA). The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked 2 h in PBS-0.5 &#x003bc;l/ml Tween-2 supplemented with 50 mg/ml fat-free milk. After 3 washes with 150 mM NaCl-0.5 &#x003bc;l/ml Tween-20 (NaCl-T), each for 10 min, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with the primary antibody (Goat polyclonal IgG anti-IP<sub>3</sub>R types 1, 2, and 3, dilution 1:250) in PBST supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA, washed again three times with NaCl-T for 10 min and incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody (rabbit anti goat IgG-AP, dilution 1:500) in PBST supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA.

The coverslips were mounted in a recording chamber and placed in a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. To apply the drugs, a home-made multichannel perfusion system was used. Perfusion of the solutions was continuous at 1 ml/min. Confocal images were obtained using a Nikon Plan-Flour &#x000d7; 20 multi-immersion objective (numerical aperture = 0.75) and captured at a resolution of 640 &#x000d7; 640 pixels in the scan mode (1 image/min).

All three types of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs were expressed at discernible levels, but in different patterns. Apparently, IP<sub>3</sub>R types 2 and 3 were the most abundant, whereas IP<sub>3</sub>R type 1 was detected in lesser amount, especially in the cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, images in the first column). Remarkably, the nuclear signal of all three IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms was intense and well defined. Confirmation of the nuclear localization of the three IP<sub>3</sub>Rs isoforms was obtained by co-localization with DAPI, which is a specific nuclear marker (Nuclei and Merge columns in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Images seen at higher magnification show an intricate cytoplasmic pattern for the three types of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs, with the signals for type 2 and 3 extended more towards the periphery of the cell (fourth column of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In addition, magnified images clearly display nuclear signals for the three isoforms in both the nuclear envelope and the interior of the organelle. To further confirm the nuclear localization of the IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms, the fifth column depicts a z-stack reconstruction (&#x02248;13 optical slices corresponding to 4 &#x003bc;m section) of the granulosa cells nuclei. It can be seen that the 3 types of IP<sub>3</sub>R show intranuclear localization, being more abundant the isoform 2 and 3. Therefore, primary cultures of mouse granulosa cells co-express all three IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms, and unexpectedly, all of them are present within the nuclei. Low signal, barely detectable, was observed when the primary antibodies were omitted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, insets in first column). To estimate the difference between the cytoplasmic and the nuclear IP<sub>3</sub>R distribution, a semi-quantitative analyzes was done (histograms at the bottom of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; cells analyzed &#x02248; 20; n = 5). IP<sub>3</sub>R type 1 and 2 showed an increased nuclear presence, whereas IP<sub>3</sub>R type 3 displayed similar signals in both compartments.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Nuclear and cytoplasmic location of IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms in mouse granulosa cells</bold>.

The first column shows the fluorescent signal elicited by the primary antibodies against IP<sub>3</sub>R types 1, 2, and 3, followed by the TX-Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Magenta color). No signal was detected when the primary antibodies were omitted (insets in first column). The second column depicts the fluorescent signal associated with the nuclear marker DAPI (Cyan color). The third column is the combination of the images in the first and second columns (merge), and the fourth column is a magnification of a selected sector of the merged image that strongly suggests the intranuclear presence of the three IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms.

Application of ATP (50 &#x003bc;M) to the assay promoted Ca<sup>2+ </sup>mobilization by activation of purinergic G-protein-coupled receptor P2Y2 in mouse granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The Fluo-4 associated signal was higher in the nuclei than in the cytoplasm, even in basal, non-stimulated conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, first block, and column &#x003b1;). However, this fact could be due to nuclear milieu influence over the fluorescent signal, and not necessarily represent an elevated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>level within the nucleus. Upon ATP stimulation, the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transient elicited in the nucleus was higher than the one recorded in the cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, first block, and column &#x003b2;). After the transient, intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>returned to basal levels, but the nuclear fluorescent signal remained higher than in the cytosol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, first block, and column &#x003b3;). Treatment with the IP<sub>3</sub>R non-competitive inhibitor xestospongin C (5 &#x003bc;M for 15 min) prevented the ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>mobilization in both compartments, without changes in the basal Ca<sup>2+ </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, second block, columns &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3;). Interestingly, the ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transient in the presence of the antibiotic brefeldin A (5 &#x003bc;g/ml for 2 h) showed a differential response comparing the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. In this case, Ca<sup>2+ </sup>mobilization was completely suppressed in the cytoplasm, but in the nucleus the brefeldin A effect was only partial, and a net Ca<sup>2+ </sup>mobilization could be observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, third block, and column &#x003b2;). In addition, brefeldin A treatment promoted a decrease in the basal Fluo-4 associated-signal within the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, third block, columns &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;). These data support the notion that the nuclei in the granulosa cells, as the nuclei of others cellular systems, also have the capacity to mobilize Ca<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>mobilization in the nucleus and cytoplasm of mouse granulosa cells</bold>.

The results are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. RyR formed clusters throughout the cytosol, and its expression within the nucleus was demonstrated by the coincidence of the fluorescent ryanodine derivative with the nuclear marker DAPI. The magnified image depicts more clearly the nuclear and perinuclear localization of the RyR. The fluorescent signal associated with thapsigargin showed the presence of SERCA in the cytoplasm as thread-like structures, and as with the RyR, the nuclear localization of SERCA was also evident from the coincidence with the DAPI signal. With higher magnification, the widespread distribution of SERCA throughout the entire cytoplasm as well as its intranuclear localization can be appreciated. Additionally, mouse granulosa cells were incubated with a fluorescent derivative of brefeldin A, a fungal metabolite that binds selectively to endomembranes, namely endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. As with RyR and SERCA, the endomembrane marker was present in the cytoplasm, where it formed numerous clusters, and also within the nucleus. Co-localization with DAPI further supported the intranuclear localization of fluorescent brefeldin A, suggesting the presence of a membranous system within the nucleus (possibly the nucleoplasmic reticulum) in mouse granulosa cells. These characteristics are apparent in the magnified image. Taken together, these results indicate that the nuclei of granulosa cells in culture conditions express the principal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling proteins, as well as membranal structures in the nucleoplasmic compartment. These findings are similar to results reported in other cellular systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular location of ryanodine receptor, thapsigargin-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, and endomembranes in mouse granulosa cells</bold>.

Both channels are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum membranes, but also within the nuclear structure (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Our data show that granulosa cells express the three IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Detection of the IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms was similar in both experimental conditions tested: in primary cultures (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), and in ovary slices (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Certainly, we do not know if the immuno-detected IP<sub>3</sub>Rs are homo or heterotetramers. However, we have evidence that granulosa cells express low molecular weight variants of IP<sub>3</sub>R types 2 and 3 which could result from regulated proteolysis or mRNA splicing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Hence, granulosa cells have the potential to display a great variety of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling responses based in the molecular diversity of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs forms.</p><p>The occurrence of at least two different isoforms of IP<sub>3</sub>R has been reported in several cellular types, such as hepatocytes (types 1 and 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], lung (types 2 and 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], colonic epithelium (types 2 and 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and deep cerebellar nuclei (types 1 and 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The congregation of the three isoforms of IP<sub>3</sub>R in a unique cellular population is less frequent. Besides the finding from this study in mouse granulosa cells, the three types of IP<sub>3</sub>R have been reported to coexist in rat bile duct epithelial cells or cholangiocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>When two or three IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms are expressed in the same cell, they are usually distributed in different subcellular regions: For example, IP<sub>3</sub>R type 3 is localized in the apical section of cholangiocytes and non-pigmented epithelium cells, whereas the other isoforms are present in the rest of the cell structure, especially in the basolateral region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In the case of the mouse granulosa cells, we did not observe any preferential subcellular location for the IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms: The signal from the three types of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs occurs throughout most of cytoplasm, presumably along the granulosa cells endomembranes, with a less intense signal for the type 1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The identity of the organelles in which the IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms were detected will be treated later.</p><p>In heterologous systems (Sf9 insect cells) the expression of each isoform of the IP<sub>3</sub>Rs presents the same Ca<sup>2+ </sup>gating and similar ionic conductance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. However, they differ in their sensitivity to IP<sub>3</sub>, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and ATP: type 1 shows medium IP<sub>3</sub>-affinity, high ATP-affinity and low Ca<sup>2+ </sup>affinity. IP<sub>3</sub>R type 2 has a high IP<sub>3</sub>-affinity, a medium Ca<sup>2+ </sup>affinity, and is ATP independent. IP<sub>3</sub>R type 3 shows a low IP<sub>3</sub>-affinity, a low ATP-affinity, and a high Ca<sup>2+ </sup>affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>IP<sub>3</sub>R type 3 is related to the triggering of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>waves in diverse tissues, such as polarized epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], as well as to act as an apoptotic mediator in different cellular systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. As to granulosa cells, it is not clear if they can be considered polarized, but some authors postulate a directionality in their function when, as a cellular population, the granulosa cells are surrounding the oocyte. For example, the handling of intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>in the granulosa cells close to the theca is different from the granulosa cells close to the oocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, at least in the ovarian slice, there was no indication of the existence of a cellular sub-population with regard to the three IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms. As to the role of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release channels in promoting Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling, it was reported that the activity of RyR was necessary for ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>mobilization in mouse granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. More systematic studies are needed to define the precise role of the three IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms during spontaneous and ligand-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients in granulosa cells. Although it is well documented that granulosa cells are prone to apoptosis according to hormonal and nutritional factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], the exact role of IP<sub>3</sub>R type 3 or the other two isoforms has not be substantiated during this process when this cell population is luteinized.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear location of IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms in granulosa cells</title><p>IP<sub>3</sub>Rs have long been known to be present within the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum membranes of many cellular types and tissues (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]). However, growing evidence indicates the existence of the IP<sub>3</sub>Rs in other intracellular organelles such as the Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], and nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Interestingly, in several cell types the IP<sub>3</sub>R has been detected in the nuclei, specifically in the nuclear envelope membranes, but also within membranous reticular structures known as the nucleoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This intranuclear system is able to store and release Ca<sup>2+ </sup>in the same way as the endoplasmic reticulum does in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. To our knowledge, the results reported here are the first to show that the nuclei of granulosa cells contain all three isoforms of the IP<sub>3</sub>R. The intranuclear distribution of each isoform of the IP<sub>3</sub>Rs is variable; for example, types 1 and 3 were preferentially localized in the inner nuclear membrane of skeletal muscle myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In contrast, isoform 1 in the nuclei of bovine aortic endothelial cells, bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells, COS-7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], and ventricular myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] was not confined to the nuclear envelope, but distributed uniformly within the nucleus. Type 2 was detected forming part of the nucleoplasmic reticulum in rat hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The exact role of each IP<sub>3</sub>R isoform in the generation and kinetics of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients in the nucleus and cytoplasm of all these cells remains to be explored.</p><p>Nuclei in the granulosa cells contain the most important elements to accomplish Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release and uptake: besides IP<sub>3</sub>Rs, we detected positive and specific signals for RyR, thapsigargin-sensitive SERCA, and endomembranes (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). It has been postulated that the cellular pattern of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>dynamics depends on the isoforms of the IP<sub>3</sub>Rs, RyRs, and SERCAs present in the different organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Indeed, the results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> indicate that cytoplasm and nuclei differ in their capacity for ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>mobilization due to differences in the extent to which brefeldin A alters Ca<sup>2+ </sup>dynamics in the two compartments. Nuclear Ca<sup>2+ </sup>has been shown to be specifically and autonomously mobilized in a great variety of other cellular types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Questions arise regarding the potential functions of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>fluctuations within the nucleus. Several reports have shown that nuclear Ca<sup>2+ </sup>can control the transcriptional activity of certain genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], protein transport across the nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], and translocation of protein kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].
