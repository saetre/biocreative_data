Patient &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AAB and rabbit &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AB were purified using affinity chromatography and characterized both by epitope mapping and surface plasmon resonance measurements. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), and Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-adrenergic receptor were incubated with patient &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AAB and rabbit &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AB and the activation of signal transduction pathways was investigated by Western blot, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and gene expression. We found that phospholipase A2 group IIA (<italic>PLA2-IIA</italic>) and L-type calcium channel (<italic>Cacna1c</italic>) genes were upregulated in cardiomyocytes and VSMC after stimulation with both purified antibodies. We showed that patient &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AAB and rabbit &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AB result in protein kinase C alpha activation and transient extracellular-related kinase (EKR1/2) phosphorylation.

Sympathetic over-activity in hypertension and accompanying excess stimulation of postsynaptic &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR supports the use of selective &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR inhibitors as antihypertensive drugs. However, &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR blockade was discontinued in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) because of a putative increased risk for heart failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003742-Barzilay1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, a highly controversial decision that has been sharply criticized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003742-Shannon1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial 2 (Val-HeFT2) showed that &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR blockade was beneficial in heart failure. &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR can contribute to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

However, the link between &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AB formation and cardiac remodeling remains unclear. We have now performed additional studies to elucidate the pathophysiological relevance of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AAB.

Antibodies directed at receptors can block or stimulate their targets. Hallmark example of the latter action is Graves' disease where antibodies directed at the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor exert an agonistic action. Recently, compelling evidence has been presented regarding agonistic antibodies directed against the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR, the &#x003b2;-ARs, the Ang II AT1-R, and the platelet-derived growth factor-alpha receptor, as reviewed elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003742-Luft1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The antibodies could play a pathogenic role in various cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, cardiomyopathy, preeclampsia, acute humoral rejection, and connective tissue disease.</p><p>Earlier, we speculated that &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AAB could contribute to hypertension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003742-Luther1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Our goal here was to give the notion of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AAB a more robust scientific basis. Thus, we verified our candidate by generating &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AB by immunization. Concomitantly, we subjected patients from our collective who harbored &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AAB to immunoadsorption. We found in our uncontrolled trial that lowering &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AAB titers was associated with a lower blood pressure. We did not perform a randomized double blind, crossover trial. Nonetheless, our study meets class I (safety) criteria and suggests that a future class II (efficacy) trial might be warranted. We cannot exclude the possibility that short-term effects of the immunoadsorption, such as circulating blood volume changes during apheresis or other confounders contributed to the reduction in blood pressure. Since the reduction in blood pressure persisted for the observation period of 180 days, we believe that removal of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AAB by apheresis was the main cause for the blood pressure reduction. Within the five days immunoadsorption period, the level of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AAB decreased gradually. Thereafter, &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AAB could not be detected after successful immuoadsorption in these patients for the entire observation period of 180 days. A similar state-of-affairs has been described for &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-AAB in dilated cardiomyopathy after immunoadsorption. These data suggest that immunomodulation by removal or neutralization of the AAB might represent a potential therapeutic strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003742-Boivin1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We isolated the detected &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AAB and the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AB that we generated against the same epitope in rabbits, using the same affinity purification protocol. Since we used the same peptide sequence for epitope mapping in the cardiomyocyte contraction assay, immunization in the rabbit, and isolation in the affinity column, we are confident that we isolated solely &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AB. Before using this material to learn more about &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR signaling in VSMC and cardiomyocytes, we confirmed binding specificity by functional (cardiac contraction assay and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation) and biochemical (surface plasmon resonance measurement) verification methods. We then performed an Affymetrix gene expression study.

Both genes contribute to signaling pathways in hypertension and atherosclerosis.

Acute administration of the purified antibodies to neonatal cardiomyocytes produced a typically shaped Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> transient.

Voltage-dependent L-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels (L-VDCC) play a crucial role in the regulation of heart rhythm and contractile performance, as well as in smooth muscle tone. The channels open in response to membrane depolarization providing Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ingress into the cell. In the myocardium, this local rise in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration triggers massive Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores inducing in turn contraction. L-VDCC expressed in cardiac and smooth muscle are multi-subunit proteins containing the &#x003b1;1C, &#x003b1;2/&#x003b4;, and &#x003b2; subunits.
