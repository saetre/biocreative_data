Despite their importance in uterine PG production, little is known concerning the specific PLA2 enzymes that regulate arachidonic acid liberation in the uterine endometrium. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the expression and activities of calcium-independent Group VI and Group IVC PLA2 (PLA2G6 and PLA2G4C) and calcium-dependent Group IVA PLA2 (PLA2G4A) enzymes in the regulation of bovine uterine endometrial epithelial cell PG production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Bovine endometrial epithelial cells in culture were treated with oxytocin, interferon-tau and the PLA2G6 inhibitor bromoenol lactone, alone and in combination. Concentrations of PGF2alpha and PGE2 released into the medium were analyzed. Western blot analysis was performed on cellular protein to determine the effects of treatments on expression of PLA2G4A, PLA2G6 and PLA2G4C. Group-specific PLA2 activity assays were performed on cell lysates following treatment with oxytocin, interferon-tau or vehicle (control), alone and in combination. To further evaluate the role of specific PLA2 enzymes in uterine cell PG biosynthesis, cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding human PLA2G6 and PLA24C, treated as described above and PG assays performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Constitutive cell production of PGF2alpha was about two-fold higher than PGE2. Oxytocin stimulated production of both PGs but the increase of PGF2alpha was significantly greater. Interferon-tau diminished oxytocin stimulation of both PGs. The PLA2G6 inhibitor, bromoenol lactone, abolished oxytocin-stimulated production of PGF2alpha. Treatments had little effect on PLA2G4A protein expression. In contrast, oxytocin enhanced expression of PLA2G6 and this effect was diminished in the presence of interferon-tau. Expression of PLA2G4C was barely detectable in control and oxytocin treated cells but it was enhanced in cells treated with interferon-tau. Oxytocin stimulated PLA2 activity in assays designed to evaluate PLA2G6 activity and interferon-tau inhibited this response. In assays designed to measure PLA2G4C activity, only interferon-tau was stimulatory. Cells overexpressing PLA2G6 produced similar quantities of the two PGs and these values were significantly higher than PG production by non-transfected cells. Oxytocin stimulated production of both PGs and this response was inhibited by interferon-tau. Bromoenol lactone inhibited oxtocin stimulation of PGF2alpha production but stimulated PGE2 production, both in the absence and presence of oxytocin. Cells over-expressing PLA2G4C produced more PGE2 than PGF2alpha and interferon-tau stimulated PGE2 production.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Results from these studies indicate that oxytocin stimulation of uterine PGF2alpha production is mediated, at least in part, by up-regulation of PLA2G6 expression and activity. In addition to its known inhibitory effect on oxytocin receptor expression, interferon-tau represses oxytocin-stimulated PLA2G6 expression and activity and this contributes to diminished PGF2alpha production. Furthermore, endometrial cell PGE2 biosynthesis was associated with PLA2G4C expression and activity and interferon-tau was stimulatory to this process.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In domestic ruminants (sheep, cattle, goats) estrous cyclicity is regulated by uterine PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>-induced demise of the corpus luteum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>is released from endometrial luminal and superficial glandular epithelium in an episodic fashion toward the end of the estrous cycle. Oxytocin (OT), of neurohypophyseal and luteal origin, is believed to bind endometrial OT receptors and initiate pulsatile PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>secretion, which in turn, stimulates release of luteal OT and creates a positive feedback loop that results in several series of pulses of short duration which are effective in causing luteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. During early pregnancy, the conceptus protein interferon tau (IFNT) binds to endometrial receptors and attenuates episodic PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>secretion, thereby rescuing the CL from regression and maintaining progesterone production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Release of arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane glycerophospholipids is catalyzed by phospholipase A<sub>2 </sub>enzymes and is considered the rate-limiting step in PG biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Released AA is then metabolized to PGG<sub>2 </sub>by a cyclooxygenase reaction and then to PGH<sub>2 </sub>by a peroxidase reaction, both mediated by cyclooxygenase (COX) -1 and/or -2. Terminal PG synthases, which exhibit tissue-specific distribution, then convert PGH<sub>2 </sub>to bioactive PGs including PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>, PGE<sub>2</sub>, PGD<sub>2 </sub>and PGI<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Although PLA2 activation catalyzes the rate-limiting step in PG biosynthesis, most investigations of the mechanisms and regulation of uterine PG production have focused on the activation and expression of down-stream enzymes, such as the cyclooxygenases and PG synthases. The few studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] that have examined the role of PLA2 in uterine PG production in domestic ruminants have focused on a single enzyme, cPLA2&#x003b1; (Group IVA PLA2 or PLA2G4A). Surprisingly, none of these studies identified consistent changes in expression of protein or mRNA for PLA2G4A in association with alterations in PG production. In contrast, non-specific PLA2 inhibitors significantly diminished both basal and agonist-induced PG production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Mammalian cells contain structurally diverse PLA2 enzymes that differ in their location and regulation [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]]. At least 14 groups, and numerous subgroups, of PLA2s have been classified. These groups include four main families of PLA2s, the low molecular weight secretory PLA2s, the cytosolic PLA2G4s, the calcium-independent PLA2G6s and the platelet activating factor (PAF) acid hydrolases (PLA2G7 and PLA2G8). The intracellular PLA2G4 and PLA2G6 enzymes are specifically important in the regulation of PG biosynthesis because their sites of action are the perinuclear membranes where down-stream AA metabolizing enzymes (cyclooxygenases and PG synthases) reside.</p><p>The first cytosolic PLA2 discovered was PLA2G4A and it has received, by far, the most attention. It is a 749 amino acid, 85 kDa protein that migrates at 100&#x02013;112 kDa in polyacrylamide gels. It is present in the cytosol of resting cells and upon activation by a variety of agonists, undergoes Ca<sup>++</sup>-directed translocation to perinuclear membranes. The N-terminal Ca<sup>++</sup>-dependent lipid binding (CaLB) or C2 domain is essential for membrane association and responsible for translocation in response to stimuli that increase intracellular calcium [14+]. Gene disruption studies have indicated an important role for PLA2G4A in normal fertility, eicosanoid production from inflammatory cells, brain injury and allergic response in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Mice with a null mutation for the gene have fewer implantation sites, smaller litters and fail to undergo labor at term.</p><p>Several additional Group IV PLA2 enzymes have been cloned recently, including IVB, IVC, IVD, IVE and IVF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Of these enzymes, IVC (PLA2&#x003b3;) is of interest because it is constitutively associated with membranes, the major site of prostaglandin biosynthesis, lacks the C2 domain and does not require Ca<sup>++ </sup>for activation. Although first associated with membrane remodeling, recent studies demonstrate that PLA2G4C functions as a signaling PLA2 linked to PGE<sub>2 </sub>production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In the literature, the term calcium-independent PLA2, has generally referred to the Group 6 family of PLA2 enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], despite the fact that Group 4C is Ca<sup>++</sup>-independent as well. Two distinct subclasses of Group 6 have been identified and characterized, 6A (also referred to as iPLA2 and iPLA2B) and 6B (iPLA2&#x003b3;). More recently several novel iPLA2s have been identified, including iPLA2&#x003b4;, iPLA2&#x003b5;, iPLA2&#x003b6; and iPLA2&#x003b7;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These novel iPLA2 family members display primarily lysophospholipase, triacylglycerol lipase and/or transacylase activities rather than PLA2 activity. Group 6A has been cloned and characterized in several species and cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It has a mass of 85&#x02013;88 kDa, contains 7&#x02013;8 terminal ankyrin repeats, and a consensus lipase motif. Several splice variants of the enzyme are expressed yielding multiple molecular weight isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Recently, expression of a 50 kDa Group 6 enzyme in rat myometrium was associated with agonist-induced uterine contractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>All PLA2 enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of the sn-2 ester bond of phospholipids to produce free fatty acids and lsophospholipid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A distinguishing characteristic of PLA2G4A is that it exhibits greater selectivity for lipids containing arachidonic acid than other cytosolic PLA2s. For this reason, PLA2G4A has been the enzyme primarily associated with direct generation of arachidonic acid and initiation of the eicosanoid cascade. However, PLA2G4C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and PLA2G6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] have been associated with agonist-stimulated arachidonic acid release and eicosanoid biosynthesis. In addition, it has been shown that PLA2G6 may mediate release of arachidonic acid directly by hydrolysis of arachidonate-containing plasmalogens or through an indirect, multi-step process involving hydrolysis of diacyl lipids to arachidonyl lysophosphatidylcholine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The objectives of the present study were to investigate the expression and activities of Group 4A, 4C and 6A PLA2 enzymes in association with PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>and PGE<sub>2 </sub>production in bovine endometrial epithelial cell cultures. Results indicate that in addition to PLA2G4A, PLA2G6 and PLA2G4C contribute to regulation of uterine cell PG production and these latter two enzymes are activated in response to oxytocin and INFT, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Bovine endometrial epithelial (BEE) cells were from Cell Applications, Inc.

The rate-limiting step in prostanoid biosynthesis is at the level of PLA2 enzymes but, surprisingly, little is known concerning the regulatory function of specific PLA2 isoforms that mediate arachidonic acid release and are likely coupled to downstream enzymes that synthesize the different PGs in reproductive tissues. Although in vivo studies may provide the most complete physiological conditions in which to evaluate uterine biology, they are not best suited for analysis of some cellular mechanisms involving biochemical pathways. For this reason, we turned to in vitro cell cultures to evaluate PLA2 regulation of PG biosynthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that expression and activity of the calcium-independent PLA2G6 and PLA2G4C in endometrial epithelial cells are differentially regulated by oxytocin and IFNT, resulting in altered prostaglandin biosynthesis.</p><p>Three lines of evidence support the concept that PLA2G6 is involved in oxytocin stimulation of endometrial PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>production. One, the PLA2G6 inhibitor BEL abolished oxytocin stimulation of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>production. Two, oxytocin increased expression of PLA2G6 as determined by Western blot analysis; and three, PLA2G6-specific activity was increased by oxytocin and this response was blocked by BEL. Similarly, the results indicate that IFNT diminished oxytocin stimulated PLA2G6 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, Western blot analysis) and activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) resulting in diminished PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>production (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These results do not exclude PLA2G4A from playing a role in oxytocin-stimulated uterine PG production. Indeed, PLA2G4A knock-out mice fail to initiate labor at term. On the other hand, the results presented may help to explain why previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] failed to identify consistent changes in PLA2G4A expression or activity in response to oxytocin.</p><p>The observation that BEL inhibition of PLA2G6 activity blocked oxytocin stimulation of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>production led to studies that examined the effects of PLA2G6 overexpression on PG production. Cells that over expressed this enzyme produced significantly more PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>and PGE<sub>2 </sub>than control non-transfected cells. Oxytocin increased production of both PGs and IFNT diminished these responses. As expected, BEL inhibited oxytocin-stimulated PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>production. In contrast, BEL, alone or in combination with oxytocin, greatly enhanced PGE<sub>2 </sub>production. Increased PGE<sub>2 </sub>production in response to BEL was also observed in non-transfected BEE cells and, in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], we have repeatedly observed stimulation of PGE<sub>2 </sub>production by BEL in primary cultures of ovine endometrial epithelial cells. Although BEL is a relatively selective PLA2 inhibitor at the concentration used, it has also been shown to inhibit Mg<sup>++</sup>-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAP-1), an enzyme that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Change in PAP-1 activity would not explain the observed increase in PGE<sub>2</sub>. Alteration of the PGE<sub>2 </sub>: PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>ratios could be affected at the level of the PG synthases. To our knowledge, there is no evidence that BEL affects PGE synthase expression or activity. In addition, studies in human monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and rat mesangial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] have demonstrated that stimulation of the arachadonic acid/PGE cascade is mediated by PLA2G6 activation and BEL inhibited agonist-stimulated PGE<sub>2 </sub>production in these cells. These data would argue against a stimulatory activity of BEL on PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthase.</p><p>Functional coupling between different PLA2 isoforms, COX-2 and specific PG synthases has been suggested as a regulatory mechanism of prostanoid biosynthesis in a variety of cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Individual isoforms, coupled to specific signaling stimuli, may act on different cellular pools of arachidonic acid at different locations in membranes. Inhibition of PLA2G6 with BEL blocked oxytocin stimulated PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>production but stimulated PGE<sub>2 </sub>production. One possible explanation for the differential effects of BEL on PG production may be that PLA2G6 is functionally coupled to PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>production which is stimulated by oxytocin and inhibition of PLA2G6 blocks this response. Conversely, inhibition of PLA2G6 may be permissive to activation of other PLA2 isoforms, such as PLA2G4C, which may be functionally coupled to PGE<sub>2 </sub>production. Clearly, confirmation of this hypothesis will require additional studies.</p><p>During early pregnancy in ruminants, IFNT not only suppresses episodic release of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>from the endometrium, but it also enhances production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. PGE<sub>2 </sub>has been proposed to have multiple roles in the maintenance of early pregnancy, including action as a luteotrophic or luteoprotective signal and as a mediator of endometrial receptivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The mechanism by which IFNT up-regulates PGE<sub>2 </sub>production is unknown but Arosh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] have shown that it does not enhance PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthase expression in bovine endometrium. We propose IFNT regulation of PGE<sub>2 </sub>production involves, at least in part, modulation of expression and activity of a PLA2 isoform. Results from cell-free PLA<sub>2 </sub>assays and Western blot analysis demonstrated that PLA2G4C activity and expression were up-regulated by IFNT. Over expression of PLA2G4C in BEE cells increased production of both PGs but the increased PGE<sub>2 </sub>was significantly greater than the increased PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>. Treatment of these cells with IFNT significantly stimulated PGE<sub>2 </sub>production. Together, these results indicate that the PLA2G4C enzyme is coupled to PGE<sub>2 </sub>production and this activity is positively regulated by IFNT.</p><p>Luteolysis, resulting from episodic secretion of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>, is acknowledged, generally, to be orchestrated progesterone, estradiol and oxytocin acting through their respective endometrial receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. During early pregnancy, IFNT diminishes expression of the estrogen receptor- alpha and the oxytocin receptor thereby blocking the OT-PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>feedback loop and preventing luteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. There can be little doubt that diminished oxytocin receptor expression contributes to early pregnancy maintenance in ruminants, but some studies have indicated that IFNt-mediated repression of oxytocin receptors is not absolute. For example, Burgess et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] demonstrated that PGFM release, following bolus inter-arterial oxytocin injection, was similar in day 14&#x02013;16 cyclic and pregnant ewes, indicating that some oxytocin receptor activity remains during early pregnancy; and Mann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] demonstrated in cattle that oxytocin receptor concentrations were not a limiting factor in oxytocin stimulated PGFM release. Based on the results from the present study, it is suggested that in addition to repressing oxytocin receptor expression, IFNT diminishes oxytocin stimulation of PLA2G6-linked PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>production and enhances PLA2G4C-linked PGE<sub>2 </sub>production.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Together, the data indicate that uterine PG production is regulated, at least in part, by the expression and activity of PLA2 enzymes and that specific PLA2 isotypes may regulate the production of specific PGs.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PKT designed and supervised completion of the PLA2 assays, Western blot analyses, over-expression studies and contributed to the drafting of the manuscript.
