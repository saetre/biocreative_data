Despite this success, many of the factors necessary for proper islet morphogenesis and function remain uncharacterized. Previous studies have shown that transgenic over-expression of the transcription factor Hnf6 specifically in the pancreatic endocrine cell lineage resulted in disruptions in islet morphogenesis, including dysfunctional endocrine cell sorting, increased individual islet size, increased number of peripheral endocrine cell types, and failure of islets to migrate away from the ductal epithelium. The mechanisms whereby maintained Hnf6 causes defects in islet morphogenesis have yet to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We exploited the dysmorphic islets in Hnf6 transgenic animals as a tool to identify factors important for islet morphogenesis. Genome-wide microarray analysis was used to identify differences in the gene expression profiles of late gestation and early postnatal total pancreas tissue from wild type and Hnf6 transgenic animals. Here we report the identification of genes with an altered expression in Hnf6 transgenic animals and highlight factors with potential importance in islet morphogenesis. Importantly, gene products involved in cell adhesion, cell migration, ECM remodeling and proliferation were found to be altered in Hnf6 transgenic pancreata, revealing specific candidates that can now be analyzed directly for their role in these processes during islet development.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>This study provides a unique dataset that can act as a starting point for other investigators to explore the role of the identified genes in pancreatogenesis, islet morphogenesis and mature &#x003b2; cell function.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite the recent success with islet transplantation as a treatment for replacing insulin-producing &#x003b2; cells lost in individuals with Type 1 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Ryan1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, the relative shortage of donor tissue necessitates the development of <italic>in vitro</italic> systems to grow functional islets. Studies by various laboratories over the past several years have resulted in the identification of several transcription factors that function in normal pancreatic/islet cell development (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Jensen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>); however, much less is known about the cell surface or extracellular components involved in islet formation and function. Ultimately, the generation of optimally functioning islets <italic>in vitro</italic> will likely rely on a complete understanding of how transcription factor networks and cell-cell interactions regulate proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis of normal pancreatic endocrine cells.</p><p>During pancreas development, islets are formed through a series of morphogenetic events involving cell migration, cell sorting, and cell adhesion. Similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian neurogenesis, pancreatic endocrine cells, of which islets are composed, become committed to the endocrine cell lineage via the Notch signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Apelqvist1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Murtaugh1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Hart1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Hald1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and delaminate from the ductal epithelium. In the mouse, the endocrine cells that will go on to contribute to the mature islets of the adult organism first become apparent at embryonic day (e) 13.5 and continue to form into early postnatal stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Jensen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Committed endocrine cells subsequently differentiate to become five different hormone-producing cell types (&#x003b2;, &#x003b1;, &#x003b4;, &#x003b5;, and PP cells). In the early stages of islet morphogenesis (around e17.5), these hormone-expressing endocrine cells can be found in clusters closely associated with the pancreatic ductal epithelium from which they originate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Pictet1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Teitelman1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Alpert1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Gu1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. These endocrine clusters must lose their tight association with the ductal epithelium and organize in the acinar parenchyma to form typical islets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Pictet1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases in endocrine cells (MMPs; known to be involved in extracellular matrix degradation) is thought to aid in the migration of these cells through basement membrane and extracellular matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Miralles1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. There is also evidence that integrins may be involved in guiding the migration and organization of the endocrine cells, leading to the characteristic islet morphology of an insulin-producing &#x003b2; cell core surrounded by &#x003b1; (glucagon), &#x003b4; (somatostatin), &#x003b5; (ghrelin), and PP (pancreatic polypeptide) cells at the periphery. In 2000, Cirulli et al. demonstrated that &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>5</sub> integrins could mediate the adhesion and migration of putative endocrine precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Cirulli1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite these and other studies, many of the processes involved in endocrine cell migration/delamination and islet morphogenesis are not yet well understood.</p><p>While many of the factors critical for islet morphogenesis remain elusive, a role for cell adhesion molecules has been well described in the formation of morphologically normal pancreatic islets. For example, in transgenic mice, a dominant negative E-cadherin driven specifically to &#x003b2; cells by the rat insulin promoter (RIP) leads to defects in &#x003b2; cell aggregation and islet formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Dahl1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, &#x003b1; cells aggregated into clusters lacking &#x003b2; cells. Additionally, in animals with a null mutation in neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), islets form with &#x003b1; cells randomly distributed throughout the islet rather than being restricted to the islet periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Esni1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In NCAM mutant islets, the subcellular distribution of epithelial polarity markers was also disrupted, which suggests that NCAM may also be involved in cell polarity and/or adhesion of islet cell types.</p><p>In addition to the mouse models mentioned above, transgenic mice over-expressing the cut-homeodomain transcription factor <underline>H</underline>epatic <underline>n</underline>uclear <underline>f</underline>actor <underline>6</underline> (Hnf6) specifically in the pancreatic endocrine cell lineage showed disrupted islet morphogenesis and a form of insulin-dependent diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Gannon1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Defects included aberrant endocrine cell sorting, increased islet size, and failure of islets to migrate away from the ductal epithelium. Due to the fact that these Hnf6 transgenic animals exhibited common features of islet dysmorphogenesis (scattering of islet cell types and abnormal islet size) with the addition of the close apposition of islets to the ductal epithelium, we hypothesized that these animals would serve as a valuable tool in which to identify factors that are critical for normal islet morphogenesis.</p><p>In the current study, whole genome microarray analysis was performed on total pancreatic RNA to identify differences in the gene expression profiles of wild type (WT) and Hnf6 transgenic animals at late gestation (e18.5) and postnatal day one (P1), developmental time points when the events of normal islet morphogenesis are occurring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Ryan1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Hnf6 transcription is dramatically down-regulated in endocrine cells of WT animals at this time and the protein is no longer detectable (Tweedie Ables et.al., submitted), thus magnifying the difference in Hnf6 activity for the study. Additionally, these time points are well before the onset of diabetes in the Hnf6 Tg mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Gannon1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and our unpublished observations), and as such are not susceptible to alterations in gene expression that are common to hyperglycemic animals (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Roche1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>). We provide the list of genes with altered pancreatic expression in response to islet-specific HNF6 over-expression.

We found that maintaining Hnf6 expression in islets resulted in a host of morphological and functional deficiencies, including a scattering of cell types within the islets, abnormal islet size, decreased insulin secretion, and a block to &#x003b2; cell maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001611-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Gannon1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Tweedie1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>). Additional morphometric analysis during embryonic and perinatal development showed that islet composition is also altered in Hnf6 Tg mice. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001611-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, glucagon<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell area was increased in Hnf6 Tg embryos as early as e15.5, and this increase was maintained postnatally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001611-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and data not shown). The increase in glucagon<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell area was manifested by larger glucagon<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell clusters that appeared to be segregated from insulin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001611-g001">Figure 1B</xref>&#x0002a;). Insulin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> area was not affected by the maintenance of Hnf6 until postnatal stages, at which point a significant decrease in insulin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> area as compared to WT controls is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001611-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

The time period of embryonic glucagon<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell population expansion coincides with previous reports of a dramatic increase in hormone-expressing cells in normal pancreas tissue known as the secondary transition, in which pro-endocrine cells that will mature to form the functional units of the adult pancreas are thought to undergo substantial differentiation and proliferation (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Jensen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001611-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001611.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Hnf6 Tg animals exhibit abnormal islet morphogenesis.</title><p>(A) Islet from a four week old WT animal showing insulin-producing &#x003b2; cells at the islet core (green) and glucagon-producing &#x003b1; cells at the periphery (red).

All statistical analysis was performed using GeneSpring 7.0 (Agilent Technologies). Since we were interested in identifying transcripts differentially expressed due to their direct or indirect involvement in islet morphogenesis, RNA isolated from whole pancreas tissue was pooled (3&#x02013;5 animals per pool) to minimize differences associated with biological variability among samples. To provide a robust technical assessment, this pool was assayed in triplicate (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>). Technical replication allows one to evaluate commonalities in gene expression changes and does not reveal differences in gene expression that may be due to inherent biological variability between individual animals, having nothing to do with the genetic manipulation. Our initial observations were subsequently validated independently on individual samples for several of the gene products showing altered expression in the pooled population (see below).</p><p>Gene expression ratio values were calculated by comparing signal intensity values for each individual sample to the average signal intensity value of the control or WT triplicates.

While we hypothesized that as a direct activator of <italic>Pdx1</italic>, over-expression of Hnf6 could lead to an increase in the number of Pdx1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells similar to that seen for Ngn3, our results are indeed consistent with mouse models of Hnf6 loss-of-function.

This may suggest that one or more of these molecules are critical for the &#x0201c;movement&#x0201d; of islet structures away from the ducts during islet morphogenesis, and its down-regulation caused a disruption in the process.

Although many transcription factors critical for these processes have been identified and characterized, information about genes involved in islet morphogenesis has remained rather elusive. In order to take an unbiased approach to the identification of previously unappreciated islet morphogenetic factors, we genetically profiled a model of islet morphogenesis from our laboratory. The Hnf6 Tg animals were previously reported to have diabetes and islet dysmorphogenesis, characterized by a mixed islet phenotype and islets with close apposition to ducts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Gannon1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Since microarray analysis generates vast amounts of data, the resulting data were categorized based on the functional role of each altered transcript. Of primary interest to us were genes involved in the processes predicted to be critical for islet morphogenesis (cell adhesion, cell communication, cell migration, ECM degradation, and cell sorting). In fact, we found that these classes of genes were disproportionately represented in our list of altered genes when compared with their representation in the total probeset present on the microarray.</p><p>There have been few studies addressing potential transcriptional targets of Hnf6 in the pancreas. In one study, Odom and colleagues constructed custom DNA microarrays targeting genomic regions located 700 base pairs upstream and 200 base pairs downstream of transcription start sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Odom1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. They subsequently performed chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with promoter microarrays in order to identify genes occupied by Hnf6 in isolated adult human pancreatic islets. The primary interest in the present study was not to identify direct binding targets of Hnf6, but rather to use the Hnf6 Tg animals as a tool for the identification of genes important for islet morphogenesis. Although the two studies are quite different in nature, comparison of the data sets reveals 16 genes in common between the two studies as well as similar, but not identical, gene products. For example, <italic>Connexin32</italic>, <italic>Hnf4</italic>, and <italic>Meis1</italic> as well as <italic>Claudin</italic>, <italic>Serpin</italic>, and Sec-like family members were identified in both studies (Supplementary Material <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001611.s003">Table S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Odom1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>). Therefore, the information provided in the Odom study suggests that these genes are also direct targets of Hnf6 during islet morphogenesis (e18.5 or P1). The remaining genes identified in the present study, but not found in the Odom analysis, are likely to be a combination of 1. indirect targets, 2. direct targets where Hnf6 binds outside the proximal promoter region, 3. genes that are direct Hnf6 targets during islet morphogenesis but are not expressed in the adult cultured islets, and 4. genes that are secondarily altered due to changes in non-endocrine cells within Hnf6 transgenic pancreata.</p><p>In another study, an inducible <italic>Hnf6</italic> transgene was introduced into INS-1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Thomas1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is not surprising that there are only a small subset of overlapping genes between our analysis and the Thomas analysis, due to some major differences in study design. For example, our study used a mouse Affymetrix chip with RNA from <italic>in vivo</italic> whole mouse pancreas, while the Thomas paper used a rat platform with RNA from a pancreatic &#x003b2; cell line (isolated from rat insulinoma).

We hypothesized that using the Hnf6 Tg mouse as a model for islet dysmorphogenesis would provide an excellent tool for identifying new genes involved in the cellular processes that establish endocrine pancreatic morphology and architecture. We have identified a host of new gene targets, many of which have not been characterized in the pancreas or in the process of islet morphogenesis. Using this data, perhaps in combination with information gained from future microarray analyses of other mouse models, may help to dissect and understand the regulatory networks involved in pancreatogenesis, ultimately leading to a complete picture of how islet architecture contributes to the finely tuned function of endocrine cell types.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Hnf6</italic> expression was driven specifically to pancreatic endocrine cells beginning at e11.5 using a 1.0 kb islet enhancer (&#x02212;2642 to &#x02212;1654) from the 5&#x02032; <italic>Pdx1</italic> mouse promoter region as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001611-Gannon1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Blots were then blocked in 5&#x00025; non-fat milk in TBS (pH 7.6) for one hour at room temperature and probed with the following primary antibodies diluted in 3&#x00025; non-fat milk in TBS and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C: rabbit anti-Pdx1 (a gift of C. Wright, 1/1000), rabbit anti-Ngn3 (Abcam, 1/1000), goat anti-&#x003b2;-actin (Santa Cruz, 1/5000). Rabbit anti-glucagon (Linco, 1/500) was also used to probe blots, but required blocking in 20&#x00025; non-fat milk in TBS (pH 7.6) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, and incubation in primary antibody diluted in 5&#x00025; non-fat milk for one hour at 4&#x000b0;C. Blots were washed in 0.05&#x00025; Tween-20 in TBS for 30 minutes at room temperature with three changes of buffer. HRP-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies were diluted to 1/2000 (anti-goat IgG, Santa Cruz) or 1/5000 (anti-rabbit IgG, Amersham) in 1&#x00025; non-fat milk in TBS and incubated for one hour at room temperature. Following washes as previously described, protein detection was facilitated by the ECL detection system (Amersham) per manufacturer's instructions using Kodak X-Omat Blue film. Protein levels in individual pancreata were then quantitated on a Molecular Imager FX densitometer (Bio-Rad) using Quantity One 4.6 software (Bio-Rad) and normalized to the quantity of &#x003b2;-actin obtained for each sample. Protein levels are thus illustrated as a ratio of WT:Hnf6 Tg. For Pdx1 the density of all three bands (includes both unmodified and post-translationally modified forms of the protein) was included in the quantitation.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR</title><p>RNA was isolated from individual pancreata at P1 as described above.

(A) The samples were quantified in 10mM Tris on a Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer. In addition to concentration, this instrument reports the 260/280 absorption ratio, which can be an important indicator of hidden contaminants. RNA integrity was assessed on total RNA isolated from individual pancreata at e18.5 using microfluidic analysis. The electropherogram it produces makes it easy to detect certain contaminants or degradation, and to calculate the 28s:18s ratio. Intensity and clarity of 28s and 18s ribosomal RNA bands (indicated) was used as a measure of RNA quality in addition to the lack of degradation products below the 18S band. The far left lane is the molecular weight ladder. Lanes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8 represent total pancreatic RNA isolated from HNF6 transgenic animals. Lanes 1, 4, 6, and 9 represent total pancreatic RNA isolated from wild type littermates. For microarray analysis, RNA from all transgenic samples were pooled (5 total), while samples 1, 4, and 9 were pooled (3 total) to generate wild type RNA. Sample number 6 was discarded due to the increased presence of degradation products in this sample. (B) Bioanalysis results from the pooled wild type samples (lane 1) and pooled transgenic samples (lane 2). These samples were labeled and used for microarray hybridization. Lane 3 is the molecular weight ladder.</p><p>(0.46 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001611.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001611.s002"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Statistically significant transcripts altered in Hnf6 Tg pancreata.
