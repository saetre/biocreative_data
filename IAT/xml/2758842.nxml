The cause of visceral hypersensitivity is unknown but is thought to be attributed to inflammation. Previously we demonstrated that a unique set of enteric neurons, colospinal afferent neurons (CANs), co-localize with the NR1 and NR2D subunits of the NMDA receptor as well as with the PAR2 receptor. The aim of this study was to determine if NMDA and PAR2 receptors expressed on CANs contribute to visceral hypersensitivity following inflammation. Recently, work has suggested that dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons expressing the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptor mediate inflammation induced visceral hypersensitivity. Therefore, in order to study CAN involvement in visceral hypersensitivity, DRG neurons expressing the TRPV1 receptor were lesioned with resiniferatoxin (RTX) prior to inflammation and behavioural testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>CANs do not express the TRPV1 receptor; therefore, they survive following RTX injection.

Behavioral studies determined that both inflamed non-RTX and RTX animals showed a decrease in balloon pressure threshold as compared to controls.

Patients with bowel disorders are known to have decreased thresholds to pain for both visceral and somatic stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Ritchie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] reported that patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) experience colonic pain at lower balloon distension pressures than controls following colorectal distension (CRD). Pain associated with low pressure balloon distension is thought to be indicative of visceral hypersensitivity caused by abnormal motility patterns in patients with bowel disorders. The molecular mechanism that is responsible for visceral hypersensitivity is still currently unknown; however, it is thought to be caused by changes in neuronal excitability of visceral afferents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>To date, it is thought that visceral hypersensitivity is mediated by sensory nociceptors of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) that transmit signals from the gut to the lumbosacral spinal cord. Studies have shown a change in expression of SP and CGRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] as well as the activation of the NMDA receptor in response to inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] within DRG neurons as well as spinal neurons. However, Zhou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] reported that the N1 and C1 cassettes of the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit are up-regulated in the colon following 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced inflammation. It was hypothesized that this up-regulation is involved in both visceral and somatic hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, enteric neurons expressing the proteinase-activated receptor- 2 (PAR2) receptor were found to be involved in visceral hypersensitivity. Coelho et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] demonstrated that by administering the PAR2 specific agonist trypsin hyperalgesia occurred in response to CRD in rats. Furthermore, Cenac et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] reported that activation of the PAR2 receptor by proteases generated hypersensitivity symptoms in IBS patients.</p><p>Recently we demonstrated that a unique set of enteric neurons, colospinal afferent neurons (CANs), co-localize with several known nociceptive peptides and receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The aim of the current study was to determine if CANs contribute to visceral hypersensitivity following TNBS-induced inflammation. To date, studies have shown that the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) has a functional role in visceral hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In our previous study we demonstrated that the TRPV1 receptor was not expressed in CAN[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

As previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], CANs do not express TRPV1; therefore, we used an intrathecal and colonic injection of resiniferatoxin (RTX) to lesion TRPV1 expressing spinal primary afferent innervation to the colon. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that all animals that received RTX (n = 50) had minimal to no TRPV1 receptors present in the colon (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>) or in DRG (L6-S1) neurons (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>).

Cell counts determined that 87 &#x000b1; 12 total DRG neurons per lumbosacral DRG innervate the colon using this procedure. Following RTX treatment, we found 26 &#x000b1; 6 DRG neurons per lumbosacral DRG innervate the colon. Thus, RTX treatment eliminates approximately two-thirds of visceral afferent innervation to the colon (p &#x0003c; 0.001) (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). Since RTX treatment does not eliminate all DRG innervation to the colon, we performed immunohistochemistry to verify RTX did lesion all TRPV1 expressing neurons. Cell counts verified that the remaining DiI labelled DRG cells did not express TRPV1 (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) (fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). We also determined that the remaining DiI labeled DRG neurons did not express the PAR2 receptor (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) (fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). This finding is in agreement with data from Amadesi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] which demonstrated that the PAR2 receptor co-localized with TRPV1 receptors in DRG neurons.

However, in control animals a minimal number of CANs co-localize with the N1 and C1 splice variants of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a, b</xref>). Fourteen days post-TNBS inflammation, both the N1 and C1 splice variants were up-regulated, a 50% (10% &#x000b1; 1.145 control; 70% &#x000b1; 3.3 TNBS) and 51% (8% &#x000b1; 8.6 control; 59.8% &#x000b1; 1.7 TNBS) increase in co-localization with CANs respectively (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This is in agreement with another study that found an up-regulation of the NR1 splice variants in the colon following TNBS inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, the co-localization of DiI with the PAR2 receptor appeared to decrease by approximately 50% following inflammation (P &#x0003c; 0.0003) (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a, b</xref>). The antibody raised against the PAR2 receptor recognizes the N-terminal end of the receptor or the un-activated form. A commercial antibody for the C-terminal end of the PAR2 receptor in rat is currently unavailable. We therefore used RT-PCR to detect PAR2 receptor mRNA, and found that the PAR2 receptor is not down-regulated following TNBS induced inflammation (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c, d</xref>). Therefore, the decrease in co-localization in CANs suggests the receptors were activated by proteases released from mast cells following inflammation of the colon. Immunohistochemical analysis determined, 14 days post-inflammation, co-localization of DiI labelled cells with SP decreased approximately 60% as compared to controls (P &#x0003c; 0.0008) (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6e</xref>). The data suggests that following inflammation the PAR2 receptor expressed on CANs is activated thus causing the release of SP.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>NMDA receptor expression on CANs increases following TNBS-induced inflammation</bold>.

We demonstrated that CANs co-localize with Na<sub>v</sub>1.9, a sodium channel that is present on nociceptive DRG neurons as well as enteric neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Although the presence of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 expressed on neurons does not determine if the neuron is a nociceptor, the presence of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 is highly correlated with neurons that are found to be nociceptive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Treatment with RTX resulted in the lesioning of TRPV1-expressing DRG neurons of the lumbosacral and thoracolumbar regions of the spinal cord. RTX also eliminated 70% of the lumbosacral DRG innervation to the colon. However, RTX treatment did not eliminate the visceral hypersensitivity response in TNBS treated animals. Although not definitive, the data suggests that CANs may contribute to visceral hypersensitivity. The visceral hypersensitivity observed seems to be associated with changes in both the NMDA and PAR2 receptors. We determined that the N1 and C1 cassettes of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor are up-regulated in CANs 14 days following TNBS-induced inflammation. Also, TNBS inflammation causes the activation of the PAR2 receptors and this activation may cause the release of SP. Both these receptors have been implicated in mediating the visceral hypersensitivity response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The present study demonstrates that CANs are putative nociceptive neurons that are involved in the plasticity of the colon following inflammation. This and our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] further suggest that sensory information can be transmitted from the gut to the spinal cord by CANs.</p></sec><sec><title>Visceral hypersensitivity present following RTX treatment</title><p>Recently studies have suggested that the TRPV1 receptor is involved in the visceral hypersensitivity response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, our current study demonstrates that elimination of the TRPV1 receptor expressing neurons does not alter the visceral hypersensitivity response to colorectal distension (CRD). It is important to note that our study looks at visceral hypersensitivity 14 days following inflammation. Some studies looking at visceral hypersensitivity have only studied this effect using acute inflammatory agents that do not last longer than 8 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Conversely, Miranda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] demonstrated that application of a TRPV1 antagonist (JYL1421) 14 days following TNBS inflammation resulted in an attenuation of the visceral motor response (VMR) as compared to the TNBS-only group. However, the response was still present as compared to control responses. Thus, the data suggest that blocking the TRPV1 receptor does result in a decrease in visceral hypersensitivity but does not eliminate the response entirely. The authors hypothesized that TRPV1 may be involved in the initial inflammation response and hypersensitivity but not the maintenance of the response. Another study has implicated the TRPV1 receptor in motility. De Schepper et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] used <italic>In-Vivo </italic>techniques in conjunction with capsazepine, a TRPV1 antagonist, to demonstrate that the sensitization of the TRPV1 receptor inhibits colitis-induced abnormal motility patterns. Therefore, it is plausible that the TRPV1 receptor is involved in an extrinsic reflex pathway modulating motility patterns during a state of inflammation. It has also been shown that this abnormal motility reflex was eliminated following ligation of the pelvic nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In addition, Jones, III et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] demonstrated that the TRPV1 receptor may be involved in non-inflammatory visceral hypersensitivity using a TRPV1 knock-out model. The authors demonstrated that TRPV1 -/- mice receiving zymosan and CRD did not show an increase in the VMR response; however, matched controls did have an increase in the VMR response. In this model zymosan did not induce inflammation, as shown by an MPO assay, which is in contrast with studies done in rats showing that zymosan causes inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Thus, our data in conjunction with the studies mentioned above suggest that the TRPV1 receptor may be involved in the mechanical component of the colonic inflammatory response but may not be the major component to maintaining visceral hypersensitivity.</p><p>Furthermore, it is important to note that the present study only looks at the involvement of the lumbosacral region of the spinal cord and its role in visceral hypersensitivity. Other studies have implicated the thoracolumbar region of the spinal cord in the mediation of the visceral hypersensitivity response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Traub et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] demonstrated that both lumbosacral and thoracolumbar regions of the spinal cord were activated during CRD as shown by cFos and cJun labeling. However, the sacral region of the spinal cord had a higher cFos and cJun response to CRD (80 mmHg) compared to the thoracic region. A later study indicated that there is a differential involvement of the two regions of the spinal cord following CRD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. To date, studies have not shown what receptors are involved in thoracolumbar mediation of visceral hypersensitivity and the exact role of this region in visceral hypersensitivity has yet to be determined. In the current study, we have shown that RTX lesions TRPV1 expressing DRG neurons in the thoracolumbar region in addition to the lumbosacral region following an intrathecal injection at the L6/S1 region of spinal cord and an intracolonic injection. Therefore, if the thoracolumbar DRG neurons are involved in visceral hypersensitivity, the present study demonstrates that the TRPV1 expressing neurons are not necessary to mediate visceral hypersensitivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Up regulation of NMDA receptors</title><p>The NMDA receptor expressed on DRG neurons has commonly been thought to regulate visceral hypersensitivity. In addition, the NMDA receptor is expressed on enteric neurons of the colon in both rats and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It was found that the NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor, NR2B and NR2D, are present on colonic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, Zhou et al.

In the present study we found similar results; however, we found that both the N1 and C1 cassettes were up-regulated in submucosal CANs. Studies have shown that when the N1 insert is present in NR1 the current amplitude is increased. This effect was shown to be potentiated by Zn<sup>2+ </sup>and spermine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, Zheng et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] hypothesized that the increase in agonist-evoked currents may be a result of a conformational change induced by the expression of N1. This data suggests that an increase in NMDA receptor activity due to the increased expression of the N1 cassette on CANs may be contributing to the visceral hypersensitivity response observed following RTX and TNBS treatment. We also observed the presence of the C1 cassette on CANs following inflammation. The C1 insert is known to have an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal as well as four serines for phosphorlation. It is thought C1 is involved in the trafficking of newly formed NMDA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Therefore, the presence of both the N1 and C1 cassettes following inflammation could increase the activity of NMDA receptors on CANs causing neuroplasticity in the colon.</p></sec><sec><title>Activation of PAR2</title><p>Recently it was suggested that activation of the PAR2 receptor is involved in inflammation-induced visceral hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In the current study we demonstrated that the N-terminal end of PAR2 receptors on CANs was no longer present following TNBS-induced inflammation. It is known that proteases released in the colon during states of inflammation cleave the N-terminal end of the PAR2 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Our antibody for PAR2 was raised against the amino acid sequence on the N-terminal end of the PAR2 receptor just prior to the cleavage site; thus, the decrease in co-localization translates to an activation of the receptor. Previous studies looking at the role of proteases in IBS patients demonstrated that the activation of the PAR2 receptor can generate hypersensitivity symptoms in IBS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In this study, colonic biopsies from IBS patients were found to have elevated levels of the proteases trypsin and tryptase as compared to non-IBS patients. A study using rats concluded that by administering the PAR2 specific agonist trypsin, hypersensitivity occurred in response to colorectal distention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Hyun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] demonstrated that PAR2 -/- mice showed a decrease in signs of inflammation following TNBS-induced inflammation as shown by H&#x00026;E staining, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, macroscopic damage score, and histological analysis. Furthermore, inflammatory mediators such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) were decreased and cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) was increased in PAR2-/- mice, suggesting that PAR2 receptors play a pro-inflammatory role. Previous studies suggest that activation of the PAR2 receptor causes the release of SP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] SP is known to bind NK1 receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord suggesting this interaction aids in mediating hypersensitivity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Amadesi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] demonstrated that DRG neurons expressing the PAR2 receptor also express the TRPV1 receptor. The authors determined that activation of the PAR2 receptor caused release of SP following capsaicin injections. In the current study we demonstrated that lesioning of DRG neurons expressing TRPV1 receptors also eliminated expression of the PAR2 receptor in DRG neurons that innervate the colon. However, following inflammation, the remaining PAR2 receptors in the colon were activated and the visceral hypersensitivity response was present. Since we know that activation of the PAR2 receptor causes the release of SP, the data suggests that activation of PAR2 receptors on CANs may mediate the visceral hypersensitivity response via the release of SP acting on the remaining NK1 receptors expressed on DRG neurons. Further studies are needed to delineate the exact mechanism of this hypersensitivity response and whether SP is involved.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the present study found that CANs are putative nociceptors as determined by the expression of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 as well as other peptides and receptors commonly found on nociceptive neurons as shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We demonstrated that visceral hypersensitivity is still present in inflamed animals when TRPV1 expressing DRG neurons are eliminated. Following inflammation, CANs express the activated form of both NMDA and PAR2 receptors. The activation of these receptors may induce neuroplasticity in the colon which, in turn, may contribute to the visceral hypersensitivity response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 105) weighing 200-250 g.

Animals were placed within a plastic enclosure on a wire mesh floor. A computer-driven filament was extended up through the mesh floor and exerted an increasing amount of pressure (0-50 g) onto the hind paw. Both hind paws were tested. Mechanical pain threshold was determined by the amount of force required for the animal to withdraw its hind paw. The stimulus was repeated four times with 5 minute intervals and the mean pressures at the mechanical threshold were recorded for each rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Colonic distension</title><p>While anesthetized with isoflurane (1-3% O<sub>2</sub>) a balloon (7 cm in length) attached to small plastic tubing (PE-160; Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) was inserted through the anus and secured in place by taping the tubing to the base of the tail. Rats were placed in a plastic restraining device in order to prevent the animals from removing the balloon. The tubing was connected to a pressure transducer (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, Massachusetts) to perform colorectal distension (CRD). Following recovery from anesthesia, the animals were allowed 10 minutes to acclimatize before behavioral testing began. The rats then received distension of the colon in 10 mmHg intervals (0-80 mmHg) until the first contraction of the testicles, tail, or abdominal musculature occurred. This is described as the visceral pain threshold indicative of the first nociceptive response. CRD was repeated four times with 5 minute intervals and the mean pressures at the nociceptive threshold were recorded for each rat.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Perfusion fixation</title><p>After a survival time of 10 days (for surgery animals) or the end point of the experiment, animals were given a lethal dose of pentobarbital i.p. and perfused through the heart with cold 0.9% saline followed immediately with cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After fixation, the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (L6-S1 and T11-L1) and the colon of the animal were removed.

The sections were visualized with filters for red and green excitation. Images were photographed on a Leica DM LB2 Fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Negative controls, where the secondary was applied to the sections in the absence of primary antibodies, were used to verify that non-specific binding of secondary antibodies to tissue did not occur. All images were processed using the Adobe Photoshop program. For colonic cell counts, at least a total of 100 cells per immunolabel were counted for analysis. For DRG cell counts, all DiI labelled cells were counted per DRG. Cell counts were done using the ImageJ program (NIH, Bethesda, MD) where DiI positive cells (in red) were counted and marked; double labelled cells were determined by superimposing the marked image with the label being investigated (in green).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Primary antibodies used in immunohistochemistry of CANs.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Label</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Host</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Dilution</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Company</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">NR1</td><td align="left">Mouse</td><td align="left">1:500</td><td align="left">BD Biosciences</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">NR2B</td><td align="left">Mouse</td><td align="left">1:500</td><td align="left">BD Biosciences</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">NR2D</td><td align="left">Rabbit</td><td align="left">1:100</td><td align="left">Santa Cruz</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">NK1r</td><td align="left">Mouse</td><td align="left">1:500</td><td align="left">Zymed</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">SP</td><td align="left">Rabbit</td><td align="left">1:250</td><td align="left">Chemicon</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">PAR-2</td><td align="left">Chicken</td><td align="left">1:500</td><td align="left">Aves Lab, Inc.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">TRPV1</td><td align="left">Rabbit</td><td align="left">1:500</td><td align="left">Affinity Bioreagents</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">CGRP</td><td align="left">Rabbit</td><td align="left">1:250</td><td align="left">Courtesy of Dr. Michael Iadarola</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">nNOS</td><td align="left">Rabbit</td><td align="left">1:250</td><td align="left">Chemicon</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">VIP</td><td align="left">Rabbit</td><td align="left">1:500</td><td align="left">Chemicon</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">NF 200</td><td align="left">Mouse</td><td align="left">1:250</td><td align="left">Sigma</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">IB4</td><td align="left">Goat conjugated to IB4</td><td align="left">1:1000</td><td align="left">Invitrogen</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">N1</td><td align="left">Rabbit</td><td align="left">1:500</td><td align="left">Courtesy of Dr. Michael Iadarola</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">C1</td><td align="left">Rabbit</td><td align="left">1:250</td><td align="left">Courtesy of Dr. Michael Iadarola</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Alexa Fluor 488</td><td align="left">Goat anti-Rabbit</td><td align="left">1:1000</td><td align="left">Invitrogen</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Alexa Fluor 488</td><td align="left">Donkey anti-Mouse</td><td align="left">1:1000</td><td align="left">Invitrogen</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Alexa Fluor 488</td><td align="left">Goat anti-chicken</td><td align="left">1:1000</td><td align="left">Invitrogen</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>RT-PCR primer sequences</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Primer name</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Forward Sequence</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Forward Temperature (&#x000b0;C)</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Reverse Sequence</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Reverse Temperature (&#x000b0;C)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Product Length (bp)</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">PAR2</td><td align="left">CACCAGTAAAGGGAGAAGTCT</td><td align="center">59</td><td align="left">GGGCAGCACGTCGTGACAGGT</td><td align="center">59</td><td align="center">598</td></tr><tr><td align="left">GAPDH</td><td align="left">CCTTCATTGACCTCAACTACATGGTCTA</td><td align="center">63</td><td align="left">TAGCCCAGGATGCCCTTT</td><td align="center">55</td><td align="center">720</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR</title><p>Animals were euthanized with CO<sub>2 </sub>and the colon was quickly removed.
