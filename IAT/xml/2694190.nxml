In plasma, SHBG is the major sex steroid-binding protein, regulating their availability to responsive tissues. SHBG is also an integral part of a membrane-based steroid signaling pathway in certain responsive tissues, including the prostate and breast.</p><p>The initial steps of SHBG-mediated steroid signaling in the prostate and breast have been well characterized in cultured cells and tissue explants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Unliganded SHBG binds to a specific membrane receptor (R<sub>SHBG</sub>); the SHBG-R<sub>SHBG </sub>complex is activated by subsequent binding of an appropriate androgen or estrogen, independently of the androgen or estrogen receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. R<sub>SHBG </sub>activation leads to a rapid increase in intracellular cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], presumably through the action of a G protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Studies in cultured cells have demonstrated downstream effects that include protein kinase A activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], increased prostate specific antigen expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], decreased progesterone receptor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and seemingly disparate findings of reduced MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and increased ALVA-41 prostate cancer cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, a biologic role of R<sub>SHBG </sub>signaling in the intact prostate and breast awaits demonstration.</p><p>The source of the SHBG that initializes R<sub>SHBG </sub>signaling <italic>in vivo </italic>is unclear; it could be taken up from the plasma, where it is relatively abundant, or synthesized in cells in which signaling occurs. In addition to the liver which is well known to be the source of plasma SHBG, and testis (which synthesizes the differentially glycosylated SHBG isoform, androgen binding protein (ABP), SHBG protein and mRNA have been demonstrated in other human tissues, including the prostate and breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The relatively stable concentration of plasma SHBG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] makes it a less likely source for the initiation of R<sub>SHBG </sub>signaling, as the physiology of important signaling molecules depends on their variation with time. Other, more variable sources of SHBG would be better candidates. This raises the possibility that the prostate and breast themselves could control local SHBG concentrations, thereby regulating R<sub>SHBG </sub>activation in an autocrine/paracrine manner.</p><p>Most work regarding human SHBG mRNA expression has been based on earlier reports of the existence of two major and two minor transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] (GenBank Accession Number: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="M31651">M31651</ext-link>). A downstream promoter, (P<sub>L</sub>), regulates the expression of a major, eight-exon mRNA transcript that encodes SHBG (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_001040">NM_001040</ext-link>)(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The liver secretes SHBG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; the nascent SHBG translation product is a 402 amino acid precursor protein which is glycosylated and cleaved at its amino terminus to remove a 29 amino acid long leader peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] leading to the secretion of mature SHBG into plasma. Domains responsible for steroid binding and dimerization are encoded within exons 3 and 4[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], while binding of SHBG to R<sub>SHBG </sub>is mediated by a decapeptide sequence encoded within exon 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Mature SHBG has an O-linked glycosylation site at Thr7, and N-linked sites at Asn 351 and Asn 367 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The identical eight exon transcript is also expressed in the testis, which is translated into ABP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In addition to the SHBG/ABP transcript, there is a second major SHBG gene transcript in the testis (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="X16350">X16350</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="X16351">X16351</ext-link>) derived from a second promoter (P<sub>T</sub>), located 1.9 kb upstream of P<sub>L </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It possesses unique 5' end sequences, referred to here as exon 1T, and lacks exon 7. Transgenic mice express a human SHBG species that appears to be attributable to this transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], however, such an isoform has not been identified in humans. In addition to the two major transcripts, two minor human SHBG gene transcripts resulting from alternative splicing of exon 7 have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. These include an SHBG/ABP-like transcript that lacks exon 7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), and an eight exon long transcript originating from P<sub>T </sub>that retains exon 7.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic diagram of the contiguous human SHBG/ABP transcript and alternatively spliced transcripts arising from the downstream promoter, P<sub>L</sub></bold>.

Below, in black, are linear depictions of the two previously described human SHBG gene transcripts originating from P<sub>L</sub>; the four novel transcripts described in this study are depicted in grey. Transcripts are identified on the left by missing exons. Three of five alternatively spliced P<sub>L </sub>transcripts retain the SHBG/ABP reading frame, whereas those lacking exon 7 alone and exons 4&#x02013;7 undergo identical frameshifts within exon 8 that may affect their inherent stabilities (see discussion).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-10-37-1"/></fig><p>The LNCaP (prostate cancer) and MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell lines express SHBG at the mRNA and protein levels and possess R<sub>SHBG </sub>activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], making them attractive <italic>in vitro </italic>models for studying the effects of local SHBG expression on steroid signaling and R<sub>SHBG </sub>regulation. These cell lines retain both alleles of the p53 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], located ~35 kb from the distal end of the SHBG gene locus on chromosome 17p13.1 and, due to this extremely close linkage, we presumed that both SHBG alleles also remain intact. We initially intended to confirm prior reports of SHBG mRNA expression in these cell lines as a prelude to investigating the function of locally expressed SHBG in the prostate and breast. As positive controls for SHBG mRNA expression, we included the human HepG2 (hepatoma) cell line (known to express abundant amounts of the SHBG/ABP transcript) and normal testis tissue (known to express abundant amounts of the major P<sub>T</sub>-derived transcript).</p><p>In the course of that effort, we found that transcription of the human SHBG gene is far more complex than had been previously reported. We performed a detailed structural analysis of human SHBG transcripts from the human LNCaP, MCF-7, and HepG2 cell lines, and from normal human liver, testis, prostate, breast, and brain tissues. RT-PCR based mapping assays revealed the existence of at least three distinct human SHBG gene promoters; we determined transcriptional start sites for each. In addition to the four previously reported transcripts, we identified and characterized 15 novel SHBG gene transcripts resulting from alternate splicing of exons 4, 5, 6, and/or 7. Real-time, quantitative PCR showed that SHBG transcription is tissue dependent, and perhaps, cancer dependent. We also detected a smaller sized immunoreactive SHBG species in LNCaP, MCF-7 and HepG2 cells, which raises the possibility that at least one of these transcripts is translated. Based on our current knowledge of SHBG function, these results could have important biologic implications for the modulation of R<sub>SHBG </sub>activity and cellular steroid signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>SHBG exon 5&#x02013;8 RT-PCR</title><p>Because the longest run of A residues within the human SHBG coding region is only three, an oligo-d(T) primer was selected for first strand cDNA synthesis from LNCaP, MCF-7 and HepG2 cells, and from normal testis. As a control for the initial SHBG RT-PCR assays, first strand cDNA was also synthesized from MCF-7-Tr, a stably transfected cell line that constitutively overexpresses relatively high amounts of the contiguous exon 1L-8 transcript containing the human SHBG/ABP coding region.</p><p>A short SHBG RT-PCR assay, spanning exons 5 through 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], was used to generate partial SHBG mRNA expression profiles for LNCaP, MCF-7, HepG2, testis and the MCF-7-Tr control. Based upon prior reports of SHBG transcription (see Introduction), two RT-PCR fragments were anticipated from LNCaP and MCF-7 cells, a contiguous 521-bp fragment that retains exon 7, and a smaller 313-bp fragment that lacks exon 7. Instead, LNCaP and MCF-7 gave rise to three distinct RT-PCR fragments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). All 521-bp, 313-bp, and 176-bp RT-PCR bands were isolated, reamplified, and sequenced. In addition to the expected 521-bp and 313-bp RT-PCR fragments, whose identities were confirmed by sequencing, we also found a 176-bp RT-PCR fragment of low abundance. The 176-bp fragment was derived from a transcript(s) in which exon 5 is directly spliced to exon 8 (sequence analysis). This same 176-bp fragment was generated from HepG2 and normal testis. HepG2 and normal testis RT-PCR also revealed a faint, intermediate RT-PCR fragment of approximately 384-bp. We were unable to reamplify this fragment and its identity, therefore, is not established. As expected, the MCF-7-Tr RT-PCR control gave rise only to the contiguous 521-bp fragment, undoubtedly because the highly overexpressed full-length SHBG/ABP cDNA transcript overwhelmed the RT-PCR assay. The relative intensities of the 521-bp and 313-bp bands varied dependent on the source of the RNA.

First strand cDNAs, generated from normal liver, prostate, and breast, as well as from brain (which expresses SHBG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], were also included as templates for RT-PCR. Adding further complexity to the picture of SHBG gene expression, the exon 2&#x02013;8 RT-PCR assay generated nine distinct RT-PCR fragments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>; summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Each HepG2, liver and testis RT-PCR fragment was reamplified and sequenced. The largest fragment, 1075-bp, contained the expected contiguous exon 2&#x02013;8 sequence. Four of the remaining eight RT-PCR fragments were comprised of sequences that were consistent with their sizes. From largest to smallest, these transcripts lacked exon 7 (867-bp); exons 6 and 7 (730-bp); exons 4 and 7 (705-bp); and exons 4, 6 and 7 (568-bp). That exon 4 undergoes alternative splicing was confirmed using an RT-PCR assay that spanned exons 3 and 5 (data not shown). A prior report similarly found alternative splicing of exon 4, using an RT-PCR assay that included primers specific for exons 3 and 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. For reasons that are unclear, the four remaining RT-PCR fragments consistently gave sequences that were identical to those described above. For example, we had expected the ~913-bp RT-PCR fragment to give rise to a sequence derived from a transcript lacking exon 4, however, it gave the 1L-8 sequence lacking exon 7. As described below, given our positive identification of an exon 1N-8 transcript lacking exon 4, we suspect that technical factors (perhaps the generation of single stranded species during the PCR process) may have interfered with our ability to positively detect this specific transcript in the 2&#x02013;8, 1L-8 and 1T-8 RT-PCR assays. As expected, only a single, intense contiguous exon 2&#x02013;8 RT-PCR fragment was generated from MCF-7-Tr. The same individual exon 2&#x02013;8 RT-PCR fragments were generated from all three cell lines, albeit in unequal abundances (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of RT-PCR results</bold>.

A short exon 1N-2 RT-PCR assay was also performed on LNCaP, MCF-7, and HepG2 to confirm that exon 1N is incorporated into mature SHBG mRNA transcripts. A single RT-PCR fragment of the expected size was generated from LNCaP and MCF-7, but not from HepG2 (data not shown). All other RACE bands generated from LNCaP, HepG2 and normal testis were either comprised of SHBG sequences that had recombined with sequences from other chromosomes or were not specific for SHBG, and were considered to be experimental artifacts.

These incorporated upstream primers specific for either exons 1L, 1T, or 1N and a common, downstream exon 8 primer. For these RT-PCR experiments, because exon 8 is the last described exon in the human SHBG gene, and it contains appropriate transcriptional processing sequences, the use of a reverse primer complementary to exon 8 sequences demonstrates the likely presence of full length transcripts. For the most part, counterparts of all exon 2&#x02013;8 assay RT-PCR fragments appeared in one or more of the exon 1&#x02013;8 assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>; summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

The sizes of six of the nine HepG2 fragments were consistent with their sequences, whereas three were not, and remain unattributable. Sequence analysis of all 1130-bp fragments confirmed that they were derived from the contiguous SHBG/ABP transcript. This fragment was the sole detectable 1L-8 species in prostate, breast and brain. HepG2 also displayed 1L-8 RT-PCR fragments corresponding to smaller sized, alternatively spliced transcripts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) that lacked exon 7, exons 4 and 7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU352662">EU352662</ext-link>), exons 6 and 7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU352661">EU352661</ext-link>), exons 4, 6, and 7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU352663">EU352663</ext-link>), and a novel, 463-bp RT-PCR fragment. The 463-bp fragment was comprised of exon 1L, 2, 3, and 8 sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU352664">EU352664</ext-link>), representing a transcript lacking exons 4&#x02013;7. To our knowledge, this is the first account of a human SHBG transcript that lacks exon 5 sequences. Alternatively spliced 1L-8 species were also observed in liver, testis, MCF-7 and LNCaP (sequence analysis confirmed that the relatively abundant 922 bp fragment in testis and liver corresponded to the transcript lacking exon 7). The sequences obtained for the remaining three different sized RT-PCR fragments unexpectedly gave sequences that were identical to specific SHBG transcripts described above. Because of the incongruence of their sizes and sequences, and despite repeated attempts at their resolution, their significance remains uncertain.</p><p>The exon 1T-8 assay produced a total of ten individual RT-PCR fragments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Those generated from LNCaP and testis were reamplified and sequenced, as were all of the 1152 bp fragments. Six of the ten fragments LNCaP and testis fragments gave sequences that corresponded with their sizes. As expected, the 943-bp fragment, corresponding to the major exon 1T-8 transcript lacking exon 7, was the most abundant testis transcript. This transcript was found in all samples other than for prostate and breast. The contiguous exon 1T-8 transcript (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU352665">EU352665</ext-link>) was present in all samples tested. Alternatively spliced exon 1T-8 transcripts lacking exons 6 and 7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU352666">EU352666</ext-link>), 4 and 7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU352667">EU352667</ext-link>), and 4, 6, and 7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU352668">EU352668</ext-link>) were also detected. Testis and liver generated a very weak 484-bp 1T-8 fragment that was found by sequence analysis to consist only of exons 1T, 2, 3, and 8 (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU352669">EU352669</ext-link>). Of the four remaining 1T-8 RT-PCR fragments, the smallest was unrelated to any SHBG transcript, while the remaining three fragments gave previously characterized SHBG transcript sequences that were incongruent with their sizes. Sequence analysis confirmed that all 1152 bp fragments from the remaining samples corresponded to the contiguous 1T-8 transcript. Furthermore, the sequences of selected abundant bands from the 1T-8 assay (the 806 bp liver and brain, the 622 bp MCF-7, the 484 bp MCF-7), also confirmed their structures.</p><p>The exon 1N-8 assay produced a total of nine individual RT-PCR fragments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). RT-PCR fragments from LNCaP and MCF-7 were reamplified and sequenced. Six of the nine fragments gave sequences that corresponded with their sizes. The contiguous 1146-bp 1N-8 fragment (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU352670">EU352670</ext-link>) was present in LNCaP and MCF-7, and was faint in testis and prostate. The third largest fragment was found to consist of a mixed sequence derived from two transcripts, an appropriately sized 984-bp fragment that had undergone splicing of exon 4 alone (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU352675">EU352675</ext-link>) and an aberrantly migrating fragment that lacks only exon 7. This result suggests that transcripts lacking exon 4 may have gone undetected in the 1L-8 and 1T-8 assays if their sequence signals were drowned out by more abundant co-migrating species. The 1N-8 assay also generated appropriately sized fragments corresponding to transcripts that have undergone splicing of exon 7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU352671">EU352671</ext-link>), and exons 6 and 7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU352672">EU352672</ext-link>), 4 and 7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU352676">EU352676</ext-link>), 4, 6, and 7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU352673">EU352673</ext-link>), and exons 4, 5, 6, and 7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU352674">EU352674</ext-link>) (the latter did not reproduce well in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).

Contributions from individual promoters were measured using qPCR assays specific for exons 1L, 1T, and 1N, respectively. The samples were normalized against GAPDH expression.</p><p>Overall, the exon 1L, and 1T, qPCR assays gave results that were comparable to the three individual exon 1&#x02013;8 RT-PCR assays. Among the normal tissues, overall SHBG gene transcription, as measured by the exon 2&#x02013;3 qPCR assay, was highest in liver and testis. Transcripts containing exon 1L were most abundant in liver, whereas those containing exon 1T were most abundant in testis. All normal tissues, other than liver, expressed transcripts containing exon 1N. Compared to their respective parental tissues, the three cancer cell lines all displayed reduced expression of exon 1L-containing transcripts, whereas there were varied differences in the abundance of exon 1T- and 1N-containing transcripts. Apparent discrepancies between certain exon 1N qPCR and RT-PCR results could signify that novel 3' end sequences may be incorporated into a fraction of SHBG gene transcripts; this would have gone undetected here due to our exclusive use of an exon 8-based downstream primer in longer range RT-PCR assays. Thus, actual human SHBG gene expression may be even more complex than is presented here.</p></sec><sec><title>Initial Western blot analysis of SHBG protein expression in HepG2, LNCaP, and MCF-7 cells</title><p>We addressed the question of the existence of SHBG isoforms in HepG2, LNCaP, and MCF-7 cells in initial Western blot studies. Immunoblot analysis of solubilized cellular proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, was performed using a polyclonal rabbit anti-human SHBG antibody (WAK-S1012-53, WAK-Chemie, Germany). Western blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) shows that all three cell lines express an immunoreactive protein of the same molecular weight as purified SHBG. A lower molecular weight species of 33&#x02013;35 kD was also detected (it could be greater because the molecular weight marker appears to have run slower than expected). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that such a lower molecular weight SHBG species exists in these cell lines. Since immunoreactive SHBG was not detected in the fetal bovine serum used in the prepared media (data not shown), we believe that this lower molecular weight species is either an isoform derived from one of the alternatively spliced SHBG transcripts, or a proteolytic fragment of SHBG itself. Assigning one of the transcripts described above to this species is difficult without further study, since SHBG has multiple glycoslyation sites that could increase its observed size by up to 6 kilodaltons, and a 29 amino acid long signal peptide at its amino terminus that may or may not be retained. Potential candidates include the 1L transcript lacking exons 6 and 7 which encodes an unmodified protein of 28.02 kilodaltons. If it exists, the exon 1L transcript lacking exon 4 encodes an unmodified protein of 37.87 kilodaltons; without the signal peptide it would have a molecular weight of 34.55 kilodaltons. Further studies should identify the origin of this novel smaller species. Compared to HepG2 and LNCaP, the appearance of multiple larger species in MCF-7 is likely due to differential glycosylation of SHBG itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Western blot analysis of SHBG protein expression in HepG2, LNCaP, and MCF-7 cells</bold>.

Human prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and specific regions of the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] have previously been shown to display immunoreactive SHBG protein. Our 1L-8 RT-PCR assay showed that each of these tissues expresses the SHBG/ABP transcript. Compared to liver, the relative low expression of the transcript encoding SHBG in breast and prostate is consistent with a local effect/need for SHBG in acting on R<sub>SHBG</sub>. Extending this speculation, fibulin-1D and fibulin-2 have been shown to sequester plasma SHBG in the uterine stromal cells of transgenic mice, with a preference for steroid-bound SHBG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Such an interaction could be envisioned as regulating local R<sub>SHBG </sub>signaling and/or sex steroid delivery in the human prostate, where SHBG expression predominates in luminal epithelial cells and R<sub>SHBG </sub>activity is highest in stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>It has been recently reported that SHBG acts to actively transport steroids into cells by binding of the endocytic receptor, megalin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], though this finding has been disputed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Should megalin serve such a function in the breast and prostate, then locally expressed SHBG could be a major player in steroid uptake in these tissues.

Therefore, locally expressed SHBG could play a role in a number of different biologic functions related to sex steroids.</p></sec><sec><title>Biologic significance of alternatively spliced SHBG gene transcripts</title><p>We suspect that only specific transcripts derived from P<sub>L </sub>are likely candidates to encode stably translated SHBG isoforms. The exon 8 reading frame is retained in P<sub>L </sub>derived transcripts that lack exon 4 alone, exons 6 and 7, and exons 4, 6, and 7. The remaining P<sub>L </sub>derived transcripts, which present frameshifts within exon 8, appear less likely to be stably translated; an E326 SNP variant of SHBG, possessing a premature termination codon, is rapidly degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] suggesting that motifs encoded within exon 8 confer protein stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We do not rule out the possibility that the exon 1L-8 transcript lacking exon 4 exists and went undetected due to aberrantly comigrating sequences, considering that we detected an exon 1N-8 transcript that lacks exon 4 from a mixture of comigrating RT-PCR fragments. Supporting this contention is a prior report that showed HepG2 transcripts to undergo splicing of exon 4 alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Based on its size alone, the 1L-8 transcript lacking exon 4 could encode the smaller, immunoreactive species recently described in human sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Based upon their sequences, conventional translational initiation events can not explain how human P<sub>N</sub>- or P<sub>T</sub>- derived transcripts are translated into stable SHBG isoforms. The first potential AUG start codon within exon 1N heads a short, four amino acid open reading frame. The subsequent AUG codon lies at the beginning of a 32 amino acid open reading frame; a termination codon precludes its merge into the exon 2 SHBG/ABP reading frame. Exon 1T is devoid of an AUG start codon, the first potential AUG start codon within exon 2 of P<sub>T</sub>- derived transcripts occurs at the beginning of a short open reading frame consisting of only 10 amino acids. For such transcripts, it has been suggested that translation may initiate within exon 2 at a downstream AUG codon that shares the SHBG/ABP open reading frame, or that they may utilize alternative, rare start codons within exon 1T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We note that, beginning with the CUG at position +13, there are eight possible alternative CUG, UUG, GUG, or AUA start codons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] within the long exon 1T open reading frame that merges with the SHBG/ABP reading frame in exon 2.

The existence of an intracellular SHBG species that does not bind steroid, but retains the R<sub>SHBG </sub>membrane-binding motif within exon 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] would be quite exciting, as it could potentially affect R<sub>SHBG </sub>signaling, as well as other SHBG mediated properties.</p><p>In addition to our finding of a smaller SHBG species in cell lines, human hypothalamus and cerebrospinal fluid have been shown to contain an immunoreactive SHBG species which is 4.3-kD smaller than that of serum SHBG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

Furthermore, the putative human exon 1A region contains no potential start codons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), thus, transcripts originating from a human P<sub>A </sub>would run into the same functional and translational questions as do transcripts derived from P<sub>T</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Relative abundance of human SHBG transcripts in tissues and cell lines</title><p>Transcripts derived from P<sub>L</sub>, P<sub>T</sub>, and P<sub>N </sub>are expressed differentially in normal prostate, breast, liver, and testis. The relative expression of the SHBG/ABP transcript is consistent with our hypothesis regarding local generation of SHBG vs. the utilization of plasma SHBG- that immediate, rapid effects of SHBG, including those mediated by the R<sub>SHBG </sub>signaling pathway, are likely to be regulated through local expression of SHBG within responsive tissues; the concentration and/or availability of plasma SHBG is not responsive to SHBG needs in particular sites. Each of the cell lines we examined had a reduced abundance of total 1L transcripts as compared to their corresponding normal tissues, and more specifically this was the case for the SHBG/ABP transcript. Furthermore, the cancer cell lines examined in these studies had a greater overall abundance of alternatively spliced P<sub>L </sub>derived transcripts than did their corresponding normal tissues. If SHBG gene expression is indeed modulated in prostate and breast cancer, this could alter their androgen and estrogen responsiveness.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our findings provide a broad and detailed picture of human SHBG transcript structure and expression. At the same time, they also raise many new and important questions, including the viability of novel alternatively spliced transcripts, their functions in hormonally responsive tissues, including the breast and prostate, and the role that aberrant SHBG gene expression may play in cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>The LNCaP FGC, MCF-7 and HepG2 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD). LNCaP cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (10-0410CV, Mediatech, Herndon, VA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (100&#x02013;106, Gemini Bioproducts, West Sacramento, CA), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Mediatech), 0.75% sodium bicarbonate (Mediatech), and 100 units/ml Penicillin-100 &#x003bc;g/ml Streptomycin (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY). The clonal MCF-7-Tr cell line, which constitutively expresses high levels of a transcript containing the full length human SHBG cDNA coding region, was generated by stably transfecting MCF-7 cells with the plasmid, pCMV-FLAG-SHBG. This plasmid contains the SHBG cDNA coding region (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_001040">NM_001040</ext-link>) cloned downstream of a CMV promoter, and in frame with three iterations of an amino terminal FLAG tag. MCF-7 and MCF-7-Tr cells were maintained in DMEM (10-017-CV, Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.75% sodium bicarbonate, 10 &#x003bc;M nonessential amino acids (Mediatech) and 100 units/ml Penicillin-100 &#x003bc;g/ml Streptomycin. HepG2 cells were grown in DMEM (10-010-CV, Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 0.75% sodium bicarbonate and 100 units/ml Penicillin-100 &#x003bc;g/ml Streptomycin. Cells were refed every 2&#x02013;3 days and split 1:3 to 1:5 upon attaining &#x02265;80% confluence.</p></sec><sec><title>RNAs</title><p>Total cellular RNAs were isolated from exponentially growing LNCaP, MCF-7, MCF-7-Tr, and HepG2 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total cellular RNAs were purchased from Ambion, Inc.

Duplicate aliquots of liver, testis, prostate, and breast RNAs were similarly tested. RNA aliquots were reverse transcribed to yield first-strand cDNAs using the Applied Biosystems Reverse Transcription Reagents protocol (Applied Biosystems) and products were diluted 1:10 in distilled H<sub>2</sub>O. Taqman assay PCR reactions (Perkin-Elmer-Applied Biosystems) were performed in triplicate in 96-well optical plates that included appropriate negative control reactions and wells, and run in an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System machine. Assay-on-Demand Gene Expression Products (Applied Biosystems) were used; for individual reactions, 2.5 &#x003bc;l of each sample were combined with 12.5 &#x003bc;l of 2&#x000d7; Taqman Universal Master Mix, 1.25 &#x003bc;l of Target Assay Mix and 8.75 &#x003bc;l H<sub>2</sub>O.

Assay by design primers (Applied Biosystems) SHBG exon 1N-1NF (forward primer), SHBG exon 1N-1NR (reverse primer), and SHBG exon 1N-1NM2 (probe) were used [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>].</p><p>Data were extracted and amplification plots generated with ABI SDS software. Threshold cycle (Ct) scores, which represent the cycle number at which fluorescence signal crosses an arbitrary (user-defined) threshold, were averaged for subsequent calculations of relative expression values. For each of the four individual SHBG qPCR assays: 1) exon 2&#x02013;3; 2) exon 1L-2; 3) exon 1T-2; and 4) exon 1N-2, and for each individual cell line and tissue, mean SHBG Ct scores were normalized against mean Ct scores for the endogenous control gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and standard deviations were calculated. Expression ratios for each assay were determined relative to MCF-7 expression by the following calculation: Relative Expression = 2<sup>-&#x00394;Ct </sup>where &#x00394;Ct = normalized sample Ct &#x02013; normalized MCF-7 Ct.</p></sec><sec><title>Western Blot Analysis</title><p>HepG2, LNCaP, and MCF-7 cells were grown in 100 cm<sup>2 </sup>dishes until they were approximately 80% confluent.

Gel electrophoresis was performed at 75 volts in Tris-HEPES-SDS running buffer. Protein transfer onto PVDF membranes was performed at 15 volts for 30 minutes in an SD Transblot Cell (Biorad), using 25 mM Tris-base (pH 7.4), 192 mM Glycine, in 15% methanol as transfer buffer.</p><p>PVDF membranes were blocked by incubating overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in 20 mls of SuperBlock blocking buffer (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% Tween-20 (TBST) with gentle shaking. Membranes were then washed three times for five minutes each with 20 mls of SuperBlock Blocking Buffer/TBST with gentle shaking. Next, membranes were covered with 10 mls of SuperBlock Blocking Buffer/TBST containing a 1/1000 dilution of either a rabbit anti-hSHBG antibody (WAK-S1012-53, WAK-Chemie, Germany) or a rabbit anti-actin antibody (A2066, Sigma). Primary antibody incubation was for one hr at room temperature with gentle shaking, after which membranes were washed as above and covered with 10 mls of SuperBlock Blocking Buffer/TBST containing a 1/2000 dilution of Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG(H+L) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Cat. No. 31460, Pierce Biotechnology). Incubation with the secondary antibody was for one hr at room temperature with gentle shaking, after which membranes were washed as above, equilibrated in PBS, processed with Western Blotting Luminol Reagent (Cat.
