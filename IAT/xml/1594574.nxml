A microarray technology is a very valuable method for the prediction of hormone-responsive activities in various gene expressions. Thus, we investigated the altered gene expression by estrogen and endocrine disruptors (EDs) using microarray technology in the uterus of immature rats. In this study, the expression levels of only 555 genes (7.42%) among the 7636 genes spotted on microarray chips were enhanced by more than two-fold following treatment with estradiol (E2), suggesting that direct or rapid response to E2 is widespread at the mRNA levels in these genes. In addition, elevated expression levels of the genes (over 2-fold) were observed by diethylstilbestrol (DES; 9.01%), octyl-phenol (OP; 8.81%), nonyl-phenol (NP; 9.51%), bisphenol-A (BPA; 8.26%) or genistein (9.97%) in the uterus of immature rats. The expression levels of representative genes, i.e., calbindin-D9k (CaBP-9k; vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein), oxytocin, adipocyte complement related protein (MW 30 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase A and calcium binding protein A6 (S100a6; calcyclin), were confirmed in these tissues by real-time PCR. In addition, the mRNA levels of these genes by real-time PCR were increased at follicular phase when E2 level was elevated during estrous cycle of adult female rats. In conclusion, these results indicate distinct altered expression of responsive genes following exposure to E2 and estrogenic compounds, and implicate distinct effects of endogenous E2 and environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals in the uterus of immature rats.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Environmental chemicals that disrupt endocrine function are suspected for their adverse effects on the reproductive system in wild animals and humans and are being increasingly assumed for their possible participation in inducing estrogenic effects. Furthermore, they are proposed to possess hormone-like properties, i.e., mimicking natural hormones, inhibiting the action of hormones, and inducing abnormal gene expressions. Environmental estrogenic compounds that bind to the estrogen receptors (ERs) can block or alter endogenous estrogen functions in reproductive and developmental stages via an ER-mediated response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Examples of suspected environmental estrogenic chemicals (endocrine disruptors; EDs) include polychlorinated hydroxybiphenyls, DDT and its derivatives, certain insecticides and herbicides (kepone and methoxychlor), plastic components (bisphenol A) and some components of detergents and their biodegradation products (alkylphenols etc.). Although the activity of most of these environmental estrogens is low when compared to endogenous or synthetic estrogens (17&#x003b2;-estradiol; E2 or ethinylestradiol), dietary or environmental exposure scenarios that led to the detection of significant quantities of these substances in human urine and tissue sample have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The profound effects of E2 on cell growth, differentiation, and general homeostasis of reproductive and other systems are mediated mainly by the temporal and cell type-specific expression of different genes, whose products are the molecules controlling these molecular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In rats, the concentration of E2 is consistently low throughout neonatal development and starts to increase after day 28 of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The uterus and ovaries are two of the most sensitive tissues to E2, and both tissues express two forms of ER, ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2;. In particular, ER&#x003b1; is predominantly expressed in uteri while ER&#x003b2; is expressed in ovaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a synthetic estrogen which can induce various reproductive alterations in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Numerous reproductive changes in wildlife populations can be caused by EDs which resemble DES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Alkylphenols (APs), such as octyl-phenol (OP) and nonylphenol (NP), were reported to bind directly to the ER in trout, stimulate citelogenin gene expression in trout hepatocytes, be mitogenic in MCF-7 cells and stimulate transcription in mammalian cells via ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In vitro studies revealed that OP and NP are the most potent estrogenic alkylphenols, and the potency of OP has been shown to be approximately 10<sup>-3</sup>~10<sup>-7 </sup>relative to 17&#x003b2;-estradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, the binding affinity of BPA indicated that it is approximately 10000-fold less potent than E2 and 20000-fold less potent than DES for both ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. <italic>In vivo </italic>estrogenic activities (400&#x02013;1000 mg/kg/day) in immature or ovariectomized rats and mice have been recognized. Thus, the concentrations of EDs such as OP, NP, and BPA, in the present study are expected to have similar effects as those of steroid hormones. In addition, APs are weakly estrogenic in traditional uterotropic assays as evidenced by the increase in uterus weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In vitro assays, E2 has been demonstrated to induce maximal proliferation of MCF-7 cells at 1 nM concentration, and OP and NP have been found to be considerably potent compounds as estrogenic chemicals at 1 and 10 &#x003bc;M, respectively. Treatments with OP and NP inhibited the binding affinity of E2 to ER in MCF-7 cells by a competitive ER binding assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a particularly important environmental estrogen. Not only in it widespread in the environment, but it is commonly ingested by humans, being released by polycarbonate plastics, the lining of food cans, and dental sealants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. BPA only acts as an agonist of estrogen via ER&#x003b2; whereas it has dual actions as an agonist and antagonist in some types of cells via ER&#x003b1; Thus, the activity of BPA may depend on the ER subtype and the tissue involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. ER&#x003b2; has a higher relative binding affinity to genistein (Gen) in <italic>in vitro </italic>assays compare with ER&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Genistein is readily absorbed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and act as a pharmacological estrogen both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>via ERs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Although an actual impact of environmental estrogens on reproductive health is not well defined thoroughly, these chemicals have the potential to disrupt the reproductive system and confirm its estrogen-like activity <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Therefore, the changes in the expression of estrogen target genes are considered to be a useful index for evaluating the estrogenic activity of synthetic compounds. However, it is difficult to predict the full range of effects of estrogenic compounds from changes in the expression levels of only well-known estrogen target genes.</p><p>Reproductive organs are highly susceptible to hormonal exposure during organ development and sex differentiation. In our previous studies, we showed that NP, OP and BPA have estrogenic activity, resulting in uterotrophic effects in the uterus of rats treated with these compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In addition, we demonstrated that the CaBP-9k gene is not expressed in the uterus of immature rats, which do not obtain estrogen from ovaries, and that it is regulated through the binding of the ER/estrogen complex to the estrogen response element (ERE) in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. CaBP-9k mRNA in the uterus is known to fluctuate during estrous cycle of rats depending on serum estrogen level. CaBP-9k mRNA at diestrus was not detectable, but increased at proestrus and reached the highest level at estrus and then decreased as metestrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The aim of this study was to identify estrogen-responsive genes by E2 and endocrine disrupting chemicals in the uterus of rats and to determine whether estrogen responsive genes are differentially regulated following exposure to these estrogenic compounds by microarray analysis and real-time PCR. Finally, we evaluated the correlations between E2-induced and EDs-induced gene profiles, and confirmed the biomarker among altered gene expression for screening potential EDs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals and treatments</title><p>Immature Sprague-Dawley rats (2-weeks of age) with dams were obtained from Orient Co, Ltd. (Gyeonggi-do, Korea). All animals were housed in polycarbonate cages, and used after acclimation to an environmentally controlled room (temperature: 23 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C, relative humidity: 50 &#x000b1; 10%, frequent ventilation and a 12 h day/night cycle). To determine the effect of EDs, each group of five animals (14-days old) was injected subcutaneously (<italic>sc</italic>, 0.1 ml per rat) with E2 (40 &#x003bc;g/kg BW; Sigma-Aldrich Corp, St. Louis, MO, USA), DES (500 &#x003bc;g/kg BW; Sigma-Aldrich Corp), OP (600 mg/kg BW; Fluka Chemie, Buchs, Switzerland), NP (600 mg/kg BW; Sigma-Aldrich Corp), BPA (600 mg/kg BW; Sigma-Aldrich Corp), and genistein (40 mg/kg BW; Sigma-Aldrich Corp) by a single dose daily for 3 days and euthanized 24 h after final injection. All chemicals were dissolved in corn oil (Sigma-Aldrich Corp) as a vehicle. The rats were injected with E2 (<italic>n </italic>= 3) as a positive control or corn oil (<italic>n </italic>= 3) as a negative control daily for 3 days. The uteri were washed in cold sterile 0.9% NaCl solution (0.9% normal saline) and used for microarray and RT-PCR analyses. All rats were euthanized at 24 h after the injection.</p><p>It is believed that exposure to DES or endocrine disruptors might be detrimental to development and differentiation, although the effects may not be apparent until adulthood. In the present study, treatment with estrogenic compounds induced a significant increase in the mRNA expression of specific genes in the neonate rat uterus. To confirm altered gene expression profile by E2 or EDs in the uterus of immature rats, adult female rats were also employed to examine the elevated endogenous E2 in the induction of these genes at proestrus and estrus during estrous cycle. Estrous cycle was determined by the observation of three types of the cells derived from the vaginal smears: leukocytes, cornified cells and nucleated epithelial cells. Four stages of the estrous cycle (proestrus, estrus, metestrus and diestrus) were determined as following criteria: proestrus was characterized by many epithelial cells and few leukocytes; estrus by many cornified cells and no leukocytes; metestrus by some cornified cells and many leukocytes; and diestrus by few epithelial cells and many leukocytes. All animals were smeared daily, and the rats that had three regular cycles were selected. Forty female rats were randomly assigned to four groups according to the respective phase of estrous cycle (proestrus, estrus, metestrus and diestrus, n = 10 each) and euthanized immediately. The uteri were washed in cold sterile 0.9% NaCl solution (0.9% normal saline) and used for RNA extraction. All experimental procedures and animal use were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Chungbuk National University.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation and cDNA microarray analysis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to manufacturer's suggested procedure, and purified using RNeasy total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was digested using an RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen) during RNA purification. Total RNA was quantified by spectrophotometer and its integrity was assessed by running on a 0.8% agarose gel. To make cDNAs from mRNAs for microarray analysis, the same quantity of each RNA sample from the treated groups (n = 5) or control groups (n = 3) was pooled. A cDNA microarray consists of 7636 cDNA spot including Incyte clones, housekeeping genes and Arabidopsis DNA as controls. The experiments were performed on the rat cDNA microarray prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The PCR reactions were prepared according to the standard protocol and reaction mixtures were subjected to be amplified at 35 cycles. The primer pair used for amplification was overlap primer-1 (5'-AAT TAA CCC TCA CTA AAG GG-3') and overlap primer-2 (5'-GTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG C-3'). The size and amount of the PCR products were verified on 1% agarose gel. The PCR products were purified by ethanol precipitation, then resuspended in 15 &#x003bc;l of hybridization solution (GenoCheck, Korea), and spotted onto CMT-GAPS &#x003b1; silane slide glass (Corning, NY) with a pixsys 5500 arrayer (Cartesian Technologies, CA) using 16-Stealth Micro spotting pins. The printed slides were processed according to CMT-GAPS &#x003b1; slide protocol. Briefly, the spots were re-hydrated with 1 &#x000d7; SSC for 1 min and then DNA linked using a UV crosslinker (Stratagene, CA). The slides were soaked in the succinic anhydride/sodium borate solution for 15 min with gentle agitation and then transferred to a 95&#x000b0;C water bath for 2 min. The slides were quickly transferred to 95% ethanol for 1 min and then dried using a centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 20 sec.</p></sec><sec><title>Hybridization with fluorescent DNA probe</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from the treated and untreated tissues from immature or adult rats at the indicated time points using the TRI-REAGENT (MRC, OH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescent labeled cDNA probes were prepared from 50 &#x000a7;P of total RNA by oligo (dT)<sub>18</sub>-primed polymerization using SuperScript &#x003b1; reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, NY) in a total reaction volume of 30 &#x003bc;l. The reverse transcription mixture included 400 U Superscript RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 0.5 mM dATP, dTTP and dGTP, 0.2 mM dCTP and 0.1 mM Cy3 or Cy5 labeled dCTP (NEN Life Science Product Inc.). After reverse transcription, the sample RNA was degraded by adding 5 &#x003bc;l of stop solution (0.5 M NaOH/50 m EDTA) and incubating at 65&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The labeled cDNA mixture was then concentrated using the ethanol precipitation method. After determining the target cDNA quality, cDNA samples derived from the pooled uteri of five individual neonate rats from each treated group were selected and hybridized. The concentrated Cy3 and Cy5 labeled cDNAs were resuspended in 10 &#x003bc;l of hybridization solution (GenoCheck). After two labeled cDNAs were mixed, the mixture was denaturized 95&#x000b0;C for 2 min and then incubated in 45&#x000b0;C water chamber for 20 min. The cDNA mixture was then placed at three spotted slide positions and covered by a cover slip to assess the overall quality of each sample. The slides were hybridized for 12 h at 62&#x000b0;C hybridization chamber. The hybridized slides were washed in 2 &#x000d7; SSC, 0.1% SDS for 2 min, 1 &#x000d7; SSC for 3 min, and then 0.2 &#x000d7; SSC for 2 min at room temperature. The slides were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 sec to be dried.</p></sec><sec><title>Scanning and image analysis</title><p>Hybridized slides were scanned with the Axon Instruments GenePix 4000B scanner and the scanned images were analyzed with the software program GenePix Pro 5.1 (Axon, CA) and GeneSpring 7.1 (Sillicongenetics, CA). In order to allow algorithm to eliminate all bad spots, no data points were eliminated by visual inspection from the initial GenePix image. For signal normalization, housekeeping genes (&#x003b2;-actin) and positive control genes (A. thaliana genes) were spotted onto each slide. The signals of these spots were used for normalization. To filter out the unreliable data, spots with signal-to-noise (signal &#x02013; background &#x02013; background SD) below 100 were not included in the data. Data were normalized by global, lowess, print-tip and scaled normalization for data reliability. Data were sorted of above 2-fold altered genes using GeneSpring 7.1 (Sillicongenetics) and a hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using Pearson correlation. The statistical significance of differential expression was assessed by computing a q-value for each gene. To determine the q-value, we used a permutation procedure, and for each permutation a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-statistic was computed for each gene. The result was considered significant when the logarithmic gene expression ratio of three independent hybridizations was more than twofold the difference in the expression level. The accuracy of microarray analysis in this study was confirmed by real-time PCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Confirmation of microarray analysis with real-time PCR</title><p>The standard curve was generated for a standard RNA preparation by serial dilution (1, 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, 0).

Based on the number of genes expressed in control versus treated samples, the overall pattern of altered gene expression was similar between the control (vehicle-treated) and estrogenic compound-treated (E2, DES, OP, NP, BPA or genistein) rats. Although the number of genes whose expression is altered by any chemical tested is modest, there is substantial change in the gene expression altered or modified by exposure to each compound. The mean values of the intensities of each spot in this study were calculated, and are plotted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The data shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> are typical of the three self <italic>vs</italic>. self comparisons, which showed that a more than 2-fold change would be necessary to overcome the intrinsic variability introduced by the hybridization procedure. For this reason, the data was further filtered to select for genes that showed an absolute differential of at least two-fold or greater. Of the 7479 genes examined, the change in the mRNA expressions of 85 genes was listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>. In addition, treatment with E2 resulted in the induction of 555 genes by more than two-fold. About 7.42% of all genes were up-regulated by E2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), causing no significant difference in the expression of the remaining 92.58% of the genes. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, the expression level significantly increased in the uterus when treated with DES (9.01%) or OP (8.81%). Furthermore, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> shows the common 21 genes induced by E2, DES, and OP in the uterus of immature rats. In addition, a single treatment of NP (9.51%), BPA (8.26%) or genistein (9.97%) induced a significant increase in gene expressions in this tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), and there are 30 common genes by these EDs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).

The expression patterns of several genes up-regulated by estrogen were confirmed to verify the results of the microarray analysis using real-time PCR analysis. The rats were injected with endocrine disruptors to determine their effect on the induction of calbindin D9k (CaBP-9k) mRNA in the immature uterus. The expression level of CaBP-9k mRNA significantly increased when treated with OP (12.2-fold vs. vehicle), NP (14.2-fold) and BPA (1.6-fold) for 3 days (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In addition, CaBP-9k mRNA was markedly induced by a single dose of E2 (9.1-fold) or DES (21.4-fold) as seen in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The induction of uterine oxytocin by estrogenic compounds was further assessed by real-time RT-PCR. An increase in oxytocin was observed in the uterus of rats as expected when treated with a single of OP (13.6-fold), NP (17.4-fold) and BPA (1.5-fold) for 3 days Furthermore, treatment with a single dose of E2 (9.9-fold) or DES (30.5-fold) resulted in an increase of oxytocin in this tissue. Increased expression level of adipocyte complement related protein (30 KDa; Acrp30) was observed when treated with OP (14.1-fold), NP (9.4-fold) and BPA (1.7-fold). In addition, a single dose of E2 (4.1-fold) or DES (19.1-fold) induced a marked increase in Acrp30 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The treatment with E2 (2.3-fold), DES (3.1-fold), OP (2.6-fold), and NP (2.5-fold) altered the expression level of lactate dehydrogenase A (Ldha). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the expression level of calcium binding protein A6 (S100a6) in this tissue significantly increased when treated with OP (3.1-fold) and NP (4.2-fold). In addition, a single dose of E2 (2.8-fold) and DES (5.8-fold) treatment induced a significant increase in the expression of calcium binding protein A6 mRNA in the uterus of rats.

Estrogen plays an important role in various molecular events, but the molecular mechanisms that are regulated by estrogen in the uterus remain largely unknown. Therefore, the identification of estrogen-induced gene expression is essential to understanding how estrogenic compounds regulate uterine physiology and pathology at the cellular level. In the present study, microarray analysis showed that only 7.42% (555 genes) of all genes spotted on the microarray slide were up-regulated by more than two-fold following estrogen treatment, suggesting that direct or rapid responses to estrogen is widespread at the mRNA level. Furthermore, treatments with DES (9.01%), OP (8.81%), NP (9.51%) BPA (8.26%) or genistein (9.97%) showed an induction of distinct genes by more than two-fold in the uterus. Recently, gene profile patterns by microarray technology were determined in the developing uterus and ovaries of Sprague-Dawley rats at different stages of the development exposed to graded dosages (sc) of 17alpha-ethynyl estradiol (EE), Gen, or BPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This analysis of the transcript profile in a dose-dependent manner revealed that a common set of genes are altered, but some of the genes are differentially changed by these estrogenic chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Interestingly, 592 genes of immature rat showed strong and consistent changes in expression after EE exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], indicating that previously identified estrogen-sensitive genes are sensitive to EE exposure and that they are targets of the estrogenic action of EDs in both the uterus and the ovary. In actual, the level of EDs in nature is low compared with using dosage in the present study. For example, several studies have been performed to assess the presence of EDs in milk. EDs were determined in milk and infant formula at concentrations from 0.4 to 81 &#x003bc;g/kg in NP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], or 0.1 to 13.2 &#x003bc;g/kg in BPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], respectively. Although we are aware that we used the high dose of EDs, this study focused to describe estrogen specific genes using cDNA microarray to detect estrogenicity in vivo following treatment with EDs.</p><p>Uterine CaBP-9k may be involved in controlling myometrial activity which is affected by the intracellular calcium level; however, the exact role of CaBP-9k in the uterus is still under investigation by us and other research groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Recently, it has been demonstrated in our previous studies that both CaBP-9k mRNA and protein could be a novel biomarker for estrogenic compounds in the uterus of immature rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Based on the previous results, the present study was performed to further investigate EDs-induced specific gene expression in the uterus following treatment with DES, E2 and estrogenic compounds such as OP, NP, BPA and genistein. Thus, the expression levels of CaBP-9k mRNA were analyzed to confirm the estrogenic effect of these compounds in this tissue. E2 is a major factor controlling <italic>CaBP-9k </italic>gene expression in the rat uterus. The <italic>CaBP-9k </italic>gene is not expressed in the uterus of mature ovariectomized and immature rats which do not have circulating E2 from ovaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Using microarray, the expression level of uterine CaBP-9k mRNA was significantly increased when treated with E2 (4.2-fold), DES (7.32-fold), OP (3.09-fold), and NP (2.57-fold) in the uterus of immature rats [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>]. In pregnant rats, a relative potency of estrogenic compounds indicated OP = NP &#x0003e; BPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Despite different potency in estrogenicity, E2 and the estrogenic compounds tested in this study induced a significant increase of CaBP-9k mRNA in the uterus of immature rats. The expression profile potentially provides a wealth of data about the differences in gene expression between experimental samples; however, these differences do not always reflect realistic mRNA levels. The induction of uterine CaBP-9k by estrogenic compounds was further assessed by real-time RT-PCR. Although the gene expression levels by microarray analysis were not identical to those obtained PCR analysis, the expression patterns of these genes obtained by these two types of analysis were largely similar. In agreement with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], there was no change in the expression pattern of CaBP-9k mRNA during the estrous cycle. Estrogen stimulated the number of uterine oxytocin binding sites, and oxytocin receptor mRNA expression in ovariectomized virgin rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In rats, during the terminal stages of pregnancy, the myometrium is extremely sensitive to oxytocin and this increase in uterine responsiveness occurs in parallel with increases in the number of uterine oxytocin binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This leads to increased uterine responsiveness to oxytocin and the onset of the uterine contractions that facilitate parturition. The change in uterine responsiveness to oxytocin involves an increase in the quantity of oxytocin receptor protein per cell and the number of smooth muscle cells that express oxytocin receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Based on the treatments with EDs, increased expression levels of oxytocin mRNA were observed when rats were treated with OP (14.76-fold) and NP (9.54-fold), and a single dose treatment with DES (5.70-fold) and E2 (5.83-fold) for 3 days. However, treatments with BPA and genistein for 3 days failed to detect the expression level of oxytocin mRNA [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>]. These observations raise the possibility that the increase in the oxytocin mRNA level shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, occurs, at least in part, as a result of the injected estrogenic compounds and that the PCR data and microarray data are in general agreement. Furthermore, the present study indicated at least that oxytocin mRNA which can be amplified with the primer set increase about 2-fold on proestrus compared with the value on metestrus. The mRNA levels of oxytocin increased 2-fold between metestrus and proestrus by Northern blot analysis during estrous cycle, while oxytocin binding increased more than 10-fold within this same interval in the uterus of rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, the expression level of adiponectin (adipocyte complement-related protein of 30 kDa, Acrp30) in the uterus of rats increased in microarray analysis following with E2 (5.86-fold), DES (6.26-fold), OP (5.97-fold), and NP (10.05-fold) treatments. Using real-time PCR analysis, we confirmed the expression of Acrp30 mRNA in the neonatal uteri following injection with EDs. Although the rates of Acrp induction were not identical from microarray analysis, treatment with E2, DES, OP and NP resulted in significant increases in Acrp30 mRNA. Furthermore, our results showed that Acrp30 fluctuated during the estrous cycle, suggesting that steroid hormones play a role in the regulation of Acrp30. Acrp30 is expressed exclusively in the adipocytes, its hormone is exclusively secreted by differentiated adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], and its protein was secreted and detected in plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The levels of the adipocyte hormones, leptin and adiponectin, appear to be correlated with the cell proliferation index and sex steroid receptor abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Furthermore, OVX in young cycling mice induced plasma Acrp30, and E2 implants reversed the effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. However, our results indicate that E2, DES, OP and NP up-regulated its level, suggesting that it does not imply any reverse effect in this tissue.</p><p>The lactate dehydrogenase-A (Ldha) is hormonally regulated in rodents and in highly expressed in the rat mammary gland during pregnancy and lactation, and Ldha mRNA also increases during mammary gland tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. E2 induces lactate dehydrogenase activity in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, and is elevated in estrogen receptor positive or progesterone receptor positive tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The synthesis of Ldha isoenzyme was found to increase significantly in the uterus of immature mice, and expression from the mouse lactate dehydrogenase-A promoter fused to the cat gene in Chinese hamster ovary cells was also induced by E2 and DES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Using microarray, the expression level of uterine Ldha mRNA was significantly increased when treated with E2 (2.17-fold), DES (2.06-fold), OP (1.77-fold), and NP (2.72-fold) in the uterus of immature rats [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>]. In addition, we further investigated the expression of Ldha mRNA related to estrogen during estrus cycle. A significant increase in Ldha mRNA was detected at proestrus and estrus compared with metestrus and diestrus. The expression pattern of Ldha mRNA during the estrous cycle was in parallel with CaBP-9k mRNA, whereas others appeared to peak at estrus compared to their level at proestrus.</p><p>Calcyclin (S100A6), a small acidic protein that weighs about 10 kDa, belongs to the S100 calcium-binding protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. These family members share a common S100 calcium-binding motif and are implicated in several regulatory functions that include protein phosphorylation, some enzyme activities, the dynamics of cytoskeletal components, transcription factors, and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>homeostasis, and also cell proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The effect of E2 on the expression level of calcyclin mRNA in uteri was further examined to elucidate a relationship between expression levels of calcyclin and estrogenic compounds. E2 resulted in an induction of uterine calcyclin mRNA in immature rats. In addition, treatment with estrogenic compounds resulted in a significant increase in the expression of calcyclin mRNA, whose level paralleled those of oxytocin and Acrp30, as shown in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. After adjusting the data, it is clear that major alterations in gene profiles were induced by estrogenic compounds, such as E2, DES, OP, and NP, and that these differences could have a significant effect on uterine function in reproductive tissues during the estrous cycle.</p><p>Taken together, we demonstrated that an alteration in various mRNAs of gene profiles is one of the most significant factors at the transcriptional level in the reproductive tissue following E2, DES or estrogenic compounds. In addition, the expression patterns of CaBP-9k, oxytocin, Acrp, Ldha, and calcyclin mRNAs were altered in the uterus of immature rats during the estrous cycle. In conclusion, these results indicate distinct altered expression of responsive genes following exposure to estrogen and estrogenic compounds, and implicate differential effects of estrogen and environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals in the uterus of immature rats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>Additional file 1</title><p>Altered gene expressions induced by E2, DES, OP, NP, BPA and Gen in the uterus of immature rats.
