Histone deacetylases (HDACs) lead to the compaction of chromatin and subsequent silencing of gene transcription, and they have recently been implicated in a diversity of functions and dysfunctions in the postnatal and adult brain including ocular dominance plasticity, memory consolidation, drug addiction, and depression. Here we investigate the role of HDACs in the generation of neurons and astrocytes in the embryonic brain.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>As a variety of HDACs are expressed in differentiating neural progenitor cells, we have taken a pharmacological approach to inhibit multiple family members. Inhibition of class I and II HDACs in developing mouse embryos with trichostatin A resulted in a dramatic reduction in neurogenesis in the ganglionic eminences and a modest increase in neurogenesis in the cortex. An identical effect was observed upon pharmacological inhibition of HDACs in <italic>in vitro</italic>-differentiating neural precursors derived from the same brain regions. A reduction in neurogenesis in ganglionic eminence-derived neural precursors was accompanied by an increase in the production of immature astrocytes. We show that HDACs control neurogenesis by inhibition of the bone morphogenetic protein BMP2/4 signaling pathway in radial glial cells. HDACs function at the transcriptional level by inhibiting and promoting, respectively, the expression of <italic>Bmp</italic>2 and <italic>Smad7</italic>, an intracellular inhibitor of BMP signaling. Inhibition of the BMP2/4 signaling pathway restored normal levels of neurogenesis and astrogliogenesis to both ganglionic eminence- and cortex-derived cultures in which HDACs were inhibited.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results demonstrate a transcriptionally-based regulation of BMP2/4 signaling by HDACs both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> that is critical for neurogenesis in the ganglionic eminences and that modulates cortical neurogenesis. The results also suggest that HDACs may regulate the developmental switch from neurogenesis to astrogliogenesis that occurs in late gestation.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons are the predominant terminally-differentiated cell type produced in the brain during prenatal development in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Bayer1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

This resulted in a dramatic effect, in that over 50&#x00025; of the cells differentiated into astrocytes, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g004">Fig. 4C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Gross1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>).

In order to test the involvement of endogenous BMP signaling in normal and TSA-treated cultures, cells were treated with two different BMP2/4 inhibitors. Alk3-ECD is a recombinant protein consisting of the extracellular domain of the BMPR1A receptor that can bind to BMP2 and -4 with high affinity, preventing them from binding to the endogenous BMPR1A receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Sachse1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>.

Each inhibitor was added for 24 hours before bFGF withdrawal, with or without 10 nM TSA, and then removed when bFGF was withdrawn. The cultures were analyzed 4.5 days later, at 7 DIV. The use of either Alk3-ECD or noggin (each at a concentration of 250 ng/ml) alone did not affect neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g004">Fig. 4A, D</xref>) or astrocyte production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g004">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). However, addition of either BMP2/4 inhibitor in combination with 10 nM TSA completely restored normal levels of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g004">Fig. 4A, D</xref>). In addition, the production of astrocytes was reduced to levels seen in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g004">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). Longer treatment of cultures with these reagents, starting 24 hours before bFGF withdrawal but continuing for an additional 4.5 days, produced similar results (Neurogenesis: Control: 31.1&#x000b1;0.7&#x00025;; TSA: 8.2&#x000b1;1.1&#x00025;; Alk3-ECD: 30.4&#x000b1;1.1&#x00025;; Alk-3 &#x00026; TSA: 27.9&#x000b1;1.4&#x00025;; Noggin: 30.0&#x000b1;3.9&#x00025;; Noggin &#x00026; TSA: 24.8&#x000b1;2.3&#x00025;, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2, reagent concentrations as above).</p><p>In order to investigate the effect of TSA upon neural stem cell cultures, we next examined the activation of the BMP2/4 signaling pathway. Binding of BMP2/4 to their cognate receptors results in the phosphorylation of two adjacent serine residues in the Smad1/5/8 proteins, followed by their translocation to the nucleus where they act as transcriptional regulators of BMP2/4-responsive genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Chen1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>.

Addition of 10 ng/ml BMP2 to cultures 24 hours before bFGF withdrawal caused an accumulation of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 in the nucleus after just 1 hour of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). This localization was sustained at 4 hours, whereas by 12 and 24 hours it was no longer detectable.

This delay in Smad1/5/8 nuclear localization compared to BMP2 application may reflect the need to induce a change in transcription patterns of genes involved in BMP signaling, such as <italic>Bmp2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>) itself or <italic>Smad7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we investigated two other pathways that are known to regulate neurogenesis in mammals and that had been implicated in the inhibition of retinal neurogenesis in a mutation in the zebrafish <italic>hdac1</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Yamaguchi1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.

TSA, a potent and specific inhibitor of class I and II HDACs, was seen in the GE to greatly reduce neurogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> and almost completely block neurogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic>. In contrast, in the cortex neurogenesis was actually enhanced upon HDAC inhibition. We have identified the BMP2/4 signaling pathway as the target of HDAC activity, both in the GE and the cortex. During brain development HDACs inhibit BMP2/4 signaling, as this signaling pathway is upregulated, beginning at the transcriptional level, upon inhibition of HDACs by TSA. We observed that TSA inhibition of HDAC activity resulted in an increase of histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels already within one hour of drug application, suggesting that corresponding changes in gene expression could take place very quickly, as has been reported before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Arts1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. In principle, the suppression of BMP signaling could be accomplished at the transcriptional level in a number of ways, including the ligands BMP2/4, their receptors, and genes in the signaling pathway downstream of the BMP ligands, such as the Smad family members. Indeed, within 12 hours of TSA application to cortical or GE-derived precursor cultures, we saw an upregulation in the expression of <italic>Bmp2</italic>, and a down-regulation in the inhibitory cytoplasmic factor <italic>Smad7</italic>. Both of these changes could contribute to an upregulation in the BMP2/4 signaling pathway. To prove this point, extracellular inhibition of BMP2/4 activity by noggin or Alk3-ECD restored both neurogenesis and astrogliogenesis to normal levels in TSA-treated cultures derived from both cortex and GE. Although noggin can inhibit other BMP family members, the binding and inhibition of BMP2 and -4 by Alk3-ECD, the high affinity receptor for these growth factors, identifies this BMP subfamily as responsible for the reported effects. Together, the two complementary transcriptional effects in <italic>Bmp2</italic> and <italic>Smad7</italic> may act in a synergistic fashion to tip the balance from neurogenesis to astrogliogenesis in the GE, and to further reinforce neurogenesis in the cortex. We propose that an important role of HDACs in GE-derived neural progenitor cells is to suppress the responsiveness of the progenitors to astrocyte fate-promoting signals from BMP2 and BMP4. Two lines of evidence suggest that these two factors are produced by the progenitors themselves. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the cultures are homogenous at the level of nestin staining in the minimal time period in which TSA exerts its effects, i.e. in the 24 hour period before bFGF withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g004">Fig. 4C, D, E</xref>). The observed levels of <italic>Bmp2</italic> and <italic>Bmp4</italic> gene expression are therefore probably reflective of production by the nestin-positive progenitors. <italic>In vivo</italic>, direct identification of <italic>Bmp2</italic>- and <italic>Bmp4</italic>-expressing cells by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, followed by the labeling of radial glia cells with an antibody recognizing BLBP, clearly identifies radial glia as a significant minority of the cells in the ventricular zone of both GE and cortex that respond to HDAC inhibition by upregulation of <italic>Bmp2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g011">Fig. 11A, A&#x02032;</xref>).</p><p>During mammalian brain development, neural progenitors at first generate primarily neurons and toward the end of gestation switch to the production of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Bayer1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. How do BMP2/4 affect this switch? In our study, a 24-hour treatment with TSA just before bFGF withdrawal is sufficient to inhibit neurogenesis in GE-derived precursor cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>), and up to 4 cell divisions could occur between the cell type that is affected by TSA in this 24-hour period and the generation of neurons or astrocytes 3&#x02013;4 days later, based upon a calculated cell-cycle length of 21 hours (Maya Shak&#x000e8;d, unpublished data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Nowakowski1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>). The affected cell type could in principle be a bipotential progenitor, but it is more likely to represent a progenitor such as a radial glial cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Kriegstein1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>, that gives rise to separate neuroblasts and glioblasts, with BMP2/4 favoring the formation of glioblasts.

Interestingly, we saw an increase <italic>in vivo</italic> in the cortex in the RC2-positive population, with a corresponding slight increase in neurogenesis. This would be consistent with a neurogenic role of these precursors at this developmental time point.

The advanced developmental state of the radial glia in the GE could explain the relative ease with which HDAC inhibition, leading to an upregulation of BMP2/4 signaling, results in a switch to an astrogliogenic program. In contrast, neocortical radial glia are in the middle of their neurogenic program in the time frame we investigated. In this context, the strong expression of the neurogenic factor <italic>Ngn1</italic> has been shown to actively inhibit astrogliogenesis in the neocortex at this time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Sun1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref>, and indeed, <italic>Ngn1</italic> was seen to be upregulated upon HDAC inhibition in precursor cultures derived from cortical progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g003">Fig. 3J</xref>). However, <italic>Ngn1</italic> was also seen to be upregulated by HDAC inhibition in GE-derived precursor cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g003">Fig. 3I</xref>), but it clearly did not show a neurogenic effect upon the cultures, perhaps explained by the fact that its basal level of transcription is much lower in the GE than in neocortex. Finally, HDACs have catalytic activity upon proteins other than histones, including alpha-tubulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Matsuyama1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>, p53, and CBP/p300 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-McKinsey1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, so there is also the possibility that HDACs regulate the acetylation of non-histone proteins important for BMP signaling. Clearly, other factors must be at work to explain the difference in response to HDAC inhibition in the cortex and the GE, and these differences will best be investigated by performing an unbiased gene expression analysis using microarray gene chips.</p><p>It is unclear why GE precursors do not precociously generate GFAP&#x0002b; astrocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> after HDAC inhibition, as they certainly do so in precursor cultures derived from the GE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g005">Fig. 5C, D</xref>). Premature astrogliogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> has been seen in several mouse mutants in neurogenic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Tomita1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Parras1">&#x0005b;79&#x0005d;</xref> and for the DNA-methylating enzyme <italic>Dnmt1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Fan1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>. In the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mutant, the astrogliogenic transcription factors <italic>Stat1</italic> and <italic>Stat3</italic> are upregulated at the transcriptional level, a change correlating with a demethylation of the <italic>Stat1</italic> gene promoter. Interestingly, we also observed an upregulation of both <italic>Stat1</italic> and <italic>Stat3</italic> in both cortical and GE cultures upon TSA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g003">Fig. 3G, H</xref>), without seeing any increase in astrogliogenesis in cortical cultures, which could be explained by the anti-astrogliogenic effect of Ngn1 in cortical precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Sun1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, it could be that pharmacological modulation of histone acetylation levels is not sufficiently strong to overcome inhibitory signals to astrogliogenesis present in the embryonic GE, and that these inhibitory signals are either absent or reduced in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures. Indeed, astrogliogenesis was clearly promoted in dissociated cultures prepared from the GE of embryos that had been treated with TSA <italic>in utero</italic> and then treated with either BMP2, LIF, or both factors together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g009">Fig. 9C</xref>). However, the nature of these signals remains unclear.</p><p>Which HDAC is responsible for the control of neurogenesis in the cortex and GE? Of the five different HDAC inhibitors used in this study, only VPA, which specifically inhibits class I HDACs at the concentrations we have used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Gottlicher1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, did not show any affect upon neurogenesis, although it did inhibit the production and maturation of oligodendrocytes, as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-MarinHusstege1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that class II HDACs may be responsible for controlling neurogenesis in the telencephalon. Of the class II HDACs that we examined, we detected protein expression of HDAC4, -5, -6, and -7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002668-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The expression of HDAC9 has also been reported at the mRNA level in differentiating neurosphere cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Ajamian1">&#x0005b;80&#x0005d;</xref>. As it is possible that these gene products may perform similar functions in the neural progenitors, identification of the individual HDACs involved in neurogenesis may be difficult. In this respect, comparison with myogenesis may prove useful. In the mouse, individual knock-outs of <italic>Hdac4</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Vega1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>Hdac5</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Chang1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>Hdac7</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Chang2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> have not been reported to show a disruption in the skeletal myogenesis program, although all three proteins are clearly important for the <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-McKinsey1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, HDAC5 and HDAC9 have been reported to play functionally redundant roles in heart development <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Chang1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Possible redundancy of HDAC function in neurogenesis from neural stem cells is currently under investigation through sequential and combinatorial knockdown experiments using RNA interference. It will also be important, however, to undertake a closer examination of the various HDAC knockout strains for defects in nervous system development.</p><p>Our results stand in agreement to a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Hsieh1">&#x0005b;81&#x0005d;</xref> showing that several HDAC inhibitors, including TSA, VPA, and sodium butyrate, dramatically increase neurogenesis from neurospheres derived from adult rat hippocampus, which develops as an invagination of the dorsal telencephalon at the same time as the cortex. We did not see such a large increase in neurogenesis in embryonic cortex <italic>in vivo</italic>, but we did observe a doubling of neurogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition to the difference in species and developmental stage examined in these two studies, these results may reflect the different roles that BMPs play in neurogenesis in various regions of the brain. In the developing cortex, BMP2/4 promote the formation of neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Li1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, but in contrast they have been shown to inhibit neurogenesis in neural stem cells derived from the subventricular zone of the embryonic GE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Gross1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data are consistent with an inhibitory role of BMP2/4 upon neurogenesis in the ventral telencephalon. It is of interest to note that ablation of <italic>hdac1</italic> in the embryonic zebrafish also leads to a reduction in neurogenesis, both in the retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Yamaguchi1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> and in motor neurons of the spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002668-Cunliffe2">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. In the former case, Hdac1 was found to suppress both Wnt and Notch signaling. We investigated both of these pathways and found that neither of them seem to play a role in the HDAC-mediated promotion of neurogenesis, at least in GE-derived neural progenitor cells. Whether this reflects a vertebrate class difference between the two model organisms or differences in HDAC function between various regions of the nervous system is unclear.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, HDACs are shown to play an important role in neurogenesis in the developing GE and a modulatory role in neocortical neurogenesis. HDAC control of <italic>Bmp2</italic> and <italic>Smad7</italic> transcription leads to an inhibition of BMP2/4 signaling and thereby a neurogenic program in GE, and in contrast an inhibition of neurogenesis in the cortex. Inhibition of class I and II HDACs with TSA or other HDAC inhibitors causes an increase and a decrease, respectively, in the expression of <italic>Bmp2</italic> and <italic>Smad7</italic>, leading to an elevation in BMP2/4 signaling and a switch to an astrocytic program in the GE and a promotion of neurogenesis in the cortex. Our study suggests that histone acetylation levels play a crucial and similar role in the regulation of the transcription of genes in the BMP signaling pathway in both dorsal and ventral telencephalon, but that this similar modulation of transcription results in opposite biological outcomes. The reason for this difference remains unclear, and therefore future studies will examine this hypothesis in detail, examining global changes as well as specific modifications of core histones at the promoters of genes relevant for BMP2/4 signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany) unless otherwise indicated.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Mouse lines</title><p>All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the regulations of the state of Baden-W&#x000fc;rttemberg, Germany.
