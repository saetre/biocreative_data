We took advantage of these permissive cells expressing mCD81 and the previously described MT81/MT81<underline>w</underline> mAbs to analyze the role of TEM-associated CD81 in HCV infection. Importantly, MT81<underline>w</underline> antibody, which only recognizes TEM-associated mCD81, did not strongly affect HCV infection. Furthermore, cholesterol depletion, which inhibits HCV infection and reduces total cell surface expression of CD81, did not affect TEM-associated CD81 levels.

Almost 80% of infected patients develop a chronic hepatitis that can in the long term evolve either to liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Unfortunately, no vaccine is currently available to prevent new infections and the current treatments are not fully efficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. HCV is an enveloped RNA virus mainly targeting liver cells by a mechanism that has yet to be elucidated. For a long time, it has been difficult to study the different steps of the HCV life cycle because of the difficulties in propagating this virus in cell culture. However, a major step in investigating HCV entry was achieved in the development of pseudotyped particles (HCVpp), consisting of native HCV envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2, assembled onto retroviral core particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. More recently, the development of a cell culture system allowing an efficient amplification of HCV (HCVcc) has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This cell culture system allows the study of the whole life cycle of HCV and, together with HCVpp, also permits the characterization of HCV entry mechanisms.</p><p>Although the early steps of viral entry have yet to be elucidated, accumulated data suggest several cell surface-expressed molecules as entry factors for HCV (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). Among these molecules, the tetraspanin CD81 has been shown to play a key role in HCV entry, acting during a post-attachment step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Like all members of the tetraspanin family, CD81 is composed of four transmembrane domains, a small extracellular loop (SEL) and a large extracellular loop (LEL), which contains a conserved CCG amino acid motif involved in the formation of disulfide bridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The CD81 LEL is the critical region for the interaction with the E2 envelope glycoprotein and for virus entry. The role of CD81 in the species restriction of HCV has been extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and it has been recently shown that in spite of the absence of <italic>in vitro </italic>interaction between murine CD81 (mCD81) LEL and a soluble form of HCV E2, the ectopic expression of mCD81 in HepG2 cells restored permissivity to HCVpp and, in a lesser extent, to HCVcc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These results suggest that CD81 contributes to, but alone does not define, the species restriction and additional cellular factors are likely involved. Moreover, we have recently shown that EWI-2wint, a new partner of CD81, is able to modulate HCV entry in target cells suggesting that, in addition to the presence of specific entry factors in the hepatocytes, the absence of a specific inhibitor may contribute to the hepatotropism of HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Members of the tetraspanin family organize and regroup their associated transmembrane proteins and are involved in various functions such as cell morphology, motility, fusion and signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A major characteristic of tetraspanins is their ability to interact with each other and with other transmembrane proteins, thus building multi-molecular membrane complexes, collectively referred to as the tetraspanin enriched microdomains (TEM) or tetraspanin webs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Membrane cholesterol contributes to the organization of these domains on the surface of live cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Cholesterol is also critical to many pathogens, including HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and <italic>Plasmodium </italic>infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, it has been shown that CD81 is required for <italic>Plasmodium </italic>sporozoite entry and differentiation into hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that specifically recognizes a subset of mouse CD81 molecules associated with TEMs (MT81<underline>w</underline>), Silvie <italic>et al</italic>. have defined the role of TEM-associated CD81 in mice <italic>Plasmodium </italic>infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The similarities between <italic>Plasmodium </italic>and HCV liver infections indicate the importance of studying the role of TEM-associated CD81 in HCV infection.</p><p>In our study, infection of Huh-7 target cells with highly infectious HCVcc particles allowed us to isolate a cellular clone resistant to HCV infection which has lost CD81 expression (Huh-7w7 cells). We then took advantage of the emergence of these CD81-deficient cells to analyze the functionality of mCD81 in HCV infection and to study the role of TEM-associated CD81 in HCV infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of Huh-7 cells resistant to HCV infection</title><p>In a previous study, we have shown that a HCV JFH-1 full-length RNA genome encoding mutations in the capsid and E2 sequences (JFH-1/CS-N6) releases highly infectious HCVcc particles which display a marked cytopathic effect on target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Infection of Huh-7 cells with these particles led to the selection of few living cells that were resistant to HCV infection. In order to analyze the capacity of these cells to resist to HCVcc infection, they were amplified and treated with interferon &#x003b1; to eliminate any potential remaining virus. This cell population, called Resistant 1 (R1), displayed reduced levels of JFH-1 HCVcc infection compared to parental Huh-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In parallel, we infected the R1 cell population with retroviral particles harboring HCV envelope glycoproteins of genotypes 1a or 2a (HCVpp-1a or HCVpp-2a, respectively) and found reduced levels of HCVpp infection in comparison to Huh-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Both cell lines were not infected by particles devoid of envelope proteins (data not shown) and were equally infected with the positive control VSVpp, which infects virtually all type of cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Ectopic expression of CD81 in HCV-resistant Huh-7 cells restores HCV permissivity</bold>. <bold>A</bold>, Huh-7 cells and R1 cell population infected with JFH-1 HCVcc were processed for double-label immunofluorescence for capsid protein (green) and nuclei (blue, Hoechst). <bold>B</bold>, Cells were infected with virus pseudotyped with HCV envelope proteins from 1a (HCVpp 1a) or 2a (HCVpp 2a) or VSV G envelope protein (VSVpp). <bold>C</bold>, Huh-7 cells and R1 individual cellular clones were infected with HCVcc expressing <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, several clones were resistant to infection (clones 3, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 14) while others exhibited some susceptibility to HCVcc (clones 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 16), but greatly reduced when compared to the parental Huh-7 cells. Interestingly, analysis of the sensitivity of several clones to HCVpp infection showed similar reduced infectivity levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), indicating that the entry step of HCV life cycle is affected in these cells. The only major difference was observed for clone 6, which was barely permissive for JFH-1 infection but highly permissive for HCVpp, suggesting that replication or assembly of HCVcc is likely affected in these cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Ectopic expression of human and mouse CD81 in resistant cells restores HCV permissivity</title><p>The HCV entry stage is a multistep process involving several cellular factors (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). Among these molecules, the tetraspanin CD81, the Scavenger Receptor class B type I (SR-BI), and the tight junction protein claudin 1 (CLDN-1) play key roles. Since the absence of one of these molecules might explain the differences in infectivity of the R1 cell clones, their expression levels were examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Experiments of surface biotinylation followed by immunoprecipitations with specific mAbs showed that the cell surface expression levels of SR-BI and CLDN-1 were similar in each clone, whereas CD81 expression differed among the clones. CD81 cellular expression levels in R1 cell clones were also tested by anti-CD81 western-blotting over total cell lysates and similar results were obtained (data not shown). Interestingly, non permissive R1 cell clones were also negative for CD81 expression, indicating that HCV entry defect observed in clones 3, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 14 is likely due to the absence of CD81 expression.</p><p>To confirm our hypothesis, we ectopically expressed CD81 in one of the non-permissive Huh-7 R1 cell clones (clone 7) that we called Huh-7w7 cells. Plasmids expressing human CD81 (hCD81), mouse CD81 (mCD81) or empty expression vector (pcDNA3.1) were stably transfected in Huh-7w7 cells. The CD81 expression level was next controlled by flow cytometry analysis using 1.3.3.22 anti-hCD81 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>, <bold>left panel</bold>) and MT81 anti-mCD81 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>, <bold>right panel</bold>) mAbs. Cell surface expression of hCD81 in Huh-7w7/hCD81 cells was higher than in parental Huh-7 cells, whereas no hCD81 expression was detectable in Huh-7w7/pcDNA3.1 and Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells. mCD81 was also highly expressed in Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>, <bold>right panel</bold>) and expression level was comparable with the one of Hepa1.6 cells that naturally express mouse CD81 (data not shown). Huh-7 cells and the complemented Huh-7w7 populations displayed similar expression levels of the control tetraspanin CD151 (data not shown).</p><p>We next tested the sensitivity of the different cell lines to HCVcc and HCVpp infection. Control cells expressing the empty vector pcDNA3.1 were totally resistant to HCV infection (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). In contrast, Huh-7w7/hCD81 cells were equally or slightly more infected by HCVpp than parental Huh-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). Thus, ectopic expression of hCD81 fully restores permissivity to HCVpp harboring HCV envelope glycoproteins from different genotypes indicating that CD81 expression is likely the only defect for HCV entry in Huh-7w7 cells. However, the level of infectivity of Huh-7w7/hCD81 cells by HCVcc was 50%, as compared to the one of Huh-7 cells, indicating that despite being highly expressed, hCD81 did not fully restore permissivity to HCVcc. Overexpression of CD81 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>) in Huh-7w7/hCD81 cells may lead CD81 to oligomerize, as shown for CD9 another tetraspanin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], in less permissive CD81 molecules to HCVcc infection. The entry efficiency of HCVpp will not be affected in this context but only driven by CD81 expression levels. It has to be noted that differences in HCVcc and HCVpp entries have already been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, ectopic expression of mCD81 in Huh-7w7 cells was also able to restore HCV permissivity. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>, the level of permissivity to HCVcc of Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells was 20% of the one of parental Huh-7 cells. In addition, permissivity of Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells to HCVpp bearing glycoproteins from different genotypes was analyzed and showed that mCD81 supports infection with HCVpp from genotypes 2a and 4, with 29% and 19% of level of infectivity respectively, as compared to the one of Huh-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). In contrast to Flint <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], we did not observe any significant infectivity for HCVpp harboring glycoproteins from genotypes 1a and 1b.</p><p>It is worth noting that the sensitivity of Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells to HCV infection is solely due to the expression of mCD81 since anti-hCD81 mAbs (1.3.3.22; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and 5A6; not shown) efficiently inhibited HCVcc and HCVpp infection of Huh-7 and Huh-7w7/hCD81 cells, but did not significantly affect the infectivity of Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells. These results indicate that no residual expression of hCD81 is responsible for permissivity since in such a case infection would be fully inhibited by the anti-hCD81 mAbs.

This is evidenced by the lack of recognition of CD81 after cell lysis with detergents that do not preserve tetraspanin-tetraspanin interactions, and by the complete removal of the CD81 pool recognized by MT81<underline>w</underline> following immunodepletion of tetraspanin complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

Such an antibody preferentially recognizing human CD81 associated with TEMs is not available. However, since Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells are susceptible to HCVcc and HCVpp-2a infection, we next took advantage of this model and the MT81<underline>w</underline> mAb to study the role of TEM-associated CD81 in the early steps of HCV life cycle.</p><p>Using the MT81<underline>w</underline> anti-mCD81 mAb, we first characterized the subpopulation of mCD81 that is associated with TEMs on the cell surface of Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). As shown by flow cytometry analysis, the intensity of MT81<underline>w</underline> labeling only reached 32 &#x000b1; 14%, depending on the experiment, of the intensity with MT81 in Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells, indicating that only a fraction of CD81 molecules is engaged in tetraspanin microdomains on these cells, as described for Hepa1&#x02013;6 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, we cannot exclude that the lower affinity of MT81<underline>w</underline> may lead to an underestimate of the ratio of CD81 engaged in TEMs. The specificity of MT81<underline>w</underline> to recognize TEM-associated CD81 in Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments from biotinylated cell lysates made under different detergent conditions. Tetraspanin microdomains are typically disrupted by Triton X-100, but are retained in less hydrophobic detergents such as Brij 97 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

The tetraspanin pattern obtained with Huh-7 cells using 5A6 hCD81 mAb is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>. The major proteins co-immunoprecipitated with CD81 have an apparent molecular mass consistent with that of EWI-2 and EWI-F, two major partners of CD81 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The identity of these proteins was confirmed by direct immunoprecipitation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and data not shown), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Interestingly, MT81 and MT81<underline>w</underline> immunoprecipitations of mCD81 in Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells gave a pattern similar to that of hCD81 in Huh-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). EWI-2 and EWI-F proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with mCD81 in Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells. In addition, immunoprecipitation with an anti-CD151, another tetraspanin, co-immunoprecipitated a fraction of mCD81 in Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells as well as hCD81 in Huh-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, lines TS151). Altogether, in spite of slight differences in stoichiometry, these results show that mCD81 in Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells is engaged in similar web interactions than hCD81 in Huh-7 cells.</p><p>We then analyzed the ability of MT81 and MT81<underline>w</underline> to inhibit HCVcc and HCVpp infectivity. As shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, MT81 mAb, which recognizes the whole population of CD81, efficiently inhibited both HCVcc infection and HCVpp entry into Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells. Indeed, MT81 inhibited 80% of HCVcc infection and 95% of HCVpp infection at low concentrations (3 &#x003bc;g/ml). In contrast, MT81<underline>w</underline> was poorly neutralizing since it only induced an inhibition of 40% and 60% of HCVcc and HCVpp infection, respectively, at tenfold higher concentrations (30 &#x003bc;g/ml). However, it has to be noted that MT81<underline>w</underline> mAb might be a low-affinity antibody, as compared to MT81 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The specificity of the observed inhibitory effect was ensured by using an irrelevant antibody at the highest concentration (anti-transferrin receptor antibody CD71 at 30 &#x003bc;g/ml, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> TR30).

To further analyze the role of TEM-associated CD81 in HCV infection, we next assessed the effect of cholesterol depletion on HCV infection. Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells were treated with increasing amounts of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (M&#x003b2;CD), a cyclic oligosaccharide that selectively removes cholesterol from the plasma membrane without incorporating into the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Treatment of Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells with M&#x003b2;CD prior to infection resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of HCVcc (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) and HCVpp-2a (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) infectivity. In both set of experiments the maximal inhibition of HCV infection was reached at an M&#x003b2;CD concentration of 15 mM, which decreased the cellular cholesterol content by fivefold (data not shown). Moreover, inhibition of infection was specifically due to cholesterol removal from the cell surface, since it was reversed by cholesterol replenishment with M&#x003b2;CD-cholesterol complexes before HCV infection (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Such preformed M&#x003b2;CD-cholesterol complexes are known to replenish cells with cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It has to be noted that M&#x003b2;CD treatment had no effect on VSVpp entry (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>), which is clathrin dependent, indicating that HCVpp entry inhibition was not due to disruption of clathrin-enriched domains following cholesterol depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In addition, cell treatment with M&#x003b2;CD at 15 mM three hours after cell/virus contact did not have any effect on infection (data not shown), indicating that membrane cholesterol is required at the entry step and M&#x003b2;CD is not toxic under our experimental conditions.

M&#x003b2;CD treatment of Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells reduced MT81 labelling by 58 &#x000b1; 7% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Aa</xref>), suggesting that cholesterol depletion induced a decrease in total cell surface expression of mCD81 in Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells. Even with cholesterol replenishment, CD81 expression level could not be restored to conditions that would enable HCV infectivity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Ac</xref>, M&#x003b2;CD+Chol). Incubation of M&#x003b2;CD-treated cells with increasing concentrations of preformed M&#x003b2;CD-cholesterol complexes raised cell surface mCD81 expression level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). However, a concentration four times higher than needed to reverse the inhibitory effect of M&#x003b2;CD on HCV infectivity (10 mM instead of 2,5 mM) was necessary to reach the cell surface mCD81 expression level of untreated cells. Interestingly, treatment with M&#x003b2;CD alone had no effect on TEM-associated mCD81 population in Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells, as determined using MT81<underline>w</underline> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Ab</xref>).

We analyzed the expression levels of SR-BI, CLDN-1 and LDL receptor (LDL-R), three other major actors of HCV entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The tetraspanin CD151 was used again as a control. Since no antibody against extracellular loops of CLDN-1 is available for flow cytometry, we performed our analyses by immunoprecipitation of surface biotinylated cell lysates. As shown above, treatment of Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells with M&#x003b2;CD was accompanied by a reduced expression level of CD81, as detected by MT81 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). We also found a reduced immunoprecipitation of CD81 by MT81<underline>w</underline> after M&#x003b2;CD treatment. Cholesterol depletion prior to lysis in Brij 97 likely led to a harsher effect of the detergent leading to a partial dissociation of tetraspanin complexes recognized by MT81w. Interestingly, treatment of Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells with M&#x003b2;CD did not lead to a reduction of cell surface expression of SR-BI, CLDN-1 or LDL-R. It has to be noted that SR-BI and CLDN-1 seemed even more expressed after M&#x003b2;CD treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).

Since sphingomyelin influences CD81 cell surface expression as well as HCV infection, we sought to determine the effect of the Smase treatment on TEM-associated CD81 population. Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells were pre-treated with Smase, washed and then infected with HCVcc or HCVpp-2a.

Smase treatment resulted also in a significant decrease of cell surface expression of CD81 on Huh-7 cells (data not shown), as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The similarity of Huh-7 and Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells responses to Smase treatment tends to show that results obtained with Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells can be extrapolated to Huh-7 cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion and conclusion</title><p>We have previously shown that mutations (CS-N6) in the structural proteins of the JFH-1 genome increase the production and infectivity of HCVcc particles, leading to an accelerated cytopathic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, infection of Huh-7 cells with such particles led us to isolate cellular clones exhibiting different levels of permissivity to HCVcc and HCVpp. For most of them, reduced HCV infection levels were directly related to their reduced expression level of CD81, while other entry molecules such as SR-BI and CLDN-1 were not modified. Our observation is in accordance with previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Ectopic expression of CD81 in Huh-7w7 cells, one of the resistant cell clones, restored HCV permissivity indicating that CD81 deficiency alone was responsible for the resistance to HCV infection in these cells. In agreement with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], we did not observe any variation in HCV genome replication in Huh-7w7 cells in comparison to Huh-7 cells (data not shown), suggesting that CD81 is not involved in this step of the viral cycle. Masciopinto <italic>et al</italic>. showed that CD81 and HCV envelope glycoproteins could be detected in exosomes of mammalian cells, suggesting that HCV may intracellularly interact with CD81 allowing its export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. They pointed out a possible role of CD81 in assembly and release of HCV particles. However, our results indicate that CD81 does not participate to HCV assembly or release of new viral particles, since the supernatant of Huh-7w7 cells transfected with full-length HCV RNA infected na&#x000ef;ve Huh-7 cells to a level comparable to that of the supernatant from transfected Huh-7 cells. Thus, Huh-7w7 cells constitute a new tool allowing to investigate the involvement of CD81 in HCV entry and offering a new single-cycle replication system, as already used by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The molecular determinants of HCV-CD81 interaction have been analyzed by several groups by using biochemical assays (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]). However, Flint <italic>et al </italic>have highlighted the limitation of these approaches since various mutated CD81 sequences previously reported to abrogate E2-CD81 interaction, were able to restore permissivity in HepG2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In our study, we show that ectopic expression of human and mouse CD81 proteins in human hepatoma cells devoid of CD81 conferred susceptibility to infection by HCVcc and HCVpp at various levels. Interestingly, mCD81 protein supports infection by HCVcc and HCVpp bearing glycoproteins from genotypes 2a and 4 suggesting that, in accordance with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], CD81 is not the sole determinant of species susceptibility to HCV. Other additional cellular factors likely modulate HCV entry. In addition, interaction/organization levels and stoichiometry between entry factors and plasma membrane lipids may regulate species susceptibility to HCV.</p><p>CD81 belongs to the tetraspanin family of which members have the distinctive feature of clustering dynamically with numerous partner proteins and with one another in membrane microdomains. Within this web, the associations of tetraspanins with their nontetraspanin partner molecules have been referred to as primary, and tetraspanin can interact with each other through their associated partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast to primary complexes, tetraspanin-tetraspanin interactions are not stoichiometric and palmitoylation is necessary for the maintenance of these interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. It is still unknown whether all tetraspanins expressed in a certain cell are associated with each other. Importantly, tetraspanins associate indirectly with additional proteins. Functionally, these interactions cluster in TEM, enabling lateral dynamic organization in the membrane and the cross-talk with intracellular signalling and cytoskeletal structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In our study, generation of a human cell line expressing mCD81 (Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells) permissive to HCV infection allowed us to analyze the role of TEM-associated CD81 in HCV infection. This study could be performed with two recently described mAbs: MT81, which recognizes total mCD81; and MT81<underline>w</underline>, which specifically recognizes a fraction of mCD81 associated with other tetraspanins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It is worth noting that such a tool allowing the detection of hCD81 associated with TEMs is not available. We first determined the inhibitory effect of both mAbs on HCVcc and HCVpp infection: MT81 strongly inhibited HCV infection, whereas MT81<underline>w</underline> led to a weak inhibition of infection at saturing concentrations. This reduced capacity of MT81<underline>w</underline> mAb to inhibit HCV infection suggests that TEM-associated CD81 molecules, recognized by this mAb, are not the exclusive site of infection. In accordance with these results, ceramide enrichment of plasma membrane leading to an increased association of CD81 with TEMs highly inhibits HCV infection. While palmitoylation is not the only mechanism by which tetraspanins interact with each other, it has been shown to play an essential role in TEM organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. The ability of palmitoylation-defective CD81 to support infection by HCVpp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] is again consistent with a minor role of TEM-associated CD81 in HCV entry. We cannot exclude that the epitope recognized by MT81<underline>w</underline> mAb on CD81 is not involved in HCV interaction. The partial inhibition of MT81<underline>w</underline> might also be the reflect of a partial recognition of the TEM-associated CD81 fraction, as previously suggested by Silvie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The entire HCV life cycle is associated with cholesterol metabolism in host cells (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]), and lipid composition of the plasma membrane seems very important for the HCV entry step. In our study, we showed that cholesterol depletion by treatment with M&#x003b2;CD strongly reduced HCV entry into target cells, and conversely cholesterol replenishment by M&#x003b2;CD-cholesterol complexes restored the infection levels. These results point out again the importance of cell membrane cholesterol in HCV entry, likely in the fusion process as has been previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Very recently, we have shown that increasing the levels of ceramide in the plasma membrane induce a massive endocytosis of CD81 leading to a strong inhibition of HCV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Interestingly, in the present study, we showed that following Smase treatment of Huh-7w7/mCD81 cells, expression of CD81 is inversely related to association of CD81 with tetraspanin webs. These results suggest that ceramide might specifically modify the levels of interaction or the cell surface distribution of TEM. In this regard, it has been shown that gangliosides play an important role in the organization of CD82-enriched microdomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Ceramide enrichment may also induce clustering of CD81 leading to an increased binding of MT81<underline>w</underline> mAb. In accordance with this hypothesis, it has been shown that high levels of ceramide induce large-scale clustering/capping of death receptors (e.g. Fas/CD95) required to initiate efficient formation of death-induced signalling complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Alternatively, MT81<underline>w</underline> may recognize an epitope of CD81 that is more exposed following ceramide enrichment.

Using CD81/CD9 chimeras, it has been recently shown that CD81 LEL plays a critical role in sporozoite infection and a stretch of 21 amino acids is sufficient to confer susceptibility to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. In contrast to HCV infection, it seems that CD81 does not act directly as a receptor but is rather involved indirectly, likely by modulating the activity of an associated protein. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that CD81 associated to multiple proteins in the tetraspanin web plays a major role in sporozoite infection, since modulation of cellular cholesterol levels, which changes tetraspanin microdomain organization, has been shown to also modify the extent of CD81-dependent sporozoite infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In contrast, in our study, we demonstrated that TEM-associated CD81 is not used by HCV, indicating that these two pathogens, while using the same molecules, invade their host by different mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>5A6 (anti-CD81 kindly provided by S.
