For example, Lrp4 binds Wise, a secreted Wnt modulator and BMP antagonist. Lrp4 shares structural elements within the extracellular ligand binding domain with Lrp5 and Lrp6, two established Wnt co-receptors with important roles in osteogenesis. Sclerostin is a potent osteocyte secreted inhibitor of bone formation that directly binds Lrp5 and Lrp6 and modulates both BMP and Wnt signaling. The anti-osteogenic effect of sclerostin is thought to be mediated mainly by inhibition of Wnt signaling through Lrp5/6 within osteoblasts. Dickkopf1 (Dkk1) is another potent soluble Wnt inhibitor that binds to Lrp5 and Lrp6, can displace Lrp5-bound sclerostin and is itself regulated by BMPs. In a recent genome-wide association study of bone mineral density a significant modifier locus was detected near the <italic>SOST</italic> gene at 17q21, which encodes sclerostin. In addition, nonsynonymous SNPs in the <italic>LRP4</italic> gene were suggestively associated with bone mineral density. Here we show that Lrp4 is expressed in bone and cultured osteoblasts and binds Dkk1 and sclerostin <italic>in vitro</italic>. MicroCT analysis of Lrp4 deficient mutant mice revealed shortened total femur length, reduced cortical femoral perimeter, and reduced total femur bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD). Lumbar spine trabecular bone volume per total volume (BV/TV) was significantly reduced in the mutants and the serum and urinary bone turnover markers alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and desoxypyridinoline were increased. We conclude that Lrp4 is a novel osteoblast expressed Dkk1 and sclerostin receptor with a physiological role in the regulation of bone growth and turnover, which is likely mediated through its function as an integrator of Wnt and BMP signaling pathways.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoporosis and the inherently increased susceptibility to sustain fractures associated with this disease represent a major challenge in our aging western societies.

Hypomorphic mutations of the Lrp4 gene are compatible with survival and present with a variable degree of skeletal abnormalities, in particular fusion of digits at the hind and fore limbs (polysyndactyly). By engineering a stop codon just upstream of the transmembrane domain of the murine Lrp4 gene, we have generated such a hypomorphic dysfunctional receptor (Lrp4 <italic>ECD</italic>), in which the lack of a membrane anchor prevents the efficient interaction of Lrp4 with its extracellular ligands.

The role of Lrp4 as an antagonist of canonical Wnt signaling pathway is thought to be mediated in part by a displacement of the homologous Lrp5/6 proteins in the co-receptor complex formed by frizzled proteins (fzd) with Lrp5/6, which is required to bind Wnt proteins and to transduce the Wnt signal to downstream elements of the canonical cascade.</p><p>Lrp5/6 are established Wnt co-receptors with important roles in osteogenesis.

Body weight of the animals was determined upon sacrifice. Ten week old wildtype mice had a significantly higher total body weight (25.7 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 1.3 g) than their Lrp4ECD littermates (20.3 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 1.4 g) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007930-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), consistent with our earlier findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007930-Johnson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

MicroCT 3D and 2D reconstruction of the femur did not reveal striking differences in the overall morphology of the bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007930-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), but showed that the reduction of total body weight was accompanied by a significant reduction of femur length (13.5 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 0.3 mm vs 12.5 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 0.2 mm p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0001) and a clear, albeit statistically non-significant trend towards a reduction in the combined height of lumbar vertebrae L3 and L4 (6.36 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 0.36 mm vs 5.78 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 0.58) of Lrp4ECD mutants as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007930-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007930-g004">4B</xref>). Furthermore, the inner and outer cortical perimeter of the femur mid-diaphyses was significantly smaller in Lrp4ECD mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007930-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, p&#x0003c;0.0001 and p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.002). These findings indicate that at least part of the reduction of the total body weight was due to impaired skeletal growth. This is consistent with our previous report of a role of Lrp4 as a modulator of the BMP and Wnt signaling cascades in limb and tooth development, since both pathways also play a role in the enchondral ossification process in the growth plate that controls limb length growth. Total femur bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) were also significantly reduced in Lrp4ECD mutants (BMC 11.1 &#x0002b;/&#x02212;1.3 mg versus 9.0 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 1.5 mg, p&#x0003c;0.05 and BMD 641.3 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 16.7 mg/cc versus 602.3 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 21.4 mg/cc, p&#x0003c;0.01), while cortical thickness, cortical BMC and cortical BMD were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007930-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that the difference in total femur BMD/BMC was due to differences in the trabecular compartment of the femur. For the assessment of trabecular bone structure and density in mice, the lumbar spine is better suited than the distal femur or the proximal tibia. We therefore performed &#x003bc;CT on the lumbar vertebrae L3 and L4. Again, 3D and 2D reconstructions did not unveil gross abnormalities of lumbar spine morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007930-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), but trabecular bone analyses revealed a significantly reduced bone volume per total volume (BV/TV, 18.9 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 1.5&#x00025; vs 15.7 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 2.5&#x00025;) in Lrp4 ECD mutants as compared to wild type littermates, accompanied by the according changes in trabecular separation and trabecular number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007930-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Trabecular thickness was not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007930-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Taken together, &#x003bc;CT analyses of the femur and lumbar spine indicate impaired bone growth in Lrp4ECD mutant mice, with smaller bones of otherwise mostly normal morphology and suggest a concomitant relative increase of bone resorption over bone formation, resulting in a net loss of trabecular bone.</p><fig id="pone-0007930-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007930.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Lrp4ECD results in impaired bone growth.</title><p><italic>Panel A</italic>, Representative &#x003bc;CT images of WT and Lrp4ECD mouse femurs. <italic>Panel B</italic>, Total body weight of ten week old male mice was determined prior to sacrifice.

Lrp5 and Lrp6 have been recognized as the main osteoblast expressed co-receptors of the frizzled family of proteins, which together form a receptor complex at the cell surface that binds the Wnt signaling proteins and thereby initiates the canonical signaling cascade. The finding that Lrp4 is also expressed by osteoblasts in bone has important implications for the understanding of the complexity of the regulation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in bone. Sclerostin and Dkk1 are inhibitory modulators of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway and it has been generally assumed that these molecules exert their antagonistic effect mainly through direct binding to Lrp5/6, thereby blocking binding sites on these receptors for the pathway activating Wnts. Here we have shown that Lrp4 efficiently binds both sclerostin and Dkk1, suggesting that at the osteoblast surface, Lrp4 could either compete with Lrp5/6 for the interaction with sclerostin and Dkk1 or cooperate with the Lrp5/6/frizzled co-receptor complex by binding and presenting these ligands to Lrp5/6. LRP4, but not Lrp5/6, contains an NPXY endocytosis motif in its cytoplasmic domain. However, it is not known whether Lrp4 contributes to the endocytosis of extracellular molecules to a significant extent. The exact nature of both the cellular consequences of sclerostin and Dkk1 binding to Lrp4 as well as the impact that this process may have on the signaling function of Lrp5/6 in bone and other tissues will have to be determined by future studies. It is likely that mouse genetics with double and triple knockout combinations of receptor and ligand genes will be needed to fully understand these interactions.</p><p>How can we explain the bone phenotype of Lrp4ECD mice? We have previously shown that Lrp4 integrates BMP and Wnt signals in tooth development in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007930-Ohazama1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> by binding Wise, a secreted BMP antagonist that also binds to Lrp6 and thereby inhibits Wnt signaling. In analogy to Wise, sclerostin and Dkk1 are two other Lrp5/6 ligands that we have now shown to also interact with Lrp4. One possible mechanism is that Lrp4 simply acts as a sink and competes with Lrp5/6 for the binding of these Wnt antagonists, which then are no longer available for suppression of the signal through the Lrp5/6 axis. When Lrp4 is dysfunctional as in the Lrp4ECD mutant strain that we used here, the availability of extracellular Wnt- antagonists increases, resulting in a net inhibitory effect on canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in the cell, which is well known to decrease BMD and thus would provide an explanation for the reduced lumbar spine trabecular BV/TV in the Lrp4ECD mutant mice. Furthermore, both Wnt signaling and BMP signaling are involved in the growth plate organization and enchondral ossification process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007930-Chen1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007930-Perry1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, Lrp4 can by itself inhibit Wnt signaling, presumably by competing for Lrp5/6 in the Wnt/Fz complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007930-Johnson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Since sclerostin can inhibit BMPs, and Dkk1 is itself regulated by BMPs, it is likely that the failure to properly integrate BMP and Wnt signaling pathways in the absence of a normal, functional Lrp4 is responsible for the reduced limb length growth in the Lrp4 ECD mutants. Such a mechanism would be analogous to the role of LRP1 in the integration of PDGF and TGF&#x003b2; signals in the vascular wall, where loss of LRP1 expression in smooth muscle cells results in the simultaneous deregulation of PDGF as well as TGF&#x003b2; signalling with medial hypertrophy, elastolysis and fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007930-Boucher1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007930-Zhou1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The elevated concentration of biochemical bone turnover markers, serum osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase and urinary DPD in Lrp4ECD animals indicate that both osteoblast and osteoclast activities are significantly increased in these mice. This could be either explained by an altered coupling of osteoblast and osteoclast activity due to osteoblast-specific changes in Wnt and BMP signaling, or by altered osteoclast function independent of osteoblasts. We failed to detect Lrp4 expression in primary osteoclast cultures from wildtype mice (data not shown), which would favour a mechanism in which altered coupling leads to increased osteoclast activity in this mouse model, possibly by a mechanism similar to the one observed in mutant mice with osteoblast-specific inactivation of &#x003b2;-catenin which results in increased bone resorption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007930-Glass1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>.

Whether the elevated concentrations of osteocalcin in Lrp4ECD mice are also associated with an altered glucose metabolism will have to be determined.</p><p>The current study cannot distinguish whether the observed bone phenotype of the Lrp4ECD mutant is due to an impaired interaction of osteoblast expressed Lrp4 with Dkk1, with sclerostin, or most likely with both proteins. Future studies will have to address to what degree the phenotype is synthetic, e.g. by analyzing mice with osteoblast-specific inactivation of Lrp4 in combination with mutations in Dkk1 and sclerostin.</p><p>In conclusion, the expression of Lrp4 by osteoblasts described here adds another player to the long list of established factors that modulate canonical Wnt signaling in bone. By demonstrating that in addition to Wise, Lrp4 is able to interact with two additional important modulators of Wnt and BMP signaling, our perspective of the complexity of the integration of BMP and Wnt signaling pathways on the osteoblast surface has expanded further. Extensive further studies are clearly necessary to fully understand the mechanisms by which Lrp4 deficiency leads to impaired bone growth, increased bone turnover and polysyndactly in these mutant mice. Nevertheless the recently described association of both the SOST and LRP4 genes with BMD in humans, together with our findings suggest that LRP4 plays a physiologically important role in the skeletal development and bone metabolism not only in rodents, but in humans as well.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are indebted to Ali Aktar for performing &#x003bc;CTs, and to Walter Tauscher, Priscilla
