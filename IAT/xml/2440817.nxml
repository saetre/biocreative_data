The methylated RIP140 then preferentially recruited exportin 1 for nuclear export. As a result, the nuclear gene-repressive activity of RIP140 was reduced.

All these PTMs affect the biological activity of RIP140. Of particular significance is protein arginine methyl transferase (PRMT)-mediated arginine methylation on three specific arginine residues of RIP140, Arg240, 650, 948, which negatively regulates its biological activity in the nucleus (gene repression) by reducing its interaction with a corepressive enzyme machinery containing HDAC3 and facilitating its export to the cytoplasm via the exportin (CRM1)-containing export machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002658-Huq2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. As a result, the nuclear, gene repressive, activity of RIP140 is reduced.</p><p>Some of the extracellular cues/stimuli for phosphorylation, acetylation and pyridoxylation of RIP140 have begun to be investigated, but it was unclear what triggered protein arginine methylation of RIP140 to stimulate its nuclear export. In particular, the signals for this important PTM in the context of adipocyte differentiation, where the physiological role of RIP140 has been clearly established, was most interesting. The primary goals of this study were to identify the signal(s) that stimulated arginine methylation of RIP140 in adipocyte differentiation, and to delineate the signal transduction pathway that transmitted the stimuli and ultimately rendered the export of RIP140 to the cytoplasm.</p><p>It was first found that protein kinase C epsilon (PKC&#x003b5;)-stimulated phosphorylation of RIP140 also reduced its gene repressive activity by triggering its export to the cytoplasm. The targets of PKC action on RIP140 were located to two specific serine residues, Ser-102 and 1003, both of which were critical for its arginine methylation and nuclear export. This was mediated by the recruitment of chaperone 14-3-3/PRMT1 complex to the PKC-phosphorylated RIP140 and the action of PRMT1 to methylate RIP140. In differentiating cultures, the expression and activity of PKC&#x003b5; was elevated, which triggered this cascade of events. Further, the physiological relevance of this signal transduction pathway, that altered the PTMs of RIP140 and its subcellular localization and activity, was demonstrated in gain- and loss-function studies using specific point mutations, as well as wild type and RIP140 null adipocyte cultures.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>PKC-stimulated phosphorylation at Ser-102 and Ser-1003 of RIP140 regulates its cytoplasmic localization</title><p>In our previous study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002658-Huq2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> we have established the export of RIP140 to the cytoplasm, which was stimulated by its specific arginine methylation. To examine the upstream signaling events that triggered the export of RIP140, a preliminary study was conducted by using pharmacological agents. These tests revealed that compounds that regulated PKC activities could modulate the nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation of endogenous RIP140 in differentiating (8 days) adipocyte cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). A fraction of endogenous RIP140 appeared in the cytoplasm of the normally differentiating culture (lane 1, control), and a significantly increased cytoplasmic RIP140 was detected when the PKC pathway of the culture was further stimulated (lane 2). Conversely, RIP140 remained, primarily, nuclear when the PKC pathway was blocked (lane 3). An RNAi experiment to knock down endogenous RIP140 was included for a control (lane 4). In agreement with PKC-stimulated cytoplasmic localization of RIP140, the known biological activity of nuclear RIP140, gene repression, was inhibited by PKC but not MAPK (a negative control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Further it was the N- and C-termini, but not the central domain, of RIP140 that responded to the activation of PKC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002658.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0002658-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002658.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Effect of PKC phosphorylation on subcellular localization of RIP140.</title><p>(A) Cellular distribution of endogenous RIP140 in differentiated adipocyte cultures where PKC activity was pharmacologically activated (PMA) or inactivated (Calphostin C).

Since both the N- and the C-termini, but not the central domain, responded to PKC activation, we then screened all the phosphorylated residues in these two domains, including residues at 102, 104, 202, 207, 358, 380 (for the N-terminus) and a single phosphorylated residue at 1003 (for the C-terminus) by mutations mimicking constitutive dephosphorylation (CN, S/T&#x02192;A). This series of mutation studies identified Ser-102 and Ser-1003 as the critical residues responsive to PKC activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002658.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). The functional roles of these two residues, with respect to gene repression, were further verified by incorporating either the constitutive negative (dephosphorylation, CN, S&#x02192;A) or the phospho-mimetic (CP, S&#x02192;E) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002658-Gupta1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002658-Wu1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> mutation in the context of the full-length protein. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). It appeared that while each single mutation of 102, or 1003, exerted a partial effect, only the double mutation (of Ser-102 and Ser-1003) could completely abrogate the responsiveness to PKC activation, indicating synergistic effects of phosphorylation at these two specific residues. The double negative mutant (102CN&#x0002b;1003CN) was strongly repressive, whereas the double phospho-mimetic mutant (102CP&#x0002b;1003CP) was not effective in trans-repression. A mock mutation at Ser-315, a negative control, exerted no effect on the repressive activity of RIP140.</p><p>We then validated the effects of phosphorylation of Ser-102 and Ser-1003 on subcellular distribution of RIP140 in reconstituted RIP140 null adipocyte cultures. While the individual mutation, either Ser-102 or Ser-1003, slightly affected the nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of RIP140, only the double mutant exhibited a more pronounce effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The double negative (D-CN) mutant was retained, almost entirely, in the nucleus whereas the double phospho-mimetic mutant (D-CP) was increasingly cytoplasmic.

We thus speculated if PKC-stimulated phosphorylation of RIP140 could trigger its physical association with the 14-3-3/PRMT1 complex, thereby rendering its arginine methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Very interestingly, in differentiated adipocyte cultures, a basal methylation level of endogenous RIP140 was detected in the absence of any external stimuli, supporting the presence of an autonomous signaling pathway in the differentiating adipocyte culture for arginine methylation of RIP140 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g002">Figure 2A</xref> top panel, lane1). While additional MAPK stimulation (lane 2) did not significantly affect the methylation status of RIP140, additional PKC activation was able to enhance (lane 4), and inhibition of PKC reduced (lane 5), the level of arginine methylation of endogenous RIP140. Consistently, complex formation of RIP140/PRMT1, and of RIP140/14-3-3, was significantly enhanced by a PKC activator and reduced by a PKC inhibitor (2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> panels). The formation of the tri-molecular complex was then verified by sequential IP experiments where the RIP140/PRMT1 or RIP140/14-3-3 immuno-complex was subsequently examined to determine its association with the third partner, 14-3-3 or PRMT1 (4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> panels). These results, all together, demonstrated PKC activation-stimulated tri-molecular complex formation of endogenous RIP140/14-4-3/PRMT1 in differentiating adipocyte culture, which rendered arginine methylation of RIP140.</p><fig id="pone-0002658-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002658.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Effects of PKC-mediated phosphorylation on RIP140 interaction with the export effectors.</title><p>(A) PKC, but not MAPK, activation induced <italic>in vivo</italic> hypermethylation and association of endogenous RIP140 with the effecter molecules 14-3-3 and PRMT1.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g002">Figure 2B</xref> lane 2, arginine methylation of RIP140, as well as its cytoplasmic distribution, was increased by the activation of PKC. Leptomycin B significantly hindered PKC-stimulated export of RIP140, with methylated RIP140 accumulated in the nucleus (lane 4), suggesting that PKC-activated export of RIP140 employed the same CRM1-mediated export machinery.</p><p>The PKC-triggered phosphorylation-methylation cascade and its associated effector molecules were then validated in RIP140 null adipocytes rescued by expressing either the dominant negative (D-CN) or the double phospho-mimetic (D-CP) mutant RIP140. The wild type RIP140 was methylated, and was able to interact with PRMT1 and 14-3-3 at a basal level. For the phospho-mimetic RIP140, methylation was enhanced and its association with 14-3-3 and PRMT1 was also increased. On the contrary, the dominant negative mutant failed to be methylated and could not be associated with PRMT1 or 14-3-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In agreement with the methylation status of RIP140, which is a key actor regulating cellular distribution of RIP140 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002658-Huq2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, the gene-repressive (nuclear activity) effect of the wild type and the mutant RIP140 on one of the endogenous target genes, RAR-&#x003b2;2, was verified as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g002">Figure 2C</xref> (the 2<sup>nd</sup> panel from the bottom). The wild type (WT), and the dominant negative (D-CN) RIP140 which was predominantly nuclear in localization, repressed basal expression of RAR-&#x003b2;2; whereas the double phospho-mimetic (D-CP) RIP140, which would be primarily cytoplasmic, did not elicit such a nuclear activity. We further verified if methylation on the phospho-mimetic RIP140 was important for its export by using adenosine-2,3-dialdehyde, a global methyl transferase inhibitor (MTI), in this system. This methylation inhibitor abrogated the methylation and export of the phospho-mimetic RIP140 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, lane 4), supporting arginine methylation as the down stream mediator of PKC phosphorylation-stimulated export of RIP140.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>14-3-3 chaperone facilitates the recruitment of PRMT1 to RIP140 for its methylation and export</title><p>Ser-102 and 1003 were the principal targets of PKC that modulated the association of RIP140 with 14-3-3/PRMT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

A GST-pull down assay was first employed to examine the potential direct interaction of 14-3-3 with RIP140 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The bacterially produced wild type (WT) RIP140, as well as negative phospho-mutants (102CN and 1003CN single mutants and the double mutant D-CN), failed to interact with 14-3-3. Importantly, two single phospho-mimetic mutants (102CP and 1003CP) apparently interacted directly with 14-3-3; further, the double phospho-mimetic RIP140 (D-CP) even more strongly interacted with 14-3-3. This result clearly showed that while the dephosphorylated (at two PKC sites, residues 102 and 1003) RIP140 could not directly interact with 14-3-3, phosphorylation at these two sites indeed facilitated direct interaction of RIP140 with 14-3-3.</p><fig id="pone-0002658-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002658.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Functional roles of PKC&#x003b5;, 14-3-3 and PRMT1 in RIP140 export.</title><p>(A) Direct interaction (GST pull down assay) of various GST-RIP140 wild-type/mutants with 14-3-3.

The signals leading to its cytoplasmic export would likely reduce, or terminate, this nuclear effect, and possibly negatively regulated fat accumulation in differentiating or differentiated adipocytes. To test this hypothesis in the RIP140 null background, gain-of-function experiments were carried out as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g005">Figure 5A</xref>. Re- expressing a wild type RIP140 (WT) effectively rescued the defect of fat accumulation in the knockout culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, bar 2), but re-expressing the phospho-mimetic RIP140 (D-CP which could be exported) failed to efficiently rescue this defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, bar 3).

We establish the activated PKC&#x003b5; in differentiating adipocytes as the initial nuclear trigger that stimulates phosphorylation on two specific residues of nuclear RIP140 (on Ser-102 and Ser-1003), which renders the recruitment of a specific chaperon 14-3-3 to RIP140 in the nucleus that brings the associated PRMT1 to RIP140, thereby methylating RIP140 and stimulating its export. The functionality of the three major players (PKC&#x003b5;, 14-3-3 and PRMT1) in this signal transduction pathway has been confirmed in the differentiating adipocyte culture. This study reveals not only an autonomously activated signaling pathway for post-translational modifications to regulate the nuclear activity of an important coregulator for gene expression, RIP140, but also implicates a possibility that RIP140 may perform certain cytoplasmic functions in differentiating or differentiated adipocytes. With regards to the relationship of the kinetics of the signaling factors and RIP140 phosphorylation-methylation as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, we have observed interesting kinetics of these factors that stimulate phosphorylation and methylation of RIP140 in differentiating preadipocyte cultures. The changes of these factors are likely a result of cell-autonomous response in the early differentiation process rather than the outcome of phosphorylation-methylation of RIP140, because these factors are the upstream signals triggering phosphorylation-methylation of RIP140. It is therefore predicted that these factors will probably not drastically be affected by null mutation of RIP140, or mutation at phosphorylation-methylation of RIP140. On the contrary, the biological end point, or the effect of phosphorylation-methylation triggered nuclear export or RIP140, i.e. fat accumulation, indeed could be significantly affected by mutation in the modification status of RIP140 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g005">Figure 5A</xref>.</p><p>It is very interesting that RIP140 can be phosphorylated on at least 12 sites, but only Ser-102 and Ser-1003 are critical for the subsequent recruitment, or binding, of RIP140 to 14-3-3. This is in agreement with previous reports showing that the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of RIP140 are important for 14-3-3 binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002658-Zilliacus1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. 14-3-3 mediated cytoplasmic localization has been implicated, mostly, in the cytoplasmic retention of certain proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002658-Kumagai1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002658-Muslin1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, although several reports suggested its role also in nuclear export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002658-Brunet1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002658-Aguilera1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. This could be due to the predominantly cytoplasmic distribution of 14-3-3 detected in certain cell types. In the adipocyte differentiation culture, 14-3-3 could be detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, but its association with RIP140 occurred only in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Further, 14-3-3 binding per se, i.e. without methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), failed to stimulate cytoplasmic distribution of RIP140, suggesting an active role for the methylation-dependent nuclear export of RIP140, rather than 14-3-3 mediated cytoplasmic retention or sequestration, of RIP140. It is likely that 14-3-3 serves as a chaperone to recruit PRMT1 to the phosphorylated RIP140 in the nucleus. PRMT1 methylates RIP140 and the methylated RIP140 then recruits exportin to mediate its nuclear export. This is in agreement with the widely recognized role for 14-3-3 as a scaffold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002658-Zilliacus1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002658-Braselmann1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>There is an absolute requirement for CRM1 to trigger RIP140 export, since the process is blocked by a selective inhibitor of CRM1, leptomycin B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Arginine methylation of RIP140 is crucial since a PKC phospho-mimetic RIP140 (D-CP) failed to be exported in the presence of a methylation inhibitor (MTI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Binding by 14-3-3 is also indispensable for the export of RIP140 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002658-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, the control for cytoplasmic distribution of RIP140 involves a specific cascade of events to ensure proper transport of RIP140 between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The employment of such a tightly controlled pathway to regulate RIP140 translocation within a specific time window of adipocyte differentiation strongly suggests certain important cytoplasmic functions or roles for RIP140 as the differentiating adipocyte cultures gradually change their properties.</p><p>RIP140 is a ligand dependent co-repressor of genes regulated by hormones and is shown to play important roles in adipocyte differentiation, in particular with regards to fat accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002658-Leonardsson1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002658-Powelka1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

The typical field containing multiple cells of the unprocessed images were cropped with a similar dimension for each image using the crop tool at Adobe Photoshop. To determine the differential sub-cellular distribution pattern of RIP140 constructs, many microscopic fields of the images were randomly selected with the help of a manipulator and the distribution pattern (nuclear, nuclear-cytoplasm, and cytoplasmic) within cells were recorded. In addition, the randomly selected fields were properly focused to capture the images with the same setting and stored as digital image files.

The total ion chromatogram (LC-MS) of tryptic digests of RIP140 showed three modified peptides spanning amino acids 101&#x02013;111aa (101LSDSIVNLNVK111) (A), 101&#x02013;112 aa (101LSDSIVNLNVKK112) (B), and 100&#x02013;111 aa (100RLSDSIVNLNVK111) (C) contained both Ser-102 and Ser-104 (bold letter). The modified peptide spanning 100&#x02013;111 (C, top) and 101&#x02013;112 (B, top) appeared as doubly charged ions, respectively at 719.36 m/z (mol. mass 1436.72) and 705.35 m/z (mol. mass 140.72), while the peptide (101&#x02013;111 aa) appeared as a triply charged ion at 641.31 m/z (mol. mass 1280.63). The precursor mass of each ion from the modified peptide showed &#x0002b;80 Da mass shift as compared to the each doubly charged peptide ion of the corresponding unmodified peptide 100&#x02013;111 aa (679.37 m/z, mol. mass 1356.76 Da) (C, bottom), 101&#x02013;111 aa (601.33 m/z, mol. mass 1200.66 Da) (A, bottom) and 101&#x02013;112 aa (665.36 m/z, mol. mass 1328.75 Da) (B, bottom). This indicated that each peptide is modified by a mono-phosphorylation site. Previously, by MS/MS analysis of the precursor ion of the modified peptide 100&#x02013;111 aa (C, top), we have reported the assignments of phosphorylation site at Ser-104 (Huq et al, 2005). However, careful analysis of all three peptide ions revealed that each peptide actually contained two species of modification by a single phosphorylation site. One species contained the modification site at Ser-102 (S1 site) and the other species contained the modification site at Ser-104 (S2 site). Here, we ascertained the assignments of both sides by careful analysis of the MS/MS spectra of the above three peptides. In the MS/MS spectrum of the modified peptide spanning 101&#x02013;111 aa (A, top) two species of fragment ions (b or y ions) were shown to consider phosphorylation site either at Ser-102 (S1 site) or Ser-104 (S2 site). The spectra shows consecutive b ions due beta-elimination H3PO4 as b2-P (s1), b3-P (s1), b4-P (s1/s2) at 183.11 m/z, 298.13 m/z, 385.17, and 498.25 m/z, which indicated the phosphorylation site at Ser-102. The spectrum also showed relatively low intense a2&#x0002b;P (s1) peak at 253.09 m/z having the intact phosphate moiety. This provided significant confidence to assign the phosphorylation site at Ser-102. In addition, the intense y9-NH3 ion at 984.53 m/z corresponded to the unmodified peptide. This further confirmed the modification at Ser-102. On the other hand, the spectra showed b2 (s2) and b3 (s2) ions, respectively at 201.12 m/z and 316.15 m/z, which corresponded to unmodified peptide. This suggested some species of the peptide were not modified at Ser-102. However, the spectra showed b4-P, b5-P, b8-P and b10-P ions at 385.17 m/z, 498.25 m/z, 868.52 m/z and 1070.58 m/z, respectively due to possible beta-elimination of H3PO4 from Ser-104, suggesting the possible location of the phosphorylation site in other species of the peptide (101&#x02013;111 aa) was at Ser-104. The MS/MS spectrum of tryptic missed cleaved peptide (101&#x02013;112 aa) (B, top) showed similar fragmentation pattern as that of tryptic peptide spanning 101&#x02013;111 aa (A, top). However, the a2&#x0002b;P (s1) ions at 253.09 m/z were more intense as compared to that of peptide spanning 101&#x02013;111 aa (A, top), further suggesting the phosphorylation site at Ser-102. Finally, MS/MS spectrum of the other missed cleaved modified peptide (100&#x02013;111 aa) (C, top), showed intense of b4 ion at 472.25 m/z corresponded to the unmodified peptide, suggesting no phosphorylation at Ser-102. However, the doubly charged y12 ion at 719.37 m/z contained the intact phosphate moiety. Thus the modification site in this peptide was assigned to Ser-104 as reported previously (Huq et al, 2005). Taken together, the analysis of the above three peptides revealed that both Ser-102 and Ser-140 are modified by mono-phosphorylation on RIP140.</p><p>(1.84 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002658.s002.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002658.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>PKC&#x003b5; distribution and functionality in differentiated adipocytes.
