Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms, which regulate PDGF-C transcription remains incomplete. Transient transfection analysis, conventional and quantitative real-time PCR revealed the induction of PDGF-C transcription and mRNA expression in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) exposed to the peptide hormone angiotensin (ATII), which induces Egr-1. Occupancy of a G + C-rich element in the proximal region of the PDGF-C promoter was unaffected by ATII. Instead we discovered, using both nuclear extracts and recombinant proteins with EMSA and ChIP analyses, the existence of a second Egr-1-binding element located 500 bp upstream. ATII induction of PDGF-C transcription is mediated by the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) and Egr-1 activation through this upstream element. DNAzyme ED5 targeting Egr-1 blocked ATII-inducible PDGF-C expression. Moreover, increased PDGF-C expression after exposure to ATII depends upon the differentiation state of the SMCs. This study demonstrates the existence of this novel ATII-AT1R-Egr-1-PDGF-C axis in SMCs of neonatal origin, but not in adult SMCs, where ATII induces Egr-1 but not PDGF-C.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Platelet-derived growth factor-C (PDGF-C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), like PDGF-D are the two most recently identified members of the PDGF family of growth factors, which includes the well-characterized PDGF-A and PDGF-B. PDGFs are important regulators of cell proliferation and survival in many types of mesenchymal cells including smooth muscle cells (SMCs), connective tissue cells and fibroblasts. Studies over the last two decades have implicated PDGF-A and -B in pathophysiologic processes such as atherosclerosis, restenosis, fibrosis and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Since its discovery in the same year as PDGF-D, PDGF-C has been found to participate in fibrotic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>), palate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and platelet activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The human <italic>PDGFC</italic> gene is located on chromosome 4q32, which encodes a 345 amino acid protein with a two-domain structure: an N-terminal CUB-domain and a C-terminal growth factor domain (GFD). PDGF-CC is produced as a latent factor, requiring thereby activation by proteolysis to release the GFD from the CUB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). PDGF-C mRNA is expressed in most human adult tissues, with highest levels in heart, kidney and pancreas and smaller amount are found in placenta, skeletal muscle and prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Angiotensin II (ATII), the effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, is involved in blood pressure control, vascular tone and growth factor induction. Additionally, ATII is a pro-atherogenic factor as it is capable of stimulating vascular SMC proliferation through the generation of complex signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) that affect the expression of pathophysiologically relevant genes such as PDGF-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), PDGF-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and PDGF-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Vascular SMCs respond to ATII multiphasic manner: within seconds, ATII can activate PLC and Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization; within minutes, protein kinase C (PKC) and phospholipase D (PLD) are activated; and within hours, NADH/NADPH oxidase activity is stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The SMC response to ATII is influenced by its differentiation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). For example, in both cultured newborn rat arterial medial SMCs and rat arterial neointimal SMCs, PDGF-B mRNA expression is induced by ATII, but no change in B-chain expression is observed in rat adult SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). SMC heterogeneity is a well-known feature of this cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The &#x02018;contractile&#x02019; state, which is typical of the differentiated artery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), whereas the &#x02018;synthetic&#x02019; state is characteristic of developing or pathologic arteries and the SMCs exhibit an epithelioid shape with enhanced proliferative and migratory activity.</p><p>ATII has previously been shown to regulate PDGF-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), PDGF-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and PDGF-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) transcription, however the ATII-inducible expression of each isoform may be mediated by distinct mechanisms. In the case of PDGF-D, ATII acts through reactive oxygen species (ROS), specifically H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Ets-1, whereas ATII-inducible PDGF-B expression, although not yet fully elucidated, has been shown to be dependent on Ras, ERK and c-Jun-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. Furthermore, ATII activates the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway to stimulate Egr-1 and PDGF-A expression via a G+C-rich region (located &#x02212;76 to &#x02212;47 bp) in the proximal PDGF-A promoter bearing Egr-1-binding elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). This element is strikingly similar to that in the proximal PDGF-C promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Egr-1 mediates inducible PDGF-A and PDGF-C transcription in cells exposed to FGF-2 through this proximal element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Since this element controls inducible PDGF-A expression in cells exposed to a variety of other agonists and conditions [such as ATII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), PMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>)], we hypothesized that this element in the PDGF-C promoter regulates altered expression in response to other stimulants. It is presently unknown whether ATII regulates the PDGF-C gene. This demonstration is important, as it would place ATII as an agonist governing the expression of every known PDGF ligand.</p><p>This study reveals the existence of a second functional Egr-1-binding element in the PDGF-C promoter located &#x0223c;500 bp upstream of the proximal G + C-rich element previously shown by us to mediate FGF-2-inducible PDGF-C transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). We report that ATII induction of PDGF-C transcription is mediated by the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1) and Egr-1 activation through this upstream element. Moreover, we demonstrate that ATII-inducible PDGF-C expression is SMC differentiation state-dependent and that the two Egr-1-binding elements operate independently.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>ATII (Sigma) was dissolved in water (Baxter), aliquoted and stored at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C.

ATII regulation of PDGF-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) or PDGF-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) expression has only been studied in adult rat SMCs.

In contrast to results obtained using neonatal SMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>A&#x02013;C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A, B, E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>), ATII did not influence PDGF-C mRNA expression in adult SMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A and B), indicating that PDGF-C expression in SMC is differentiation state-specific. We explored whether the inability of ATII to influence PDGF-C expression in adult SMCs is due to the lack of induction of Egr-1 by ATII in this cell type. ATII stimulated Egr-1 mRNA expression in adult SMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C and D) as it did together with protein in neonatal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C). These observations therefore indicate Egr-1-dependent and -independent transcriptional control of PDGF-C between these SMC subtypes. To determine the functional importance of this upstream element in relation to Egr-1 and Sp1, transient co-transfection analysis was performed in WKY12-22 SMCs using wild-type (pPDGF-C-797) and mutant (pPDGF-C-797.mutEgr1) PDGF-C promoter together with expression vectors for Egr-1 and Sp1. Both transcription factors, as expected, activated the wild-type PDGF-C promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>A). However, whereas mutation of the distal element (&#x02212;543/&#x02212;535) blocked Egr-1 activation of the PDGF-C promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>A), disruption of this element did not alter Sp1's ability to activate the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>A). That Egr-1 and Sp1 were overexpressed in this context was demonstrated by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>B). These findings demonstrate that Sp1's transactivation of the PDGF-C promoter is not mediated by &#x02212;543/&#x02212;535, although Sp1 binds this element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;C). SMCs of distinct differentiation state respond to changes in the extracellular environment through different pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The present study demonstrates that ATII-inducible PDGF-C expression in SMCs is dissimilarly regulated in cells of neonatal and adult origin, by providing evidence for a novel ATII-AT1R-Egr-1-PDGF-C axis in SMCs of neonatal origin, but not in adult SMCs, where ATII induces Egr-1 but not PDGF-C. This study also demonstrates that ATII is a positive regulator of PDGF-C gene expression in neonatal SMCs, and for the first time, defines ATII as an agonist of all four known PDGF ligand chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>). Using nuclear extracts and recombinant proteins, we discovered this novel upstream element cooperatively binds both Egr-1 and Sp1, and mediates ATII-inducible PDGF-C expression. DNAzymes targeting Egr-1 mRNA established that Egr-1 plays a critical role in ATII-inducible PDGF-C expression. Additionally, by using pharmacologic inhibitors of each ATII receptor, AT1R and AT2R, we demonstrated that ATII acts through AT1R to induce PDGF-C expression. Element &#x02212;543/&#x02212;535 plays a critical role in both Egr-1- and ATII-activation of the PDGF-C promoter. Thus, although Egr-1 is a key regulator of ATII-inducible PDGF-C expression, this present study invites further investigation to rationalize differences in the transcriptional regulation of PDGF-C between SMC subtypes.
