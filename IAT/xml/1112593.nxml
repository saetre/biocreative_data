Because of its small size, large populations and self-fertilization of the hermaphrodite, functional predictions carried out by genetic modifications as well as RNAi screens, can be rapidly tested. This is an obvious advantage when compared to the increasingly complex <italic>Drosophila </italic>and mouse genomes. Therefore, the nematode <italic>C. elegans </italic>has emerged as an excellent entry point to begin to address these predictions. There are currently two main approaches in <italic>C. elegans </italic>to investigate gene function on a genomic scale using reverse-genetics. The first one is based on RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) where "functional knock-outs" of a particular gene can be studied and phenotypes identified. The other is a PCR -based technology to identify genetic mutants in a mutagenized library. Complementary expression data can also be acquired from microarray data or by Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) to identify genes that are co-expressed or up/down regulated under defined conditions. These methods can be directly combined, on a particular set of genes, to provide a comprehensive description of the gene's expression patterns and functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition, results can be refined using independent screens of other experimental systems, for example human cell lines.</p><p>RNAi based on the introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is the method that results in specific inactivation of the corresponding gene through the degradation of endogenous mRNA. It was originally described in <italic>C. elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and has become the main reverse-genetics tool for determining the function of specific genes. Several large-scale studies involving <italic>C. elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], subjected approximately 90% of the 19,427 predicted genes to down regulation via RNAi. Moreover, individual clones of the entire RNAi feeding library described in Fraser et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] can be ordered directly. In addition, in vitro synthesis of ~21-nt small interfering RNAs to mediate gene-specific suppression in mammalian cells have been developed in order to extend this particular technique to higher eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>80% of <italic>C. elegans </italic>genes have human homologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. As long as we are able to establish orthology, information obtained for a gene sequence in one organism is potentially transferable to the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, since the human and the worm genomes are phylogenetically very distant, in many cases these sequences are only able to produce poorly supported trees. Moreover, position of individual branches may not be conserved between different algorithms for finding distance trees. Phylogenetic reconstructions involving human/worm sequences in a number of cases are unable to resolve their exact phylogenetic past. In the case of orthology assignments they provide only an indication for its existence.</p><p>Moreover, sequence orthology does not necessarily imply the same function. However, genes shown to be descendants of the same gene (orthologous genes) have, in general retained the same function over the course of evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. If so, it is important to select for analysis only the genes where a clear orthology assignment can be established.</p><p>Based on a collection of uncharacterized protein families derived from a comparison of three available genomes including <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, <italic>C. elegans </italic>and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, an integrated in-house program for functional gene annotation was initiated. As part of this annotation effort, a set of genes originating from this collection of novel protein families was selected for functional analysis in both <italic>C. elegans </italic>and human cell lines.</p><p>In this study novel protein families are explored using a diverse set of technologies involving both <italic>in silico </italic>and experimental analysis with the intention of identifying interesting gene candidates showing evidence of highly conserved function which may serve as potential drug targets in the future.</p><p>We have sought to identify, through phylogenetic analysis, the most likely worm orthologs for a set of human genes. Expression patterns and RNAi data in the worm were obtained, as well as corresponding data using human cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis: the most likely ortholog?</title><p>Multiple gene duplication followed by massive gene loss and acquisition of novel functions has been shaping the evolution of distant organisms. In a search for the most likely orthologs, special attention must be paid to the fate of duplicated genes when related to speciation. Duplicated genes tend to evolve in different patterns following the duplication event arising from different functional constrains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>According to Remm et al. and Sonnhammer and Koonin, out-paralogs are paralogs that predate speciation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. By contrast, in-paralogs are genes that arose after speciation. Therefore, all in-paralogs are considered potential functional orthologs. Using translated sequence we compare maximum parsimony trees to neighbor joining counterparts. Genes for which the position of the branches (in particular the branches leading to <italic>C. elegans </italic>and its closest human homolog) was conserved between both algorithms chosen for finding distance trees (Neighbor joining versus Maximum Parsimony), were selected for the experimental study (Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.). This criterion has been used in order to eliminate genes producing unstable topologies caused by duplications or a generally weak phylogenetic signal. Also, in this way it was possible to infer the homolog which most likely retained the ancestral gene function.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Wormbase ID numbers and accession numbers for the analyzed set of <italic>C. elegans </italic>genes and their identified human homologs.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>C. elegans</italic></bold></td><td></td><td align="left"><bold>Human ortholg</bold></td><td></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Worm base ID</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Description</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Acession no.</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Description</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">T24D1.1</td><td align="left">Chondroitin synthase</td><td align="left">NP_055733</td><td align="left">Chondroitin synthase 1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">F23C8.6</td><td align="left">Predicted coding sequence</td><td align="left">NP_065145</td><td align="left">CHMP1.5 protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left">F38H4.7</td><td align="left">Predicted coding sequence</td><td align="left">AAK25825</td><td align="left">BTB/POZ domain containing protein 1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C05C8.6</td><td align="left">Predicted coding sequence</td><td align="left">NP_060267</td><td align="left">BTBD2 protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C01A2.4</td><td align="left">Predicted coding sequence</td><td align="left">NP_054762</td><td align="left">Hypothetical protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C11D2.4</td><td align="left">Predicted coding sequence</td><td align="left">NP_115683</td><td align="left">C9orf64 protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left">F41D9.1</td><td align="left">Predicted coding sequence</td><td align="left">NP_056520</td><td align="left">Hypothetical protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C47D12.2</td><td align="left">Predicted coding sequence</td><td align="left">NP_060123</td><td align="left">Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left">ZK795.3</td><td align="left">Predicted coding sequence</td><td align="left">NP_219484</td><td align="left">U3 snoRNP protein 4 homolog</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C17E4.3</td><td align="left">Predicted coding sequence</td><td align="left">NP_848545</td><td align="left">Hypothetical protein MGC48332</td></tr><tr><td align="left">B0379.4a</td><td align="left">Predicted coding sequence</td><td align="left">AAP34400</td><td align="left">HYA22 protein.

Our trees typically contain two or more human homologs showing significant sequence similarity to a single worm gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Therefore, we selected candidate genes by choosing genes that produced trees that allow for identification of single human sequences as the most probable orthologs. These trees clearly discriminate out-paralogs or other in-paralogs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In effect, well-supported trees showing a one-to-one relationship between human and worm sequence were selected. However, since the purpose of this analysis was to identify genes that most likely retained the same function rather than orthology <italic>sensu stricto</italic>, it is possible that in some cases a paralog (in-paralog) was selected as the most promising ortholog. In other words, the <italic>C. elegans </italic>genes that we identified are either true orthologs or the best in-paralogs to the corresponding human genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Despite the fact that the exact type of orthology encountered in individual trees could not always be identified, we find this level of resolution satisfactory for the purposes of this study.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Maximum parsimony and Neighbor joining trees for F41D9.1 (A, B) and C13F10.4 genes (C,D)</bold>.

Only genes able to produce trees as shown in A and B (F41D9.1) were subjected to experimental work.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-6-65-1"/></fig><p>Thus, phylogenetic analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) predicts F41D9.1 (Q94222) to have a similar function to human CAA18266. The tree also assigns other human sequences, namely BAA83007 and AAL55877, which are apparently a product of a duplication event in the mouse/human lineages, as either out-paralogs or in-paralogs. Regardless of their exact orthology/paralogy relation to the worm sequence, neither of them is the most probable ortholog.</p><p>To the contrary, a frequently encountered situation was obtained in the case of the worm gene C13F10.4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The two human sequences though rather similar having a protein matrix distance of 0.61482 (Philip package), were easily separated in both the Neighbor Joining tree (NJ tree) and the Maximum Parsimony tree (MP tree). The NJ tree in particular demonstrates that the gene was duplicated in the animal series starting from <italic>Gallus sp</italic>. and upwards. Thus, in an ideal case, phylogenetic analyzes would correctly identify the exact copy of the duplicated gene in the human genome and assign it to a single <italic>C. elegans </italic>sequence as its true ortholog, as shown for F41D9.1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The position of the other copy would point to its paralogous/in-paralogous relation to the worm sequence. However, the worm gene is either weakly associated with the branch leading to both human sequences (NJ tree, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and it forms a separate branch with the XP_113763 human sequence (MP tree, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><p><italic>C. elegans </italic>genes and their most probable human orthologs are shown in the Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

However, our results are consistent with another study published by Kamath et al. where no specific phenotype was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The mutant phenotype of C05C8.6 points to its involvement in embryonic and larval development with a molecular function associated with protein binding <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org"/>.</p><p>Although a greater proportion of genes show specific RNAi phenotypes when using <italic>rrf-3 </italic>strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], our results point to an increase in the severity of the phenotypes following down-regulation in the <italic>rrf-3 </italic>background, rather than additional phenotypes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Subcellular localization in human cell lines</title><p>For seven of the human orthologs presented in this study, we cloned full-length open reading frames (ORFs), representing encoded cDNAs, into vectors containing V5 epitope sequences in order to generate recombinant fusion proteins for immunofluorescence detection. Because of the novelty of these proteins and the lack of available antibodies against such proteins, it was necessary to overexpress in human cell lines and subsequently detect with antibodies against the V5 fusion tag. Subcellular localizations were obtained in two human cell lines: HeLa and Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK293). Endogenous expression for the proteins studied in the two cell lines was confirmed by RT-PCR.</p><p>NP_219484, human ortholog for ZK795.3, displays three distinct patterns: diffuse nuclear, nucleolar and nuclear foci (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). We were able to confirm the nucleolar pattern by colocalization with fibrillarin, a protein predominantly found in nucleoli and cajal bodies. We were unable to determine the exact sub-compartment to which the nuclear foci belong. However, the pattern is strikingly similar to that of paraspeckles. The proteins, described as U3 snoRNP protein 4 homologs, belong to the IMP4 family of proteins which are small ribonucleoproteins involved in pre-ribosomal RNA processing. These results are consistent with those previously obtained in yeast and recently described in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Based on the interaction of these proteins with snoRNA in 60-80S RNP complexes and their likely involvement in pre-rRNA processing, it is possible to speculate that the preferred location of the Imp4 protein is both transient and dynamic throughout the nucleus, which would explain the three patterns we observe.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localization of recombinant fusion proteins in human cell lines. </bold>Human protein NP_219484 (<italic>C. elegans </italic>protein ZK795.3) was detected in transfected HeLa cells with goat anti-V5 conjugated with FITC and co-localized with human anti-fibrillarin subsequently detected by donkey anti-rabbit Cy3 (A). Nuclei were stained with DAPI. This protein displays both a nucleolar (top row) and nuclear speckle (bottom row) pattern (A). NP_848545 (C. <italic>elegans </italic>protein C17E4.3) was detected in HEK293 cells with mouse anti-V5 and goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (B). Cells were costained with rabbit anti-Lamin and donkey anti-rabbit Cy3 illustrating a colocalization with the nuclear envelope (B). Partial ER and nuclear distributions were observed for NP_115683 by co-detection with rabbit anti-calreticulin in HeLa cells (C). AAP34400.1 was detected in HeLa cells at the plasma membrane by co-staining with Annexin II (left panel, D) and a partial colocalization with beta-actin was also detected (right panel, D).

We were able to confirm the presence of this protein at the nuclear membrane by colocalization with Lamin, denoting a possible role for this protein as part of the nuclear envelope (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). C3HC4 which contains a RING-finger motif, has been classified as the third member (MARCH-III) of the recently defined membrane-associated RING-CH protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The same authors reported that proteins belonging to this family, including MARCH-III, characteristically contain two predicted C-terminal transmembrane domains, indicating a possible association with membrane-bound organelles. Furthermore, Bartee et al. concluded that localization of human MARCH III by fusion protein overexpression revealed a punctate pattern partially overlapping with cytoplasmic vesicles, specifically early endosomes. However, we were unable to confirm this finding. It is important to note that proteins are, in many cases, dynamic in location meaning that there are potentially multiple locations. Thus, our co-staining data are the most compelling we have seen.</p><p>AAK25825/NP_079514, also described as BTB/POZ domain containing 1 (BTBD1), exhibited a cytoplasmic pattern resembling elongated "worm-like" bodies for which we were unable to determine a known structure (data not shown). Members of this domain family have been shown to interact with co-repressor complexes involved in transcriptional repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Previously, BTBD1 has been shown to interact specifically with topoisomerase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, a recent study further characterized BTBD1 as colocalizing with TRIM family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Interestingly, TRIM proteins have been shown to exhibit ubiquitin ligase activity.</p><p>NP_115683 has no functional annotation and has only been described as an open reading frame located on human chromosome 9. This protein exhibits weak expression when "overexpressed" under control of CMV promoter. Immunofluourescence shows this protein to have both a cytoplasmic and a nuclear distribution. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic expression appears punctate and partially colocalizes with calreticulin, a marker for endoplasmic reticulum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).</p><p>AAP34400.1/JC5707 is a member of a family of small C-terminal domain phosphatase (SCP3) and contains an NIF domain (Nuclear Lim Interacting factor-like phosphatase). Other members of this family have been shown to interact with RNA polymerase II and show nuclear localization (SCP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Surprisingly, SCP3 was detected at the plasma membrane by colocalization with annexin II, a known component of the plasma membrane (left panel, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). In addition to this pattern, we noted fibrous structures that partially colocalized with beta-actin (right panel, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>).</p><p>Hypothetical protein NP_056520 expression was detected by western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown). Microscopy detection displayed a cytoplasmic/nuclear rim staining pattern. However, western blot analysis revealed a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa which is inconsistent with the predicted size of 80 kDa, indicating a possible premature stop in translation or post-translational cleavage. In addition, we were unable to detect ectopic expression for NP_060123. Any attempts to detect this protein via western blot or microscopy were unsuccessful despite sequence validation of the corresponding expression plasmid.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Specific expression patterns have been identified for the F41D9.1, ZK795.3, C17E4.3 and C09D4.1 GFP-fusion strains. Visible RNAi phenotypes for T24D1.1, F23C8.6, ZK795.3 and B0379.4a were observed. RNAi on T24D1.1a produced an extensive phenotype that was not revealed in the large-scale study by Fraser et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus, our study shows the value of analyzes focusing on a small number of candidate genes where a variety rather then a pre-defined set of phenotypes are observed. In addition, immunofluorescence microscopy of human cell lines over-expressing NP_219484, NP_848545, AAK25825/NP_079514, NP_115683, AAP34400.1/JC5707 and NP_056520 has detected subcellular localization of the corresponding proteins.

Therefore, the absence of an observable RNAi phenotype may be explained by the known refractory nature of RNAi in this tissue. For the gene ZK795.3, which showed a more generalized effect on the development, corresponding widespread expression pattern was observed in the worm and in human cell lines. Given that the protein prediction indicates this gene as a snoRNP candidate, its involvement in a variety of cellular processes thus can be expected. To the contrary, restricted subcellular expression patterns in human cells observed in a few cases, for example the AAK25825 (F38H4.7) and NP_115683C11D2.4 genes (Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), correlate with the absence of phenotypes other than the wild type. This fact suggests that these genes may be of somewhat lesser importance.</p><p>In conclusion, this comparative <italic>C. elegans</italic>-human cell lines study based on orthology assignments explores gene functionality by combining two key aspects of functional genomics: a whole organism approach and protein overexpression data using cells lines.</p><p>Our results extend currently available information on the selected genes providing a step more towards identifying their exact function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>In order to select candidate genes for the RNAi experiments phylogenetic reconstructions were performed as follows: <italic>C. elegans </italic>and related sequences were collected from Genelynx <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genelynx.org"/> or/and Wormbase <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org"/>.

HEK293 and HeLa cells (ATCC) were maintained at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded on glass coverslips at 80% confluency 24 hours prior to transfection in DMEM containing 10% FBS without antibiotics. Cells were transiently transfected for 24&#x02013;48 hours with Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde/1.5% sucrose in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature (RT), after which cells were treated with 0.5% triton-X 100 in PBS for 5 minutes. Cells were incubated for 30 minutes at RT in blocking buffer (2% BSA in PBS) before detection with the primary antibodies. Fusion proteins were detected with either goat anti-V5 (1:500, Bethyl Laboratories) conjugated with a FITC label or an unlabeled mouse anti-V5 (1:200, Invitrogen) for which a secondary detection with goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:1000, Molecular Probes) was performed. Diluted antibodies were applied to coverslips and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 hours before washing in PBS. Samples were co-stained with the following organelle-specific antibodies and corresponding dilutions: rabbit anti-calreticulin (1:200, Affinity Bioreagents), human anti fibrillarin (1:100, a gift from Dr. N.
