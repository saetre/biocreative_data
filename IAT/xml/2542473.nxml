In addition, aberrant Notch signaling has been associated with several diseases and cancers. The core components of Notch signaling are cell surface single-pass type I transmembrane proteins: the receptor, Notch, and the ligands Delta (Dl) and Serrate (Jagged in vertebrates). Ligand binding to the extracellular domain of Notch results in a series of proteolytic cleavages mediated by kuzbanian, a disintegrin and metalloprotease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lieber et al., 2002</xref>), and by the &#x003b3;-secretase activity of the presenilin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Strooper et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Struhl and Greenwald, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Okochi et al., 2002</xref>). As a result, the intracellular domain of Notch is released from the cell membrane and translocates into the nucleus to activate the downstream target genes.</p><p>Notch signaling is iteratively involved in numerous developmental processes of various organs and affects lateral inhibition, binary cell fate decision, and inductive signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bray, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lai, 2004</xref>). A model system to study Notch signaling is the development of adult external sensory organs (ESOs) of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Modolell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lai, 2004</xref>). Each ESO develops from a field of equivalent cells that express similar levels of proneural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jan and Jan, 1993</xref>). Each cell in this group has the potential to develop into a sensory organ precursor (SOP), the mother cell of an ESO. However, because of lateral inhibition mediated by Notch signaling, only one or few cells are selected to acquire the SOP fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hartenstein and Posakony, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</xref>). The SOP then undergoes a series of asymmetrical divisions to generate four daughter cells that form the mature ESO, during which Notch signaling plays a crucial role in binary cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hartenstein and Posakony, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gho et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bardin et al., 2004</xref>). Defects in Notch signaling lead to bristle aberrations that can easily be identified under a dissection microscope. Thus, screens to identify novel components of the Notch signaling pathway can be based on assaying mitotic clones on the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> thorax for bristle abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berdnik et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jafar-Nejad et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gallagher and Knoblich, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The activity of Notch signaling is highly regulated through posttranslational modifications. For instance, the activity of the Notch receptor in certain contexts is modulated by extracellular posttranslational glycosylation mediated by ER enzymes, including rumi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acar et al., 2008</xref>) and <italic>O</italic>-fucosyl transferase-1, and the Golgi enzymes Fringe (glycosaminyl transferase) and Fringe connection (UDP sugar transporter; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haines and Irvine, 2003</xref>). In addition, <italic>O</italic>-fucosyl transferase-1 has been shown to act as a chaperone for Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Okajima et al., 2005</xref>). Whether maturation and folding of Notch within the secretory pathway require additional enzymes within the ER or Golgi has yet to be determined.</p><p>By performing a mosaic genetic screen for bristle aberrations, we show that a disulfide bond forming oxidase, ER oxidoreductin 1&#x02013;like (Ero1L), is required for Notch-dependent developmental processes. We find that Notch is a key target in <italic>Ero1L</italic> mutant cells. These cells exhibit a much-reduced ability of Notch to reach the cell membrane, thereby accumulating a vast amount of the protein in the ER. Our biochemical assays indicate that Ero1L plays a role in disulfide bond formation of the three Lin12-Notch repeats (LNRs). The specificity of this phenotype is quite surprising, as Ero1L is proposed to be a global regulator of disulfide bond formation in yeast.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Mutations in <italic>kiga</italic> cause bristle tufting and wing defects</title><p>To identify novel genes required for ESO development, we performed a mosaic genetic screen on chromosome 3L using the eyeless-flipase (<italic>ey-FLP</italic>) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stowers and Schwarz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Newsome et al., 2000</xref>). We generated ethyl methanesulfonate&#x02013;induced mutant clones during larval development and screened for bristle defects in adult heads (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Mutations in a single complementation group (two alleles, <italic>23T</italic> and <italic>335QRS</italic>) cause a bristle-tufting phenotype in homozygous mutant clones on the head epidermis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) and thorax (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and C'</xref>). In addition, mutations in this complementation group cause notching of the wing margin and thickening of the wing veins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). As these phenotypes are reminiscent of the loss of Notch function, we named this group <italic>kiga</italic>, which is phonetic for &#x0201c;notched&#x0201d; in Taiwanese.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Alleles of <italic>kiga</italic> cause bristle tufting and wing defects.</bold> (A) The bristle and socket cells are external structures of a mechanosensory organ (arrowhead).

To probe whether lateral inhibition is affected in <italic>kiga</italic> mutant clones, we performed immunostaining using anti-Sens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nolo et al., 2000</xref>) to label the SOPs in pupal nota at 12 h after puparium formation (APF) when the primary SOPs of the bristles are specified.

Cells in the large homozygous mutant clones lack expression of Cut at the DV boundary. A higher magnification of a small portion of D is shown in E and E'.

Consistent with the role of <italic>kiga</italic> in lateral inhibition, Cut expression in <italic>kiga</italic> mutant clones is expanded (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and C'</xref>). However, fate specification occurs normally, as the neuronal marker Elav is expressed in the <italic>kiga</italic> clones at 24 h APF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and C'</xref>), and the adult phenotype indicates that the shaft and socket cells of the ESO can differentiate properly. These data indicate that <italic>kiga</italic> is specifically required for lateral inhibition but not for cell fate decisions and differentiation.</p><p>During adult wing development, the formation of the dorsal&#x02013;ventral (DV) boundary is crucial for compartmentalization and is dependent on Notch signaling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A'</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Celis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Celis and Bray, 1997</xref>). In agreement with the notching phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), we observed a loss of Cut, a downstream target of Notch signaling at the DV boundary in large <italic>kiga</italic> mutant clones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and D'</xref>), indicating that <italic>kiga</italic> plays a role in inductive Notch signaling. Note that <italic>kiga</italic> mutant cells located in the vicinity of wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and D'</xref>; green) do express Cut at the boundary. Interestingly, these cells are clearly less affected by the loss of <italic>kiga</italic> (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and B'</xref>).</p><p>We then sought to examine whether <italic>kiga</italic> can genetically modify Notch-related phenotypes. For example, a hypermorphic allele of Notch (<italic>N<sup>AxE-2</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Celis and Garcia-Bellido, 1994</xref>) exhibits a loss of the fourth and fifth wing veins in male flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>) caused by a gain of function of Notch. Because the wing vein-thickening phenotype associated with <italic>kiga</italic> mutants might be caused by a loss of Notch signaling activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), we examined whether loss of <italic>kiga</italic> can suppress the severity of the wing phenotype in <italic>N<sup>AxE-2</sup></italic> mutant flies. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>, removal of one copy of <italic>kiga</italic> in <italic>N<sup>AxE-2</sup></italic> mutant flies leads to a suppression of the wing vein loss phenotype. In addition, we examined whether <italic>kiga</italic> can genetically modify the ectopic wing vein phenotype of a gain of function allele of EGF receptor, <italic>Elp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lesokhin et al., 1999</xref>). We found that removal of one copy of <italic>kiga</italic> does not affect the ectopic wing vein formation of <italic>Elp/</italic>&#x0002b; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, compare the arrow in H with the arrow in I). In summary, these observations indicate that <italic>kiga</italic> selectively affects Notch signaling.</p><p>To determine whether <italic>kiga</italic> affects other signaling pathways, we examined the readouts for the decapentaplegic (Dpp) and hedgehog (Hh) pathways. Dpp and Hh signaling are required for anterior&#x02013;posterior (AP) boundary formation during wing development. We found that the levels of phospho-Mad, a downstream effector of Dpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tanimoto et al., 2000</xref>), in mutant clones are comparable with wild-type cells near the AP boundary, indicating that the Dpp pathway is unaffected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, J and J'</xref>). Similarly, the expression of cubitus interruptus (Ci), the target of Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Motzny and Holmgren, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang and Holmgren, 1999</xref>), is unaffected in the posterior compartment in <italic>kiga</italic> mutant clones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, K and K'</xref>). These observations are in agreement with the adult wing phenotypes that indicate that <italic>kiga</italic> is not required for AP patterning of the wing and suggest that loss of <italic>kiga</italic> results in specific defects in Notch signaling.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>kiga</italic> is required for Notch signaling in the signal-receiving cells</title><p>To determine whether <italic>kiga</italic> is required for the Notch signaling in the signal-sending or signal-receiving cell, we analyzed the role of <italic>kiga</italic> in ovary development.

Each EGF repeat and LNR has three disulfide bonds. As unpaired cysteine residues induce a prominent UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frand and Kaiser, 1998</xref>), it is likely that some or many disulfide bonds of the NECD require Ero1L to fold properly. Furthermore, the unpaired cysteines of Notch should result in the misfolding and accumulation of Notch in the ER. Indeed, we noticed strikingly high levels of Notch in <italic>Ero1L</italic> mutant cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and B'</xref>) except in the vicinity of the DV boundary (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B'</xref>, arrows), where Notch accumulation is less obvious (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D&#x02013;E</xref>). In addition, intracellularly accumulated Notch colocalizes with another ER marker, Boca, a chaperone protein of the ER (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C&#x02013;D</xref>''; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Culi and Mann, 2003</xref>). Expression of Boca is also up-regulated in <italic>Ero1L</italic> mutant clones (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C'' and D''</xref>), indicating that the ER is likely expanded and that the levels of multiple chaperones are up-regulated during a UPR.</p><p>In the apical section in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 (C&#x02013;C'')</xref>, the normal cortical localization of Notch in the mutant region is dramatically decreased, suggesting that Notch cannot be inserted into cell membrane in <italic>Ero1L</italic> mutant cells. To examine this, we immunostained unpermeablized cells in wing imaginal discs using an antibody recognizing the NECD. We found that membrane-associated Notch is greatly reduced in <italic>Ero1L</italic> mutant clones (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, E and E'</xref>), whereas total Notch staining is greatly enhanced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E''</xref>). These data indicate that the vast majority of Notch is presumably misfolded in the ER and unable to reach the cell membrane in the absence of <italic>Ero1L</italic>.</p><p>To rule out the possibility that higher levels of Notch are secondary to induction of the UPR, we overexpressed a mutant form of Hsc3 to ectopically induce ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elefant and Palter, 1999</xref>) under the control of the <italic>patched-GAL4</italic> driver. Immunostaining of Notch indicates that neither the localization nor the expression levels of Notch are affected in the <italic>Hsc3</italic> expression domain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, F and F'</xref>), indicating that the accumulation of Notch in the ER is caused by the loss of <italic>Ero1L</italic>.</p><p>It is important to emphasize that the accumulation of Notch in <italic>Ero1L</italic> mutant tissue gradually decreases with time. When the SOPs are selected from the proneural cluster at 12 h APF, the accumulation of Notch in mutant tissue is most extreme (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, G and G'</xref>). However, by 24 h APF, the accumulation of Notch in <italic>Ero1L</italic> mutant tissue has decreased to near wild-type levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, H and H'</xref>). This correlates with the adult phenotype, in which only inductive signaling and lateral inhibition are affected. As a significant decrease in Notch protein levels between 12 and 24 h APF, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the UPR may help fold Notch and/or promote degradation of misfolded proteins through a mechanism known as ER-associated protein degradation, whose components are induced by the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Travers et al., 2000</xref>). This process may thereby allow Notch to function properly during the later cell fate specification events.</p></sec><sec><title>Notch is a major target of Ero1L</title><p>Our phenotypic analyses suggest that loss of Ero1L causes a rather specific defect in Notch signaling. If Notch is one of a few key affected proteins in <italic>Ero1L</italic> mutants, the UPR should be significantly diminished when <italic>Notch</italic> is removed in <italic>Ero1L</italic> mutant clones.

Although the residual up-regulation of Hsc3 suggests that there are unidentified targets of Ero1L, the result strongly suggests that Notch is a major target of Ero1L and that the accumulation of misfolded Notch in the ER activates a strong and transient UPR in the absence of Ero1L.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Notch is a major target in <italic>Ero1L</italic> mutant cells.</bold> (A&#x02013;D') Confocal sections through wing imaginal discs harboring <italic>Ubx-FLP</italic>&#x02013;induced mutant clones (lack of GFP expression).

Finally, proteins that contain Ig-like repeats with disulfide bonds such as FasII are also unaffected in their subcellular distribution (unpublished data). Together, these data indicate that Ero1L is quite specifically required for Notch to exit the ER and reach the cell membrane.</p><p>In the contexts that we have examined so far, it seems that disulfide bond formation of many proteins does not depend on Ero1L function. It has been shown that a quiescin/Sox (QSOX) protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoober et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thorpe and Coppock, 2007</xref>) can carry out thiol oxidation in vitro, and overexpression of QSOX in yeast can rescue the lethality of <italic>ero1</italic>. Because there are three uncharacterized homologues of this QSOX family in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hoober et al., 1999a</xref>), we surmise that these proteins may have a previously unidentified role in oxidative folding in the ER. Two of the QSOX genes, <italic>CG6690</italic> and <italic>CG17843</italic>, are less likely to be involved in general protein folding in the ER because a microarray study has shown that these proteins have a specific expression pattern in male accessory gonads of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chintapalli et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, another <italic>QSOX</italic> gene, <italic>CG4670</italic> (<italic>QSOX1</italic>), exhibits widespread expression in different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chintapalli et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting a role for this gene in general ER protein folding. To characterize the function of <italic>CG4670</italic>, we knocked down CG4670 using RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dietzl et al., 2007</xref>) with the ubiquitous drivers <italic>da-GAL4</italic> and <italic>act-GAL4</italic> at 29&#x000b0;C. Although the mRNA of CG4670 is significantly knocked down (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>), this did not result in any lethality or developmental defects. In addition, knocking down CG4670 with tissue-specific drivers, including <italic>patched-GAL4</italic>, <italic>neuralized-GAL4</italic>, and <italic>nubbin (nub)-Gal4</italic>, did not result in any observable phenotypes in the wing or notum (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 F</xref>; and not depicted), suggesting that <italic>CG4670</italic> is not specifically required for Notch signaling.</p><p>To examine whether CG4670 can contribute to disulfide bond formation when Ero1L function is compromised, we performed genetic interaction experiments between these two genes.

We examined the secretion efficiency of LNR domains (3XLNR) and EGF domains (6XEGF) tagged with a signal peptide for secretion in S2 cells when <italic>Ero1L</italic> is reduced. The constructs were transfected in S2 cells, and similar levels of secreted proteins in the medium were observed for both proteins (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>, bottom, lanes 1 and 3). Although secretion of 6XEGF is unaffected in <italic>Ero1L</italic> knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>, bottom, lanes 1 and 2), the amount of 3XLNR in the medium of cells in which Ero1L is reduced through RNAi is much diminished (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>, compare lane 3 with lane 4), indicating that Ero1L is required for proper 3XLNR secretion but not for 6XEGF.

A similar molecular weight shift is observed in Ero1L knockdown lysate without prior DTT treatment (lane 4), indicating a loss of disulfide bond formation in a portion of the LNR domain.

This compound can covalently react with a free thiol on the cysteine residue and increase the molecular mass by 490 D per cysteine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kobayashi et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, if there is a defect in disulfide bond formation of the 3XLNR domain when Ero1L is knocked down, we expect a mobility shift of this domain by &#x0223c;9 kD using Western blot analysis after incubation with AMS. As a positive control, the LNRs were reduced with DTT incubation before AMS incubation, and a clear mobility shift by &#x0223c;10 kD was observed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>, compare lane 6 with lane 5). When Ero1L knockdown was performed, a fraction of the LNR domain showed a similar mobility shift as in our positive control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>, compare lane 4 with lane 6), indicating that a certain proportion of the cysteine residues of the LNRs are in the thiol form. This is in contrast with the result obtained from a negative control experiment in which an EGFP double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was used (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>, lane 2). Although a considerable fraction of the LNRs does not exhibit a mobility shift in our Ero1L knockdown experiments (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>, lane 4), we propose that this is likely caused by an incomplete knockdown of Ero1L. Alternatively, the remaining capacity of disulfide bond formation in the S2 cell may be dependent on QSOX protein, allowing formation of the disulfide bonds in Notch.</p><p>In summary, the data indicate that disulfide bond formation of the LNR domain and the subsequent trafficking of this domain from the ER require Ero1L, supporting our hypothesis that Notch is a major target of Ero1L.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have isolated mutations in <italic>Ero1L</italic> in a mosaic screen that cause <italic>Notch</italic>-related phenotypes.

However, it is not clear whether Ero1L can affect specific subsets of disulfide-containing proteins in vivo in different physiological contexts.</p><sec><title>Ero1L is required for Notch signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>Several datasets indicate that Ero1L function affects Notch signaling rather specifically during development. First, lateral inhibition, inductive signaling, and follicle cell differentiation, which are hallmarks of Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bray, 1998</xref>), are defective in <italic>Ero1L</italic> mutant clones. Second, downstream targets of the Dpp and Hh signaling pathways are properly expressed in <italic>Ero1L</italic> mutants. Third, several membrane proteins other than Notch are expressed and localized normally in <italic>Ero1L</italic> mutant clones. Fourth, the UPR induced in <italic>Ero1L</italic> mutant clones is considerably reduced in clones that are double mutant for <italic>Notch</italic> and <italic>Ero1L</italic>. Thus, the data strongly argue that Notch is a major substrate for Ero1L or that Notch is an extremely sensitive target when Ero1L function is compromised.</p><p>In yeast, Ero1p relies on PDIs to transfer oxidizing equivalents for folding substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tu et al., 2000</xref>). Because certain members of the PDI family exhibit substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ellgaard and Ruddock, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jessop et al., 2007</xref>), it has been proposed that different disulfide bond structures may be oxidized by specific sets of PDI family members. Although it is quite surprising that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ero1L has a quite specific role in Notch signaling, it is likely that one or several PDIs are required to interact with Ero1L to function in the Notch signaling. Furthermore, the Notch loss of function phenotype associated with the loss of <italic>Drosophila Ero1L</italic> can be rescued by overexpressing human <italic>ERO1-L&#x003b1;</italic>, suggesting that the role of Ero1L in Notch signaling is conserved in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec><title>Ero1L affects the LNR domain of Notch</title><p>Notch, Dl, and Serrate have numerous EGF motifs in their extracellular domain, and each motif has three cysteine bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Downing et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hambleton et al., 2004</xref>), leading to the possibility that these proteins are likely candidate substrates for Ero1L. The in vivo overexpression experiments using Dl, full-length Notch, and NEXT in <italic>Ero1L</italic> mutant clones strongly suggest that Ero1L is involved in folding of the NECD. Furthermore, clonal analyses show that only Notch exhibits strong ER accumulation, whereas other EGF-containing membrane proteins are unaffected. This suggests that a unique portion in NECD depends critically on Ero1L function. In addition to the EGFs, the NECD also contains another type of domain with cysteine bridges, namely three LNRs. The LNRs are found in all Notch homologues, including Lin12, Notch, and Notch 1&#x02013;4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanchez-Irizarry et al., 2004</xref>). The only other LNR-containing proteins are mammalian proteins termed pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (pappalysin-1) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A2 (pappalysin-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boldt et al., 2004</xref>), which have no homologues in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This observation prompted us to test whether the LNRs are the target of Ero1L. Our biochemical data indicate that cysteine bridge formation in the LNRs is clearly impaired in <italic>Ero1L</italic> knockdown cells. Thus, Ero1L-dependent disulfide bond formation in the LNR domain but not the EGF domain may also underlie the specificity of the phenotype associated with the loss of Ero1L.</p><p>Before ligand activation, the interaction between the LNRs and the nearby heterodimer domain of Notch mediates an autoinhibitory function that renders Notch resistant to S2 cleavage and thus regulates ligand-dependent Notch activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanchez-Irizarry et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gordon et al., 2007</xref>). Deletions in the autoinhibitory domain result in a gain of function activity of the Notch receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Greenwald and Seydoux, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lieber et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry et al., 1997</xref>). It is therefore reasonable to surmise that if the LNRs of Notch are misfolded and Notch were able to reach the membrane, it may have detrimental effects, as the protein is likely to be constitutively active. However, all of the gain of function mutations identified in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients reside in the heterodimer domain of Notch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weng et al., 2004</xref>). Quite possibly, a stringent quality control mechanism in the ER ensures proper folding of the LNRs. If mutations in the LNRs disrupt its proper folding, Notch will likely not exit the ER and reach the cell membrane. Furthermore, our genetic interaction data suggest that <italic>Ero1L</italic> loss of function can specifically suppress a <italic>Notch</italic> gain of function phenotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>). A plausible translational aspect is that partially knocking down Ero1L expression in Notch-dependent T cell leukemia could be considered as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Different thiol oxidases in ER-protein folding of metazoans</title><p>It is surprising that Ero1L, a thiol oxidase proposed to be involved in global disulfide bond formation in yeast, does not cause cell lethality in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. How do disulfide bonds form in the absence of Ero1L? We explored the possibility that other thiol oxidases (QSOX) are involved in ER disulfide bond formation. Although compromising QSOX does not cause a visible phenotype, genetic interaction between <italic>Ero1L</italic> and <italic>QSOX1</italic> (<italic>CG4670</italic>) suggests that a QSOX protein can indeed contribute to disulfide bond formation when Ero1L function is decreased. Together with the strong UPR observed in <italic>Ero1L</italic> mutant cells, we propose that the UPR can either enhance the expression of QSOX or potentiate similar proteins at a later developmental phase. This also suggests that regulation of thiol oxidases in multicellular organisms is more complex than in yeast.</p><p>In summary, through characterization of the loss of function phenotypes of <italic>Ero1L</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we find that Ero1L is involved in Notch signaling.
