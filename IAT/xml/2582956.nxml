In plants, targeting of DRM2 depends on small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), although the molecular details are still unclear. Here, we show that two SRA-domain proteins (SUVH9 and SUVH2) are also essential for DRM2-mediated de novo and maintenance DNA methylation in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. At some loci, SUVH9 and SUVH2 act redundantly, while at other loci only SUVH2 is required, and this locus specificity correlates with the differing DNA-binding affinity of the SRA domains within SUVH9 and SUVH2. Specifically, SUVH9 preferentially binds methylated asymmetric sites, while SUVH2 preferentially binds methylated CG sites. The <italic>suvh9</italic> and <italic>suvh2</italic> mutations do not eliminate siRNAs, suggesting a role for SUVH9 and SUVH2 late in the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. With these new results, it is clear that SRA-domain proteins are involved in each of the three pathways leading to DNA methylation in Arabidopsis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Our genetic heritage plays an important role in determining who we are and the characteristics we possess. However, in the past decade it has become increasingly clear that in addition to the genes we inherit, a second level of information is critical for expression of these genes. This information takes the form of modifications to either the DNA (DNA methylation) or the proteins that package the DNA (histones). These modifications can determine whether a gene is expressed or silenced. In this paper, we identify two new genes that are part of a DNA methylation&#x02013;targeting pathway in the model plant <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Disruption of these two closely related genes prevents DNA methylation by one of the cellular DNA methyltransferases. However, these genes are not simply redundant. They are both capable of binding methylated DNA, but differ in their preference for specific sequences in the genome. This ability to bind to methylated DNA suggests that these proteins help target or retain the modification apparatus at particular regions of the genome. These results are important in that they identify two new players in this vital cellular process and bring us closer to understanding how epigenetic modifications can be targeted to specific genes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytosine methylation is found in the genomes of most eukaryotes and plays a critical role in repression of transposable elements as well as in the epigenetic regulation of select genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000280-Yoder1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000280-Zilberman1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

This phenotype, which consists of curling of the leaves and short stature, has recently been shown to be caused by the ectopic expression of an F-box gene, <italic>SUPPRESSOR of DRM1 DRM2 CMT3 (SDC)</italic>, which is silenced by non-CG DNA methylation occurring at tandem repeats found in its promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000280-Henderson2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this respect, mutations in siRNA biosynthesis pathway genes can substitute for <italic>drm2</italic> mutations, and <italic>kyp</italic> mutations can substitute for <italic>cmt3</italic> mutations. For example, the <italic>SDC</italic> overexpression developmental phenotype can also be seen in the following triple mutants: <italic>drm1 drm2 kyp</italic>, <italic>nrpd2a nrpd2b kyp</italic>, and <italic>nrpd2a nrpd2b cmt3</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000280-Chan3">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000280-Henderson2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on the morphological defect of the <italic>suvh9 suvh2 kyp</italic> triple mutant, we therefore reasoned that these mutations must also be blocking both the DRM2 and the CMT3 pathways.

At two loci whose non-CG methylation mostly depends on CMT3, the 180 base pair <italic>CEN</italic> repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000280-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) and the retrotransposon <italic>Ta3</italic> (data not shown), we did not observe an effect on either CG methylation or CHG methylation, further suggesting that SUVH9 and SUVH2 are specific to the DRM pathway. Methylation of <italic>Ta3</italic> and the <italic>CEN</italic> repeats is also strongly dependent on the MET1 pathway, indicating the SUVH9 and SUVH2 do not affect this pathway either. At the single copy SINE element, <italic>AtSN1</italic>, which is methylated by both DRM2 and CMT3, <italic>suvh9</italic> again had no effect while <italic>suvh2</italic> reduced non-CG methylation by 50&#x00025;.

The SET domain aligns closest to the H3K9 methyltransferases, but one of the most conserved sequences in the carboxy-terminal region of the SET domain (RFxNHxCxPN) is highly diverged, replaced with a sequence that is highly conserved between SUVH9 and SUVH2 homologs in rice and poplar (CYxSHSxxPN; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000280.s001">Figure S1</xref>). SUVH9, SUVH2, and their homologs are also missing the post-SET domain. This conservation suggests that this region is important functionally, but may have a distinct activity compared to the other SUVH proteins. Conflicting results have been reported regarding the histone methyltransferase activity of these enzymes. One report found no histone methyltransferase activity in SUVH9 and SUVH2 GST fusion proteins using calf thymus histones as substrates, whereas activity for SUVH4 (KYP), SUVH5 and SUVH6 fusions was easily observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000280-Ebbs2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

We repeated these assays for both SUVH2 and SUVH9 and did not observe activity in vitro using either histones or nucleosomes as a substrate.

Furthermore, we could detect binding of AdoMet (the methyl donor for methyltransferase enzymes) to KYP but not to SUVH9 or SUVH2, suggesting that these two proteins may have lost methyltransferase activity.</p><p>It is possible that SUVH9 and SUVH2 require another protein for activity, or possibly dimerize in vivo to create an active site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000280-Manzur1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000280-Tenney1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.

We immunoprecipitated SUVH9 and SUVH2 from plants and assayed their ability to methylate histones or nucleosomes, but again no activity was observed. Thus, while our results cannot rule out that SUVH9 and SUVH2 are active methyltransferases, they do raise the possibility that the SET domains are acting in a different manner.

SUVH9 prefers methylated CHH, binding with a higher affinity when a G residue is not located in the two adjacent positions. This differs from KYP and SUVH6 which preferentially bind to CHG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000280-Johnson1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Biologically this preference for CHH makes sense because DRM2 is essential for maintaining CHH residues. SUVH2 binding specificity for methylated CG sites was more surprising. DRM2 from tobacco is active in vitro, and preferentially methylates CHH and CHG and only methylates CG residues at a low frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000280-Wada1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, SUVH2 appears to be binding to a sequence not commonly maintained by DRM2.

Thus, one possibility is that SUVH2 may function by linking CG methylation and non-CG methylation.</p><p>The difference in binding specificity of the SRA domains of SUVH2 and SUVH9 correlates well with the loci that are preferentially affected in the mutants. Both <italic>MEA-ISR</italic> and <italic>FWA</italic> are rich in methylated CG residues (8 mCGs:4 methylated non-CGs in <italic>MEA-ISR</italic>; 20 mCGs:4 methylated non-CGs in <italic>FWA</italic>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000280-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and show a strong dependence on SUVH2 which preferentially binds to methylated CGs.

One possibility is that SUVH2 could retain DRM2 at sites rich in methylated CG and SUVH9 could do the same at sites rich in non-CG methylation. These SRA proteins would then provide a link between establishment of methylation and maintenance methylation. Alternatively, SUVH9 and SUVH2 may recruit or retain a component of the DRM2 pathway which is needed for DRM2 activity. It is also possible that SUVH2 and SUVH9 directly participate in the silencing of DNA methylated genes, and that some of the loss of DNA methylation observed in <italic>suvh2</italic> and <italic>suvh9</italic> mutants is due to secondary effects of the loss of gene silencing or other chromatin marks. Regardless of the specific mechanism involved, these results show that each of the major methylation systems in Arabidopsis require an SRA-domain protein for function. CG methylation by MET1 involves VIM1 (an SRA protein homologous to UHRF1 which specifically binds hemimethylated CG sites; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000280-Bostick1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000280-Woo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>) CMT3 is dependent on KYP, which specifically binds methylated CHG; and DRM2 requires SUVH9 and SUVH2, which bind to methylated CHH or methylated CG, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant Materials</title><p>The <italic>drm1 drm2 cmt3</italic> and <italic>drm1 drm2 kyp</italic> triple mutants were generated in the Columbia background and have been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000280-Chan3">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.
