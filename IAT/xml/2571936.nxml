Liaw, J.M. Mullington, S.C. Shih, H. Okada, N. Bodyak, P.M. Kang, L. Toltl, B. Belikoff, J. Buras, et al. 2006. <italic>J. Exp. Med.</italic> 203:1447&#x02013;1458). Moreover, enhanced VEGF/Flk-1 signaling was shown to contribute to sepsis morbidity and mortality. We tested the hypothesis that PlGF also contributes to sepsis outcome. In mouse models of endotoxemia and cecal ligation puncture, the genetic absence of PlGF or the systemic administration of neutralizing anti-PlGF antibodies resulted in higher mortality compared with wild-type or immunoglobulin G&#x02013;injected controls, respectively. The increased mortality associated with genetic deficiency of PlGF was reversed by adenovirus (Ad)-mediated overexpression of PlGF. In the endotoxemia model, PlGF deficiency was associated with elevated circulating levels of VEGF, induction of VEGF expression in the liver, impaired cardiac function, and organ-specific accentuation of barrier dysfunction and inflammation. Mortality of endotoxemic PlGF-deficient mice was increased by Ad-mediated overexpression of VEGF and was blocked by expression of soluble Flt-1. Collectively, these data suggest that up-regulation of PlGF in sepsis is an adaptive host response that exerts its benefit, at least in part, by attenuating VEGF signaling.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: Ad, adenovirus; CLP, cecal ligation puncture; COX, cyclooxygenase; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; MPO, myeloperoxidase; PlGF, placental growth factor; sFlt-1, soluble Flt-1; VCAM, vascular cell adhesion molecule; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; also termed VEGF-A) is a member of a growing family of related proteins that include VEGF-B, -C, and -D, and placental growth factor (PlGF; for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). VEGF/vascular permeability factor was first identified and characterized by Senger et al. as a potent stimulator of endothelial permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). VEGF was subsequently reported to promote proliferation, migration, and survival of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). In addition, VEGF has been implicated in inflammatory processes, including rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated increased VEGF levels in animal and human models of sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Importantly, inhibition of VEGF signaling with soluble Flt-1 (sFlt-1) or antibodies against Flk-1 improved morbidity and mortality in septic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>).</p><p>PlGF occurs in four isoforms in humans (PlGF-1&#x02013;4), and in one isoform in mice (PlGF-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). PlGF was originally identified in the placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) but has subsequently been shown to be expressed in other tissues, including the heart, lung, thyroid gland, and skeletal muscle (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Circulating levels of PlGF are normally undetectable. However, increased PlGF levels have been described in several conditions, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), cutaneous wound and bone fracture healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), atherosclerosis, and sickle cell disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Recently, we demonstrated that circulating levels of PlGF are elevated in mouse and human models of sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Previous studies have implicated a role for PlGF in inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that elevated levels of PlGF in sepsis might contribute (as do increased VEGF levels) to the pathophysiology of the host response to infection. On the contrary, we found that PlGF protects against sepsis morbidity and mortality.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>PlGF protein and mRNA levels are induced in animal models of sepsis</title><p>We recently demonstrated that circulating PlGF levels are increased in C57BL/6 mice injected with LPS or subjected to cecal ligation puncture (CLP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). The PlGF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice used in this study were backcrossed to an FVB background. Previous studies have demonstrated strain-specific sensitivity to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Thus, we wished to confirm these findings in FVB mice. The i.p. administration of 18 mg/kg LPS resulted in a time-dependent increase in plasma PlGF concentrations, with peak levels (3,447.4 pg/ml) occurring at 24 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Similarly, in a CLP model of sepsis, peak levels of PlGF (111.4 pg/ml) occurred at 24 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Previously, we demonstrated that PlGF protein levels were increased in all tissues examined, including the brain, lung, heart, liver, kidney, and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). In real-time PCR assays, there was a time-dependent induction of PlGF transcripts at 24 h in the brain (5.3-fold), lung (14.3-fold), liver (28-fold), kidney (25.7-fold), and spleen (8.5-fold). PlGF mRNA levels in the heart peaked at 6 h (54.2-fold; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies revealed a PlGF signal in perivascular cells but not the endothelium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> shows the heart, lung, and liver). Collectively, these findings suggest that sepsis is associated with the widespread induction of PlGF mRNA and protein expression.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>PlGF levels in sepsis and survival studies in PlGF-deficient mice.</bold> (A, a) Plasma levels of PlGF in wild-type male FVB mice injected i.p. with 18 mg/kg LPS at the time points indicated.

To that end, 10&#x02013;12-wk-old PlGF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice or wild-type littermates were administered 18 mg/kg LPS or subjected to CLP. PlGF deficiency was associated with significantly lower survival rate in both the endotoxemia model (wild-type male, 62.5% vs. PlGF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> male, 11.8%; wild-type female, 56.3% vs. PlGF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> female, 12.5%) and in CLP (wild-type male, 50% vs. PlGF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> male, 0%; wild-type female, 50% vs. PlGF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> female, 0%; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). The differences in survival between wild-type male and female FVB mice were not statistically significant. Interestingly, the increased mortality associated with the genetic deficiency of PlGF was less pronounced in younger mice (6 wk old; unpublished data). To test for the effect of acute PlGF down-regulation in the adult animal, FVB mice were administered 1 mg of neutralizing monoclonal anti-PlGF antibody (clone 5D11D4) i.p. 20 h before initiation of sepsis. In these experiments, PlGF levels in the plasma were undetectable (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In 10&#x02013;12-wk-old male mice, anti-PlGF antibody&#x02013;mediated depletion of PlGF resulted in reduced sepsis survival in LPS-treated mice (control IgG, 62.5% vs. PlGF antibody, 12.5%) and mice subjected to CLP (control IgG, 50% vs. PlGF antibody, 0%; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Similar results were obtained in female mice and in younger animals (6 wk old; unpublished data). Thus, PlGF has a protective role in sepsis.</p></sec><sec><title>PlGF deficiency is associated with increased VEGF levels in sepsis</title><p>We previously demonstrated that endotoxemia in mice is associated with increased circulating levels of VEGF, sFlt-1, and the inflammatory marker IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). In this study, there were no differences in baseline plasma levels of VEGF, sFlt-1, or IL-6 in PlGF-deficient mice versus wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). As expected, PlGF levels were undetectable under all conditions in PlGF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and antibody-treated animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A, a and e</xref>). In response to 16 mg/kg LPS, PlGF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice demonstrated significantly higher plasma levels of VEGF (2.6-fold) and IL-6 (2.4-fold) compared with wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A, b and d</xref>). The dose of 16 mg/kg LPS was chosen for these and subsequent morbidity experiments because 18 mg/kg LPS led to nearly 100% mortality (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). A similar effect was observed in PlGF antibody&#x02013;treated animals compared with IgG&#x02013;injected controls (VEGF, 3-fold; IL-6, 1.7-fold; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A, f and h</xref>). In contrast, PlGF deficiency did not influence endotoxemia-mediated induction of sFlt-1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A, c and g</xref>). In wild-type mice, endotoxemia was associated with reduced VEGF protein levels in the lung at 6 h, and in the lung and brain at 24 h, and with increased VEGF protein levels in the liver and kidney at 6 h and in the spleen at 24 h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Compared with wild-type mice, PlGF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice demonstrated significantly higher levels of VEGF protein and mRNA in the liver at 24 h.

PlGF is thought to bind to VEGFR1/Flt-1 and the coreceptors neuropilin-1 and -2. The interaction between PlGF and VEGFR1/Flt-1 has been shown both to trigger downstream signaling and to enhance VEGF signaling via VEGFR2/Flk-1 (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Although PlGF is not required for developmental angiogenesis, it appears to play an important role in postnatal angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and vasculogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). In addition, increasing evidence points to a proinflammatory effect of PlGF. Most notably, PlGF-mediated induction of monocyte migration and activation has been shown to contribute to tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), sickle cell disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). In addition, PlGF has been causally linked to vascular permeability and plasma extravasation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>).</p><p>From a mechanistic standpoint, it has been proposed that PlGF displaces VEGF from VEGFR1/Flt-1, thus promoting VEGF&#x02013;VEGFR2/Flk-1 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Moreover, PlGF-mediated activation of VEGFR1/Flt-1 may lead to the transactivation of VEGFR2/Flk-1, further enhancing the response to VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Previous studies have revealed that PlGF up-regulates the expression of VEGF by periendothelial fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, or inflammatory cells in wound or tumor stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Together with our recent observations that sepsis is associated with elevated levels of VEGF and PlGF, and that VEGF plays a pathogenic role in sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), these data led us to hypothesize that elevated levels of PlGF would accentuate sepsis morbidity and mortality. On the contrary, we found that PlGF plays a net protective role in mouse models of sepsis.</p><p>A clue to the mechanism by which PlGF deficiency causes increased morbidity and mortality was found in our discovery of elevated circulating VEGF levels in septic PlGF-deficient mice. Moreover, Ad-mediated expression of sFlt-1 reversed the excess mortality in LPS-treated PlGF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Thus, the increased mortality associated with PlGF deficiency is attributed, at least in part, to exaggerated VEGF levels. Previous studies have demonstrated that PlGF and VEGF, when produced by the same cell, may form PlGF/VEGF heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). PlGF/VEGF heterodimers, in turn, have been shown to inhibit VEGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). In response to LPS, we found the majority of PlGF up-regulation in perivascular cells. Perivascular cells have also been shown to express VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the loss of PlGF yields not only elevated levels of free VEGF but also increased homodimerization and, thus, bioactivity of VEGF.</p><p>The prevailing view in the literature is that PlGF functions as a proinflammatory and permeability-enhancing cytokine. However, the results of the present study indicate that these effects of PlGF are highly context dependent. For example, although PlGF induces vascular permeability in several skin models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), it promotes barrier function in sepsis. PlGF has been shown to promote monocyte infiltration in ischemic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>), tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), atherosclerotic plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), and bone fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). However, as we have demonstrated in this paper, PlGF inhibits leukocyte accumulation in the liver of septic animals. Previous studies have shown that PlGF up-regulates VEGF expression in wound or tumor stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Moreover, neutralizing anti-PlGF antibody failed to induce VEGF levels in the plasma in tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). In contrast, PlGF deficiency is clearly associated with increased VEGF levels in sepsis. Additional studies will be needed to determine the precise mechanism by which PlGF signaling limits VEGF release and signaling under these conditions.</p><p>In summary, our findings suggest that the up-regulation of PlGF represents an adaptive host response to infection. As anti-PlGF therapies become more widespread for the treatment of such conditions as cancer and atherosclerosis, it will be important to carefully monitor patients for the development of infections and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>Mouse models of endotoxemia and CLP; measurement of IL-6, VEGF, sFlt-1, and PlGF in plasma; Ad-mediated overexpression of sFlt-1, VEGF, and PlGF; cardiac physiological studies; permeability assays; tissue RNA isolation; and real-time PCR were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).
