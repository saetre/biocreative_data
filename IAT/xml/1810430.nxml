We provide evidence that CLP1-dependent IL7-receptor mediated B cell differentiation is critically controlled by the transcriptional repressor Gfi1. Gfi1-deficient progenitor B cells show global defects in IL7R&#x003b1;-dependent signal cascades. Consequently, IL7-dependent trophic, proliferative and differentiation-inducing responses of progenitor B cells are perturbed.

To further assess a potential role of Gfi1 in early lymphoid development, we made use of a transgenic Gfi1<sup>GFP/Gfi1</sup> reporter mouse that allows monitoring of the transcriptional activity of the Gfi1 locus. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, Gfi1 is expressed in HSC and CLP1, but not in presumptive CLP2 or ETP, indicating that the latter populations may develop in a Gfi1-independent pathway.

Furthermore, a dynamic expression pattern of Gfi1 was seen in vitro, when HSC were differentiated into B cells in the presence of IL7 and SCF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000306.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p><p>As previously shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000306-Hock2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, total numbers of B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the bone marrow of Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were significantly reduced, when compared to wildtype control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).

In a subsequent series of experiments we therefore directly analyzed IL7-dependent early B cell development in vitro.

In contrast to Gfi1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> progenitor cells, few Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> LSK cells differentiated into B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD19<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (5&#x00025; versus 32&#x00025;) and B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (0.9&#x00025; versus 21&#x00025;) cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), suggesting that cytokine-induced B cell differentiation is impaired in the absence of Gfi1. To prove a cell autonomous and specific role for Gfi1, we transduced Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> LSK cells with retroviruses encoding Gfi1-GFP and GFP, respectively, and cultured these genetically modified cells in SCF and IL7 containing medium. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, only Gfi1-transduced progenitor cells, but not GFP-transduced control cells, differentiated into B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells. In complementary experiments, we also determined whether a specific downregulation of Gfi1 in wildtype B cells would affect in vitro B cell differentiation. LSK cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding a specific shRNA directed against Gfi1 or &#x0201c;empty&#x0201d; vectors, respectively. As expected, a knockdown of Gfi1 significantly impaired in vitro B cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g003">Fig 3C</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000306.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).

LSK HSCs were incubated in the presence of various cytokine combinations acting on hematopoietic progenitor cells and their viability was measured by propidium iodide exclusion 48 hours later. In these experiments, we tested both LSK progenitor cells and CD48<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD150<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (45). Both progenitor cell populations expressed IL7R&#x003b1; upon 48 hours of cytokine stimulation, while no IL7R&#x003b1; expression could be detected at hour 0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000306.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Whereas a cytokine cocktail consisting of IL3, SCF, Flt3L, and IL6 maintained the viability of Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> progenitor cells, Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells cultured in the presence of IL7 died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000306.s004">Fig. S4</xref>), indicating that Gfi1 plays a specific role in IL7-mediated trophic effects. This was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis documenting deficient IL7-mediated upregulation of the mRNA encoding the antiapoptotic protein Bcl2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). To assess proliferative responses of Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hematopoietic stem cells, LSK cells were labelled with CFSE and cultured in the presence of IL7 or SCF &#x00026; IL7. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, both Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Gfi1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> HSC divided in the presence of SCF &#x00026; IL7, documented by a decrease in fluorescence intensity. In contrast, IL7 did not induce proliferation in Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> HSC. Similar results were seen when CD48<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD150<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000306.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). In addition to antiapoptotic and proliferative effects, IL7 also induces a differentiation program in progenitor B cells. To quantify B cell differentiation in Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Gfi1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> cells on a clonal level, HSC were cultured on semisolid medium in the presence of various cytokine combinations. 14 days later, Colony-Forming-Units (CFU) were counted. Compared to Gfi1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> HSC, Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> HSC gave rise to slightly increased numbers of CFU (8750 versus 6650) when incubated in the presence of IL3, SCF, Flt3L, IL6, potentially reflecting increased cell cycle progression in Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> HSC (13). In contrast, IL7-induced growth of colonies was severely impaired in Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> HSC (175 versus 2200) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g004">Fig. 4D</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000306.s006">Fig. S6</xref>), suggesting that IL7R&#x003b1;-mediated signals are globally ineffective in the absence of Gfi1.</p><p>The generation of the earliest B cell progenitors critically depends on the transcription factors E2A and EBF.

We reasoned that in the absence of Gfi1 the coordinated expression of key transcription factors might be disturbed and measured their expression levels in defined progenitor B cell populations by RT-PCR. E2A and EBF were transiently upregulated at the transition from Hardy fraction B to D in wildtype B progenitor cells, but not in Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g004">Fig. 4E upper and middle panels</xref>). These data were confirmed in independent experiments using B cell progenitor cells defined by the expression of B220, CD19, and IgM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000306.s007">Fig. S7B</xref>). As a consequence of E2A and EBF expression in progenitor B cells, Pax-5 is upregulated at the transition from Hardy fraction C to D. In line with decreased upregulation of E2A and EBF, Pax-5 transcription was not induced in Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cell progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g004">Fig. 4E lower panel </xref>and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000306.s007">Fig S7B</xref>). The number of CD19 positive B-lineage cells was also reduced in Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>), either as a consequence of decreased Pax5 expression, or due to defects in fraction B cells. Thus, in the hierarchy of the signal cascade, Gfi1 appears to function upstream of IL7-mediated transcriptional activity of E2A, EBF and Pax5. Taken together, we document that the response to IL7 is severely reduced in Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B progenitor cells resulting in defective B cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>STAT-signalling and negative circuits</title><p>In view of global IL7-unresponsiveness of Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells affecting trophic, proliferative, and differentiation-inducing cellular responses, we reasoned that Gfi1-deficiency affected early IL7R&#x003b1; signalling events such as activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. We isolated B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells from Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Gfi1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice and determined the levels of STAT5 phosphorylation at various time points after IL7 stimulation by Western blot. Whereas total STAT5 protein was comparable between Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Gfi1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; </sup>control cells, IL7-induced STAT5 phosphorylation was completely absent in Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Since Gfi1 represents a zinc finger molecule mediating transcriptional repression in the nucleus, direct effects on IL7R&#x003b1; activation appeared unlikely. We therefore hypothesized that the balance of activating and inhibitory effects on JAK-STAT-signalling might be affected in the absence of Gfi1. We quantified expression levels of SOCS3, an inhibitor of STAT5 carrying a putative Gfi1/Gfi1B-binding site in its promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000306-Jegalian1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, baseline levels and IL7-induced expression levels of SOCS3 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>) appeared increased in Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> progenitor B cells when compared to Gfi1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> cells. This finding indicates that decreased IL7-mediated signalling may at least partially be caused by preponderance of negative feedback circuits. To directly assess the role of unleashed SOCS3 expression in early B cell development, we transduced HSC from wildtype mice with retroviral constructs encoding SOCS3, expanded sorted cells in the presence of IL3, IL6, SCF, and Flt3L and evaluated IL7R-dependent signals. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g005">Fig 5D</xref>, transduced cells showed evidence of increased SOCS3 levels (upper panel). When SOCS3-overexpressing cells were stimulated by IL7, SOCS3-transduced progenitor cells revealed decreased phosphorylation of STAT5, as shown by intracytoplasmic FACS analysis (lower panel). In line with this observation, SOCS3-transduced cells also lost viability in response to IL7, whereas most control-transduced cells maintained their viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). These experiments show that elevated levels of SOCS3 are associated with decreased cellular responses to IL7 and thus provide mechanistic insights into the role of Gfi1 in negative feedback circuits controlling B cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Modulation of IL7R&#x003b1;-expression</title><p>Coordinated lymphocyte development is not only critically dependent on IL7-mediated signals but also on dynamic and developmental-stage-specific regulation of the IL7R&#x003b1; chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000306-Chowdhury1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000306-Purohit1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

These results suggest that Gfi1 directly represses IL7R&#x003b1; transcription and thus allows coordinated B cell development to proceed. To directly prove binding of Gfi1 to a cognate binding site in the IL7R&#x003b1; gene, we performed chromatin-immunoprecipitation studies in progenitor B cell extracts from Gfi1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000306-g006">Fig. 6 D and E</xref>, direct binding of Gfi1 could be documented to a Gfi1-binding site in intron 2 of IL7R&#x003b1;, but not to putative Gfi1 binding sites present in intron 3, intron 4, or the promoter. This indicates that the IL7R&#x003b1; gene is a direct target of the transcriptional repressor Gfi1. Thus, we define a complex mechanistic role for Gfi1 in IL7-mediated signalling as well as in direct downregulation of IL7R&#x003b1;.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that Gfi1 is a critical modulator of IL7-dependent B cell differentiation.

However, Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and IL7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> are not identical with respect to their B cell phenotype.

We found that multiple IL7-mediated effects in progenitor B cells are severely reduced in the absence of Gfi1. Perhaps most significantly, IL7-induced upregulation of E2A, EBF, and Pax5, critical transcription factors controlling B cell differentiation, is severely perturbed. It should be noted however, that these effects may not be completely dependent on defective IL7-mediated signals but may result from as yet undefined other roles of Gfi1.

Indirect effects of Gfi1 on cytokine receptor signalling have been shown previously in myeloid development, where impaired STAT3 signalling in Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> precursor dendritic cells has been associated with increased transcription of PIAS3 and SOCS3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000306-Rathinam1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we provide evidence that similar feedback mechanisms control early B cell development by integrating cytokine signals and negative circuit loops. Our data indicate that IL7-dependent STAT5 signalling is decreased in the absence of Gfi1. We cannot definitively exclude the concern that our data of decreased STAT5 phosphorylation and increased SOCS mRNA and protein levels may be confounded by the fact that the Gfi1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cell populations differ in various respects.
