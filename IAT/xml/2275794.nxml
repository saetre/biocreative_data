The <italic>C. perfringens</italic> &#x003b1;-toxin has been shown capable of inducing these changes, but its potential synergy with perfringolysin O (&#x003b8;-toxin) is less well understood. Similarly, <italic>Clostridium septicum</italic> is a highly virulent causative agent of spontaneous gas gangrene, but its effect on the microcirculation has not been examined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to use intravital microscopy to examine the effects of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> and <italic>C. septicum</italic> on the functional microcirculation, coupled with the use of isogenic toxin mutants to elucidate the role of particular toxins in the resultant microvascular perfusion deficits. This study represents the first time this integrated approach has been used in the analysis of the pathological response to clostridial toxins. Culture supernatants from wild-type <italic>C. perfringens</italic> induced extensive cell death within 30 min, as assessed by <italic>in vivo</italic> uptake of propidium iodide. Furthermore, significant reductions in capillary perfusion were observed within 60 min. Depletion of either platelets or neutrophils reduced the alteration in perfusion, consistent with a role for these blood-borne cells in obstructing perfusion. In addition, mutation of either the &#x003b1;-toxin or perfringolysin O structural genes attenuated the reduction in perfusion, a process that was reversed by genetic complementation. <italic>C. septicum</italic> also induced a marked reduction in perfusion, with the degree of microvascular compromise correlating with the level of the <italic>C. septicum</italic> &#x003b1;-toxin. Together, these data indicate that as a result of its ability to produce &#x003b1;-toxin and perfringolysin O, <italic>C. perfringens</italic> rapidly induces irreversible cellular injury and a marked reduction in microvascular perfusion. Since <italic>C. septicum</italic> induces a similar reduction in microvascular perfusion, it is postulated that this function is central to the pathogenesis of clostridial myonecrosis, irrespective of the causative bacterium.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Clostridial myonecrosis is a life-threatening process induced by infection with species such as <italic>C. perfringens</italic> and <italic>C. septicum</italic>. The associated pathology includes muscle death and a characteristic disruption in tissue perfusion. Exotoxins produced by these species have been implicated in the reduction in perfusion. However, how these toxins function in tandem remains unclear. In this study we used intravital microscopy to study microvascular blood flow in a muscle exposed to products of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> and <italic>C. septicum</italic>. <italic>C. perfringens</italic> supernatants induced cellular injury and a progressive reduction in blood flow. Removal of blood-borne platelets and neutrophils from the circulation reduced the alteration in blood flow. In addition, this response was reduced by genetic deletion of either the &#x003b1;-toxin or perfringolysin O, providing the first indication that each of these exotoxins contributes to the reduction in blood supply to affected tissues. Using a similar approach, we observed that <italic>C. septicum</italic> supernatant induced a comparable reduction in perfusion, which was mediated in part via the <italic>C. septicum</italic> &#x003b1;-toxin. These results indicate that platelets, neutrophils and multiple clostridial toxins contribute to reduced blood supply and oxygen delivery associated with clostridial infection and suggest that the dominant component of the pathology is toxin-induced cellular injury and death.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gas gangrene is a life-threatening syndrome most commonly associated with invasion of tissue by the anaerobic bacterium, <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> type A.

However, its effects on microvascular perfusion have not been examined. Therefore, we used a comparable approach to that used with <italic>C. perfringens</italic>, and applied supernatants of wild-type <italic>C. septicum</italic> (JIR6086) to the cremasteric microvasculature. Similar to the response induced by <italic>C. perfringens</italic>, culture supernatants from <italic>C. septicum</italic> induced a significant microvascular perfusion deficit over a 60 min time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000045-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>). To assess the role of the <italic>C. septicum</italic> &#x003b1;-toxin (a different protein than the similarly named toxin secreted by <italic>C. perfringens</italic>), we compared the perfusion deficit induced by wild-type supernatant with that induced by supernatant from a <italic>csa</italic> mutant (JIR6111) deficient in &#x003b1;-toxin production, and with an isogenic &#x003b1;-toxin-complemented derivative (JIR6146). The relative &#x003b1;-toxin titres for these three strains are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000045-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>. No detectable hemolytic activity was observed for the &#x003b1;-toxin mutant (JIR6111) on horse blood agar.

Exposure of tissues to supernatants from the &#x003b1;-toxin mutant resulted in a mean perfusion at 60 min of 29.4&#x000b1;7.3 mm/mm<sup>2</sup>, versus 17.3&#x000b1;6.5 mm/mm<sup>2</sup> in response to wild-type <italic>C. septicum</italic> supernatant (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.057, when analyzed as &#x00025; reduction from baseline) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000045-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>).

Visualization of the microcirculation indicated that blood flow in capillaries was severely reduced. Given the central role of these vessels in the delivery of oxygen and nutrients, this effect would be expected to be an important contributor to the necrosis that occurs in infected tissue. Cell death, as assessed by PI incorporation, was found to occur prior to substantial reduction in tissue perfusion, raising the possibility that this injury was an important contributor to the reduction in perfusion.

Similarly, Alape-Giron <italic>et al</italic>. observed very rapid (within 1&#x02013;2 min) alterations in the morphology of muscle fibers upon exposure to &#x003b1;-toxin, thrombus formation within 2&#x02013;5 min, and complete cessation of blood flow within 15&#x02013;20 mins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-AlapeGiron1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, the response in the present study was much more gradual and associated with minimal changes in muscle morphology. It is likely that these divergent observations are due to differences in the toxin activity present in culture supernatants versus preparations of purified &#x003b1;-toxin. Despite this difference, platelet depletion was partially protective against the reduction in blood flow induced by <italic>C. perfringens</italic> supernatants. These data are consistent with previous findings in which the anti-thrombotic agent heparin was protective against &#x003b1;-toxin-induced vascular collapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Bryant2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, and support the hypothesis that platelets are important contributors to the <italic>C. perfringens</italic>-induced deficit in microvascular perfusion.</p><p>The role of leukocytes is one of the least well understood aspects of this response. The inability of leukocytes to effectively infiltrate <italic>Clostridium</italic>-infected tissues is a hallmark of the disease pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Ellemor1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, but it remains unclear if this is a contributing factor to myonecrosis or an epiphenomenon. Nonetheless, examination of the microvasculature has shown that neutrophil depletion protects against reductions in blood flow induced by <italic>C. perfringens</italic> &#x003b1;-toxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Bryant2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. This finding is supported by the results of the present study, in which neutrophil depletion was protective against the microcirculatory collapse induced by <italic>C. perfringens</italic> supernatants. In studies of ischemia/reperfusion injury, the neutrophil has been shown to contribute to reductions in microvascular perfusion via luminal obstruction of microvessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Strock1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Jerome2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, &#x003b1;-toxin, via platelet GPIIb/IIIa and P-selectin (CD62P), can induce formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates, which could also act to reduce microvascular perfusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Bryant2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Bryant4">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. These processes provide potential mechanisms for the contribution of neutrophils to the defect in microvascular perfusion induced by <italic>C. perfringens</italic>. However, these data must also be viewed in light of recent work examining the effect of neutrophil depletion on <italic>C. perfringens</italic>-induced myonecrosis. O'Brien <italic>et al</italic>. showed that in animals infected with large inoculates of <italic>C. perfringens</italic>, neutrophil depletion failed to protect against myonecrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-OBrien2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. This finding indicates that under conditions where large numbers of live bacteria are present, <italic>C. perfringens</italic> is capable of inducing fatal myonecrosis irrespective of the potential perfusion-maintaining effect afforded by neutrophil depletion.</p><p>Many studies implicate &#x003b1;-toxin as being of central importance in <italic>C. perfringens</italic>&#x02013;associated myonecrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-FloresDiaz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Awad1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-AlapeGiron1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Williamson1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, analysis of the molecular basis of the vascular response to <italic>C. perfringens</italic> confirmed the previously observed capability of the &#x003b1;-toxin to induce vascular collapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Bryant2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-AlapeGiron1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This was shown using &#x003b1;-toxin-deficient <italic>C. perfringens</italic> mutants, which were less effective at reducing perfusion than wild-type <italic>C. perfringens</italic>, and by complementation of an &#x003b1;-toxin and perfringolysin O-deficient strain with &#x003b1;-toxin, which restored the ability to disrupt perfusion to levels not different from that of the wild-type strain. However, these experiments also provided evidence suggesting a role for perfringolysin O in reducing perfusion. Firstly, supernatants from perfringolysin O-deficient strains caused substantially less vascular compromise than those from wild-type strains, although this result may have been complicated by the comcomitant reduction in &#x003b1;-toxin activity in this mutant. Secondly, supernatants from &#x003b1;-toxin/perfringolysin O-double mutant strains complemented with perfringolysin O were capable of reducing microvascular perfusion in some mice, a response not seen in response to supernatants lacking both toxins. These data suggest a novel activity for this toxin, although further work is required to confirm this hypothesis. It has been demonstrated that perfringolysin O contributes to the escape of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> from the macrophage phagosome, is a primary mediator of <italic>C. perfringens</italic>-mediated macrophage cytotoxicity, and can activate TLR4, indicating that perfringolysin O can make important contributions to <italic>C. perfringens</italic>-induced pathology independently of the &#x003b1;-toxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-OBrien1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Park1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. However, analysis of the virulence of mutant <italic>C. perfringens</italic> strains lacking both &#x003b1;-toxin and perfringolysin O provides clear evidence that the pathology of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> infection is most severe in the presence of both toxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Ellemor1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Awad2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-OBrien1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In cases of clinical <italic>C. perfringens</italic> infection, the toxin levels present in the tissues are unknown. Given this situation, the relative merits of examining the effects of purified toxins versus culture supernatants are difficult to assess. In the present experiments, the rationale for the use of culture supernatants is that it allowed assessment of the tissue response to the complete set of clostridial toxins, an approach that is likely to more accurately model clinical infection. Furthermore, it also allowed the assessment of the effect of removal of single <italic>C. perfringens</italic> gene products from the supernatant. However, it must be noted that the genetic approaches used in this study produced some unexpected effects. In the <italic>C. perfringens</italic> experiments, the &#x003b1;-toxin activity in the perfringolysin O mutant JIR4069 was lower than that in the wild-type strain. Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alterations in perfusion associated with exposure to this strain are due not only to the absence of perfringolysin O, but also to its lower &#x003b1;-toxin activity. Similarly, in the <italic>C. septicum</italic> studies, plasmid-mediated complementation of the <italic>C. septicum</italic> &#x003b1;-toxin mutant resulted in a greater level of toxin activity than that in the wild-type strain. Nevertheless, the level of perfusion defect observed in response to the three <italic>C. septicum</italic> strains examined correlated with the level of &#x003b1;-toxin activity, supporting the concept that the <italic>C. septicum</italic> &#x003b1;-toxin is capable of inducing a reduction in microvascular perfusion.</p><p>Vascular leukostasis and the absence of neutrophils is a characteristic of clinical cases of clostridial myonecrosis, but the mechanisms of leukostasis and its contribution to the process of myonecrosis remain unclear. Since the initial trauma associated with <italic>C. perfringens</italic> gangrene cannot be replicated in experimental <italic>C. perfringens</italic> infections, high inoculates are required to induce myonecrosis; at lower infection rates, neutrophil infiltration proceeds unhindered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Awad1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-OBrien2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, purified &#x003b1;-toxin has been shown capable of inducing adhesion molecule expression and leukocyte recruitment in a vascular bed in which blood flow was presumably maintained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Bunting1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. From these findings it could be argued that if neutrophils are able to enter the infected tissue efficiently before cessation of microvascular perfusion, they are then able to participate in clearing the infection. However, in the present study we observed extensive cell death prior to the most severe reductions in blood flow. It is possible that endothelial cells were irreversibly injured by exposure to the clostridial toxin mixtures. This hypothesis is highly relevant to the process of neutrophil recruitment in that leukocyte transmigration across the endothelium has been shown to require active responses from endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Huang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000045-Millan1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. It is likely that severely injured endothelial cells would be unable to undergo the cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary to allow transmigration. Therefore, the possibility that leukostasis in part reflects a reduction in efficiency of leukocyte transmigration due to endothelial injury cannot be discounted.</p><p>Taken together, these data are consistent with a model of <italic>C. perfringens</italic>-induced myonecrosis in which both &#x003b1;-toxin and perfringolysin O contribute to the reduction in microvascular perfusion. The data also indicate a potential role for injury of local cells, in addition to roles for circulating platelets and neutrophils. Although it was not possible to clarify the influence of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> products on leukostasis, it is clear if a comparably severe reduction in perfusion occurred during clinical infection, then this would prevent delivery of large numbers of leukocytes to the affected site.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies and Reagents</title><p>Antibodies used in these experiments were RB6-8C5 (purified from supernatant) and rabbit anti-thrombocyte serum (Accurate Chemical &#x00026; Scientific).

The left jugular vein was cannulated to administer additional anesthetic and fluorochromes. Catheters were not heparinized to avoid obscuring potential thrombotic effects of clostridial products. Animals were maintained at 37&#x000b0;C on a thermocontrolled heating pad. The cremaster muscle was exteriorized onto an optically-clear viewing pedestal. The muscle was cauterized longitudinally and held flat against the optical window via attachment of silk sutures. The tissue was kept warm and moist by superfusion of warmed bicarbonate buffered saline (pH 7.4), and covered with a coverslip held in place with vacuum grease.</p><p>The cremasteric microcirculation was visualized using an intravital microscope (Axioplan 2 Imaging; Carl Zeiss, Australia) with a X 20 objective lens (LD Achroplan 20X/0.40 NA, Carl Zeiss, Australia) and an X 10 eyepiece.

This intravital microscopy approach was selected to also enable examination of the effects of clostridial toxins on leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions. However, it was found that treatment of muscle with diluted TPG alone elevated leukocyte interactions above that in buffer-treated mice.
