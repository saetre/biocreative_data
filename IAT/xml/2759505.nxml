Three days of culture corresponded to the confluence conditions for the three cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007478-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). The proliferation rates of both MA- and MP were higher than that of MA&#x0002b; whatever the time of culture (p&#x0003c;0.05). The proliferation rate of MA- and MP cells were very similar until 5 days of culture whereas that of MA- cells was significantly increased (p&#x0003c;0.05) compared to that of MP cells after 5 days of culture. Finally flow cytometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007478-g001">Figure 1b</xref>) showed that the ratio of cells in S-G2/M phase at confluence versus cells in exponential growth was significantly lower (&#x02212;14&#x00025;, p&#x0003c;0.05) in MA&#x0002b; cells and higher (&#x0002b;22&#x00025;, p&#x0003c;0.05) in MA- cells in comparison to that of control MP cells. Similar results were obtained for MDA-MB 231 derived models (data not shown). These data confirmed that cells with reduced Arl2 content continued to grow at confluence whereas cells with increased Arl2 content were particularly sensitive to contact inhibition.</p><p>Co-culture experiments with MP and MA- cells were performed using specific fluorescent linker dyes to follow each cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007478-g001">Figure 1c</xref>).

Growth rates of each cell line were measured in the presence of cantharidic acid, a well characterized inhibitor of PP2A. In the presence of cantharidic acid at a dose selectively inhibiting PP2A (IC50 for PP2A activity &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;40 nM and for PP1 &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;473 nM, manufacturer's indications) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007478-g001">Figure 1d</xref>), the growth rate of MA&#x0002b; cells was significantly enhanced (&#x0002b;30&#x02013;70&#x00025;, p&#x0003c;0,05) whereas those of MA- and MP cells were not significantly modified.

In a previous study we have demonstrated that Arl2 content influences the content and the activity of the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007478-Beghin1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the reported tumor suppressor properties of PP2A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007478-Janssens1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, we have determined the impact of Arl2 on tumor cell aggressivity and tumorigenic capacity in two breast cancer cell models, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231. We observed that modifications of Arl2 expression levels could induce modifications of contact inhibition, clonogenic potential, and tumor growth, including spontaneous apoptosis of tumor cells. Preliminary data also suggest that cells with reduced Arl2 content possess enhanced metastatic potential when injected orthotopically in SCID mice (data not shown). We have thus shown for the first time, in two different breast cancer cell models, that a reduced Arl2 expression level is associated with a more aggressive neoplastic phenotype. These results were supported by the observation that low Arl2 content was associated with greater aggressivity in primary human breast tumors.</p><p>Cells with reduced Arl2 content were found to behave more aggressively, with loss of contact inhibition, ability to grow in multilayer <italic>in vitro</italic>, enhanced clonogenic or cluster formation potential, gain of survival advantage vis-&#x000e0;-vis their normal counterparts in an <italic>in vitro</italic> competition assay as well as enhanced tumor growth and reduced spontaneous necrosis tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>. The role of Arl2 downregulation in the acquisition of an aggressive phenotype is supported by similar results observed when mice injected with parental cells were treated with siRNA against Arl2. This treatment effectively modulated Arl2 gene expression in tumors and was associated with increased tumor growth. Conversely increased expression yielded the opposite phenotype, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, with reduced clonogenic potential and reduced tumor growth with massive spontaneous tumor necrosis. These results therefore strongly suggest that Arl2 content is correlated with <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> aggressivity in the two breast cancer models studied.</p><p>PP2A has been shown to play an important inhibitory effect on cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007478-Lao1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007478-Neviani1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. We have previously shown that the content and the activity of the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) is modified in cells with altered Arl2 content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007478-Beghin1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we confirm that inhibition of PP2A in SCID mice is associated with increased tumor aggressivity. Analysis of enzymatic activity in Arl2 modified tumors showed that PP2A activity was increased in cells with increased Arl2 content, a result in keeping with our observation that these cells proliferated more actively in the presence of a PP2A inhibitor. PP2A is known to interact directly with many proteins and modify their activity by either activating or inhibiting them. The anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and Bcl-xl and the pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax are targets of PP2A. In these proteins, the dephosphorylation occurs at the serine residues and shifts the signaling pathway toward apoptosis by activating and deactivating the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007478-Messner1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The increased PP2A activity of cells with high Arl2 content is thus likely to explain the massive apoptosis observed in tumors derived from these cells. Conversely the enhanced aggressivity observed in cells with reduced Arl2 content could not be attributed to a reduction in PP2A enzyme activity.</p><p>It remains to be established which are the key regulators involved in Arl2/PP2A regulation of tumor aggressivity. PP2A dephosphorylates a large variety of substrates involved in cell cycle regulation. Our previous study found that alterations in Arl2 content profoundly modified microtubule dynamics as well as the duration of the various phases of mitosis, in particular anaphase and telophase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007478-Beghin1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. We have also reported that Arl2 content influences the content and distribution of phosphor-ser15-P53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007478-Beghin2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, other authors have recently demonstrated the involvement of MT dynamics and of PP2A in the regulation of concentration of E-cadherin at cell-cell contacts. Stehbens <italic>et al.</italic> identified a pool of MTs that extend radially into cell-cell contacts, blocking MT dynamics and thereby altering the ability of cells to concentrate and accumulate E-cadherin at cell-cell contacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007478-Stehbens1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Takahashi <italic>et al.</italic> have shown that treatment of the cells with inhibitors of PP2A caused disruption of cell-cell adhesion and proposed that PP2A could play a crucial role in the maintenance of cell-cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007478-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion these data suggest that Arl2, a small GTP protein whose role is yet largely unknown, appears to be a significant regulator of PP2A content and activity in breast cancer cells, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In preclinical models, reduced Arl2 content is associated with enhanced tumor aggressivity while increased Arl2 content is associated with reduced aggressivity and enhanced spontaneous necrosis. In primary human breast tumors, low Arl2 mRNA content is associated with larger tumor size and greater risk of lymph node involvement at diagnosis. These data suggest that Arl2, possibly through a PP2A-mediated pathway, is a key regulator of breast tumor aggressivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All research involving animals have been conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines.
