When the cloned DNA fragment was used as a template for in vitro transcription with E. coli RNA polymerase, a tRNAPro1 precursor of 120 nucleotide residues was obtained. The tRNAPro1 gene transcribed as a single transcription unit was followed by two unusual repeating sequences, both of 108 bp. These two repeating sequences were separated by a 60 bp spacer sequence. The 5'-portion of each repeating sequence overlapped 19 bp of the 3'-terminal region of the tRNAPro1 gene just like the repeating sequences in the E. coli tRNATyr1 gene. A rho-independent termination was present in the first repeating unit.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00303-0206-a" xlink:role="3217"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00303-0207-a" xlink:role="3218"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00303-0202.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3213"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00303-0203.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3214"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00303-0204.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3215"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00303-0205.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3216"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00303-0206.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3217"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00303-0207.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3218"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00303-0208.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3219"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00303-0209.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3220"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
