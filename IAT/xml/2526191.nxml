Transcription factors play crucial regulatory roles in the differentiation processes that culminate in the formation of effector and memory B and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>).</p><p>The transcriptional repressor B lymphocyte&#x02013;induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1) is one of the few transcription factors known to be crucial for regulating B lymphocyte terminal differentiation. Blimp-1 is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) and sufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) for the formation of fully functional antibody-secreting plasma cells and for maintenance of long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>Blimp-1 is a SET domain and a zinc finger&#x02013;containing transcriptional repressor encoded by the <italic>Prdm-1</italic> gene. Transcriptional repression by Blimp-1 is mediated by repressive modifications in chromatin structure, through recruitment of Groucho family transcriptional corepressors, and chromatin-modifying enzymes (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>]). In addition to its crucial role in the differentiation of plasma cells, Blimp-1 has critical functions in embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), and targeted deletion of the <italic>Prdm1</italic> gene in the mouse is embryonically lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Blimp-1 is also required for terminal differentiation of several nonlymphoid cell lineages in adult organisms (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>]).</p><p>Recently, a role for Blimp-1 in T cell differentiation was demonstrated in two laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). After T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, both CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T lymphocytes express Blimp-1 mRNA in amounts comparable to that in fully mature plasma cells. Blimp-1 mRNA is also expressed at high levels in Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory T cells. Conditional deletion of Blimp-1 in T cells results in profound alterations of T cell homeostasis and function and culminates in the spontaneous development of fatal colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Blimp-1&#x02013;deficient CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory T cells (T reg cells) are partially dysfunctional, as they perform properly in in vitro immunosupression assays and in one colitis model in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), but fail to inhibit chemically induced colitis in WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>TCR stimulation of Blimp-1&#x02013;deficient CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in vitro results in hyperresponsiveness that is revealed by robust proliferation in suboptimal stimulatory conditions and increased numbers of IL-2 producers, indicating that Blimp-1 is a negative regulator of IL-2 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). This idea is also reinforced by two recent observations: (a) Blimp-1 and IL-2 expression upon TCR stimulation are inversely correlated, and (b) enforced expression of Blimp-1 in T cells represses IL-2 production upon TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><p>IL-2 was initially identified as an autocrine cytokine necessary for in vitro expansion of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Subsequent studies indicated a role for IL-2 in promoting T cell expansion, survival, effector differentiation, and memory cell survival via promotion of IL-7R expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Indeed, the stimulatory properties of IL-2 make it a therapeutic target, especially in AIDS and cancer, where IL-2 administration promotes T cell expansion in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). IL-2 has also been shown to participate in the contraction of inflammatory responses, by programming activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells for apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) and promoting the growth and survival of the innate CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>FoxP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>T reg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Because of these effects, IL-2&#x02013; or IL-2R&#x02013;deficient mice exhibit a multifaceted autoimmune phenotype characterized by multiorgan inflammation, absence of T reg cells, and accumulation of autoreactive T cells (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>]).</p><p>Interestingly, IL-2 represses its own expression in a classical negative-feedback loop that functions in a STAT-5&#x02013;dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). This finding, together with the observation that IL-2 is a potent inducer of Blimp-1 expression in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), led to the suggestion that Blimp-1 plays important roles in IL-2 autoregulation.</p><p>We have investigated this hypothesis, and report that Blimp-1 directly represses the <italic>Il2</italic> gene and indirectly represses <italic>Il2</italic> by repressing <italic>Fos</italic>, which encodes Fos; Fos is a component of AP-1, a strong activator of <italic>Il2</italic>. As a consequence of the increased production of IL-2 in the absence of Blimp-1, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell proliferate more upon antigen-specific stimulation and are more resistant to cytokine deprivation&#x02013;induced cell death. Attenuation of IL-2 production by Blimp-1 plays a role in an antigen-specific response in vivo. Thus, one important function of Blimp-1 in T cells is to attenuate IL-2 production upon antigen stimulation, by both direct and indirect gene repression.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Blimp-1 attenuates IL-2 expression in the primary response</title><p>We have previously reported that lack of Blimp-1 results in increased proliferation and IL-2 production after polyclonal TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). To further understand the mechanisms by which Blimp-1 regulates IL-2 production, we evaluated the kinetics of IL-2 production in an antigen-specific context. Blimp-1 conditional KO (CKO) mice were bred to OT2 TCR transgenic mice to generate antigen-specific, Blimp-1&#x02013;sufficient (Ctrl) and &#x02013;deficient (CKO) CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. When naive (CD44<sup>low</sup>) OT2 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were stimulated in vitro with APCs and cognate antigen, the percentage of IL-2&#x02013;producing cells was significantly higher in the CKO than in the Ctrl cultures in all time points evaluated. In agreement with results from polyclonal stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), TCR restimulation 3 d after primary activation also resulted in more IL-2&#x02013;producing cells in the CKO cultures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). CKO cells proliferated more robustly, especially when antigen was provided in lower doses (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080526/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080526/DC1</ext-link>). Thus, Blimp-1 attenuates proliferation and the number of IL-2&#x02013;producing cells upon antigen-specific stimulation, and attenuation of IL-2 production by Blimp-1 can be observed at the time of primary stimulation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of Blimp-1 and IL-2.</bold> (A) Production of IL-2 by naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> OT2 Blimp-1&#x02013;sufficient (Ctrl) and &#x02013;deficient (CKO) cells stimulated with 0.1 &#x003bc;M OVA and APC (determined as described in Materials and methods).

Consistent with our observation of increased IL-2 production in Blimp-1 CKO T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), forced expression of Blimp-1 in T cells decreases expression of IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), and IL-2 causes its own down-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Given these complicated interactions, we investigated the kinetics of Blimp-1 and IL-2 expression in normal T cells, measuring steady-state mRNA levels. At days 1 and 2 after stimulation of naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in vitro, IL-2 steady-state mRNA is more strongly induced than Blimp-1 mRNA. However, by day 3, Blimp-1 mRNA increases significantly and IL-2 mRNA decreases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). To study this at the single-cell level, we used a mouse in which Blimp-1 mRNA expression is reported by EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Total spleen cells were stimulated in vitro and analyzed for IL-2 and GFP expression. 1 d after stimulation, &#x0003c;10% of the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells expressed GFP, whereas &#x0223c;5% of cells expressed IL-2. 3 d after stimulation, GFP expression increased to 17%, whereas IL-2 expression decreased to &#x0003c;3% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, top right). Restimulation on day 3 resulted in increased expression of both IL-2 protein and Blimp-1 mRNA, and addition of IL-2 amplified Blimp-1 expression, while decreasing IL-2 production (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, bottom). Strikingly, in all time points, very few cells were double-positive for GFP and Blimp-1.</p><p>Previous studies show that IL-2 production is tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), and that even under optimal conditions not all T cells in a population will acquire the competence to transcribe the <italic>Il2</italic> gene and synthesize IL-2 upon primary stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). The negative correlation between Blimp-1 expression and IL-2 production at the single-cell level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>), along with the observation that more cells make IL-2 when Blimp-1 is absent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), provide evidence that expression of Blimp-1 is important in the exclusion of IL-2 production upon TCR stimulation. These results confirm and expand previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), supporting the model that upon T cell activation, most induction of Blimp-1 occurs secondary to IL-2 production and that the induced Blimp-1 participates in a regulatory loop to repress IL-2 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Blimp-1 is required for cytokine deprivation&#x02013;induced cell death after activation</title><p>IL-2 also has important effects on T cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). After T cell activation, IL-2 production decreases, triggering passive cell death and limiting T cell numbers at the conclusion of an immune response. Because our data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) implicated Blimp-1 in postactivation down-regulation of IL-2, we next investigated whether Blimp-1 also plays a role in passive cell death after IL-2 withdrawal.</p><p>Naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from Ctrl or CKO mice were stimulated for 5 d, in optimal conditions, so IL-2 production was maximal and Blimp-1 expression was high in the Ctrl cells. 5 d after stimulation, cells were extensively washed and replated with or without exogenous IL-2. Blimp-1 CKO cells survived better in the absence of exogenous IL-2, and there were two- to threefold more live cells in CKO cultures compared with Ctrl (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Addition of IL-2 at the time of replating abrogated the differences between Ctrl and CKO cells, indicating that the increased IL-2 production in the absence of Blimp-1 was responsible for the increased survival of effector cells in this assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, Blimp-1&#x02013;dependent repression of IL-2 is important for passive cell death at the conclusion of an immune response.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Attenuation of IL-2 production by Blimp-1 promotes susceptibility to IL-2 deprivation&#x02013;induced cell death.</bold> Control and CKO naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were stimulated with plate-bound &#x003b1;CD3, &#x003b1;CD28, and IL-2 for 5 d (primary stimulation), washed, and replated in medium only (left) or in the presence of IL-2 (right). Cell death was determined by staining with Annexin V and 7-AAD.

Although the production of IL-2 is regulated transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) because Blimp-1 is a transcriptional repressor, it probably regulates the transcription of the <italic>Il2</italic> gene, either directly and/or indirectly. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed steady-state levels of IL-2 mRNA in cells from Ctrl and CKO mice. Naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from CKO mice had significantly higher amounts of steady-state IL-2 mRNA than cells from Ctrl mice, before and at later time points after stimulation (days 2 and 3), but not earlier (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). This suggests that low levels of Blimp-1 in naive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) are sufficient to repress <italic>Il2</italic> before activation. Alternatively, or in addition, the repression of <italic>Il2</italic> by Blimp-1 in naive cells could be facilitated by the regulatory pathways operating before TCR stimulation, which differ considerably from the ones in place after stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Upon activation of <italic>Il2</italic> by NFAT, members of AP-1 family and NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), the relatively low amounts of Blimp-1 are apparently overcome, and Blimp-1 cannot repress <italic>Il2</italic>. However, as Blimp-1 levels rise, Blimp-1 is once again able to repress <italic>Il2</italic> transcription. If higher levels of Blimp-1 are, indeed, required to contain <italic>Il2</italic> transcription upon TCR stimulation, it would also explain why restimulation at day 3 results in more <italic>Il2</italic> mRNA in Blimp-1 CKO cells, as in these circumstances Blimp-1 expression in WT cells is further elevated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>; unpublished data). Repression of <italic>Il2</italic> by Blimp-1 is also consistent with the recent observation that enforced expression of Blimp-1 represses IL-2 production upon TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Blimp-1 deficiency results in increased levels of IL-2 and Fos steady-state mRNA.</bold> Steady-state IL-2 (A) and Fos (B) mRNA in naive (day 0) and stimulated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from Control and CKO mice.

Because our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>) showed that <italic>Fos</italic> is a direct target of Blimp-1&#x02013;dependent repression in keratinocytes, we asked if Blimp-1 repressed <italic>Fos</italic> in T cells.

To test this hypothesis and identify Blimp-1 response elements, we searched the genomic sequence (plus 10 kb upstream and 10 kb downstream of the transcriptional start site [TSS]) of the mouse and human <italic>Il2</italic> genes, looking for Blimp-1 consensus binding sites (CBSs). We found 20 putative CBSs for Blimp-1 in the mouse <italic>Il2</italic> gene (Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080526/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080526/DC1</ext-link>), and 8 of these sites (&#x02212;7,252, &#x02212;5,547, &#x02212;4,795, &#x02212;4,765, &#x02212;4,221, &#x02212;4,207, &#x02212;3,982, and &#x02212;1,861) were contained in an 8.4-kb region upstream of the <italic>Il2</italic> TSS, which has been shown to be repressed by Blimp-1 in an in vitro reporter assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). We focused our efforts on these sites first; however, some sites were embedded in simple-sequence repeats and we were unable to design primers for efficient amplification of these regions. Thus, sites &#x02212;3,982, &#x02212;1,861, in the upstream region of the gene, and &#x0002b;10,215 and a region containing no Blimp-1 consensus sequence (&#x0002b;1,556 to &#x0002b;1,713 bp) relative to the TSS were investigated.

These results, together with previous results (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1&#x02013;3</xref><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>), demonstrate that Blimp-1 directly represses transcription of <italic>Il2</italic> and the <italic>Il2</italic> activator <italic>Fos</italic>.</p><p>We conclude that Blimp-1 attenuates IL-2 production both directly, by repression of the <italic>Il2</italic> gene, and indirectly, by repression of <italic>Fos</italic>. Nevertheless, the contribution of Fos to the overall increase in <italic>Il2</italic> transcription in the CKO cells is difficult to determine. Enforced expression of Fos in T cells caused elevated IL-2 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>); however, deletion of Fos alone is insufficient to decrease IL-2 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), and the effects of Fos in regulating proliferation can only be observed when both FosB and Fos are missing (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title>Lack of Blimp-1 leads to increased IL-2 production in vivo</title><p>Our data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1&#x02013;2</xref><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), and that of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), show that the transient nature of IL-2 production after T cell activation depends on induction of Blimp-1 by IL-2 and subsequent Blimp-1&#x02013;dependent repression of IL-2 production via repression of <italic>Il2</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic>. To explore the role of Blimp-1&#x02013;dependent repression of IL-2 in vivo, we transferred Ctrl and CKO CFSE-labeled naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> OT2 (CD45.2) into allotype congenic recipients (C57BL/6 SJ CD45.1), and then immunized the recipients with dendritic cells pulsed with OVA peptide. 5 d later, cells were recovered from lymph nodes of recipients and restimulated in vitro, and IL-2 production was evaluated in the CD45.2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population by intracellular cytokine staining. At this time point, both proliferation and IL-2 production were more pronounced in the Blimp-1 CKO cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). Approximately twofold more Blimp-1 CKO cells entered cell cycle compared with the Ctrl cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). In addition, in mice injected with CKO cells, &#x0223c;40% of the CD45.2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were producing IL-2, whereas 16% of the CD45.2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were IL-2 producers in the mice injected with Ctrl cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Therefore, Blimp-1 attenuates CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell proliferation and IL-2 production upon antigen-specific TCR stimulation in vivo (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>Thus, this study demonstrates that Blimp-1 represses IL-2 production after T cell activation and shows that the molecular mechanism responsible depends, at least in part, on Blimp-1&#x02013;dependent repression of <italic>Il2</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic> transcription. Furthermore, we identify Blimp-1 response elements in these two genes. The conclusion that Blimp-1 represses IL-2 transcription is supported by several observations: (a) Blimp-1&#x02013;expressing cells do not express IL-2 protein at detectable levels; (b) Blimp-1 mRNA induction correlates with IL-2 mRNA down-regulation; (c) IL-2 protein and steady-state mRNA are elevated in Blimp-1&#x02013;deficient CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells; and (d) endogenous Blimp-1 specifically binds to a regulatory region in the <italic>Il2</italic> gene in activated primary CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells.</p><p>This establishes Blimp-1 as an important component in a recently described IL-2 autoregulatory loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) that operates in vivo to control the development and magnitude of T cell effector responses, and it confirms and extends the suggestion of Gong and Malek, that Blimp-1 plays an important role in IL-2 autoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, after activation in vitro, IL-2 production in Blimp-1&#x02013;deficient T cells eventually decreases, although more slowly than in Blimp-1&#x02013;sufficient cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Thus, mechanisms in addition to Blimp-1 are apparently present for IL-2 down-regulation. Nonetheless, Blimp-1 is important physiologically for IL-2 repression because lack of Blimp-1 results in increased IL-2 production upon antigen immunization in vivo. Increased levels of IL-2 produced by CKO cells are associated with increased proliferation both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. S1 and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), and with increased resistance to cytokine deprivation-induced cell death after activation in vitro (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, deregulation of IL-2 production in the Blimp-1 CKO mice is likely to contribute to the aberrant T cell homeostasis and the inflammatory phenotype observed in these mice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>C57BL/6 (B6) and B6 CD45.1 congenic mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. <italic>Prdm1</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) were backcrossed 10 times with B6 mice, and then crossed with B6CD4-Cre mice, which were purchased from Taconic, to generate B6 <italic>Prdm1</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup>CD4-Cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (Blimp-1CKO) and <italic>Prdm1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> CD4-Cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (Control).
