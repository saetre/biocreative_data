TRPM8 is activated by voltage, cold and cooling compounds such as menthol. Despite its essential role for cold temperature sensing in mammals, the pharmacology of TRPM8 is still in its infancy. Recently, tyrosine 745 (Y745) was identified as a critical residue for menthol sensitivity of the channel. In this report, we study the effect of mutating this residue on the action of several known TRPM8 antagonists: BCTC, capsazepine, SKF96365, and clotrimazole as well as two new inhibitor candidates, econazole and imidazole.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We show that Y745 at the menthol binding site is critical for inhibition mediated by SKF96365 of cold- and voltage-activated TRPM8 currents. In contrast, the inhibition by other antagonists was unaffected by the mutation (BCTC) or only partially reduced (capsazepine, clotrimazole, econazole), suggesting that additional binding sites exist on the TRPM8 channel from where the inhibitors exert their negative modulation. Indeed, a molecular docking model implies that menthol and SKF96365 interact readily with Y745, while BCTC is unable to bind to this residue.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we identify structural elements on the TRPM8 channel that are critical for the action of channel antagonists, providing valuable information for the future design of new, specific modulator compounds.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>TRPM8 is a non-selective cation channel of the TRP family that is activated by mild cold temperatures and cooling compounds such as menthol, eucalyptol and icilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Like several other TRP channels, TRPM8 is also gated by voltage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The voltage dependence of TRPM8 is characterised by a strong outward rectification at depolarized transmembrane potentials, and a rapid and potential-dependent closure at negative membrane potentials. Cooling and menthol application shift the activation curve of TRPM8 towards more negative potentials, thus increasing the probability of channel openings, boosting inward currents at physiological membrane potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Endogenous factors such as phospholipase A<sub>2 </sub>products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], endocannabinoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and PIP<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] also participate in channel regulation.</p><p>TRPM8 is expressed in a subset of small diameter primary sensory neurons and their peripheral terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition to its well characterized and critical role in the activation of low threshold thermoreceptors, responsible for the sensations of innocuous cold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], other evidence indicates the possible involvement of TRPM8 channels in normal noxious cold sensations and cold allodynia [reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]]. Notably, in an animal model of neuropathic pain, cold allodynia is significantly attenuated by capsazepine, a TRPM8 blocker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and mice lacking TRPM8 show reduced responses in nerve injury induced models of cold-allodynia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Also, sensory fibers with high threshold cold-evoked responses are difficult to record from in these mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Moreover, TRPM8-positive fibers are prominent in peripheral territories with marked noxious responses to cold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Many neurons responding to TRPM8 agonists are also activated by capsaicin, a marker of nociceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These new findings stress the potential use of TRPM8 modulators in the therapeutic management of cold-evoked pain, a characteristic symptom in some patients with neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Despite its fundamental role in many aspects of cold temperature transduction in mammals, the pharmacology of TRPM8 is still largely unexplored. Only a few studies have so far been dedicated to TRPM8 channel inhibitors and their mechanisms of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Recently, Malkia et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] showed that several antagonist compounds, including BCTC and SKF96365, act as negative allosteric modulators of channel gating, shifting the voltage activation of TRPM8 towards more positive potentials, suppressing the depolarizing effects of temperature and chemical agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. SKF96365 is a non-specific blocker of various calcium-permeable channels, including receptor-operated channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. BCTC was originally introduced as a highly potent and specific antagonist of the heat-activated vanilloid receptor TRPV1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, later studies showed that it also inhibits the TRPM8 channel, as does another TRPV1 blocker, capsazepine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These two antagonists bind competitively at the vanilloid binding pocket of the TRPV1 channel, governed by residues in the intracellular parts of the putative transmembrane domains 2, 3 and 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Recently, during a massive random mutagenesis screen, tyrosine 745, located in the middle of putative transmembrane segment 2, was identified as a crucial residue for the menthol sensitivity of mouse TRPM8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The generated TRPM8-Y745H mutant channel was insensitive to menthol, but retained the responsiveness to cold and voltage exhibited by the wild-type channel. Because of the significant parallels between TRPM8 and TRPV1 pharmacology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], we decided to study the effect of the Y745H mutation on the activity of the best characterized TRPM8 antagonists: BCTC, capsazepine, SKF96365 and clotrimazole, as well as of two new inhibitor candidates: econazole and imidazole. We identify, for the first time, structural elements on the TRPM8 protein that are critical for channel antagonism, and demonstrate an important difference in the way antagonists interact with the menthol binding site of TRPM8.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression and functional phenotype of the TRPM8-Y745H mutant</title><p>The correct expression of the TRPM8-Y745H mutant was first verified by Western blot analysis of lysates from HEK293 cells transfected with the TRPM8-wt and TRPM8-Y745H plasmids.

To determine whether the observed lack of block at the mutant channel was due to a shift in the dose-response curve of SKF96365, we also tested a super saturating concentration of the drug.

Imidazole, on the other hand, was ineffective at both the TRPM8 wild-type and Y745H mutant channels, at concentrations of 20 &#x003bc;M, 100 &#x003bc;M and 1 mM (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>).</p><p>While the TRPM8-wt channel is known to undergo certain rundown in the experimental conditions used in our calcium imaging recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], the almost complete recovery of the initial cooling response after 3 minutes of washing observed with the majority of the antagonists (e.g. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) demonstrates the inhibition to be specific to the antagonists applied.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiology confirms the differential effects of the Y745H mutation on BCTC and SKF96365 antagonism</title><p>In a previous study we showed that calcium imaging provides a reliable estimate of the potency of block of TRPM8 by different antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

We focused on BCTC and SKF96365 because they showed the largest differences between wild-type and mutant channels.

Furthermore, fits of the curves to equation (i) during activation by cold, allowed us to confirm our previous observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] that BCTC inhibits TRPM8 channel activity through a reduction in maximum conductance and a shift of the midpoint activation voltage towards more positive potentials. No significant differences were observed in either of these parameters between the wild-type channel and the Y745H mutant (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D-E</xref>), nor in the apparent gating charge (not shown). The effects were dose-dependent and readily reversible upon wash of the drug (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).

In this study, we investigated the effect of different compounds at the TRPM8-Y745H mutant channel, focusing on the differential effects of several antagonists on the gating properties.</p><p>Cold and menthol activate wild-type TRPM8 by shifting its voltage-dependent activation towards more negative potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We confirmed a previous report showing that the tyrosine at position 745, on the putative S2 transmembrane segment, is essential for the agonist effects of menthol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Menthol is a small and fairly lipophilic compound which easily partitions in the lipid bilayer and could thus be expected to affect TRPM8 channel function from various interaction sites. However, during menthol application to the menthol-insensitive TRPM8-Y745H mutant, the parameters describing voltage gating: V<sub>1/2 </sub>and g/g<sub>ctrl </sub>underwent no changes whatsoever, suggesting that menthol exerts its full effect by specific interaction with the binding site governed by the tyrosine residue 745. In the absence of menthol, the apparent gating charge, z<sub>app</sub>, was slightly lower in the TRPM8-Y745H mutant, indicating that this site is to some extent communicated with the voltage sensor of the channel. This finding is supported by recent work on TRPM8 voltage sensor mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and a fragmental model of the channel structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>While TRPM8 and TRPV1 share only around 20% protein sequence homology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], the channels have several phenotypic characteristics in common. Both are activated by temperature changes, and C-terminal chimeras between the channels exhibit reversed temperature sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, both TRPM8 and TRPV1 are inhibited by compounds such as BCTC, CTPC, SB-452533, capsazepine and ruthenium red [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. All TRPV1 antagonists, with the exception of pore blockers such as ruthenium red, seem to bind at the vanilloid binding pocket [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, no reports exist on the binding site of TRPM8 antagonists.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate the variable inhibitory effect of several compounds at the TRPM8-Y745H mutant channel. This finding is unexpected since all of them affect gating of the channel in a similar fashion, shifting voltage-dependence to more positive potentials and exerting an allosteric negative modulation of the channel during cold- or chemically evoked activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Our results reveal that the tyrosine residue 745 at the menthol binding site is critical for inhibition mediated by SKF96365. In contrast, the inhibition by other antagonists is unaffected (BCTC) or only partially reduced (capsazepine, clotrimazole, econazole) by the mutation, suggesting that at least one other binding site exists on the TRPM8 channel from where the inhibitors exert their negative allosteric modulation. Furthermore, the results imply that not all TRPM8 blockers should be considered competitive antagonists of menthol, even though the allosteric inhibitory effect they mediate lies in competition with the activating effect of cooling agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The experimental observations of differential interaction of Y745 with the antagonists SKF96365 and BCTC were further confirmed by molecular docking studies. Interestingly, in these simulations SKF96365 exhibited strong interactions with both Y745 and an asparagine residue, N799, that also interacts with icilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Looking at Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>, SKF96365 can be hypothesized to lock the S2 and S3 domains into a fixed position, thereby preventing conformational shifts of the S4 domain induced by menthol (or cooling) that would lead to channel activation. This idea is further supported by our finding that SKF96365 inhibits the TRPM8-wt current at 33&#x000b0;C, a condition in which the channel is only activated by voltage, whereas no effect is seen at the Y745H mutant. BCTC, in contrast, blocks both the wild-type and mutant channels in this condition with similar potency, indicating the presence of an alternative binding site. Overall, our data suggest a sequential model of TRPM8 gating where chemical modulators can favour (e.g. menthol) or hinder (e.g. BCTC or SKF96365) the energetics of subsequent channel opening by cold temperature or voltage, from different binding sites.</p><p>Our results provide direct clues for the identification of different structural motifs required for antagonist binding, aiding in the design of new candidate molecules for specific inhibition of TRPM8 channels. They also provide tools for current efforts to resolve the crystal structure of TRP channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Further mutagenesis work is required to identify the remaining binding site(s) of the various TRPM8 blockers. One potential site is formed by residues in the S2-S3 linker region, known to be important for the sensitivity to icilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Another plausible location is centred on residues within the TRP domain. This domain is known to be important in the energetics of channel opening, i.e. translating drug binding into channel opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In this regard, we consider a very powerful approach to subject random generated libraries of TRPM8 mutant channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] to the inhibitory actions of the different antagonists characterized in this study. In this way, one could obtain unbiased structural information on the action of different inhibitors.</p><p>Finally, we also studied for the first time the inhibitory capacity of two members of the imidazole family: the parent compound itself, and the antimycotic agent econazole, at the cooling-activated TRPM8 channel. Imidazole was unable to inhibit neither of the two TRPM8 constructs, while econazole, similarly to its relative clotrimazole, proved to be a potent antagonist of the wild-type channel. Both econazole and clotrimazole lost potency at the Y745H mutant channel. This identification of a novel TRPM8 antagonist prompts further screening of imidazole-based compounds in the quest for new TRPM8 blockers, and offers indications for the design of more potent derivatives.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this report, we identify, for the first time, structural elements on the TRPM8 protein that are critical for channel antagonism, and demonstrate an important difference in the way antagonists interact with the menthol binding site of TRPM8.
