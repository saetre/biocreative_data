Three patients (5.7%) were at stage I, 5 (9.4%) stage II, 15 (28.3%) stage III and 30 (56.6%) at stage IV. MUC1 tumor expression was studied by immunohistochemistry employing two anti-MUC1 antibodies: CT33, anti cytoplasmic tail MUC1 polyclonal antibody (Ab) and C595 anti-peptidic core MUC1 monoclonal antibody. Serum levels of MUC1 and free anti-MUC1 antibodies were detected by ELISA and circulating immune complexes (CIC) by precipitation in polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3.5%; MUC1 isolation from circulating immune complexes was performed by protein A-sepharose CL-4B affinity chromatography followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Statistical analysis consisted in Multivariate Principal Component Analysis (PCA); ANOVA test (Tukey's test) was employed to find differences among groups; nonparametrical correlations (Kendall's Tau) were applied when necessary.

A significant statistical correlation was found between MUC1 serum levels and anti-MUC1 IgG free antibodies, while a negative correlation between MUC1 serum levels and anti-MUC1 IgM free antibodies was found. Circulating immune complexes were elevated in 16/53 (30%) samples and were also statistically associated with advanced tumor stage. MUC1 was identified as an antigenic component of IgG circulating immune complexes. Moreover, poorly differentiated tumors were inversely correlated with tumor and serum MUC1 detection and positively correlated with node involvement and tumor mass.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Possibly, tumor cells produce MUC1 mucin which is liberated to the circulation and captured by IgG antibodies forming MUC1-IgG-CIC.

HNSCC localization consists about 40% in the oral cavity, 15% in the pharynx, 25% in the larynx and the rest sites such as salivary glands and thyroid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Data obtained from argentinian records show some differences compared with data found in other countries since the most frequent localization has been larynx (1665/3127, 53%) followed by oral cavity (1035/3127, 33%) and finally, pharynx showing 427/3127, 14%. In 2002, the total number of HNSCC cases informed in Argentina was 3127 (16.9/100000) inhabitants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Worldwide, delayed diagnosis is common and frequently very scarce improvement in five-year survival over the last four decades has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>HNSCC mainly progress to adjacent tissue and nodes while distant metastasis is a late event. The ability of tumor cells to invade is an acquired and progressive phenomenon mediated, in many cases, by the alteration of membrane glycoproteins such as mucins. Dabelsteen and Gao [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] proposed that the presence of different glycosylation patterns modulate the behavior of these membrane glycoproteins involved in cell signaling. In adenocarcinoma, particular interest has been focused on MUC1 mucin; in previous publications we have extensively detected MUC1 and associated epitopes in HNSCC and also we have isolated this mucin from larynx primary squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. MUC1 is a large heterodimeric glycoprotein formed by a highly glycosilated extracellular portion associated to a small cytoplasmic tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Studies developed on different carcinoma localizations such as breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] have proved that MUC1 mucin can elicit a humoral immune response; furthermore, we have detected free and complexed anti-MUC1 antibodies in serum samples belonging to breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>This report constitutes a detailed statistical study about MUC1 expression and anti-MUC1 immune response related to different clinical and pathological parameters which may be useful to increase our knowledge to develop new anti HNSCC therapeutic strategies based on immunological tools.</p><p>Here, we present data that confirm a high tumor MUC1 expression in HNSCC which correlates positively with circulating MUC1. Also, a positive correlation was found between serum MUC1 versus anti-MUC1 IgG free antibodies.</p><p>In addition, circulating immune complexes levels were statistically associated with tumor size, inversely associated with MUC1 tumor expression and were not positively associated with serum MUC1 and free anti-MUC1 IgG. Finally, tumor size, node involvement and poor differentiation were positively associated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Fifty three pre treatment HNSCC patients from the "Hospital General Interzonal de Agudos Gral. San Mart&#x000ed;n", La Plata, Argentina were included in this study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>); all tumors were primary; patients with previous history of HNSCC or who had received preoperative therapy were not included. Patients were clinically categorized according to the American Joint Cancer Committee (AJCC, Cancer Staging Manual, 2002). Sex and age distribution of patients was: 39 males (73.6%) and 14 (26.4%) females with a mean age of 60.67 (11.55 SD) years and a range from 29 to 98 years. Twenty six patients (49.1%) had their primary tumor located in the oral cavity, 17 (32.0%) in the larynx and 10 (18.9%) in the pharynx. Three patients (5.7%) were at stage I, 5 (9.4%) at stage II, 15 (28.3%) at stage III and 30 (56.6%) at stage IV; stages IVA, IVB and IVC cases where also included. Eighteen were classified as well differentiated (34.6%), 19 as moderately differentiated (36.5%) and 15 as poorly differentiated (28.9%).

Gels were electroblotted into nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher &#x00026; Schuell GmbH, Germany), which were blocked with TRIS buffered saline (TBS) 3% BSA at 4&#x000b0;C overnight and after five washes with TBS membranes were incubated with primary antibody at 4&#x000b0;C overnight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Nitrocellulose membranes were washed and incubated with peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or IgM (1:400) in TBS 3% BSA at room temperature for 3 hours.

The Cancer Associated Serum Assay (CASA) (Medical Innovations Ltd, Australia) utilizes two anti MUC1 core protein monoclonal antibodies, BC2 (IgG) as catcher and BC3 (IgM) as tracer, both directed to MUC1 peptide epitope APDTR. Reaction was detected by a peroxidase labeled anti-mouse IgM and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylebenzythiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS; Sigma, USA). Optical density (OD) was read at 405 nm, MUC1 levels were extrapolated from a standard curve and the cut off employed was 4 U/ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Serum anti-MUC1 antibodies detection</title><p>Detection of antibodies reactive with the protein core of MUC1 was performed by an ELISA described by von Mensdorff-Pouilly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] with some modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Briefly, 100 &#x003bc;l/well of 1 &#x003bc;l/ml BSA were dispensed onto 3912 Falcon III flexible PVC 96 wells plates (BD Labware, USA) and dried overnight at 37&#x000b0;C. After washing, 50 &#x003bc;l of a 100mer peptide containing five tandem repeats of the MUC1 core protein (100 &#x003bc;/ml) and 50 &#x003bc;l of carbodiimide (1-cycloexil-3-[2 morpholinoethyl] carbodiimide metho-p-sulphonate (Sigma, USA) were dispensed in duplicates. For each sample, 2 wells were incubated with carbodiimide-peptide and two other wells were employed as controls containing 100 &#x003bc;l of blocking buffer (1% BSA PBS) at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. After washing, 150 &#x003bc;l of blocking buffer was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Plates were washed and diluted human serum samples in blocking buffer (1:80 for IgM and 1:40 for IgG determinations) were applied and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing, 50 &#x003bc;l of peroxidase conjugated goat anti-human IgM 1:400 or IgG 1:600 (Sigma, USA) in PBS Tween-BSA 0.1% were dispensed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.

After 1 hour at room temperature in the dark, OD was read at 405 nm. Free anti-MUC1 core antibody levels were calculated as the difference between the averages of carbodiimide-peptide wells and controls. Cut off was 0.340 OD for anti-MUC1 IgM and 0.274 for IgG Abs.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Multivariate Principal Component Analysis was applied to standardized variables and a correlation table was obtained. Variables (vectors) were plotted against the two principal components extracted (Factor 1 in x axis and Factor 2 in y axis). ANOVA test with post hoc comparisons of means (Tukey's test) was employed to find differences among groups; nonparametrical correlations (Kendall's Tau) were applied when necessary. Statistical significance was set to p &#x0003c; 0.05 in all cases; calculations were performed with STATISTICA for Windows, StatSoft, Inc.

CT33 Ab, reactive with MUC1 cytoplasmic tail, was present in 40 (80%) HNSCC specimens, 22/25 tumors localized in oral cavity, 11/16 in the larynx and 7/9 in the pharynx. Reaction pattern was similar to previous reports developed in breast cancer employing the CT2 monoclonal antibody directed against the same last 17 aa of the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail (Croce et al, 2003). Cell membrane staining with a linear pattern was observed in 34 (68%) specimens, a cytoplasmic reaction was obtained in 32 (64%) samples while 27 (54%) had a mixed pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Also, a nuclear staining was displayed in 4 (8%) specimens. There were no statistically significant differences in MUC1 cytoplasmic tail expression related to tumor stage, localization or differentiation, although a clear tendency of negative CT33 reaction was found in advanced stage tumors while nuclear staining was associated with poorly differentiated tumor areas.</p><p>C595 monoclonal antibody, directed to the protein core of MUC1 extracellular domain, showed a positive reaction in 9 samples (18%), 6/25 localized in oral cavity, 2/17 in the larynx and 1/9 in the pharynx. Well differentiated tumors showed a strong reaction limited to the cytoplasm and cell membrane and mainly located in areas with keratin. In moderately and poorly differentiated tumors, a reaction was observed along the cytoplasm with a microvesicular pattern. No correlation was found between C595 monoclonal antibody reactivity versus tumor stage, node status or tumor differentiation. An example of C595 staining is depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>MUC1 serum levels</title><p>Serum MUC1 levels were measured in 53 HNSCC patients by means of ELISA. MUC1 serum levels were higher in cancer patients (mean = 2.46 U/mL, SD = 3.46 U/mL) than controls (mean = 0.60 U/mL, SD = 0.69 U/mL); the percentage of individuals over the cut off value (4 U/mL) was 8/53 (15%) vs 2/18 (10.5%), respectively. Through multivariate Principal Component Analysis, in HNSCC, a positive correlation was found between immunohistochemistry MUC1 detection and Cancer Associated Serum Assay levels (Kendall &#x003c4; = 0.275, p = 0.005; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Anti-MUC1 humoral immune response analysis</title><sec><title>Anti-MUC1 Ab detection</title><p>Free anti-MUC1 serum Ab levels measured in HNSCC were lower than normal sex and age matched controls.

A negative correlation between IgG and IgM levels (Kendall &#x003c4; = -0.309, p = 0.001) was found. Both anti-MUC1 IgG and anti-MUC1 IgM were statistically correlated with MUC1 serum levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), while IgG levels were detected according to MUC1 levels, anti-MUC1 IgM levels were very low in those patients over MUC1 cut off levels (4 U/mL). This association was also found by the multivariate Principal Component Analysis; in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> the vectors representing anti-MUC1 IgG and IgM are drawn opposed, while the vector that represents serum MUC1 was at the same quadrant of anti-MUC1 IgG.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Circulating immune complexes in HNSCC patients</title><p>Fifty three HNSCC patients presented a mean circulating immune complexes value of 0.224 OD (SD = 0.103 OD) statistically different from normal negative controls (mean = 0.171 OD, SD = 0.029; p = 0.038) and positive controls (SLE patients), mean = 0.456 OD, SD = 0.121 OD; p &#x0003c; 0.001. Tumor stage was statistically associated with circulating immune complexes levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>); two way ANOVA test with post hoc analysis of means showed differences between T2 and T3 tumors versus T4 although node invasion did not present any difference. Also, a statistical significant difference was found between well differentiated and moderately differentiated tumor samples, which presented a large amount of circulating immune complexes (p &#x0003c; 0.05) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). On the other hand, although undifferentiated tumors had circulating immune complexes levels similar to well differentiated tumors, no statistical difference was found between poor versus moderately differentiated specimens. Elevated circulating immune complexes levels were found in 16/53 patients (30.2%) which belonged to tumor stage I 1/3 (33%), stage III 3/15 (20%) and stage IV 12/30 (40%).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of tumor antigens isolated from circulating immune complexes</title><p>Eight out of 16 (50%) serum samples contained MUC1-CIC; results are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>.

Furthermore, it has been reported that in vivo, MUC1 cytoplasmic tail regulates erbB receptors signaling through the activation of MAPK pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>These observations clearly demonstrate the transforming properties of MUC1 overexpression in carcinoma and emphasize the importance of MUC1 cytoplasmic tail subcellular localization. In HNSCC we have found extensive expression and cellular localization of MUC1 cytoplasmic tail; large and poorly differentiated tumors were likely to be less reactive with CT33 and C595 Abs.</p><p>When C595 (anti-extracellular MUC1) monoclonal antibody was assayed, a lower percentage of reactivity with respect to anti-MUC1 cytoplasmic tail was found; we have previously reported a high reactivity to MUC1 protein core epitopes in HNSCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The difference among results was expected since previous reports included a larger number of tumors localized in oral cavity (58%) in comparison with 49.1% in the present report; we found that this localization is reactive with anti-protein core monoclonal antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. On the other hand, results presented here corresponded to 18.9% of pharyngeal tumors which did not usually react with these monoclonal antibodies; in past reports, only one patient with a pharyngeal tumor was included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. MUC1 cytoplasmic tail reactivity is not affected by MUC1 glycosylation and sialylation and, consequently, represents a better indicator of cell membrane associated MUC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] have described MUC1 RNA splice variants which do not express the protein core region. Our results also showed that serum MUC1 levels were elevated in 15% of HNSCC samples; interestingly, we found a statistically significant correlation between serum and tumor MUC1 detection indicating that this mucin may possibly be released by the tumor.</p><p>In this research we found anti-MUC1 antibodies; also, we observed that serum MUC1 levels were positively correlated with free anti-MUC1 IgG, which may indicate that an anti-MUC1 immune response is mounted. Tumor derived MUC1 is known to induce cellular and humoral specific immune responses in cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In this context, it is possible to speculate that a specific anti-MUC1 immune response is induced in HNSCC patients.</p><p>In another report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], we pointed out that low MUC1 serum levels in stage I breast cancer patients were associated with the presence of free and complexed anti-MUC1 antibodies. Similarly, circulating anti-MUC1-IgG antibody levels were found predictive of survival in breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and pancreatic cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We have found that anti-MUC1 IgG Ab correlated negatively with poor HNSCC differentiation and disease stage which are the main predictors for patient outcome in this localization.</p><p>Furthermore, we proved that MUC1-CIC detected by Western blot were of the IgG isotype since isolation was performed by protein A Sepharose CL-4B chromatography, which is known to bind with high affinity to 1, 2 and 4 IgG classes.</p><p>Presence of high amounts of circulating immune complexes in cancer patients is not very well understood. Antibody formation may represent the onset of an anti tumor immune response but, on the other hand, may be the consequence of tumor immune evasion related to a defective cellular immune response. Nonetheless, circulating immune complexes have been associated with tumor progression and also, their formation clearly affects the correct evaluation of several tumor markers.</p><p>Only a few reports in the literature have described the antigenic component of circulating immune complexes in HNSCC. Vlock DR and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] have exhaustively studied the reactivity of serum Abs against autologous tumor cell lines. These authors found that some patients presented high Ab titers which occasionally cross reacted with tumor cell lines derived from other histogenesis.</p><p>In accordance with other reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], we found higher circulating immune complexes levels in HNSCC patients in comparison with normal subjects; furthermore, we also agree with these authors that elevated circulating immune complexes levels were detected in advanced tumor stage. They pointed out that high circulating immune complexes levels in HNSCC patients is the result of increased tumor mass which would mediate changes in anti tumor immunity. Moreover, Das TK et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] found that circulating immune complexes persist after surgical excision of the primary tumor due to the presence of remaining tumor tissue or occult metastasis.</p><p>MUC1 is a mucin that has been detected both in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane and nucleus in different tumor localizations. MUC1 is synthesized in the ER and glycosylated in the Golgi apparatus but it has been described that it suffers several glycosylation cycles being expressed in the plasma membrane several times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, different splicing variants have been described that can be present in the cytoplasm and in the plasma membrane, as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Wen et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] investigated intracellular trafficking of MUC1 cytoplasmic tail in human pancreatic cancer cell lines S2-013 and Panc-1 and detected this fraction at the inner cell surface, in the cytosol and in the nucleus. They hypothesized that the association between &#x003b2;-catenin and fragments of the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail facilitated the cytosol-to-nuclear translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin and contributed to its nuclear accumulation. We have found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] MUC1 cytoplasmic tail and protein core expression in the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus in breast and colorectal tumor samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In HNSCC, Principal Component Analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) showed that circulating immune complexes were associated with advanced tumor stage; furthermore, the vectors that represent these variables did not positively correlate to serum MUC1 and anti-MUC1 IgG antibody levels, and also were inversely correlated with MUC1 tumor expression. Considering that we identified MUC1 as an antigenic component of circulating immune complexes, taken together, these results indicate that a large tumor mass produces high MUC1 mucin that is liberated to circulation and captured by IgG antibodies forming MUC1-CIC.</p><p>Another interesting conclusion is that poorly differentiated tumors are inversely correlated with tumor and serum MUC1 detection. This finding suggests the possibility to take into account its consideration regarding prognosis and follow up of this disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MER carried out the studies and drafted the manuscript.
