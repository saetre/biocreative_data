Some leaderless proteins, however, can exit from a cell in an ER-Golgi independent fashion, for example, interleukins 1&#x003b1; and 1&#x003b2;, FGF2, thioredoxin, lipocortin, galectin, HIV-tat protein, annexin, and vas deferens protein. TCTP, with no classical leader sequence that might explain its extracellular presence, belongs to these unusual proteins, which exit from a cell without passing through the classical secretion pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005732-Muesch1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005732-Kuchler1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Extracellular TCTP was first identified in the supernatants of U937 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005732-MacDonald1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and further studies on TCTP release were done using HEK293 cells. U937 cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI media for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 h, and the collected supernatants and cells were processed, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for TCTP. The secreted amount of TCTP increased with incubation time and reached maximum after 5 h incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005732-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To ensure that TCTP resulted from an active secretion process rather than from contamination from cell lysis or non-specific release, the supernatants were also immunoblotted against &#x003b2;-tubulin, one of the abundant cytosolic proteins. Beta tubulin was clearly identified in cell lysates but not in the corresponding supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005732-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In HEK293 cells, it was difficult to detect the secretion of endogeneous TCTP. HEK293 cells were therefore transfected with TCTP-3Xflag and 2 days later placed in serum-free media and their supernatants were assayed for the presence of TCTP. Transfected HEK293 cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM media for 0, 0.5, 1, or 3 h, and the collected supernatants and cells were processed, and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for TCTP-3Xflag.

In U937 cells, 10 &#x000b5;M omeprazole reduced TCTP secretion by about 60&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005732-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and by 50&#x00025; with 100 &#x000b5;M pantoprazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005732-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

In these experiments, we used omeprazole at lower concentration than pantoprazole for the following reasons. First, omeprazole showed cytotoxic effect at concentrations higher than 100 &#x000b5;M, probably due to the excessive inhibition of H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase. Second, the reconstituted pantoprazole caused precipitation after freezing and thawing and precipitation causes some reduction in activity. To avoid such precipitations, it was dissolved as soon as it was reconstituted, and divided into small aliquots. The viability of the cells treated by omeprazole and pantoprazole was confirmed with trypan blue or CCK-8 kit; there was no significant difference between untreated and treated cells. The inhibition of TCTP secretion by omeprazole and pantoprazole was also seen in ionomycin (IM) treated cells. IM is a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ionophore and induces secretion of many proteins in an ER-Golgi independent process. With U937 cells, IM treatment increased TCTP secretion by approximately 50&#x00025; and pre-treatment with omeprazole and pantoprazole blocked this increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005732-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

There are many studies about the secretion mechanisms of the other non-typically secreted proteinsother than TCTP. Secretion of the catalytic subunit of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase is reported to be related to fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). In this study, the authors searched for some small molecules that might cause specific perturbation of the plasma membrane and interfere with FGF-2 release. They assumed that there is a plasma membrane translocation apparatus (PMTA) through which FGF-2 is exported. They found cardenolides like ouabain inhibit FGF-2 secretion and that Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase acts as a PMTA component or regulator. Based on this report, we searched for the inhibitors that act on plasma membrane and inhibit TCTP secretion. Eventually we found that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole and pantoprazole decrease the leaderless TCTP export. Possible cytotoxic effects of omeprazole and pantoprazole could be ruled out, since the trypan blue or CCK-8 assay showed no toxic effects when these drugs were used. Also, reduction in TCTP secretion by PPIs did not result from altered protein synthesis or increased instability of intracellular pools, because the treatment with these drugs did not modify the amounts of the intracellular proteins remarkably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005732-g001">Figs. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005732-g002">2B</xref>).</p><p>Omeprazole is used to treat peptic ulcer because it is a specific inhibitor of the human gastric H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase. It is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Other Chemicals containing pantoprazole, rabeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole are also PPIs. PPIs interact with the catalytic &#x003b1;-subunit of H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase and thereby inhibit its ability to exchange K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> for H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, hydrolyze ATP, and maintain an electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. In addition to reduction of gastric acid secretion through H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase inhibition, various biological effects of omeprazole have been investigated, including antileishmanial (antimicrobial) activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005732-Jiang1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, relaxation of human arteries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005732-Naseri1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, and inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005732-MartinsdeOliveira1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the major target of PPIs is heretofore believed to be gastric H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase (known to be mainly in parietal cells of stomach), other molecules, for example putative H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase that are sensitive to PPIs and are unrelated to gastric H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase or completely new targets other than proton pump, might be influenced by PPIs, considering the effects of PPIs on neutrophils or arteries. The data presented here suggest that the new activities of PPIs should be evaluated in the light of their role as inhibitors of TCTP and in the export of unidentified proteins export via ER-Golgi independent secretion pathways.</p><p>Several possible models can link, at the molecular level, the known actions of PPIs, their effect on their target (the &#x003b1;1-subunit of H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase) and their ability to inhibit TCTP export. For example, the translocation apparatus exporting TCTP from cells may be regulated via the electrochemical gradient maintained by H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase. If this model is correct, one needs to examine the expression of H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase in U937 and HEK293 cells. Western blotting analysis using the cell lysates of U937 and HEK293 cells, showed several bands detected by anti-gastric H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase &#x003b1; antibody (data not shown). But the detected proteins were smaller than expected. This indicates either that gastric H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase &#x003b1; does not exist in these cells or that new, modified forms of gastric H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase &#x003b1; might exist. It is also possible that there is a novel PPIs-sensitive protein target that is distinct from the catalytic &#x003b1;-subunit of H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase, even though thus far, the main binding target of PPIs is the catalytic &#x003b1;-subunit of H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase. Next possibility is the H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase blockade may modify ongoing intracellular events, such as calcium influx and calcium mobilization, and modulate TCTP release. In previous studies, it was reported that PPIs could affect the intracellular calcium level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005732-Holm1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005732-Grant1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> and tat exocytosis is one of the mechanisms of TCTP secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005732-Amzallag1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The changes in intracellular calcium levels caused by PPIs might influence exocytosis and subsequently TCTP secretion.</p><p>TCTP has been implicated in various cellular processes, such as cell growth, cell cycle progression, malignant transformation, protection of cells against stress and apoptosis. In addition, an extracellular, cytokine-like functions have been established for TCTP. Thus far, there have been no reports showing that changes in intracellular TCTP levels influence the severity of allergic responses or regulation of various allergic cytokines. For TCTP to act as a regulator of allergic responses, it should be released from cells. TCTP cannot affect downstream effector cells until it is secreted. Because of their ability to inhibit TCTP secretion <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, omeprazole and pantoprazole might be potentially useful as anti-allergic asthmatic therapies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0005732-Bommer1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
