This structure was identified 100 years ago and formerly called "Jensen's ring". At low magnification, the annulus appears dense and homogeneous, but at high magnification it shows to be composed of closely packed filamentous subunits oriented circumferentially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>During early spermiogenesis, a flagellar axoneme forms beneath the cell surface from one of the two centrioles, and rapidly protudes from the cell. The centriole pair forming the axoneme then move towards the nucleus and finally impacts it, which causes the cell membrane adherent to the centriole to become infolded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. As early as in this stage the annulus or the anlage of the annulus can be seen encircling the axoneme at the distal end of the basal body by electron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. During the late stage of sperm flagellum development, the annulus slips towards a more distal position, and the mitochondria begin to affix to the flagellum. In a mature spermatozoon the annulus is located between the midpiece and the principal piece of the flagellum, and beneath the plasma membrane, firmly connecting them together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Recent researches show that the sperm annulus is a septin-based structure composed of several septins, such as SEPT1, 4, 6, 7 and 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Septins, conserved from yeast to <italic>Drosophila </italic>to humans, are polymerizing GTPases that can form hetero-oligomeric filaments required for cytokinesis and other cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The functional importance of septins in sperm annulus formation is illustrated by the <italic>Sept4</italic>-deficient male mice. <italic>Sept4</italic>-deficient male mice are sterile due to defective morphology and motility of the sperm flagella. Mutant sperm lacking the annulus often show bent-back tail morphology at the midpiece-principal piece junction. Therefore, cortical organization of the annulus based on circular assembly of septins is essential for the structural and mechanical integrity of mammalian spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. To date, however, little is known about how the annulus/septin ring is assembled and positioned to the midpiece-principal piece junction during spermiogenesis. In vivo, mammalian septins may need extra factors or adaptors to organize higher-order structures, albeit their self-assembly into filamentous rings in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus, the present study intends to examine the involvement of DNAJB13, a type II heat shock protein 40 (HSP40), in annulus assembly and positioning during mammalian sperm flagellum development.</p><p>HSP40s generally function as cochaperones in the HSP70 chaperone systems that are involved in many processes in cells, such as folding of newly synthesized proteins, refolding of misfolded proteins, translocation of proteins into organelles, assembly and disassembly of protein complexes, and protein degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We have previously shown that DNAJB13 is a component of mouse sperm axoneme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Here we report that DNAJB13 is associated with the annulus spatiotemporally during sperm flagellum development in wild type mice, and even present temporarily in the annulus-deficient <italic>Sept4</italic>-null spermatids taking on an annulus-like pattern. In vitro DNAJB13 interacts with SEPT4 directly. Altogether, our data suggest that DNAJB13 may assist in assembling the annulus and positioning it toward the midpiece-principal piece junction during sperm flagellum development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>DNAJB13 localized to sperm annulus transiently during mouse spermiogenesis</title><p>With the specific antibody against mouse DNAJB13, we have demonstrated that DNAJB13 is an axonemal component of flagella in mature spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Surprisingly, when performing immunofluorescence microscopy on mouse testicular germ cells, we found that this antibody also labeled a ring-like structure in certain spermatids in addition to the axoneme. It is known that three kinds of ring-like structures form during mammalian spermatogenesis: intercellular bridges, the perinuclear ring of the manchette, and the annulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The ring-like structure labelled by this antibody on flagella prompted us to investigate whether or not DNAJB13 localized to sperm annulus by co-staining with anti-SEPT4 antibody. SEPT4, an annulus constituent, has been used to indicate the sperm annulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We then found that DNAJB13 was co-localized with SEPT4, but only in developing spermatids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), not in mature epididymal spermatozoa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). We also employed phase contrast microscopy to clearly demonstrate the sperm annulus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), which was stained with DNAJB13 antibody in parallel, showing that DNAJB13 indeed localized to the sperm annulus.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Transient localization of DNAJB13 to sperm annulus</bold>. In addition to the axonemal localization, DNAJB13 (green) was also co-localized with an annulus constituent SEPT4 (red) to the sperm annulus (arrows) in developing spermatids (A), but not in mature spermatozoa (B). The phase contrast images of a spermatid further showed that the localization of DNAJB13 to the annulus (see insets in the phase contrast images) (C). Note the DNAJB13 antibody also labeled a small dot (arrowheads) below the annulus (A, C). The sperm nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue).

In most cases, it showed a bar-like pattern (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2B</xref>); but the ring-like pattern (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>; additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>; additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2C</xref>) was obvious when detached from flagella; it also displayed a two-dot pattern when the signal intensity was low, especially at the beginning of the annulus formation (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2A</xref>). In addition to its annulus location, DNAJB13 staining on the same testicular cell preparation uncovered a discernible pattern. In a subset of spermatids, a small dot labelled with the antibody was kept apart from the annulus staining toward the distal end of the sperm flagellum (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, C</xref>). During sample preparation, some spermatids were damaged and their annuli were released. In this case, DNAJB13 was still co-localized with SEPT4 on the ring-like structure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), indicating that there may be a strong physical interaction between them.</p></sec><sec><title>Spatiotemporal progression of annular DNAJB13 during spermiogenesis</title><p>Intrigued by our observation above, we employed immunofluorescence microscopy to follow the spatiotemporal progression of annular DNAJB13 with the annulus during mouse spermiogenesis in detail. In order to define each step in spermiogenesis, we combined the antibody staining with DAPI (nuclear staining) and MitoTracker (mitochondrial marker). Because it is difficult for us to demonstrate 4 colors in one sample, we stained the testicular germ cells with the SEPT4 antibody and the DNAJB13 antibody separately.</p><p>The annulus indicated by the SEPT4 immunofluorescent signal first appeared in step 9 spermatids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>), not in step 8 spermatids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). It kept staying at the neck region until the spermatids developed to early step 15 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c, d</xref>), and after that it slipped down to its distal position followed by the formation of the mitochondrial sheath (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e&#x02013;h</xref>). Of note, SEPT4 was still present at the midpiece-principal piece junction of mature spermatozoa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2i</xref>). It has been shown by electron microscopy that the annulus can be detected shortly after the flagellum formation and migration toward the nucleus in the early stage of cat spermiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In Chinese hamster spermiogenesis, the anlage of the annulus is first detected in spermatids in which the centriolar pair forming the flagellum has reached and impacted the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Correspondingly, the flagellum forms in step 2&#x02013;3 spermatids, then migrates inwards and finally reaches and indents the nucleus in step 6 spermatids in both rat and mouse spermiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, with immunofluorescence microscopy, we were unable to detect the annulus structure even in step 8 spermatids, probably due to the sensitivity difference between the two methodologies, or the developmental difference among different species, or because the annulus prior to step 9 is not septin-based. Indeed, early ultrastructural studies in rat and mouse spermatids show that the annulus cannot be clearly seen until step 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and stays at the neck region from step 9 to early step 15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], consistent with our present findings.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Spatiotemporal progression of annulus during mouse spermiogenesis</bold>. The annulus (arrows) indicated by the SEPT4 antibody was first seen at the neck region of step 9 spermatids (b), not in step 8 spermatids (a).

The signal intensity of annular DNAJB13 increased as the spermiogenesis proceeded (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c&#x02013;i</xref>). It peaked when the annulus migrated down to its most distal position, and afterwards decreased gradually with the formation and maturation of mitochondrial sheath (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3j&#x02013;n</xref>). In contrast to SEPT4 staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2i</xref>), DNAJB13 was absent at the midpiece-principal piece junction of mature spermatozoa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3o</xref>). The nuclear staining (blue) and mitochondrial staining (red) used to define steps of spermiogenesis were merged with the DNAJB13 staining to clearly show the whole progression (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a'&#x02013;o'</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d, e, f, g, h, i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3j</xref> detailed the migrating progress of both DNAJB13-labeled dot and annulus towards the midpiece-principal piece junction on the tail. The DNAJB13 dot appeared around step 13&#x02013;14 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>), a time point slightly before annulus migration (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3e</xref>), advanced toward the midpiece-principal piece junction (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3f, g</xref>), and then stayed there (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3h&#x02013;j</xref>). The DNAJB13-labeled annulus followed the DNAJB13 dot downwards (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3g&#x02013;i</xref>), and eventually merged with it at the midpiece-principal piece junction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3j</xref>). These data indicate that the annular DNAJB13 and the DNAJB13 dot may be involved in positioning of the annulus.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Spatiotemporal progression of annular DNAJB13 during mouse spermiogenesis</bold>. The annular DNAJB13 staining (green, arrows) was first seen at the neck region of step 9 spermatids (b), not in step 8 spermatids (a), and the staining intensity increased until the annulus slipped down to its distal position at step 15 (c-i). With the formation and maturation of the mitochondrial sheath (red), the signal of annular DNAJB13 decreased gradually from middle step 15 to step 16 (j-n) and disappeared totally in mature spermatozoa (o). Note the DNAJB13 antibody also labeled a dot (arrowheads) below the annulus.

Surprisingly we found that DNAJB13 was still present at the neck region of the flagellum, displaying either a ring-like or two-dot pattern from step 9 to early step 15 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). However, the intensity of the annulus-like DNAJB13 staining in <italic>Sept4</italic>-null spermatids was consistently low and steady, compared to that in wild type spermatids (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b&#x02013;f</xref>). Perhaps due to lack of the annulus in the <italic>Sept4</italic>-null spermatids, the annulus-like DNAJB13 staining disappeared soon and was undetectable in middle step 15 of the <italic>Sept4</italic>-null spermatids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These data indicate that the annulus-like DNAJB13 appears prior to formation of the septin-based annulus, and further that it may assist in assembling the septin-based annulus.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of DNAJB13 in <italic>Sept4</italic>-null mouse spermatids</bold>.

Also as in wild type spermatids, the dot (arrowheads) was present and migrated towards the midpiece-principal piece junction. (B) In middle step 15 spermatids, DNAJB13 was undetectable at the midpiece-principal piece junction, which was easily distinguished by staining the mitochondrial sheath with MitoTracker (red).

Therefore, its presence and migration are likely to be independent of annulus. Since the mitochondrial sheath is still formed in <italic>Sept4</italic>-null spermatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], the dot may play a role in mitochondrial sheath orientation in the absence of annulus.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro DNAJB13 co-localized and interacted with SEPT4</title><p>In an effort to determine whether <italic>DNAJB13 </italic>and <italic>SEPT4 </italic>interact in vivo, we first made the testicular lysate.

In the early stage of sperm flagellum development, DNAJB13 forms an annular anlage, or attaches to a pre-existing annular anlage, and then recruits septins through direct interaction with SEPT4 or SEPT4-containing septin complex to build up a genuine annulus. In the late stage of sperm flagellum development, DNAJB13 may assist the migration of the annulus, and meanwhile forms a dot on the flagellum to direct the annulus toward the midpiece-principal piece junction. As the annulus is positioned to the midpiece-principal piece junction, DNAJB13 disappears gradually with formation and maturation of the mitochondrial sheath.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by Stockholm-North Animal Ethical Committee or the Animal Care and Use Committee of Kyoto University.

After lysis the cells were scraped off and transferred into a new eppendorf tube. After centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C, a small aliquot of the supernatant was taken as input, and the left was divided into two new eppendorf tubes equally. One tube was added with rabbit anti-GFP antibody (A11122, Invitrogen), and the other was added with normal rabbit IgG. After 2-hour incubation at 4&#x000b0;C with gentle rotation, each tube was added with protein G beads (Upstate) and incubated for another 2 hours. After 4 times wash with lysis buffer, the beads were boiled in 2 &#x000d7; SDS sampling buffer at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 2 minutes to collect the Co-IP products.

After filtration the cells were attached onto acid-treated, poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips. The coverslips were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 minutes and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes at room temperature. After blocking in 3% BSA the coverslips were incubated with the primary antibodies for 1&#x02013;2 hours at room temperature.

After rinse and DAPI staining, the coverslips were mounted onto slides with Prolong anti-fade reagents (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-DNAJB13 antibody (1:50), rabbit anti-SEPT4 antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:200) and guinea pig anti-SEPT4 antibody (raised against oligopeptide corresponding to residues 466&#x02013;478 of mouse SEPT4, 1:100).
