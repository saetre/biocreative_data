Dysregulation of Tensin expression has previously been implicated in human cancer. Here, we have for the first time evaluated the significance of all four Tensins in a study of human renal cell carcinoma (RCC), as well as probed the biological function of Tensin3.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>Expression of Tensin2 and Tensin3 at mRNA and protein levels was largely absent in a panel of diverse human cancer cell lines. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed mRNA expression of all four Tensin genes to be significantly downregulated in human kidney tumors (50&#x02013;100&#x00025; reduction versus normal kidney cortex; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Furthermore, the mRNA expressions of Tensins mostly correlated positively with each other and negatively with tumor grade, but not tumor size. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Tensin3 to be present in the cytoplasm of tubular epithelium in normal human kidney sections, whilst expression was weaker or absent in 41&#x00025; of kidney tumors. A subset of tumor sections showed a preferential plasma membrane expression of Tensin3, which in clear cell RCC patients was correlated with longer survival. Stable expression of Tensin3 in HEK 293 cells markedly inhibited both cell migration and matrix invasion, a function independent of putative phosphatase activity in Tensin3. Conversely, siRNA knockdown of endogenous Tensin3 in human cancer cells significantly increased their migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings indicate that the Tensins may represent a novel group of metastasis suppressors in the kidney, the loss of which leads to greater tumor cell motility and consequent metastasis. Moreover, tumorigenesis in the human kidney may be facilitated by a general downregulation of Tensins. Therefore, anti-metastatic therapies may benefit from restoring or preserving Tensin expression in primary tumors.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Tensins constitute a family of intracellular proteins that are coming to the fore as novel regulators of cell motility and growth. The Tensin family is composed of four members: Tensin1, Tensin2, Tensin3 and Tensin4 (TNS1, TNS2, TNS3, TNS4) each with discrete expression patterns in the human body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Hafizi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Lo1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on their common domains, the Tensins have the potential to interact with the plasma membrane (C1 domain) as well as bind to tyrosines (SH2 and PTB domain) in integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Calderwood1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Hafizi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition, Tensins 1-3, but not -4, contain a phosphatase (PTPase)-C2 domain pair that is homologous to that in the PTEN tumour suppressor protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Alonso1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Hafizi2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the potential lipid PTPase activity of Tensins 1&#x02013;3, as well as their putative interactions with the actin cytoskeleton, remains to be determined. Tensin1 was the first member identified, and is localized to focal adhesions in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Chen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. We identified Tensin2 (also known as C1-TEN, TENC1) as a binding partner for Axl RTK through its SH2-PTB region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Hafizi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Tensin3 has virtually the same domain organization as C1-TEN, and interacts with the EGF receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Cui1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Tensin4 is a shorter protein that is not expected to interact with the cytoskeleton, whilst it contains the SH2-PTB domains similar to the other Tensins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Lo2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The functional consequence of Tensin interactions suggests regulation of membrane receptor signaling that is linked to control of cytoskeletal dynamics. This therefore has implications for cell motility in the metastatic process. For example, in breast cancer cells, Tensin3 was shown to anchor integrins to the cytoskeleton, rendering the cell less motile and thereby less capable of metastasizing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Katz1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Conversely, stimulation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) upregulates Tensin4, which is a shorter protein that could lack actin-binding regions but which still interacts with integrins. This mobilization of Tensin4 results in its displacement of Tensin3 from the integrin, thus destabilizing the cytoskeleton and enhancing cell motility. We have reported that Tensin2 expression in kidney cells inhibits cell proliferation, survival and migration, concomitant with a selective suppression of the Akt signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Hafizi2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, an interaction apparently common to all four Tensins is that with the DLC-1 tumor suppressor protein, which may be a mediator for the potential anti-tumor effects of Tensins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Yam1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Qian1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the United States, 54390 new cases of renal cancer are predicted to occur in 2008, causing an estimated 13010 deaths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Ries1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a cancer originating from kidney epithelium and accounts for 85&#x00025; of kidney cancers and associated mortality. RCC can be further subdivided into different subtypes: conventional or clear cell RCC (ccRCC), which represents the large majority of RCC cases, followed by papillary (pRCC) and chromophobe (chRCC). Also included in this study is oncocytoma, which is a non-RCC, benign tumor type. Each of these tumor types has a distinct pathogenesis. For example, two thirds of ccRCC cases are linked with a defect in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Cohen1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>However, the epithelial cell transformation that occurs in common to these tumor types involves multiple processes, including mutations that enable conditions favorable for cancer cell survival, proliferation and migration. In addition, enhanced cancer cell motility is a principal feature in the early metastatic process. As a quarter of RCC patients present with locally invasive or metastatic disease, it is imperative to identify the factors and mechanisms that underlie the metastatic process.</p><p>The kidney is the organ where most Tensins are preferentially expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Hafizi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Chen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Cui1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

The next day (day 0), the medium was replaced with that containing 5&#x00025; serum, and cells were further incubated for up to 7 days. On each successive day, the numbers of viable cells were measured by their conversion during 3 h of the tetrazolium compound &#x0005b;3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS, Sigma) into a soluble formazan product that was measured spectrophotometrically at 490 nm. Quadruplicate wells were used for each measurement.</p><p>The second method for cell proliferation was quantitation of absolute cell numbers to generate a growth curve over 5 days. Separate clones of stably transfected mock 293 cells, wildtype Tensin3 cells (Tns3 wt) and Tensin3 PTPase mutant cells (Tns3 Mut) were seeded at 1&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells per well in a 48-well plate, in medium containing 0.5&#x00025; serum (day &#x02212;1). The next day (day 0), the medium was replaced with that containing 5&#x00025; serum, and cells were incubated for a further 5 days. On each successive day, cell number per well was determined by trypsinization of cells from the wells and counting in a hemocytometer chamber. For each clone, the cell number was determined from the mean count from nine fields. In both experiments, statistical differences between cell types on each day were determined by ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc correction.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Cell migration and cell matrix invasion assays</title><p>A modified Boyden chamber assay system was used to determine migration/haptotaxis of Tensin3&#x02013;transfected cells as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Hafizi2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, cell culture inserts with 8 &#x000b5;m pore size membranes (Nunclon, Roskilde, Denmark) were precoated with fibronectin (10 &#x000b5;g/ml; Sigma, Stockholm, Sweden) on the underside. Inserts were placed into wells of 24-well plates containing complete growth medium, and 10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded into each insert interior in complete medium. Duplicate inserts were used for each separate cell line analyzed. Cells were allowed to migrate at 37&#x000b0;C in a cell culture incubator for 18 h. Afterwards, inserts were removed and medium inside aspirated. All cells left on the upper surface of the membrane were wiped away and insert membranes were briefly rinsed, fixed in 10&#x00025; formalin and stained with Gram's crystal violet solution (Fluka, Stockholm, Sweden). Cells from a minimum of three high power fields per insert were counted under light microscopy (Olympus, Solna, Sweden). Statistical comparisons between migration of individual cell clones were carried out by ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc correction.</p><p>For matrix invasion assays, the haptotaxis assay above was modified such that instead of fibronectin, the basement membrane matrix mixture Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) was used to cover the upper side of cell culture inserts with 8 &#x000b5;m pores. Separate clones of Mock and Tensin3-transfected 293 cells were seeded into the chamber interiors in medium containing 0.5&#x00025; serum, whilst the wells of 24-well plates contained complete growth medium, thereby creating a serum gradient. Duplicate inserts were used for each separate cell line analyzed. Cells were allowed to invade the matrix and migrate through to the other side of the membrane over 30 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Afterwards, cells were fixed, stained and counted as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Knockdown of Tensin3 by siRNA silencing</title><p>The melanoma cell line WM793 was selected for Tensin3 gene silencing as it expressed the highest amounts of Tensin3 out of all the cancer cell lines tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004350-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Cells were seeded in 6-well plates 24 h prior to siRNA transfection. Cells were separately transfected with 5 nM each of three different Tensin3 siRNA constructs, siRNA I, II (ON-TARGET plus siRNA Reagents; Dharmacon, T&#x000e4;by, Sweden) and III (HP validated siRNA; Qiagen, Solna, Sweden). Negative controls included transfection mixture only and a non-silencing siRNA that was shown to have little effect on global gene expression (AllStars; Qiagen, Solna, Sweden). The siRNA was mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 and OptiMEM I serum free medium (Invitrogen, Liding&#x000f6;, Sweden), and the tranfection mixture was incubated with cells for 24 h. After this period, cells were trypsinized, counted and subjected to a migration/haptotaxis assay exactly as described above, except that 0.5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> WM793 cells per insert were used, and migration was allowed to occur over 16 h.</p><fig id="pone-0004350-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004350.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Absence of expression of Tensin2 and Tensin3 at both mRNA and protein levels in several different human cancer cell lines.</title><p>(A) Northern blot analysis of Tensin2 (TNS2) mRNA in human cancer cell lines.

We went on to perform quantitative RT-PCR to further investigate mRNA expression levels of Tensin2 and Tensin3 in a larger selection of human cancer cell lines and compared them directly to RNA extracted from whole human kidney tissue extracts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004350-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, Tensin2 mRNA was absent in the majority of cell lines. Only the colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line SW480 expressed Tensin2 mRNA at detectable levels, which was also seen in the Northern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004350-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Significantly, both Tensin2 and Tensin3 expression were lower in a single RCC patient's kidney tumor extract as compare to its adjacent normal counterpart (matched). The results show that Tensin3 expression is higher and broader than that of Tensin2 amongst the investigated cell lines, but that both genes appear to be downregulated in RCC.

Positive immunohistochemical staining for Tensin3 in RCC tissue sections was found in the cytoplasm and at varying intensities. There was no Tensin3 expression in the fibrovascular stroma or endothelial cells of tumour vessels. Positive staining was typified by a granular, dotted brown staining throughout the cytosol. Out of a total of 148 patients with RCC tumor sections analyzed, 61 (41&#x00025;) displayed either no Tensin3 staining or very weak cytoplasmic staining. In contrast, a subset of sections (16) showed an additional strong and defined Tensin3 immunoreactivity at the plasma membrane. Separating the data according to tumor type, no significant correlation was apparent between Tensin3 staining intensity and patient survival (data not shown). However, in ccRCC patients, presence of Tensin3 staining at the plasma membrane of positive cells (PM) conferred a statistically significant survival advantage over those ccRCC tumors with only cytoplasmic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004350-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

This therefore makes urgent the need for novel therapies particularly aimed at treating metastatic disease.</p><p>Today there exist dozens of intracellular molecules, the loss of which are associated with the neoplastic state in cells. This study is the first comprehensive investigation of the Tensin family of intracellular proteins in human kidney cancer, and moreover in human clinical disease. We have studied all four members of the Tensin family and, in keeping with a proposed tumor/metastasis suppressor role, found them all to be reduced in expression in RCC. Tensins -2 and -3 were absent or barely expressed in a variety of human cancer cell lines. Furthermore, a preferential plasma membrane expression of Tensin3 was correlated with greater survival. In addition, recombinant Tensin3 expression in human kidney cells caused a greatly reduced haptotactic cell migration and matrix invasion, indicating a role for Tensins in control of cell motility.</p><p>Our quantitative RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry results indicate that Tensin3 and Tensin1 are likely the most prevalent Tensins in the human kidney. Tensin3 is expressed preferentially in renal proximal tubular epithelium, while Tensin2 may also be present in podocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Cho1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, although Tensin2 is expressed at a lower level in total. All four Tensins were found to be highly significantly lower or absent in RCC tissue versus matched normal kidney cortex tissue. Notably, Tensin3 gene expression was significantly negatively correlated with tumor grade. The significance of the expression of Tensin3 and its loss in tumor development has been reported for breast cancer cells, where Tensin3 downregulation was coupled to lesser cytoskeletal stability and consequently greater motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Katz1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Downregulation of Tensin3 in thyroid tumors was also shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Maeda1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Tensin2 downregulation in tumourigenesis has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Ryschich1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and uterine carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Santin1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the case of Tensin4, this Tensin has been observed at both higher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Katz1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Sasaki1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Sasaki2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and lower <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Lo2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> levels in different clinical tumor samples. One study has reported results indicating that Tensin4 may compete with Tensin3 in sites where it is expressed strongly enough <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Katz1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in our study we found Tensin4 to be the least expressed of all the Tensins in human kidney, and it was in fact absent in most RCCs analyzed. Moreover, all the Tensins are able to interact with DLC-1 tumor suppressor protein, and may therefore enable its localization and proper function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Yam1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Qian1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, all together these results indicate that a general loss of Tensins may be advantageous to the development or spread of tumors.</p><p>The immunohistochemical analysis of Tensin3 protein expression and localization in RCC, using TMAs, showed an interesting negative correlation between its plasma membrane localization and patient survival. This indicates that in ccRCC patients where tumor cells have Tensin3 present at the plasma membrane have a better survival prognosis than ccRCC patients lacking Tensin3 or expressing it only within the cytoplasm. In keeping with data supporting the necessity of Tensin3 for cytoskeletal stability and organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Katz1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, observation of Tensin3 at the cell periphery may indicate that a tumor cell is more static and thus less likely to be motile and metastasize.</p><p>We investigated the biological role of Tensin3 in various cell models. Normal kidney cells were stably transfected with both wild type Tensin3 as well as a Tensin3 mutant that would potentially abolish any phosphatase activity. Stable expression of Tensin3 did not affect cell viability and proliferation; however, it affected both cell migration and invasion negatively. Tensin3-expressing cells exhibited a markedly reduced migration towards a fibronectin gradient as compared to mock-transfected cells. Furthermore, expression of a putative phosphatase-dead Tensin3 also inhibited migration to the same degree, indicating that the effect is independent of a phosphatase activity in the protein. In addition, Tensin3 also markedly reduced invasion of these cells into a basement membrane matrix. Moreover, we observed the opposite effect, i.e increased cell migration, using siRNA to knock down endogenous Tensin3 in human cancer cells. These results demonstrate that Tensin3 stabilizes cells and prevents their uncontrolled migration under normal conditions. However, loss of Tensin3, as occurs in e.g. RCC and other cancers, may underlie the increased cell motility in cancer cells and their propensity to subsequently metastasize, as has been alluded to previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Katz1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, any putative PTEN-like phosphatase activity in Tensin3 is not necessary for this potential anti-metastatic capacity of Tensin3. We have previously characterized the function of Tensin2 in kidney cells and found Tensin2 to suppress the Akt signaling pathway as well as inhibit cell proliferation, survival and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Hafizi2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, Tensin1 null cells have also been shown to exhibit impaired migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Chen2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, it is therefore likely that the cell motility modifying capacity of all Tensin family members is a common feature relying on their integrin/cytoskeletal interactions. In contrast, Akt pathway suppression may be unique amongst those members of the Tensin family that may have a lipid phosphatase activity, ie potentially only Tensins -2 and -3, and may be linked to cell survival and proliferation.</p><p>Much still remains to be uncovered as to the range of functions various tumor suppressors play. Understanding the biological characteristics of individual tumor suppressors and their relation to specific diseases will certainly provide new avenues in the future for screening, diagnosis and treatment. Studies on Tensins so far including the present one indicate that the Tensins represent a unique family of intracellular proteins that are able to link the extracellular matrix, via integrins and cell surface receptors, to the cytoskeleton and thereby control cytoskeletal organization and consequent migratory capacity of cells. This feature may be necessary for maintenance of normal cell architecture, and when disrupted, for example after long-term stimulation by growth factors, would result in cellular instability and greater motility. The ensuing cell behavior would thus be expected to favor the metastatic process.</p><p>We have shown that the expression of all Tensins is downregulated inRCC, and therefore analyzing gene expression and/or subcellular localization of one or more of the Tensins could be useful complements for diagnostic and prognostic estimations. The present study further suggests the potential value of therapies aimed at potentiating or upregulating the Tensins as an anti-metastatic strategy. This is already a prospect with existing agents under trial, such as the cancer chemopreventative polyphenol resveratrol, which was shown to markedly upregulate Tensin1 in different cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004350-Rodrigue1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004350.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Anti-Tensin3 antibody.
