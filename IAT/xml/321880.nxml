The entire nucleotide sequence of the three mRNAs has been determined from the cDNA clones and is presented together with the deduced amino acid sequence of the encoded polypeptides. Two of the three polypeptide sequences are 96% homologous whilst the third sequence is highly diverged, with only a 72% homology. The three tadpole alpha-globin genes are all similarly diverged from the two X. laevis adult alpha-globin genes with which they display approximately 50% homology. Analysis of several independent clones from each class of tadpole alpha-globin sequence reveals a very high degree of coding region polymorphism for each of the three corresponding genes. Using the cloned DNA sequences as hybridisation probes, we have analysed the expression of the corresponding genes during larval development. We show that all three genes are activated simultaneously early in development and that thereafter all three are expressed at an approximately equivalent level. A fourth tadpole alpha-globin mRNA sequence, for which we do not have a cDNA clone, accumulates co-ordinately with the three major mRNA sequences but to a much lower concentration. This pattern of gene expression differs significantly from that of the tadpole beta-globin genes of X. laevis, despite the two classes of genes being closely linked in the genome.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0020-a" xlink:role="5415"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0021-a" xlink:role="5416"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0012.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5407"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0013.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5408"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5409"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5410"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0016.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5411"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0017.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5412"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0018.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5413"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0019.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5414"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0020.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5415"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0021.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5416"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0022.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5417"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0023.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5418"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0024.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5419"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0025.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5420"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00309-0026.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5421"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
