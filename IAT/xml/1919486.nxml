Vertebrates contain both SMUG1 and UNG, but their distinct roles in base excision repair (BER) of deaminated cytosine (U:G) are still not fully defined. Here we have examined the ability of human SMUG1 and UNG2 (nuclear UNG) to initiate and coordinate repair of U:G mismatches. When expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells, human UNG2 initiates complete repair of deaminated cytosine, while SMUG1 inhibits cell proliferation. <italic>In vitro</italic>, we show that SMUG1 binds tightly to AP-sites and inhibits AP-site cleavage by AP-endonucleases. Furthermore, a specific motif important for the AP-site product binding has been identified. Mutations in this motif increase catalytic turnover due to reduced product binding. In contrast, the highly efficient UNG2 lacks product-binding capacity and stimulates AP-site cleavage by APE1, facilitating the two first steps in BER. In summary, this work reveals that SMUG1 and UNG2 coordinate the initial steps of BER by distinct mechanisms. UNG2 is apparently adapted to rapid and highly coordinated repair of uracil (U:G and U:A) in replicating DNA, while the less efficient SMUG1 may be more important in repair of deaminated cytosine (U:G) in non-replicating chromatin.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Uracil is a common base lesion in DNA and is introduced into the genome by deamination of cytosine and misincorporation of dUMP instead of dTMP during replication. Spontaneous deamination of cytosine has been estimated to occur at a rate of 60&#x02013;500 events per day in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). In addition, recent research has revealed that enzymatic deamination of cytosine at the Ig loci by activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID) initiates the antigen-dependent antibody diversification processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Uracil generated by deamination of cytosine is 100% miscoding, and result in C:G to T:A transition mutations if not repaired prior to replication. Misincorporated uracil is not directly miscoding, but it appears to be a critical source of spontaneously generated AP-sites (apurinic/apyrimidinic-sites) in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Uracil and some uracil analogs generated by oxidation of cytosine are excised from the genome by uracil-DNA glycosylases (UDGs). Mammalian cell nuclei contain at least four UDGs; UNG2, SMUG1, TDG and MBD4. Current evidence suggests that UNG2 (<underline>u</underline>racil-<underline>N</underline>-<underline>g</underline>lycosylase 2) and SMUG1 (<underline>s</underline>ingle-strand-selective <underline>m</underline>onofunctional <underline>U</underline>D<underline>G</underline>) are the major enzymes responsible for repair of spontaneously deaminated cytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>), while post-replicative excision of misincorporated dUMP (U:A) and excision of AID-generated uracil (U:G) are performed mainly by UNG2 alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>). Consistent with the role of UNG2 in replication associated repair, UNG2 binds PCNA and RPA, is localized to replication foci, and is cell cycle regulated with the highest levels in S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15">12&#x02013;15</xref>). Conversely, SMUG1, is not cell cycle regulated and is evenly distributed in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). SMUG1 excises uracil from DNA with a much lower efficiency than UNG2, but has broader substrate specificity. Only SMUG1 excises thymine with an oxidized methyl group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). UNG and SMUG1 belong to a superfamily that has apparently evolved from the same ancestral gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Comparison of crystal structures of human UNG and <italic>Xenopus</italic> SMUG1 has revealed that these enzymes share a common fold and that the SMUG1 active site is a mosaic of features from UNG and MUG/TDG enzyme families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>UNG is widely distributed in bacteria, eukaryotes and even some large DNA viruses, while SMUG1 has previously been reported to be present in vertebrates and insects only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Here we report the existence of bacteria that contain SMUG1 as their only identified UDG. Interestingly, identification of these bacterial SMUG1 orthologs shed new light on the origin of SMUG1 and UNG. Vertebrates contain both SMUG1 and UNG, but their distinct roles in base excision repair (BER) of deaminated cytosine are still not fully defined. We have compared the repair mechanisms of human SMUG1 (hSMUG1) and human UNG2 (hUNG2) on deaminated cytosine, <italic>in vivo</italic> by using replicating <italic>ung<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Escherichia coli</italic> cells containing AID-induced U:G lesions, and <italic>in vitro</italic> using purified enzymes (hSMUG1, hUNG2 and hAPE1) including a panel of hSMUG1 mutants. We find that only hUNG2 can complement <italic>E. coli</italic> Ung in repair of U:G mismatches, whereas hSMUG1 inhibits cell proliferation in the same system. <italic>In vitro</italic> analyses reveal that hSMUG1 and hUNG2 coordinate the initial steps of BER by distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, we characterize a specific motif in hSMUG1 that confers U:G-substrate preference and stabilizes the product AP-site binding. Finally, we propose a model for how SMUG1 and UNG2 initiate and coordinate repair of deaminated cytosine (U:G) by distinct mechanisms. This model is consistent with a role for the slow-acting SMUG1 in repair of deaminated cytosine in non-replicating chromatin, and efficient and highly coordinated repair by UNG2 of uracil (both U:G and U:A) in replicating DNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>DNA constructs and site-directed mutagenesis</title><p>To generate pAID an NcoI site flanking the ATG start codon of hAID cDNA (Image Clone: 4853069) was made by site-directed mutagenesis.

The excision rate from U:G substrate by SMUG1 was 2&#x02013;3-fold stimulated by APE1, while no stimulatory effect was observed with Uss substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). In contrast, uracil-excision by UNG2 was only weakly stimulated with both substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). This confirms our previous quantitation of APE1 stimulation of SMUG1 and UNG2 measured with U:A-containing substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), and is in accordance with previously published data on SMUG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Together with the EMSA results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B), this indicates that uracil-turnover by SMUG1 is increased by alleviation of product-binding after cleavage of the AP-site. In support of this, we observed that bacterial AP endonuclease Endo IV also stimulates SMUG1 activity and that SMUG1 does not bind to nicked AP-sites (data not shown).</p><p>Based on the different AP-site binding properties of SMUG1 and UNG2 we analysed their effects on the activity of human APE1 and bacterial ExoIII. A molar excess of hSMUG1 inhibited both hAPE1 and ExoIII activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E), indicating that SMUG1 and AP endonucleases compete for binding to AP-sites. In contrast, hUNG2 markedly stimulated the activity of hAPE1 but had no effect on ExoIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>F). Thus, SMUG1 probably binds strongly to the product until it is displaced by an AP endonuclease that cleaves the AP-site, whereas UNG2 may physically interact with APE1 to coordinate and facilitate the first and the second step in BER.</p></sec><sec><title>Single amino acid substitutions in the active site pocket of SMUG1 have moderate effect on catalytic activity</title><p>We have previously characterized substrate specificities and kinetic constants of human SMUG1 and UNG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).

H268 in hUNG is believed to have a critical function in stabilization of the transition state intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), and accordingly the hUNG-H268L mutant displayed only 0.32% activity compared with WT. Interestingly, the equivalent mutation in hSMUG1 (H239L) retained 28.6% residual activity. To rule out a possible contribution to activity from contaminating UNG, we analysed the H268L mutant in the presence of the specific UNG inhibitor Ugi. Ugi did not have any inhibitory effect on activity, demonstrating that the hSMUG1-H268L mutant was not contaminated by UNG (data not shown). Mutation of the asparagine (hSMUG1-N85A) proposed to coordinate the active water molecule in SMUG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) resulted in 3% residual activity, whereas mutation of the corresponding residue in hUNG (D145N) reduced the activity to 0.04% compared with WT.</p><p>In UNG, Tyr147 blocks the entrance of thymine to the active site pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). SMUG1 has glycine in the corresponding position, explaining its ability to accept uracil with hydrophilic substitutions at C5 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and B). Substitution of this glycine with the much larger tyrosine (SMUG1-G87Y) resulted in a catalytically dead enzyme, suggesting a side-chain orientation of this residue that completely blocks entrance of all substrates to the binding pocket. However, except from this latter substitution, corresponding active-site mutations have generally less effect on SMUG1 activity than on UNG activity, when measured on a U:A substrate.</p><p>To quantify residual activity of the hSMUG1 mutants towards U:G, we used a multiple turnover oligonucletide assay (see &#x0201c;Materials and Methods&#x0201d; section) with a 50-fold molar excess of U:G substrate. Interestingly, the residual activities of the mutants were even higher when analyzed with U:G substrate as compared with U:A substrate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). To minimize the effect of product binding, the SMUG1 mutants were also analysed using equimolar amounts of enzyme and oligonucleotides with uracil in either U:G, U:A or Uss contexts. Under these conditions, the U:G preference of the SMUG1 mutants was even more pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). A stable enzyme-substrate complex with a long residence time will increase the possibility for catalysis to occur, thus these results indicate that SMUG1 binds U:G substrate (not only AP:G product) with higher affinity than U:A and Uss substrates. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Uracil-substrate preference of SMUG1 active-site mutants.

This structural architecture suggests a more invasive interaction with dsDNA than observed for UNG, and the wedge motif apparently also contacts base pairs adjacent to the flipped out lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). Thus, we examined to what extent the nature of these bases influences the catalytic activity SMUG1 and UNG2.

Thus, different UNG and SMUG1 family members may either have a large hydrophilic (Arg) or a large hydrophobic side chain (Leu or Ile) or surprisingly even a small side chain (Ala) as the residue expelling uracil. <table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Activity and AP-site inhibition of SMUG1 mutated in the distal strand interacting motif</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">hSMUG1 mutant</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Activity (% of WT)</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">AP-site inhibition (%)</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">U:A</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">U:G</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">AP:A</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">AP:G</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">WT</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">67 &#x000b1; 3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">70 &#x000b1; 1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R243A<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF2"><sup>a</sup></xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">94 &#x000b1; 2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">94 &#x000b1; 10</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">59 &#x000b1; 2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">47 &#x000b1; 2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R243L</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 &#x000b1; 1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 &#x000b1; 2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Not determined</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Not determined</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">N244A</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">77 &#x000b1; 5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">139 &#x000b1; 8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">72 &#x000b1; 2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">76 &#x000b1; 1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">P245A<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF2"><sup>a</sup></xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">82 &#x000b1; 6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">227 &#x000b1; 7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">65 &#x000b1; 2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">47 &#x000b1; 1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Q246A</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">98 &#x000b1; 7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">168 &#x000b1; 22</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">67 &#x000b1; 1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">68 &#x000b1; 1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">N248A</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">127 &#x000b1; 3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">268 &#x000b1; 13</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">60 &#x000b1; 1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">62 &#x000b1; 3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">K249A<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF2"><sup>a</sup></xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">122 &#x000b1; 6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">169 &#x000b1; 11</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">57 &#x000b1; 3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">48 &#x000b1; 1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>U:A activity and AP-site inhibition (500&#x02009;nM AP:A and 62.5&#x02009;nM AP:G) are measured by standard UDG assays using 7.5&#x02009;nM SMUG1 and 1.8&#x02009;&#x000b5;M dUMP-containing calf thymus DNA substrate.

Whereas no direct interaction between enzyme and the bases in the distal strand was observed in the hUNG-DNA crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), the xSMUG-DNA structure indicates that the C-terminal part of the wedge in SMUG1 interacts with the distal strand. To investigate this in more detail, a series of site-specific alanine mutants were generated in the C-terminal part of the wedge motif (243-RNPQANK-249) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>E).</p><p>Strikingly, mutations in the 244-NPQANK-249 region of hSMUG1 significantly increased the U:G activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), an effect that was most pronounced for the SMUG1-P245A mutant. To investigate this phenomenon in more detail we performed kinetic analysis of SMUG-WT and SMUG1-P245A on U:G, U:A and Uss oligonucleotide substrates. The effect of mutating Pro245 to Ala turned out to be specific (7-fold increase in k<sub>cat</sub>) to U:G substrates, since no significant changes were observed using U:A and Uss substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). This strongly suggests that SMUG1-P245 is involved in making specific interactions with guanines opposite uracil-lesions probably by pushing into the base-stack opposite the lesion as suggested by Wibley and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). Thus, mutation of Pro245 most likely increases turnover by destabilizing binding to the AP:G product. Supporting this view we have previously reported that AP-sites in dsDNA, but not in ssDNA, are inhibitors of hSMUG1, and that AP-sites opposite guanine are much more potent inhibitors than AP-sites opposite adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The activities of the SMUG1 wedge mutants were therefore analysed in the presence of oligonucleotides containing AP-sites opposite adenine (AP:A) or guanine (AP:G) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). SMUG1 mutated in residues pointing towards the distal strand, SMUG1-R243A, SMUG1-P245A and SMUG1-K249A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E), were less inhibited (&#x0223c;47%) by AP:G than WT (70%), indicating a weaker binding to AP:G. As expected from the U:A activity, the wedge mutations had a less pronounced effect on the inhibition by AP:A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Michaelis&#x02013;Menten plots of SMUG1-WT and SMUG1-P245A.

Mutating this residue (SMUG1-N248A) increased both U:G and U:A activity. Inhibition by AP-sites was, however, only marginally reduced compared with wild-type.

Notably, non-vertebrates (except from sea urchin) appear to have UDGs of either the SMUG1- or the UNG-type, while vertebrates contain both. In vertebrates, SMUG1 and UNG2 have probably evolved to carry out different and specialized functions in processing of genomic uracil (and some uracil analogous) in the most appropriate way depending on uracil context, gene locus (e.g. Ig-genes), cell type, proliferative status, cell cycle phase, sub-nuclear localization and mutagenic potential of the lesion. In the present work, we have compared and characterized some of these specialized molecular functions of hSMUG1 and hUNG2 by both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, and demonstrated that they coordinate the initial steps in BER by different molecular mechanisms.</p><p>We show that hUNG2, but not hSMUG1, can repair U:G lesions in proliferating <italic>E. coli</italic> cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, hSMUG1 expression inhibits cell growth in this system. Interestingly, it was reported that hSMUG1 can functionally compensate for Ung1 in yeast cells treated with antifolate agents to increase misincorporation of uracil in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In WT cells, antifolate treatment results in S-phase arrest and cellular toxicity due to uracil excision and single-strand breaks. Antifolate-treated &#x025b5;<italic>ung1</italic> cells are, however, able to complete DNA replication, but when hSMUG1 is expressed the cells are arrested in S-phase like the WT. This indicates that SMUG1 can target misincorporated uracil in the yeast genome and generate cytotoxic AP-sites. However, complete repair of the lesion was not monitored in the yeast study. Since the authors use S-phase arrest and cellular toxicity as a measure of complementation, their results are in agreement with our results, although their conclusion is different. In conclusion, SMUG1 and UNG2 can both target uracil residues, but only UNG2 can initiate complete BER in rapidly growing cells. It cannot be excluded, however, that SMUG1 can compensate for Ung in U:A repair both in yeast and in bacteria. Furthermore, it would be interesting to find out whether SMUG1 from a prokaryote can complement Ung-deficient bacteria.</p><p>We have previously characterized the catalytic domain of hUNG in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Here we generated active site mutants of hSMUG1 and compared their activities with those of the corresponding mutants of hUNG. Interestingly, using the same standard UDG assay protocol, single active-site mutations in SMUG1 have less effect on catalytic activity than the corresponding mutations in UNG. Analysis of hSMUG1 active-site mutants has also been published by another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), and they report a more dramatic reduction in activity of several of the mutants. This is probably because they measured SMUG1 activity using a very high molar excess of enzyme (up to 670-fold) and substrate concentrations about three orders of magnitude below the K<sub>m</sub> value of hSMUG1-WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Such assay conditions will, however, mainly reflect substrate affinity and not catalytic turnover, because the substrate is the limiting factor. By using a high substrate concentration (1.8&#x02009;&#x000b5;M), we here focused on catalytic turnover and less on substrate affinity. The relatively high residual uracil-excision activity (measured with molar excess of substrate) in the SMUG1 active-site mutants, especially against U:G substrates, may in part be explained by the specific helix-inserting motif that probably is important for binding to dsDNA substrate and product. When SMUG1 is bound to the substrate, the DNA substrate itself may be important to drive the reaction forward by so-called &#x02018;substrate autocatalysis&#x02019;. For glycosylases in the UDG superfamily, it has been reported that the substrate itself is a major contributor to lowering of the activation energy, thus explaining residual activity in mutants lacking catalytic key residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). This &#x02018;substrate autocatalysis&#x02019; phenomena may also explain the discrepancy between residual activity of SMUG1 active-site mutants measured at very low substrate concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) and those presented here measured at high substrate concentrations.</p><p>Interestingly, one of the active-site SMUG1 mutants was, however, catalytically dead. Introducing a UNG like thymine expulsion residue in SMUG1 (SMUG1-G87Y) abolished the activity completely. The superimposed structures of xSMUG1 and hUNG reveal that the thymine expulsion loops do not follow the same path, bringing the side-chains of SMUG1-G87Y and UNG-Y147 in different orientation in the substrate binding pockets of the enzymes. Additionally, in SMUG1 this residue is sandwiched between two prolines that restrict conformational flexibility in this loop segment. Thus, a large-residue in this position will most likely block the entrance of the substrate in the active site pocket of SMUG1.</p><p>We find that hSMUG1 binds to product AP-sites in dsDNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, with the strongest binding to AP:G, while no product binding was observed for UNG2. The growth-inhibitory effect of SMUG1 in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells containing U:G lesions is most likely explained by this product binding. SMUG1 attached to AP-sites may probably interfere with replication, and thereby prevent cell division, a situation that is especially prominent when SMUG1 is over-expressed. Under these circumstances, the endogenous level of AP-endonuclease activity is likely insufficient to alleviate the product binding and replication is blocked. In support of this, we find that SMUG1 inhibits activity of both the human APE1 and the bacterial ExoIII AP-endonucleases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). Thus, a high level of SMUG1 likely interferes with the downstream processing of the AP-sites and prevents complete repair. This is in agreement with the observation that expression of hSMUG1 in &#x00394;<italic>ung1</italic> yeast cells did not suppress the spontaneous mutator phenotype, but rather caused an increased mutation frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>It is well known that APE1 stimulates the excision activity of many DNA glycosylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42 B43 B44">42&#x02013;44</xref>). However, stimulation of APE1 by a DNA-glycosylase has to our knowledge not previously been reported. Here we find that UNG2 stimulates the cleavage activity of APE1, indicating that UNG2 may physically interact with APE1. In support of this, we have previously isolated UNG2-associated complexes containing all factors required for complete BER of uracil, including APE1, from human cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>).</p><p>We have examined whether sequence context of the substrate influenced on uracil-excision activity of SMUG1 and UNG2. Surprisingly, the nature of the bases flanking the uracil had only impact on uracil-excision activity of SMUG1 and not of UNG2, measured on the same double-stranded oligonucleotide substrates. The latter was rather unexpected since sequence preference of UNG from several sources [a truncated form of UNG purified from calf thymus, <italic>E. coli</italic> Ung and the catalytic domain of human UNG (UNG&#x00394;84)] has previously been demonstrated in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) and by others (herpes simplex virus UDG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). However, all these enzymes lack the regulatory N-terminal sequence. In the present study we have analysed the full-length human UNG2 enzyme in presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which has a strong stimulatory effect particularly on UNG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). It is possible that the N-terminal domain of UNG2 diminishes the sequence specificity observed for the truncated forms of UNG in order to obtain the most efficient repair of uracil in all contexts at the replication fork.</p><p>Taken together, it is clear that SMUG1 and UNG2 have evolved distinct mechanisms for the coordination of the second step in BER. Based on previous results and the new data presented here, we propose a model for how SMUG1 and UNG2 initiates and coordinates repair of deaminated cytosine (U:G) by distinct &#x02018;hand-over&#x02019; mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). This model is consistent with a role for SMUG1 in repair of deaminated cytosine in non-replicating chromatin and repair of uracil (U:G and U:A) by UNG2 in replication foci. The catalytically highly efficient and context-independent UNG2 enzyme is probably important in rapidly dividing cells to remove deaminated cytosine in front of the moving replication fork (pre-replicative repair), in addition to post-replicative repair of misincorporated uracil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). This pre-replicative repair of U:G by UNG2 is supported by the observed 5.2-fold increased mutation frequency in Ung-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), mostly G:C to A:T transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). SMUG1, on the other hand, is not designed to rapidly repair uracil during replication, and is probably more important in non-replicating chromatin, outside S-phase and in resting cells where the level of UNG2 is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). However, SMUG1 counteracts mutations also in cycling mouse cells (MEFs). Knocking down Smug1 by siRNA in MEFs resulted in 2.4-fold increased mutation frequency at the HPRT locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Thus, the slow-acting, product-binding SMUG1 may efficiently recognize deaminated and some oxidized cytosine derivatives in non-replicating dsDNA (especially in A-T rich regions where the cytosine deamination rate is expected to be higher due to increased DNA breathing), excise the lesion and remain attached to the cytotoxic AP-site product until APE1 arrives and initiates further repair. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Repair of deaminated cytosine; model illustrating distinct coordination of BER initiated by SMUG1 and UNG2 in non-replicating chromatin and in replicating chromatin (foci), respectively.

The catalysis is not very efficient because the active site is relaxed to be able to bind several other lesions. SMUG1 stays bound to the AP-site after excision. 3.

Uracil is released by efficient hydrolysis of the <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond. Note, UNG2 interacts only with the uracil-containing DNA strand.
