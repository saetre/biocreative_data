A series of Rab27a-interacting proteins have been identified; however, only Munc13-4 has been found to be expressed in CTL. In this study, we screened for expression of the synaptotagmin-like proteins (Slps): Slp1/JFC1, Slp2-a/exophilin4, Slp3-a, Slp4/granuphilin, Slp5 and rabphilin in CTL. We found that both Slp1 and Slp2-a are expressed in CTL. Isoforms of Slp2-a in CTL showed variation of the linker region but conserved the C2A and C2B and Slp homology (SHD) domains. Both Slp1 and Slp2-a interact with Rab27a in CTL, and Slp2-a, but not Slp1, is rapidly degraded when Rab27a is absent. Slp2-a contains PEST-like sequences within its linker region, which render it susceptible to degradation. Both Slp1 and Slp2-a localize predominantly to the plasma membrane of both human and mouse CTLs, and we show that Slp2-a can focus tightly at the immunological synapse formed with a target cell. Individual knockouts of either Slp2-a or Slp1 fail to impair CTL-mediated killing of targets; however, overexpression of a dominant-negative construct consisting of the SHD of Slp2-a, which is 56% identical to that of Slp1, reduces target cell death, suggesting that both Slp1 and Slp2-a contribute to secretory lysosome exocytosis from CTL. These results suggest that both Slp1 and Slp2-a may form part of a docking complex, capturing secretory lysosomes at the immunological synapse.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CTL</kwd><kwd>immunological synapse</kwd><kwd>Rab27a</kwd><kwd>secretory lysosome</kwd><kwd>Slp2-a</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) cells use polarized secretion of lysosomal organelles to destroy virally infected and tumorigenic cells.

Rab27a also plays a key role in secretory lysosome secretion in a number of cell types with secretory lysosomes or related organelles including melanocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">(7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8)</xref>, neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">(9)</xref> and pancreatic beta cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">(10)</xref>. In each of these cell types, Rab27a mediates secretion by interacting with different effector proteins: in melanocytes, Rab27a mediates transfer of lysosome-related melanosomes from the plus ends of microtubules to the actin cytoskeleton by interactions with Slac2-a/melanophilin and myosin Va (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Rab27a also mediates anchoring of melanosomes to the plasma membrane through interaction with synaptotagmin-like protein (Slp)2-a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">(12)</xref>. In neutrophils, Rab27a interacts with Slp1/JFC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">(9)</xref>, and in pancreatic alpha and beta cells, Rab27a interacts with Slp2-a/exophilin4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">(13)</xref> and Slp4/granuphilin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">(14)</xref>, respectively. These interactions are thought to promote the targeting of the granules towards the plasma membrane, possibly by mediating docking.</p><p>A family of six different Rab27a-binding Slps have been identified, all of which contain an N-terminal Slp homology domain (SHD), which binds Rab27a in a GTP-dependent manner, a central linker region and two C2 domains capable of binding to phospholipid membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">(15)</xref>. In this paper, we ask whether Slp proteins are expressed in CTL. We find expression of Slp1 and Slp2-a, both of which bind to Rab27a in CTL. Slp2-a is readily degraded because of the presence of PEST-like sequences, and in the absence of Rab27a, Slp2-a protein levels are also reduced. Slp2-a associates with the plasma membrane and focuses at the immunological synapse formed between CTL and target. Expression of dominant-negative Slp2-a, lacking the C2 domains, reduces CTL-mediated killing. These results suggest that Slp2-a may form part of the docking complex, which tethers secretory lysosomes to the plasma membrane as they reach the immunological synapse.</p><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Slp1 and novel isoforms of Slp2-a are expressed in CTL</title><p>Cell lysates from human and mouse CTLs were screened for expression of Slps by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). Antibodies against Slp1 SHD revealed bands in both human and mouse CTLs lysates.

Because no alternative splice form of Slp1 has been reported and complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning from CTL produced only the reported isoform, it is possible that the upper bands may correspond to either a post-translationally modified form of Slp1 or a cross-reactive protein. A faint upper band and the lower band marked with an asterisk are non-specific. Antibodies against either Slp2-a SHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A</xref>) or linker region (not shown) revealed single strong bands of 97 kDa in human and 100 kDa in mouse CTL lysates.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Expression of Slp1 and Slp2-a in CTL</title><p>A) Western blots showing mouse and human CTL lysates probed for expression of Slp1-5 and rabphilin (Rph).

We found two splice forms of Slp2-a in CTL derived from C57BL/6 mice. The first form is the previously described 2S-II isoform (accession number: AB057761), which lacks 16 amino acids (539&#x02013;554) from the linker region of Slp2-a. The second form, which combines the deletions seen in the 2S-II and 2S-III isoforms previously described (accession numbers: AB057761 and AB057762), lacks both the 2S-II site (amino acids 539&#x02013;554) and the 2S-III site (amino acids 587&#x02013;626) from the linker region of Slp2-a.

Each of these domains was examined for the presence of PEST-like sequences [containing the amino acids proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S) and threonine (T)]. A bioinformatic search of the SHD, linker and C2 domains of murine Slp2-a identified 14 different PEST-like clusters, with 1 in the SHD, 11 in the linker and 2 in the C2B domain. In order to test whether Slp2-a showed increased susceptibility to degradation, T7-tagged Slp1-5 proteins were expressed in COS-7 cells and cell lysates were prepared in the absence of protease inhibitors and incubated at 25&#x000b0;C for 30 min with or without 100 ng/mL of trypsin before immunoblotting and probing with antibodies against T7 tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4B</xref>). Slp1 and Slp3-a showed no decrease in the intensity of the protein band in the presence of trypsin, while Slp4-a and Slp5 showed a modest reduction.

Both calpastatin peptide and calpain inhibitor III are able to prevent the calcium-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4C</xref>). These results demonstrate that Slp2-a might be degraded endogenously in response to calcium-dependent calpains, suggesting that rapid degradation may provide a way for regulating Slp2-a activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Slp1 and Slp2-a are localized on the plasma membrane and can focus at the immunological synapse</title><p>Antibodies raised against Slp1 and Slp2-a are unable to detect endogenous protein in CTL by immunofluorescence.

Loss of Rab27a prevents secretion from both melanocytes and CTL leading to Griscelli syndrome with albinism and immunodeficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">(4)</xref>. In melanocytes, the series of protein interactions leading to melanosome secretion is well understood, with Rab27a on the melanosomes interacting with Slac2-a/melanophilin that in turn enables a tripartite complex to form with myosin Va, which can transfer the melanosomes from the microtubule to the actin cytoskeleton (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Rab27a, Slac2-a/melanophilin and myosin Va are all required for melanosome secretion, but neither Slac2-a/melanophilin nor myosin Va is required for secretion from CTL.</p><p>Not only do the proteins involved in mediating secretion differ between CTL and melanocytes but also the mechanics of secretion differ. Melanosomes move from a pericentriolar localization towards the periphery in a plus-end direction on microtubules, where they are captured onto the cortical actin cytoskeleton by myosin Va <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">(11)</xref>. Secretion from CTL is almost the reverse of this, with the centrosome of the MTOC moving to the point of secretion at the immunological synapse and the lytic granules moving in a minus-end direction towards the MTOC and the site of secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">(2)</xref>. The actin cytoskeleton is cleared away from the point of secretion, and the granules appear to be delivered to the plasma membrane directly from microtubules. Although Rab27a is required for both melanosome and lytic granule secretion, it has become clear that Rab27a is interacting with different effector proteins in order to accomplish this.</p><p>Eleven Rab27a-interacting proteins have been identified in mouse and man <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">(25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26)</xref>. Ten of these are Slps (Slp1/JFC1, Slp2-a/exophilin4, Slp3-a, Slp4/granuphilin, Slp5, rabphilin, Slac2-a/melanophilin, Slac2-b, Slac2-c/MyRIP and Noc2) containing SHD-Rab27a-binding domains. The eleventh is Munc13-4, which contains a novel Rab27a-binding domain distinct from the SHD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">(23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27)</xref>. Munc13-4 is required for granule exocytosis from CTL, and granules in CTL deficient in Munc13-4 are found docked, but unable to fuse, at the plasma membrane in the immunological synapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">(6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28)</xref>. Munc13-4 is thought to act as a priming protein for SNAREs by analogy to the neuronal protein Munc13-1, which is thought to hold t-SNAREs in an open conformation and act as a priming factor for membrane fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">(29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30)</xref>, although the details of its role are yet to be fully defined (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>).</p><p>Both Munc13-4 and Rab27a have been localized to the lytic granules, and it is not clear how the granules are passed to the plasma membrane prior to docking and secretion.

The same expression pattern is found in human natural killer cells (data not shown). Cloning cDNAs from CTL, we found that the different splice forms generated from the 19 exons conserved the SHD and C2 domains but showed a novel pattern of deletion within the linker region, the function of which remains unknown. We found a similar picture in cDNA cloned from human CTL where we identified multiple splice variants within the region encoding the linker region, but in each case, the SHD and C2 domains were present. Only a single isoform of Slp1 has been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">(33)</xref>, and cDNA cloning from both mouse and human CTLs identified only this isoform. Our Western blots using the anti-Slp1 SHD antibody showed only a single clear band reproducibly detected from human CTL lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3B</xref>) but three bands from mouse CTL lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8C</xref>). Because there is only one isoform detected at the cDNA level and only the 60-kDa band disappears in CTL derived from an Slp1-null mouse, it seems most likely that only the 60-kDa band represents murine Slp1. We do not know what the 58 and 62 kDa cross-reactive bands represent.</p><p>Both Slp1 and Slp2-a bind Rab27a in CTL. However, in CTL derived from mice lacking Rab27a, we noted that Slp2-a, but not Slp1, was less stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>). This loss of stability of Slp2-a, but not Slp1, in the absence of Rab27a most likely arises from the presence of multiple PEST-like sequences, which render it readily degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4</xref>). Similar PEST-like sequences have been identified in Slac2-a/melanophilin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">(18)</xref>. Studies in melanocytes suggested that this overexpression might have a functional role as overexpression of a mutant form of Slac2-a/melanophilin lacking the PEST-like sequences resulted in the increased rate of perinuclear aggregation of melanosomes. This suggested that endogenous degradation of Slac2-a/melanophilin may be important for releasing the melanosomes from the microtubule cytoskeleton to the actin cytoskeleton. These results suggest that Slp2-a is stabilized by its interaction with Rab27a and that this may have functional consequences <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Expression of Slp1 and Slp2-a in CTL showed that both localized predominantly to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7</xref>). Because these experiments were carried out with Slp2-a tagged at the N-terminus that might interfere with membrane association by the Rab27a-binding SHD, we tagged Slp2-a at both N- and C-termini to investigate membrane localization in RBL cells, which also express Rab27a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">(34)</xref>. Using a C-terminally tagged Slp2-a, the predominant membrane association remained at the plasma membrane, although a rare cell could be found with lysosomal-associated Slp2-a. In CTL, endogenous Slp2-a could not be detected by immunofluorescent labelling. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that neither endogenous Rab27a nor Munc13-4 can be detected in CTL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">(22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35)</xref> and presumably reflects a relatively low level of expression of these proteins in CTL. We therefore expressed both Slp1 and Slp2-a fused to pmaxGFP in CTL and found that both localized to the plasma membrane. Slp2-a&#x02013;GFP localized to the plasma membrane of CTL whether tagged at the N- or C-terminus, although the N-terminally tagged construct was expressed more efficiently in all cell lines tested. This might reflect membrane localization by the C2A and C2B domains, which may be hindered when pmaxGFP is fused to the carboxy terminus of the protein close to the C2 domains. Strikingly, Slp2-a focussed at the point of contact between CTL and target, within the immunological synapse, suggesting that this protein might play an important role in granule exocytosis from CTL. It is possible that Slp1 also focuses at the immune synapse, but expression of this construct in mouse CTL was inefficient, and we were unable to see transfected conjugates.</p><p>How might Slp2-a function? The membrane localization we observed in CTL for Slp1 and Slp2-a and the clustering of Slp2-a in the immunological synapse suggest that Slp1 and Slp2-a may act as part of a docking complex which, by interaction with Rab27a on the lytic granules, might serve to capture the granules as they reach the plasma membrane and dock them prior to secretion. Slp2-a is involved in mucus secretion by gastric surface mucous cells because a deficiency of granule docking and reduction of mucus secretion were observed in Slp2-a &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">(24)</xref>. In addition, Slp2-a is thought to target glucagon granules to the plasma membrane in pancreatic alpha cells because overexpression of Slp2-a containing mutations that prevent C2A binding to phospholipid membranes inhibits evoked glucagon secretion from &#x003b1;TC1.6 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">(13)</xref>. More recently, the C2 domains of synaptotagmins have been found to be important for producing membrane curvature and have been proposed to provide a general mechanism for promoting SNARE fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">(36)</xref>. Virtually, all C2 domains from synaptotagmins tested induced membrane curvature in a calcium-dependent manner, with the exception of Slp2-a that was unaffected by calcium.</p><p>Our functional studies using knockout mice for Slp1 and Slp2-a revealed normal levels of CTL killing of target cells, suggesting that loss of either Slp1 or Slp2-a alone is insufficient to impair granule secretion from CTL. We therefore used a dominant-negative construct consisting of the SHD from Slp2-a fused to pmaxGFP expressed in CTL to ask whether killing was inhibited. We reasoned that because the SHD of Slp1 and Slp2-a are 56% identical and 73% similar in their amino acid sequences, this SHD might inhibit both. We cannot rule out that this construct also inhibits other proteins that might bind Rab27a or other proteins involved in secretion by a similar SHD. However, to date, the SHD has only been identified in the Slps, and we have only detected expression of Slp1 and Slp2-a in CTL. It seems likely that there are other components to this complex as the SHD only gives a partial reduction in target cell killing, but which proteins these are remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Anti-Slp2-a SHD immunoglobulin G production</title><p>Recombinant glutathione S-transferase-tagged human Slp2-a SHD (corresponding to amino acids 1&#x02013;99 of Slp2-a) was expressed in the DH5&#x003b1;<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain, harvested, purified and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter.

About 2&#x02013;4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> murine CTLs after two, three or four rounds of stimulation and 1&#x02013;3 days post stimulation were nucleofected with 10 &#x003bc;g of DNA using an Amaxa nucleofector II, programme X-001 and the mouse T cell nucleofection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. About 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> murine CTLs, stimulated four times after isolation from spleen, were transfected with 10 &#x003bc;g Slp2-a constructs. The Slp2-a dominant-negative construct consisted of DNA encoding the first 100 amino acids of mouse Slp2-a fused to pmaxGFP at the carboxy terminus of Slp2-a. After 4.5 h, live cells were sorted to collect green cells (at fluorescence channel 1 (FL1) log &#x0003e;10<sup>1</sup>). Sorted cells were then used immediately to perform a killing assay using the Cytotox 96 assay (Promega) using P815 cells as targets.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Miguel Seabra for spleens from Rab27a&#x02013;GFP transgenic mice and Winnie Lui-Roberts and Jim Kaufman for critical reading of the manuscript.
