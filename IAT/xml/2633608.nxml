In this study we ascertain the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of SR-A in the recognition of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> MC58 (serogroup B) in a murine model of meningococcal septicaemia. We infected wild-type and SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals intraperitoneally with <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> MC58 and monitored their health over a period of 50 hours. We also determined the levels of bacteraemia in the blood and spleen, and measured levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). The health of SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals deteriorated more rapidly, and they showed a 33&#x00025; reduction in survival compared to wild-type animals. SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals consistently exhibited higher levels of bacteraemia and increased levels of IL-6, compared to wild-type animals. Subsequently, we constructed a bacterial mutant (MC58-278-1220) lacking two of the SR-A ligands, NMB0278 and NMB1220. Mutation of NMB0667 proved to be lethal. When mice were infected with the mutant bacteria MC58-278-1220, no significant differences could be observed in the health, survival, bacteraemia, and cytokine production between wild-type and SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals. Overall, mutant bacteria appeared to cause less severe symptoms of septicaemia, and a competitive index assay showed that higher levels of wild-type bacteria were recovered when animals were infected with a 1&#x02236;1 ratio of wild-type MC58 and mutant MC58-278-1220 bacteria. These data represent the first report of the protective role of SR-A, a macrophage-restricted, non-opsonic receptor, in meningococcal septicaemia <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the importance of the recognition of bacterial protein ligands, rather than lipopolysaccharide.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Macrophages are innate immune cells that provide a first defence against infection. Several receptors on the surface of macrophages mediate recognition of invading pathogens, and one of these is the Macrophage Scavenger Receptor A (SR-A). SR-A recognises <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, a bacterium that causes meningitis and septic shock, via proteins on the surface of the bacterium. In this study we investigated the interaction of SR-A with <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> in a mouse model for septic shock, by infecting mice with <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and comparing a mouse strain expressing SR-A with one that does not. The health of mice not expressing SR-A deteriorated more rapidly and fewer animals survived compared to those expressing SR-A. Mice lacking SR-A had higher numbers of bacteria in their blood and also produced more cytokines that can cause septic shock. We also infected mice with bacteria that did not express two of the proteins recognised by SR-A. In this case, no differences in survival, levels of bacteria, or cytokines were detected between animals that expressed SR-A and those that did not. Therefore, we show that the macrophage receptor SR-A is protective in the development of septic shock induced by <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The innate immune system is a first line of defence against invading pathogens and macrophages play an integral role in the innate immune defence against bacterial infection. This is based on the recognition of conserved microbial structures, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), by a range of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Macrophages (M&#x003d5;) express different classes of innate PRRs with diverse functions, including the phagocytic Scavenger receptors (SRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Plddemann1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. One of the receptors belonging to this family is the class A scavenger receptor (SR-A), which has been shown to recognise a range of polyanionic molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Krieger1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. SR-A is a trimeric type II transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of a cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, spacer region, &#x003b1;-helical coiled coil domain, collagenous domain and C-terminal cysteine-rich domain. SR-A expression is mostly restricted to macrophages and is not found on polymorphonuclear neutrophils or monocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Hughes1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, the expression of SR-A was shown on mast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Brown1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and specific sub-populations of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC) and splenic DC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Becker1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Selected endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells within atherosclerotic plaques also express SR-A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Naito1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The Scavenger receptors play an important role in microbial recognition and clearance, and SR-A has been shown to bind both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Peiser1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Hampton and colleagues first proposed that SR-A might be involved in antimicrobial host defence, based on their observation that SR-A could bind lipid A, an integral part of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Hampton1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Subsequent studies showed that SR-A also recognises the Gram-positive cell-wall component lipoteichoic acid (LTA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Greenberg1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, SR-A binds to different LTA structures with varying specificity depending on their exposed negative surface charge. Unmethylated bacterial CpG DNA, another major immunostimulatory microbial product, is also recognised by SR-A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Zhu1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Using a range of Gram-positive organisms, Dunne and co-workers confirmed that both soluble and cell-associated forms of SR-A are not only able to bind bacterial components, but can also recognise intact live organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Dunne1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. SR-A has been shown to play a role in both infection and inflammation. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies with three Gram-positive organisms have shown that SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are more susceptible to infection. SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals exhibited deficient clearance of bacteria from the liver and spleen in experimental <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also showed increased susceptibility to <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Thomas1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Arredouani1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. A possible anti-inflammatory host-protective role of SR-A was proposed by Haworth et al., who observed that SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice formed normal granulomas in response to BCG (Bacille Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin) priming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Haworth1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. However, these animals were more susceptible to endotoxic shock as a result of increased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in response to additional lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. In addition, SR-A has been shown to modulate chemokine levels in specific acute inflammatory conditions to ensure an inflammatory response of the appropriate magnitude <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Cotena1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p><italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> is a Gram-negative obligate commensal bacterium that colonises the human nasopharynx, however when the bacterium crosses this barrier, it causes meningitis and rapid septicaemia, particularly in young children and teenagers. We have shown previously that uptake of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> by macrophages is mediated almost exclusively via SR-A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Peiser2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, experiments employing an <italic>N. meningitidis lpxA</italic> mutant revealed that recognition of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> by SR-A was independent of lipopolysaccharide, and we identified three bacterial surface protein ligands for SR-A, namely NMB0278, NMB0667 and NMB1220 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Peiser3">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study we investigated the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of SR-A in inflammation in a murine meningococcal septicaemia model. We also ascertained the contribution of the identified surface protein ligands by constructing bacterial mutants in the SR-A ligands and examining the effects of a double mutant <italic>in vivo</italic>. We show that SR-A knock-out mice are more susceptible to septicaemia induced by <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> than wild-type mice, and that for double knock-out bacteria lacking two SR-A ligands, these effects are abrogated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Chemicals and Reagents</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were from Sigma (Poole, United Kingdom).

The neisserial surface protein ligands were NMB0278, NMB0667 and NMB1220.

NMB1220 belongs to the stomatin/Mec-2 protein family, which are oligomeric lipid raft-associated integral proteins that regulate the function of ion channels and transporters. We constructed deletion mutants in <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> MC58 for all three proteins, respectively, and also generated a double mutant lacking NMB0278 and NMB1220. We employed several approaches to delete NMB0667, however this mutation proved lethal, which may be linked to the possible role of NMB0667 in septum formation during cell division. All the mutant strains showed no deficiency in growth characteristics or LPS and protein profile. Through PCR analysis, we showed that the genes encoding these proteins are present in a wide variety of neisserial strains, including invasive disease and carriage strains. Closely related homologues are also present in other bacteria, making them ideal PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) and targets for PRRs. It should however be noted that since the genes encoding these proteins are also present in non-pathogenic bacteria and commensal strains, the term &#x0201c;PAMPs&#x0201d;, though commonly used in this context, could be considered a misnomer.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> uptake of the mutant bacteria by bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild-type and SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals did not show any differences when compared to wild-type bacteria. This could be attributed to the fact that at least one other SR-A ligand, NMB0667, was present, along with two NMB0278 homologues, which could mediate recognition and uptake. Therefore, we studied the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of SR-A in a murine model for meningococcal septicaemia. We injected <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> MC58 into wild-type C57BL/6J and corresponding SR-A<sup>&#x02212;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;</sup> mice and monitored the manifestation of symptoms of septicaemia (ruffled fur, sticky eyes), as well as the survival of the animals. The health of SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals consistently deteriorated more rapidly and there was a 33&#x00025; difference in survival when compared to wild-type animals. Analysis of blood samples taken at 20 h post-infection and at termination showed that SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals had higher levels of bacteraemia and the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6. Induction of IL-6 is commonly associated with meningococcal septicaemia in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000297-Prins1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Although not statistically significant, spleen samples also indicated higher bacteraemia for SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals, and splenic sections revealed infiltration of activated macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils. Therefore, in this model, SR-A played an important role in clearance of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> MC58. This is the first report of the <italic>in vivo</italic> importance of SR-A in a model using a Gram-negative pathogenic organism.</p><p>Subsequently, we injected the mutant bacteria lacking both NMB0278 and NMB1220 at the same dose i.p. into wild-type and SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and monitored them as before. Interestingly, the differences observed between the mouse strains when infecting with wild-type bacteria were abrogated for mutant bacteria lacking the two SR-A ligands, and overall less severe symptoms were observed. Furthermore, the levels of bacteraemia and IL-6 between wild-type and SR-A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals did not differ significantly. Therefore the surface proteins NMB0278 and NMB1220 are at least partially implicated in the SR-A-mediated effects observed for wild-type bacteria. We previously showed that NMB0278 and NMB1220 are also Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, and that SR-A was required for full activation of TLR pathways (Pl&#x000fc;ddemann et al. JII, in press). Although SR-A ligation does not directly mediate cytokine induction, the overall lower cytokine levels in animals infected with mutant bacteria could be linked to the absence of NMB0278 and NMB1220. The competitive index assay confirmed that mutant bacteria were cleared more readily, proving that this observation was not due to inter-experimental variations. These data indicate a role for SR-A in clearance of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and development of symptoms of septicaemia. Thus far, the development and progression of septicaemia has mainly been linked to LPS, however these data indicate an additional role of neisserial surface protein recognition in this process.</p><p>It is clear that the i.p. mouse challenge model described here does not represent the natural pathogenesis of neisserial disease, however it does model the overwhelming septicaemia that is characteristic of invasive meningococcal disease. Since SR-A is not expressed on polymorphonuclear neutrophils, our results signify an important role for macrophages and SR-A in the development and progression of meningococcal septicaemia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank S.
