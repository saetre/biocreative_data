We have recently demonstrated the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) protein in human placenta and its localization in villous cytotrophoblast (CT), vascular pericytes, and amniotic fibroblasts. In vitro, E2 stimulated development of large syncytiotrophoblast (ST) aggregates. In the present study we utilized ER-beta affinity purified polyclonal (N19:sc6820) and ER-alpha monoclonal (clone h-151) antibodies. Western blot analysis revealed a single ~52 kDa ER-beta band in chorionic villi (CV) protein extracts. In CV, strong cytoplasmic ER-beta immunoreactivity was confined to ST. Dual color immunohistochemistry revealed asymmetric segregation of ER-alpha in dividing villous CT cells. Prior to separation, the cell nuclei more distant from ST exhibited high ER-alpha, while cell nuclei associated with ST showed diminution of ER-alpha and appearance of ER-beta. In trophoblast cultures, development of ST aggregates was associated with diminution of ER-alpha and appearance of ER-beta immunoreactivity. ER-beta was also detected in endothelial cells, amniotic epithelial cells and fibroblasts, extravillous trophoblast (nuclear and cytoplasmic) and decidual cells (cytoplasmic only). In addition, CFK-E12 (E12) and CWK-F12 (F12) monoclonal antibodies, which recognize ~64 kDa ER-beta with hormone binding domain, showed nuclear-specific reactivity with villous ST, extravillous trophoblast, and amniotic epithelium and fibroblasts. Western blot analysis indicated abundant expression of a ~64 kDa ER-beta variant in trophoblast cultures, significantly higher when compared to the chorionic villi and freshly isolated trophoblast cell protein extracts. This is the first report on ER-beta expression in human placenta and cultured trophoblast. Our data indicate that during trophoblast differentiation, the ER-alpha is associated with a less, and ER-beta with the more differentiated state. Enhanced expression of ~64 kDa ER-beta variant in trophoblast cultures suggests a unique role of ER-beta hormone binding domain in the regulation of trophoblast differentiation. Our data also indicate that asymmetric segregation of ER-alpha may play a role in asymmetric division of estrogen-dependent cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Estrogens affect a variety of tissues, including reproductive tissues, bone, liver, cardiovascular system and brain.

Yet, forms of the estradiol receptor of differing stability have been detected in human placental tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

ER&#x003b1; immunoreactivity was confined to villous and cultured cytotrophoblast (CT) cells but not syncytiotrophoblast (ST). We also localized ER&#x003b1; immunoreactivity in villous vascular pericytes and extravillous (amniotic) fibroblasts but not in villous endothelial cells, amniotic epithelium, extravillous trophoblast (EVT) or decidual cells. In tissue culture, E2 stimulated trophoblast differentiation into syncytial aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To our knowledge, no attempt has been so far made to study placental expression of ER beta (ER&#x003b2;).</p><p>Although it was first believed that estrogen receptors were predominantly cytoplasmic, it was later proposed that they are located exclusively within the nucleus. It is now clear that these receptors can be found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, with the ratio dependent upon the cell type and physiological conditions. Some studies also indicate that estrogen receptors reside on the plasma membrane and modulate cellular activity without directly associating with DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Human ER&#x003b2; is encoded by 477 amino acids (~52 kDa) and has substantial homology to ER&#x003b1; (66 kDa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although both estrogen receptors (ERs) can be expressed in various estrogen-sensitive tissues and cells, evidence is accumulating that their expression varies during cellular proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It appears quite clear today that ER&#x003b2; has biological roles that are distinct from those of ER&#x003b1;, and certain results indicate that ER&#x003b2; can have effects opposite to those of the ER&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Although some in vitro studies suggest both ERs may play redundant roles, a dissimilar tissue distribution indicates otherwise. ER&#x003b1; (&#x003b1;ERKO) and ER&#x003b2; knockout (&#x003b2;ERKO) female mice possess a normally developed reproductive tract and maintain expression of the opposite ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The &#x003b1;ERKO female is infertile and exhibits a hypoplastic uterus that is refractory to estrogens. The ovaries of the &#x003b1;ERKO female are consistently polycystic and lack evidence of spontaneous ovulation. In contrast, the &#x003b2;ERKO female exhibits a hormonally responsive uterus and grossly normal ovaries, but is subfertile in terms of the frequency and size of litters. Double ER knockout (DERKO) mice are infertile, possess the expected reproductive tract structures, but exhibit a remarkably distinct ovarian phenotype characterized by postnatal loss of oocytes and redifferentiation of the remaining somatic cells to Sertolilike cells. This "sexreversal" in the DERKO ovary is accompanied by the ectopic expression of testisspecific genes (reviewed in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]).</p><p>A recent study of &#x003b2;ERKO mice has shown that ER&#x003b2; is not required for the normal prepubertal development of the mammary gland but for organization and adhesion of epithelial cells during pregnancy and hence for differentiated tissue morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These observations indicate a possibility of complementary (sequential) roles of ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2;, since ER&#x003b1; appears to be required for the basic development of estrogen sensitive tissues and ER&#x003b2; seems to be required for their functional maturation.</p><p>Besides the ~52 kDa ER&#x003b2;, additional related forms have been identified at the RNA level, often denoted as "ER&#x003b2; B". They would generate ~56, 61 and 63 kDa ER&#x003b2; proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Recently developed monoclonal antibodies made to the human ER&#x003b2; hormone binding domain have been shown to identify ~52 kDa and an additional ~62&#x02013;64 kDa band in protein extracts from granulosa cells of several mammalian species. Immunohistochemical studies with these antibodies revealed nuclear-specific localization of the ER&#x003b2; protein in granulosa cells of the rat ovary and in epithelial and some stromal cells of mouse and rat epididymis. Epitope mapping studies indicated that the E12 and F12 antibodies recognize overlapping peptide sequences in the C-terminal region of the hormone-binding domain, a region that is highly conserved among species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Villous CT cells are a type of stem cell which divides during pregnancy including the term placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, if the division is symmetric, i.e., resulting in two identical cells, both cells should either proliferate or differentiate. The former situation might result in placental site trophoblastic tumor or choriocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], the latter in the loss of the ability of the villous trophoblast to proliferate. However, ten years ago, biologists began to gain insight into the cellular mechanisms by which a cell divides into two cells of different developmental potentials, a process known as asymmetric division. Asymmetric division is a fundamental means of generating cell diversity and may involve extrinsic or intrinsic factors. With extrinsic factors, daughter cells are equivalent after separation but adopt different fates due to their interactions with the environment. With intrinsic factors, unequal amounts of cell-fate determinants are distributed into the two cells prior to their separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Among the intrinsic factors underlying asymmetric division, the interactions of the Numb differentiation-associated protein with Notch proliferation-associated signaling is the model most widely studied, ranging from bacteria, yeast, and Drosophila to mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Mammalian cells known to exhibit asymmetric division include diverse cell types such as neuronal cells, thymocytes, and satellite cells involved in myogenesis, and the list is growing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The aim of present study was to investigate expression and localization of ER&#x003b2; in normal term placentae as compared to that of ER&#x003b1;. Our data indicate that virtually all cellular compartments of the human placenta express either ER&#x003b1;, ER&#x003b2;, or both. In addition, we identified asymmetric ER&#x003b1; segregation in dividing villous CT cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Tissues</title><p>Seven normal placentae from deliveries between 36 and 38 weeks of pregnancy were investigated.

Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by a DABNi detection kit according to the supplier's manual (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), giving the substrate dark blue color. This contrasted with the brown color resulting from the first sequence of immunoreagents (Thy-1 immunostaining). The slides were dehydrated and mounted, without hematoxylin counterstain. A control procedure consisted of dual color immunohistochemistry as above, but both primary antibodies were replaced with PBS.</p><p>Since the diaminobenzidine reaction product masks the antigen and catalytic sites of the first sequence of immunoreagents and thus prevents interaction with the reagents of the second sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], a possibility of co-expression in the same cell types has been investigated.

In normal placentae, the expression of cyclin E (cE), which is involved in the stimulation of cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], was low, as was that of p27 (cE antagonist) promoting terminal differentiation of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] (lane 5, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>). This is in agreement with occasional trophoblast proliferation in normal term placentae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], apparently not prevented by high p27 expression. In early cultures, expression of both proteins increased significantly (lane 1, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>; see also panel B for quantitative evaluation). During culture, initially high expression of cE significantly decreased at 45 and 70 hours, and remained low at 94 hours. However, moderate expression of p27 in early cultures significantly increased at 45 hours and remained extremely high till the end of the culture. These trends were observed in all cultures from normal placentae investigated. Such observations indicate that the p27 antiproliferative effect may play an important role in the prevention of cultured trophoblast proliferation and, therefore, promote an overall tendency of cultured trophoblast cells toward terminal differentiation (see also Discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study showing placental ER&#x003b2; protein expression by western blot analysis and ER&#x003b2; immunoreactivity in placental cell types. We also show a comparison of placental ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; protein expression and cellular localization. Our observations indicate that various cellular components of human placenta express either ER&#x003b1; or ER&#x003b2;. Furthermore, we show in vivo and in vitro that ER&#x003b1;+/ER&#x003b2;- CT cells differentiate into ER&#x003b1;+/ER&#x003b2;+ young and ER&#x003b1;-/ER&#x003b2;+ mature ST aggregates.</p><p>In situ hybridization and immunolocalization of ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; in a variety of reproductive tract tissues in males and females have shown that in most instances either ER&#x003b1; or ER&#x003b2; is expressed in a particular cell type, although some cell types, e.g., Leydig cells, ovarian surface epithelium, and epithelial and stromal cells of the uterus and breast, may show expression of both ERs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, since only a proportion of cells were detected to express ER&#x003b1; or ER&#x003b2; in a single color immunohistochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], such an approach cannot demonstrate coexpression of the ERs in a particular cell, nor indicate eventual transition from one ER subtype to another during differentiation.</p><p>However, recent double color immunohistochemistry experiments indicate that the cells in the mouse proximal efferent ductule epithelium can be separated into three types with distinct expression of ERs: (1) ER&#x003b1;+/ER&#x003b2;-, (2) ER&#x003b1;+/ER&#x003b2;+ and (3) ER&#x003b1;-/ER&#x003b2;+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The authors did not provide any functional explanation of these observations. Nevertheless, our study also shows that these three types of ER expression can be detected in villous trophoblast. Moreover, our data indicate that there is a switch in ER expression from type (1) ER&#x003b1;+/ER&#x003b2;- to type (2) ER&#x003b1;+/ER&#x003b2;+ and finally to type (3) ER&#x003b1;-/ER&#x003b2;+ during trophoblast differentiation in vivo, and this observation was confirmed by the study of trophoblast differentiation in vitro.</p><p>As mentioned in the Introduction, recent studies of the functional significance of ER&#x003b2; in &#x003b2;ERKO mice show that ER&#x003b1; is sufficient for basic differentiation of estrogen-sensitive tissue. However, a lack of ER&#x003b2; results in a defect in terminally differentiated tissue morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and indicates that ER&#x003b2; expression is required for terminal differentiation of estrogen-dependent cells. Our study concurs with such observations, since we show that ER&#x003b2; expression is associated with terminal differentiation of trophoblast. Moreover, we show a switch from nuclear to cytoplasmic ER&#x003b2; expression in terminally differentiated ST and EVT. In addition, the decidual cells, which are known to exhibit degenerative changes at term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], show marked diminution of cytoplasmic ER&#x003b2;. This suggests that terminal aging and degeneration of estrogen responsive cells are accompanied by a progressive loss of ER&#x003b2; expression.</p><p>Our ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; single and dual color immunohistochemistry experiments show that daughter CT cells derived from ER&#x003b1;+ parental cells coexpress both ERs during early stages of differentiation, and lose ER&#x003b1; during their terminal differentiation into the ST. The differentiation of CT was associated with very narrow (~2 &#x003bc;m) ST, which may need complementation by additional CT cells to function. However, the parental and daughter cells showed in vivo differences in nuclear ER immunoreactivity prior to their complete separation. While the parental cell showed high nuclear ER&#x003b1;, the daughter cell associated with ST showed marked diminution of ER&#x003b1; immunoreactivity and an increase of differentiation-associated ER&#x003b2; protein.</p><p>These observations parallel recent studies that postmitotic cells may exhibit asymmetric distribution of the differentiation-associated proteins prior to their separation. Asymmetric division may involve extrinsic (influence of adjacent cells) or intrinsic factors. Among the intrinsic factors underlying asymmetric division, the interactions of the Numb differentiation-associated protein with Notch proliferation-associated signaling is the model most widely studied, ranging from bacteria, yeast, and Drosophila to mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. When the neuronal progenitor cells undergo asymmetric division (20% in neuronal tissue cell culture) they produce neuronal daughter cells to which Numb protein segregates preferentially, and such daughter cells show an enhanced differentiation of neuronal processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Interestingly, Numb is firstly associated with one pole of the plasma membrane of a dividing cell, and subsequently with one of the two resulting nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Our study indicates that preservation of nuclear ER&#x003b1; in one of two postmitotic cells is associated with the ability of CT to replicate and diminution of ER&#x003b1; and appearance of nuclear ER&#x003b2; dictates a generation of a daughter cell that is committed to differentiate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>Simplified schematic view of ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; differential expression during asymmetric division and differentiation of villous trophoblast cells in vivo (postmitotic cell surface and cytoplasmic ER&#x003b1; expression &#x02013; see ref.

However, it has to be considered that ERs are certainly not the only proteins which are involved in decisions of estrogen-dependent cells to proliferate or differentiate. At least cell cycle related proteins, either suppressors or facilitators, and growth factors and cytokines produced by stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] should be considered in addition to the promitotic effect of E2 mediated via ER&#x003b1;. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref> may not be applicable for transformed cells with abnormal ER variants, or cells exhibiting only one type of ER. For example, expression of ER&#x003b2; only may indicate that differentiation but not proliferation is estrogen-dependent.</p><p>Former studies also indicated that the decision between symmetric and asymmetric division in vivo depends on the mitotic spindle orientation. During fly neurogenesis, the neuroblasts delaminate from a monolayer of ectodermal cells. The ectodermal cells at the surface of the Drosophila embryo divide with the axes of their mitotic spindle parallel to the plane of the ectodermal monolayer. In contrast, a neuroblast divides along the apical-basal axis, so that the axes of its mitotic spindles are perpendicular to the plane of the ectodermal layer. Thus, the mitotic spindle of the neuroblast has to reorientate by 90 degrees from the plane of the ectodermal layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].The orientation of the mitotic spindle correlates with the asymmetric distribution of Numb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> shows that similar perpendicular orientation, i.e., 90 degrees from the plane of ST layer (toward the villous core), applies for asymmetrically dividing villous CT. Hence, in CV, one pole of dividing CT cells is associated with mature ST and the other with the mesenchymal villous core (stroma). It is possible to speculate that the poles of dividing CT cells are influenced differently &#x02013; the juxta-syncytial pole toward differentiation and juxta-mesenchymal toward proliferation. Therefore, the extrinsic factors (type of neighboring cells) may dictate asymmetric segregation of intrinsic factors determining the fate of dividing cells. In other words, asymmetric division in vivo may be a result of the influence of both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. If so, the extrinsic factors should be viewed as inducers and intrinsic factors as effectors of asymmetric division. Based on available data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and our observations, a possible sequence of events involved in asymmetric division of villous CT cells is given in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11A</xref>. Note an involvement of stromal (stimulation of CT division) and ST signaling (stimulation of cell differentiation). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11B</xref> indicates that symmetric division of ST may result from the presence of stromal and absence of ST signaling.</p><fig position="float" id="F11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p>Structure-related arrangement of asymmetric division (proliferation and differentiation) of villous CT cells.

Relevant references and details are given in text.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1477-7827-1-36-11"/></fig><p>However, perpendicular orientation of dividing trophoblast cells in vivo cannot be achieved in vitro, because the complex villous structure, and the villous core in particular, is absent. Although ER&#x003b1; &#x0003e; ER&#x003b2; transition was also observed during trophoblast differentiation in culture, the cultured trophoblast cells are expected to undergo symmetric division toward the differentiated phenotype rather than asymmetric division. Indeed, early cultures show proliferating CT cells, which are gradually transformed into the differentiating CT cells and syncytial aggregates during the culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], possibly due to the prevalence of differentiation signals in the absence of stromal signaling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11C</xref>). This view is supported by gradual diminution of promitotic cyclin E and an increase of antimitotic p27 proteins during trophoblast culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Finally, regarding the placenta, it is important to consider the stage of pregnancy. For early pregnancy, the scheme in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref> can possibly be extended to other cell types (decidua, EVT), in contrast to the term placenta where only villous CT cells are dividing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>We recently showed that exogenous E2 markedly stimulates development of large syncytial aggregates in trophoblast cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We also observed that this effect can be abolished with pure anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 (unpublished data). These data indicate that trophoblast differentiation is estrogen-dependent. Since trophoblast differentiation is associated with transition from ER&#x003b1; to ER&#x003b2; expression, with temporary co-expression of both, one may assume that both ERs are involved in estrogen stimulated trophoblast differentiation. Since production of placental hormones is characteristic of mature syncytium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], which shows in vivo cytoplasmic ER&#x003b2; expression only, one may also assume that estrogens stimulate production of placental hormones by ST.</p><p>Studies on localization and expression of ER&#x003b2; hormone binding domain recognized by E12 and F12 monoclonal antibodies in human placenta are of particular interest. Immunohistochemical studies with these antibodies by Choi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] revealed nuclear-specific localization of the ER&#x003b2; protein in granulosa cells of the rat ovary and in epithelial and some stromal cells of mouse and rat epididymis. Specificity of the E12 and F12 monoclonal antibodies was verified by western blot analysis using baculovirus expressed form of human ER&#x003b2; (53 kDa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These antibodies were also reported to identify an additional ~62&#x02013;64 kDa band in protein extracts from granulosa cells of several mammalian species, in addition to the ~52 kDa band [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Our observations on human placenta show that E12 and F12 antibodies exhibit nuclear-specific reactivity with placental ST. Therefore, cytoplasmic reactivity in mature ST detected by N-19 polyclonal antibody, which recognizes a single ~52 kDa band, might not be related to the ER&#x003b2; variant with a hormone binding domain. Indeed, in human trophoblast cultures, the E12 and F12 antibodies are shown to exhibit virtually no reactivity with the ~52 kDa variant and the N-19 polyclonal antibody shows no reactivity at ~64 kDa. Therefore, one may speculate that the placental ~52 kDa ER&#x003b2; variant is not necessarily a hormone binding protein. One may also assume that the placental ER&#x003b2; hormone binding variant recognized by E12 and F12 antibodies does not contain or expose epitopes which are recognized by the N-19 ER&#x003b2; polyclonal antibody which shows reactivity with trophoblast cultures. The E12 and F12 antibodies have been shown to react with baculovirus expressed ~53 kDa form of human ER&#x003b2; protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Yet, it is possible that mammalian cells naturally expressing ER&#x003b2; produce two protein variants, with and without ER&#x003b2; hormone binding domain, resulting from (post-) translational modifications of the ER&#x003b2; protein.</p><p>Interestingly, villous cytotrophoblast cells merging with syncytium showed nuclear-specific F12, but not E12 immunoreactivity. Hence, the epitope associated with the ~64 kDa ER&#x003b2; hormone binding variant recognized by E12 and F12 can be excluded, but the ~68 kDa variant recognized by F12 might be considered to be involved in early trophoblast differentiation. Since the F12 antibody also failed to recognize a distinct ~52 kDa band in human granulosa cell protein extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and the E12 antibody did not show any reactivity at ~68 kDa, one may speculate that the ~68 kDa band might be another ER&#x003b2; protein variant. Indeed, it has been indicated that it is unlikely that the E12 and F12 antibodies recognize exactly the same state of the epitope since the F12 antibody was much more efficient in immunoprecipitation of the native ER&#x003b2; protein generated in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We also show that E12 antibody identifies the ~56 kDa band in trophoblast cultures barely visible in extracts analyzed by F12 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, as compared to CV and time 0 protein extracts, trophoblast differentiation in early and late tissue cultures was associated with a more than three fold increase of the ~64 kDa ER&#x003b2; hormone binding variant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>), while the ~52 kDa protein identified by N-19 polyclonal antibody showed a tendency to decline in late cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Therefore, the ER&#x003b2; hormone binding protein appears to play a dominant role in the hormone-stimulated terminal differentiation of trophoblast, while the ~52 kDa ER&#x003b2; protein might be somehow related to the non-hormonal regulation of early stages of trophoblast differentiation (see proposed role of ER&#x003b2; in asymmetric division of estrogen-dependent cells discussed above). The importance of ER&#x003b2; hormone binding variants in stimulation of terminal trophoblast differentiation is supported by our observation on the stimulatory effect of E2 for the formation of large syncytial aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>From the above it appears that in human placenta, there are at least two ER&#x003b2; proteins: (1) the cytoplasmic and nuclear ~52 kDa ER&#x003b2; with N-terminal related epitopes recognized by N-19 polyclonal antibody and lacking a hormone binding domain recognized by the E12 and F12 antibodies, and (2) the nuclear-specific ~64 kDa ER&#x003b2; with a hormone binding domain recognized by E12 and F12 antibodies and lacking epitopes recognized by N-19 polyclonal antibody. The existence of these two distinct ER&#x003b2; proteins is particularly supported by their different expression in trophoblast cultures (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). A possibility exists that there is an additional ~68 kDa ER&#x003b2; protein, which is recognized exclusively by the F12 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>) and expressed in the nuclei of early differentiating trophoblast cells merging with ST (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our observations concur with recent views on the importance of ER&#x003b1; in the proliferation and ER&#x003b2; in the maturation of estrogen-dependent cells. Asymmetric segregation of ER&#x003b1; in dividing villous CT cells, accompanied by appearance of ER&#x003b2; in differentiating daughter cells, suggests a unique role of ERs in asymmetric division of estrogen-dependent cells. Significantly enhanced expression of the ~64 kDa ER&#x003b2; hormone binding variant in differentiating trophoblast cells and stimulation of trophoblast differentiation by estrogens indicates a unique role of the ER&#x003b2; hormone binding domain in the regulation of placental function. Since ST is a major source of placental hormones, which ensure optimal conditions for the fetus and mother, ER&#x003b2; expression by ST may be involved in stimulation of placental hormonal production by estrogens.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Supported by Physician's Medical Education and Research Foundation grant #93040, Knoxville, Tennessee, to A.B.
