Reduction of PKC-&#x003b1; activity by treatment with G&#x000f6;697-6 or by overexpression of a dominant negative (DN) mutant form decreased &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene expression. This decrease required a sequence element in the collagen promoter that contains Sp1/Sp3 binding sites. Reduction of PKC-&#x003b4; activity by rottlerin or overexpression of DN PKC-&#x003b4; also decreased &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene expression. This effect required a separate sequence element containing Sp1/Sp3-binding sites and an Ets-binding site. In both cases, point mutations within the response elements abrogated the response to PKC inhibition. Forced overexpression of Sp1 rescued the PKC inhibitor-mediated reduction in collagen protein expression. A DNA affinity precipitation assay revealed that inhibition of PKC-&#x003b4; by rottlerin increased the binding activity of endogenous Fli1 and decreased that of Ets1. On the other hand, TGF-&#x003b2;1, which increased the expression of PKC-&#x003b4;, had the opposite effect, increasing the binding activity of Ets1 and decreasing that of Fli1. Our results suggest that PKC-&#x003b4; is involved in the regulation of the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene in the presence or absence of TGF-&#x003b2;. Alteration of the balance of Ets1 and Fli1 may be a novel mechanism regulating &#x003b1;2(I) collagen expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Systemic sclerosis or scleroderma is an acquired disorder which typically results in fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. Although the pathogenesis of this disease is still unclear, it includes inflammation, autoimmune attack and vascular damage, leading to the activation of fibroblasts and disturbed interactions with different components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Thus, abnormal scleroderma fibroblasts which are responsible for fibrosis may develop from a subset of cells that have escaped from normal control mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). However, despite recent advances in understanding the regulation of collagen gene expression, the mechanisms responsible for the pathologic increase in the expression of collagen genes in scleroderma have not been elucidated.</p><p>Fibroblasts from affected scleroderma skin cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> produce excessive amounts of various collagens, mainly type I and type III collagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), and display increased transcription of the corresponding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Many of the characteristics of scleroderma fibroblasts resemble those of normal fibroblasts stimulated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), suggesting that the activation of dermal fibroblasts in scleroderma may be a result of stimulation by TGF-&#x003b2; signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Thus, the inhibition of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling is thought to be one of the most reliable approaches to the treatment of scleroderma, and there have been several reports that such an inhibition can decrease collagen expression <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>Jimenez <italic>et al</italic>. recently demonstrated that the inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC)-&#x003b4; by a specific inhibitor of PKC-&#x003b4; rottlerin or by the overexpression of the dominant negative mutant form (DN) of PKC-&#x003b4; suppressed the expression of the &#x003b1;I(I) and &#x003b1;I(III) collagen genes in both normal and scleroderma dermal fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic>, without affecting the expression of other genes examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Furthermore, they showed that scleroderma cells display higher levels of immunoreactive PKC-&#x003b4; protein using immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting. Their results indicate that PKC-&#x003b4; may be involved in the regulation of collagen genes in normal and scleroderma fibroblasts, and suggest that the inhibition of this signaling pathway may be another therapeutic approach for this disease. However, the mechanisms by which collagen gene expression is regulated by PKCs in human dermal fibroblasts remain unclear.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms regulating the expression of the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene by PKCs in normal dermal fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic>, and analyzed the association between PKCs and stimulation with TGF-&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Calphostin C, rottlerin and G&#x000f6;6976 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA).

As shown in Supplementary Figure 1A and B, two polypeptides, corresponding to the two chains of type I procollagen, were detected in the conditioned medium and cell lysates. It has been already shown that the altered ratio of the &#x003b1;1(I) to &#x003b1;2(I) chain is attributed to the difference in the immunoreactivity of anti-type I collagen antibody to the &#x003b1;1(I) and &#x003b1;2(I) chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). PKC inhibitors both decreased the secretion of type I procollagen into conditioned medium and reduced the deposition of type I procollagen in the cell lysates. To note, rottlerin had the greatest inhibitory effect (over 80% reduction), which was consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), whereas G&#x000f6;6976 decreased the levels of type I procollagen modestly (almost 50% reduction). These results suggest that PKCs are involved in the basal expression of type I procollagen in dermal fibroblasts.</p><p>To determine whether the reduction of type I procollagen protein expression by these reagents was correlated with the corresponding mRNA levels, human dermal fibroblasts were incubated in the presence or absence of these inhibitors under the same conditions, and mRNA expression was analyzed by northern blotting. The &#x003b1;2(I) collagen mRNA level was significantly reduced after the stimulation with these reagents in comparison with the control level (Supplementary Figure 1C). However, the expression of GAPDH mRNA was not affected by these inhibitors, demonstrating that the indicated concentration of these inhibitors did not have generalized toxic effects. Thus, the effect of these inhibitors on the type I procollagen protein level paralleled that on the mRNA level.</p><p>The steady-state level of mRNA can be affected by the level of gene transcription and/or the stability of mRNA. To establish whether the decrease in &#x003b1;2(I) collagen mRNA levels after the treatment with PKC inhibitors takes place at the transcriptional level or the posttranscriptional level, we wished to determine whether these reagents decreased the stability of the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen mRNA. Following the inhibition of transcription by the addition of actinomycin D, the loss of &#x003b1;2(I) collagen mRNA treated by the inhibitors was not significantly different from that observed in the untreated cells (Supplementary Figure 1D). The failure of these inhibitors to decrease the half-life of &#x003b1;2(I) collagen mRNA suggests that &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene expression is regulated at the level of transcription by these inhibitors.</p><p>To confirm this, we determined the effects of these reagents on the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter activity in dermal fibroblasts by conducting transient transfection assays using the full-length COL1A2/CAT construct. &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter activity was reduced by treatment with these inhibitors for 24 h to the same extent as the level of protein or mRNA (Supplementary Figure 1E). These results suggest that the basal activity of PKC is essential to maintain the basal transcriptional activity of the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene.</p><p>Several investigators doubt the specificity of G&#x000f6;6976 and rottlerin toward PKC-&#x003b1; and -&#x003b4;, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Thus, we examined the effects of DN PKC-&#x003b1; or -&#x003b4; on the expression of type I procollagen protein. The overexpression of these constructs also reduced the expression of type I procollagen protein in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure 1F), whereas DN PKC-&#x003b5; had no effect, although HA-recombinant proteins were expressed at similar levels. These results confirm that basal type I procollagen protein or &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene expression in normal fibroblasts is regulated by at least two signaling pathways, PKC-&#x003b1; and PKC-&#x003b4;.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional analysis of the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter by PKCs in normal fibroblasts</title><p>To identify potential regulatory elements of the human &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene by G&#x000f6;6976 or DN PKC-&#x003b1;, we performed transient transfection assays using a series of 5&#x02032;-deletions of the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene. Basal promoter activities of these constructs have been well examined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>).</p><p>The bp &#x02212;148&#x0223c;+58 construct and the longer constructs responded to G&#x000f6;6976 or DN PKC-&#x003b1;, but the subsequent bp &#x02212;108&#x0223c;+58 construct showed little reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). On the other hand, the overexpression of WT PKC-&#x003b1; did not affect any of these deletion constructs. The results indicate that the PKC-&#x003b1; inhibitor-response element is located between bp &#x02212;148 and &#x02212;108 in the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter, and that the signaling activity of PKC-&#x003b1; is saturated in normal dermal fibroblasts.</p><p>This region contains the TCCTCC motif, which can function as SBS in the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) as well as integrin &#x003b1;v promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). To determine whether this motif contributed to the PKC-&#x003b1;-mediated promoter activity, the effects of substitution mutations in the TCCTCC motif were investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter constructs carrying substitution mutations between bp &#x02212;128 and &#x02212;123 were unresponsive to G&#x000f6;6976 treatment or co-transfection with DN PKC-&#x003b1;. None of the other substitution mutations in this promoter affected the effects of G&#x000f6;6976 or DN PKC-&#x003b1;.</p><p>To further elucidate whether the TCCTCC sequence from the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter mediated the effects of G&#x000f6;6976 or DN PKC-&#x003b1; using a heterologous promoter, three copies of the 12 bp oligonucleotide (from bp 131 to 120) containing the TCCTCC motif were cloned in both orientations into the pBL-CAT5 vector carrying thymidine kinase gene promoter elements. The vector construct pBL-CAT5 alone was not affected by PKC-&#x003b1; inhibitors, whereas the insertion of &#x02018;TCC&#x02019; oligonucleotides consistently resulted in a modest reduction in promoter activity by the inhibitors, independent of orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which is similar to the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). These results suggest that PKC-&#x003b1; mediates the basal &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene expression through the TCCTCC motif specifically in dermal fibroblasts.</p><p>Next, we examined the potential regulatory elements of the human &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene by rottlerin or DN PKC-&#x003b4;. Transient transfection assays using a series of 5&#x02032;-deletions of the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter revealed that the bp &#x02212;353&#x0223c;+58 construct and the longer constructs responded to rottlerin or DN PKC-&#x003b4;, but these inhibitors did not affect the promoter activity of the subsequent bp &#x02212;264&#x0223c;+58 construct, indicating the PKC-&#x003b4;-inhibitor-response element is located between bp &#x02212;353 and &#x02212;264 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). On the other hand, unlike WT PKC-&#x003b1;, the overexpression of WT PKC-&#x003b4;-induced promoter activity, and their response element was also located between bp &#x02212;353 and &#x02212;264 in the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter. This result confirms the PKC-&#x003b4; responsive element, and indicates that the signaling activity of PKC-&#x003b4; is not saturated in normal dermal fibroblasts.</p><p>This PKC-&#x003b4; responsive element contains the EBS and three GC-boxes, which can function as the SBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Thus, the effects of substitution mutations at these binding sites were investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Mutating all three SBS resulted in a significant reduction in reactivity to rottlerin, DN or WT PKC-&#x003b4;, while mutating the EBS had a significant but weaker effect on the responsiveness. Mutating both the EBS and the SBS resulted in a complete abolishment of their effects. Mutating SBE did not affect the reactivity. Thus, the integrity of both the SBS and the EBS are thought to be critical for PKC-&#x003b4;-mediated basal &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription factors involved in the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene's down-regulation by PKC inhibitors in normal fibroblasts</title><p>Our results suggest that G&#x000f6;6976 or DN PKC-&#x003b1; down-regulates the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene expression via the SBS, whereas rottlerin or DN PKC-&#x003b4; reduces it via the SBS and EBS. To further investigate the involvement of Sp1/3 in the effects of PKC inhibitors, we determined whether the amount of Sp1 or Sp3 was affected by PKC inhibitors. Immunoblotting revealed that the expression levels of these transcription factors in cell lysates were not altered by the treatment with G&#x000f6;6976 or rottlerin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Additionally, the phosphorylated levels of Sp1 were also unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, we determined whether forced overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 could recover the PKC inhibitor-mediated reduction in type I procollagen protein. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with PKC inhibitors, and 72 h later the medium was collected. Immunoblotting revealed that transient transfection of Sp1 itself did not increase the expression of type I procollagen protein, but recovered the reduction by G&#x000f6;6976 or rottlerin in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In particular, the effect of G&#x000f6;6976 was completely recovered by Sp1 overexpression. The overexpression of Sp3 did not have such effects on type I procollagen protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These results confirm that Sp1 mediates the suppressive effects of PKC inhibitors without altering the expression or phosphorylation, and that PKC-&#x003b1; mediates basal collagen gene expression mainly via Sp1.</p><p>Next, we examined how the Ets family was correlated with the PKC-&#x003b4;-mediated basal &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene expression. In previous reports, both Ets1 and Fli1 were found to bind to the EBS between bp &#x02212;285 and &#x02212;282 of the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter in a electrophoretic mobility shift assay using nuclear extracts from normal dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, Ets1 and Fli1 had opposite effects on the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene expression: Fli1 inhibited the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter activity by competing with Ets1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Immunoblotting revealed that the amount of Ets1 in cell lysates was reduced and that of Fli1 was increased after the stimulation with rottlerin compared with the levels in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This indicated that rottlerin reduces Ets1 expression which has a positive effect on &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter activity, and induces expression of Fli1 which has a suppressive effect.</p><p>Additionally, to determine the binding activities of Ets1 and Fli1, we performed a DNA affinity precipitation assay using the COL-EBS oligo, containing the EBS and the SBS of the &#x003b1;2(I) promoter. As a negative control, we used the COL-EBS-M oligo, which has a mutated EBS of COL-EBS oligo. The results showed that only the COL-EBS oligo bound endogenous Fli1 strongly after rottlerin treatment for 3 h, whereas the binding of Ets1 to the EBS was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). EBS-M oligo did not bind Ets1 or Fli1 even after the treatment with rottlerin. To note, the binding activity of Sp1 was unchanged by rottlerin in both EBS oligo and EBS-M oligo, however, it was decreased in EBS-M oligo. These results suggest that Ets1 or Fli1 binds to this site in a specific manner, and that the balance of Ets1 and Fli1 binding to the promoter by rottlerin mediates the suppression of &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter activity.</p><p>On the other hand, levels of threonine- or serine-phosphorylated Ets1 or Fli1 were unchanged by rottlerin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The effect of exogenous TGF-&#x003b2;1 on PKC signaling in normal fibroblasts</title><p>As shown above, the signaling activity of PKC-&#x003b4; is not saturated in normal dermal fibroblasts. The balance of Ets1 and Fli1 mediated by the PKC-&#x003b4; signaling pathway may be a novel mechanism regulating the basal &#x003b1;2(I) collagen expression. Thus, we determined whether PKC-&#x003b4; or the balance of Ets1 and Fli1 is involved in the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene's up-regulation by exogenous stimuli, TGF-&#x003b2;1, as well as the basal expression.</p><p>First, to examine the expression levels of PKC-&#x003b1; and -&#x003b4; protein in the presence or absence of TGF-&#x003b2;1, we performed an immunoblot analysis using anti-PKC-&#x003b1; or -&#x003b4; antibodies. Consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>), TGF-&#x003b2;1 increased the expression of PKC-&#x003b4; in dermal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, PKC-&#x003b1; expression was not significantly affected by TGF-&#x003b2;1.</p><p>It is generally accepted that inactive PKC isoforms are located in the nucleus or cytoplasm, and translocated to the plasma membrane and/or cytoskeleton after activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Immunofluorescent labeling revealed that the stimulation of dermal fibroblasts with TGF-&#x003b2; increased the size of each cell. Only PKC-&#x003b4; was translocated to the plasma membrane and cytoskeleton in TGF-&#x003b2;1-treated dermal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results indicate that PKC-&#x003b4; expression is up-regulated and PKC-&#x003b4; is activated by the treatment with TGF-&#x003b2;1.</p><p>As mentioned above, the overexpression of WT PKC-&#x003b4; increased the promoter activity in dermal fibroblasts, which is abolished by mutating both EBS and SBS between bp &#x02212;353 and &#x02212;264 of the promoter. Thus, we speculated that TGF-&#x003b2;1 affects the SBS and EBS via the PKC-&#x003b4; signaling pathway. Because the SBS, the so-called GC-box, has been reported to be one of the TGF-&#x003b2;-response elements in the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), we then wished to confirm the involvement of the balance of Ets1 and Fli1 on EBS in the TGF-&#x003b2;1 signaling pathway. Thus, we determined the binding activities of Ets1 and Fli1, by conducting DNA affinity precipitation assays using the COL-EBS oligo. In fact, the addition of TGF-&#x003b2;1 increased the binding of Ets1 to the EBS and decreased that of Fli1 in normal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), although TGF-&#x003b2;1 was reported not to change Ets1 protein expression and to suppress Fli1 protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). These results indicate that the balance of Ets1 and Fli1 may also be involved in the TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated up-regulation as well as rottlerin-mediated down-regulation of the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The PKC family of proteins is composed of at least 10 isozymes with diverse functions that are involved in numerous important cellular processes, mediating the specific activation of a variety of transcription factors, including AP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>) and NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). However, no previous reports have discussed the association between PKC and Sp1 or Ets family transcription factors.</p><p>Previously, G&#x000f6;6976 was shown to have little or no effect on the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen mRNA expression or promoter activity in renal mesangial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). However, there was a large difference in the dose of this reagent between our study and theirs. The expression of GAPDH mRNA was not affected in our study, indicating that the inhibitory effect of G&#x000f6;6976 was not due to a generalized toxic effect. Furthermore, we confirmed the involvement of PKC-&#x003b1; in the regulation of &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene expression by the overexpression of DN PKC-&#x003b1;. Our results suggest that G&#x000f6;6976 as well as DN PKC-&#x003b1; down-regulates &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene expression via Sp1. However, G&#x000f6;6976 did not alter the total amount of Sp1 or the level of phosphorylated Sp1. Although the mechanism by which Sp1 mediates the transcriptional regulation of the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene by PKC signaling is presently unknown, it is possible that PKCs affect the interaction of Sp1 with histones or other chromatin components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Such a mechanism has recently been described for the regulation of the mouse &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter by TGF-&#x003b2;/TNF-&#x003b1;, where these cytokine treatments affected the interaction of CTF/NF1 with histone H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>).</p><p>Our study indicated that PKC-&#x003b4; mediates &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter activity via Sp1 and Ets1/Fli1 in normal fibroblasts. Synergism between Sp1 and Ets1 has been reported in parathyroid hormone-related protein promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). Moreover, Sp1 and Ets1/Fli1 cooperation is implicated in the regulation of the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Although rottlerin altered the Ets1/Fli1 ratio in the EBS of the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter, this reagent did not change the levels of phosphorylated Ets1/Fli1 or binding activity of Sp1. Because their nucleotide-recognition elements lie in relatively close proximity, there may be synergism between Sp1 and Ets1/Fli1 in the regulation of this promoter through the modification of chromatin structure. This speculation is supported by the finding that the binding activity of Sp1 to GC-box is decreased by the mutation in the EBS, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.</p><p>Deletion analysis of the human &#x003b1;2(I) promoter identified active segments mediating basal promoter activity between bp &#x02212;376 and &#x02212;108 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). Although PKC-&#x003b1;- and PKC-&#x003b4;-response elements shown by our results were included in this region, these two signaling pathways acted on separate regions of the promoter. It is known that each member of the PKC family can have independent effects on a single gene regulation. Overexpression of PKC-&#x003b1; or -&#x003b4; was reported to induce collagenase promoter activity through a 12-<italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-response element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). On the other hand, PKC-&#x003b1; and PKC-&#x003b8; are thought to have opposite effects on calcineurin-regulated retinoid X receptor transcription during T-cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). Furthermore, the response element of PKC-&#x003b1; differs from that of PKC-&#x003b8; in the MDR1 promoter in human breast carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>). A similar phenomenon may occur in the regulation of &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene expression.</p><p>We also confirmed the association between PKC-&#x003b4; and TGF-&#x003b2;1 stimulation. TGF-&#x003b2;-induced-PKC-&#x003b4; signaling affected the SBS and the Ets1/Fli1 ratio in the EBS leading to the activation of the collagen promoter. The GC-boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), the AP-1 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>) and the SBE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>) have been reported as TGF-&#x003b2;-response elements in the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen promoter, and are located between bp &#x02212;353 and &#x02212;186 in the promoter. Our results indicated that the EBS is also involved in the TGF-&#x003b2; response, which is located in the same region. We speculate that PKC-&#x003b4; translocated to the plasma membrane and/or cytoskeleton that may regulate transcription of the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene via downstream signaling cascades including Ras, Raf, MEK1/2 or ERK1/2. For example, it was recently reported that TGF-&#x003b2; activates ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase, which is implicated in transcriptional regulation by the Ets family, to enhance collagen expression in which PKC-&#x003b4; may play some role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). The balance of Ets1 and Fli1 may be a novel mechanism regulating &#x003b1;2(I) collagen expression. Taken together, our results suggest that PKC-&#x003b4; is involved in the regulation of the &#x003b1;2(I) collagen gene in the presence or absence of TGF-&#x003b2;.</p><p>Kubo <italic>et al</italic>. reported that Fli1 protein expression is consistently down-regulated in scleroderma dermal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). The up-regulation of PKC-&#x003b4; and the down-regulation of Fli1 in scleroderma may be caused by the stimulation of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling. The inhibition of PKC-&#x003b4; may be effective for the improvement of abnormal collagen overexpression. Further clarification of the role of PKC-&#x003b4; in collagen expression could provide a novel strategy for the treatment of fibrotic reactions, including those occurring in scleroderma.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_33_4_1337__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_33_4_1337__1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_33_4_1337__SUPPLEMENTARY_MATERIAL.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr Jae-Won Soh, Dr Weiqun Li, Dr Alex Toker, Dr Guntram Suske and Dr Maria Trojanowska for kindly providing the wild-type PKC-&#x003b1; and the dominant negative mutant form of PKC-&#x003b1;, -&#x003b4; and -&#x003b5;, the wild-type and the dominant negative mutant of PKC-&#x003b4; the dominant negative mutant of PKC-&#x003b5;, the expression vectors for Sp1 and Sp3, and the expression vectors for Ets1 and Fli1, respectively.</p><p>This study was supported in part by a grant for scientific research from the Japanese Ministry of Education, and by project research for progressive systemic sclerosis from the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare.
