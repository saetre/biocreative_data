The hypothesis of this study was that the lead Flex-Het, SHetA2, inhibits angiogenesis by blocking cytokine release from cancer cells. SHetA2 altered secretion of thrombospondin-4 (TSP-4), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) proteins from normal and cancerous ovarian and renal cultures. Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) expression was inhibited in cancer, but not normal cultures. Endothelial tube formation was stimulated by conditioned media from cancer but not normal cultures, and SHetA2 reduced secretion of this angiogenic activity. SHetA2 directly inhibited endothelial cell tube formation and proliferation through G1 cell cycle arrest, but not apoptosis. Recombinant TP reversed SHetA2 anti-angiogenic activity. SHetA2 inhibition of in vivo angiogenesis was observed in Caki-1 renal cancer xenografts. In conclusion, SHetA2 inhibits angiogenesis through alteration of angiogenic factor secretion by cancer cells and through direct effects on endothelial cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>Vascular endothelial growth factor</kwd><kwd>Thymidine phosphorylase</kwd><kwd>Basic fibroblast growth factor</kwd><kwd>Thrombospondin 4</kwd><kwd>Heteroarotinoid</kwd></kwd-group><contract-num rid="CA1">R01 CA106713-04</contract-num><contract-num rid="CA1">R01 CA106713-02</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="CA1">National Cancer Institute : NCI</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Ovarian and renal cancers are two of the most lethal cancers with the poor mortality linked to late stage of diagnosis and to poor response to chemotherapy and development of resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Due to the highly vascularized nature of these cancers, anti-angiogenic strategies are actively being pursued to improve the dismal patient outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Therapeutic strategies that target the neovasculature of tumors have shown modest results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Issues of these anti-angiogenesis drugs with regard to toxicity and avoiding interference with standard chemotherapy are currently under intense investigation. Therapeutic strategies that target both cancer and endothelial cells within a tumor will be effective if they can be administered in a manner that does not shut down the neovasculature before the drug can access and kill the cancer cells. Drugs that target the neovasculature without affecting the cancer cells may be able to prevent growth and metastases of the cancer, but may not be able to completely eliminate the cancer, unless the population of cancer cells has a sufficiently high apoptosis rate to completely overwhelm the proliferation rate.</p><p id="P5">Endothelial cells that form the neovasculature of tumors share many signaling pathways with cancer cells and some established anti-cancer drugs, such as taxol, have been found to have anti-angiogenesis activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Thus, in the development of new anti-cancer drugs, evaluation of potential anti-angiogenesis effects should be taken into consideration for guidance in optimizing the strategy for clinical administration in order to take advantage of any anti-angiogenic effects and take into consideration potential toxicities associated with anti-angiogenesis activity.</p><p id="P6">Heteroarotinoids (Hets) represent a novel class of small molecule drugs with promising anti-cancer activity that were originally derived from the arotinoid class of retinoids by insertion of a heteroatom into the cyclic ring of arotinoids. Arotinoids proved to be 1,000-fold more toxic than the natural retinoid, all-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid (<italic>t</italic>-RA), while the heteroatom was found to decrease the toxicity of Hets 1,000-fold back to similar levels as <italic>t</italic>-RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Through structure activity relationship studies, a series of Hets that exhibit promising in vivo anti-cancer activity were developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. A more potent class of Hets were developed by substitution of the two atom linker with a more flexible urea or thiourea linker to produce Flexible Hets (Flex-Hets). Similar to arotinoids and conventional Hets, Flex-Hets inhibited cell growth and induced differentiation, but in contrast to the parent compounds, were potent inducers of apoptosis through a mechanism independent of the retinoic acid receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The lack of receptor activation is consistent with the lack of skin irritancy and teratogenicity of Flex-Hets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Studies using matching sets of cancer cell lines and normal cells derived from the same organ (ovary, kidney and endometrium), demonstrated that normal cells are much more resistant to Flex-Het apoptosis in comparison to the corresponding cancer cell lines (Liu et al. 2008, in preparation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p id="P7">The Flex-Het containing a sulfur heteroatom, a thiourea linker and an NO<sub>2</sub> component, SHetA2 [(4-nitrophenyl) amino][2,2,4,4-tetramethylthiochroman-6-yl)amino]meth-ane-thione], was chosen as the lead based on the greatest levels of efficacy and potency of growth inhibition activity across all cell lines tested, while retaining the differential reduced effect on normal cultures. The differential effect of SHetA2 on cancer versus normal cells was associated with direct targeting of mitochondria and decrease of Bcl-2 and Bcl-<sub>xl</sub> proteins in cancer cells with little effect on normal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Promising in vivo anticancer activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] and the ability to inhibit the development of cancer in an organotypic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] prompted the acceptance of SHetA2 into the National Cancer Institute&#x02019;s RAID (Rapid Access to Intervention Development, NSC 72689) and RAPID (Rapid Access to Preventive Intervention Development) programs for preclinical development as a therapeutic and chemopreventive agent for cancer, respectively.</p><p id="P8">Microarray analysis of ovarian cancer organotypic cultures identified 44 genes to be significantly regulated by SHetA2. One of the down-regulated genes, Thymidine Phosphorylase (TP), also known as platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), is a known anti-angiogenic growth factor. The TP enzyme is involved in the nucleotide salvage pathway important for cell proliferation by converting thymidine to thymine and 2-deoxy-D-ribose-1-phosphate. The latter metabolite and subsequent metabolite 2-deoxy-D-ribose have been shown to be responsible for the angiogenic activity of TP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], while 2-deoxy-L-ribose and the TP enzyme activity inhibitor CIMU (5-chloro-6(1-imidazolylmethyl)uracil) could prevent the angiogenic stimulating activity of TP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Administration of TP was demonstrated to enhance tumor progression and to protect cells against hypoxia induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Higher levels of TP expression were observed in a variety of tumor types in comparison to surrounding normal tissues and appeared to be correlated with poor patient prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P9">Another of the SHetA2 down-regulated genes that has potential angiogenesis regulating activity was thrombospondin 4 (TSP-4). Initially, TSP-4 was not considered to be anti-angiogenic because it lacks the protein structures in TSP-1 called type 1 repeats that are responsible for the anti-angiogenesis mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. TSP-4 may be anti-angiogenic however, in that it contains the type III repeats found in TSP-1 that have recently been reported to inhibit binding of FGF-2 to endothelial cells, a process that leads to endothelial cell proliferation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].</p><p id="P10">The objective of this study was to determine if SHetA2 exhibited anti-angiogenic activity. It was hypothesized that altered expression of TP and TSP-4, in addition to the well-characterised angiogenic cytokines vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) would upset the balance of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors secreted by cancer cells resulting a net alteration in angiogenesis regulating activity. In addition, it was hypothesized that SHetA2 would directly inhibit growth and differentiation of endothelial cells, which would interfere with their ability to form and maintain vascular structures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell lines and drugs</title><p id="P11">The A2780 (Michael Birrer, National Cancer Institute) and OVCAR-3 (ATCC) ovarian cancer cell lines were maintained in RPMI media supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotic/antimycotic.

A final concentration of 1 &#x003bc;M SHetA2 or the same volume of solvent (DMSO) were then administered to nine replicate cultures for each treatment group. Media and drug were replenished on a schedule of every Monday, Wednesday and Friday for 2 weeks. One set of the treated and untreated cultures was fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin. Five micron sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) for histologic evaluation (S.L.).

Briefly in these two steps: (1) the first step was conducted to correct the non-specific binding of background for individual slide. This procedure is based on the fact that spot intensities from genes not expressed by the samples of interest constitute noise and are therefore normally distributed. The mean (<italic>S</italic><sub>0</sub>) and standard deviation (SD<sub>0</sub>) of these non-expressed genes were calculated using an iterative nonlinear curve fitting procedure and used as background parameters for normalization using the formula <italic>S</italic>&#x02019;=(<italic>S</italic>&#x02014;<italic>S</italic><sub>0</sub>)/SD<sub>0</sub>. After the first step, the normal distributed background signal for nonexpressed genes has a mean of 0 and standard deviation (SD) of 1; (2) The second step is then performed using genes significantly expressed above background (&#x0003e;3 SD above background) to correct overall variations between slides using a robust regression procedure based on the observation that the expression levels of the majority of genes do not change in compared samples. From the normalized data, a &#x0201c;reference group&#x0201d; was then establish as previously described to provide a baseline estimate of the variance derived from technical variation and biological stochastic processes present among samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].

Significant effect on tumor size was observed only in the highest treatment group at 40% reduction in tumor size. Tumors were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin.

The biological model used consisted of A2780 ovarian cancer cells grown in organotypic culture for 2 weeks with a low dose of SHetA2 (1 &#x003bc;M) or DMSO solvent control. Histological evaluation of the cultures demonstrated that both apoptosis and differentiation were induced in the treated cultures in comparison to the untreated controls exposed to solvent only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Most of the cell clumps in the treated cultures were undergoing apoptosis with some cells exhibiting nuclear characteristics of early apoptosis. A smaller fraction of the clumps in the treated cultures contained cells that exhibited more differentiated phenotypic characteristics. Microarray analysis of RNA isolated from these cultures identified a total of 44 genes that were differentially expressed between treated and untreated sample groups. Out of the 44 selected genes, 21 have known annotation information and are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. TP, which encodes a known angiogenic factor, was only expressed in untreated cells suggesting that repression of these gene by SHetA2 may lead to anti-angiogenic activity. SHetA2 repression of TSP-4 however, contradicted this theory, because it encodes an uncharacterized member for a family of TSP genes that encode anti-angiogenic proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Regulation of angiogenic cytokine expression in cancer and normal cell cultures</title><p id="P27">rtPCR analysis of RNA isolated from A2780 cultures confirmed that SHetA2 reduced expression of TP mRNA in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Down-regulation of TP protein expression also was observed in A2780 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines and the Caki-1 renal cancer cell line in time-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) manners by Western blot analysis. Consistent with the differential induction of apoptosis and upstream events observed for SHetA2 in cancer versus normal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], TP was down-regulated in cancer cell lines, but not in normal cultures of kidney tubule epithelial cells (HK-2 cell line) or primary endometrial cultures (D1) over a 24-h treatment period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Although rtPCR analysis indicated that TP was not completely eliminated by 24 h of treatment, the trend towards decreasing TP protein expression observed with time could lead to the lack of expression after 2 weeks of treatment as observed in the microarray analysis.</p><p id="P28">In contrast to the microarray results identifying TSP-4 down regulation by SHetA2, rtPCR demonstrated that TSP-4 mRNA was up-regulated by SHetA2 in a time dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). This up-regulation was confirmed by Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated protein from conditioned media collected from SHetA2-treated and control cultures of ovarian cancer (A2780 cell line) and normal immortalized ovarian cancer cells (IOSE-80) in time-dependent manners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). If TSP-4 possesses antiangiogenic activity similar to other members of the TSP family, this up-regulation would be consistent with SHetA2 exerting anti-angiogenesis activity. The differences ob- served in microarray and rtPCR results may be due to the different culture formats and incubation times evaluated. While microarray analysis is used in screening studies to identify genes involved in biological activities, the high level of artifact in this experimental format requires validation of the results. Since rtPCR is a more accurate technology considered as the gold standard for validation of microarray results, and Western blot analysis confirmed up-regulation of TSP-4, it is therefore concluded that TSP-4 expression is increased by SHetA2 treatment.</p><p id="P29">Evaluation of the effects of SHetA2 on secretion of angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors was expanded to include the well-characterized basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). rtPCR analysis demonstrated induction of bFGF mRNA expression in the A2780 ovarian cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Evaluation of altered gene expression also needed to be evaluated at the cytokine secretion level, because altered mRNA expression does not always translate linearly with altered protein secretion from cells due to multiple regulatory steps at the mRNA stability, translational, post-translational and secretion levels. SHetA2 induction of secretion of bFGF protein secretion was demonstrated by ELISA analysis of conditioned media collected from A2780 cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). This up-regulation however was only observed at concentrations greater than 5 &#x003bc;M, while microarray and angiogenesis experiments presented below were all conducted at concentrations below 5 &#x003bc;M to avoid induction of apoptosis that that occurs at higher concentrations.</p><p id="P30">Although SHetA2 induction of VEGF mRNA expression was observed in the A2780 cell line by rtPCR, ELISA of conditioned media demonstrated reduced levels of VEGF secretion after 8 h of SHetA2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). To determine if inhibition of VEGF secretion was cell line specific, a series of cancer and normal cultures were evaluated. ELISA of conditioned media demonstrated higher levels of VEGF secretion in the cancer cultures (A2780 ovarian and Caki-1 renal cancer cell lines) in comparison to the normal cultures (HK-2 normal renal tubule and D1 primary endometrial cultures). Dose-responsive inhibition of VEGF secretion was exerted by SHetA2 in all cell types evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) consistent with the proposed anti-angiogenic activity.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Differential secretion of angiogenic cytokines from cancer versus normal cells</title><p id="P31">Before Flex-Het effects on secretion of angiogenic factors from cells could be evaluated, an experimental model with multiple levels of control was needed. The approach involved conditioning media by incubation with cultured cells for 48 h. Angiogenic activity of cell secretions that accumulated in the conditioned media was quantified in the endothelial tube formation assay. In this assay, endothelial cells plated on Matrigel were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of the endothelial cell growth media to the conditioned media. The number of endothelial tube branches that formed after 16 h of incubation of triplicate cultures were counted and compared between different treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a&#x02014;c</xref>). The majority of angiogenic factors present in the media containing FBS were degraded upon incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 48 h as demonstrated by the number of endothelial tube branches formed in cultures exposed to media that was freshly removed from 4&#x000b0;C storage in comparison to media that had been incubated without cells (compare &#x0201c;Fresh&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;Inc. w/o Cells&#x0201d; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Incubation of the media with Caki-1 renal cancer cells however generated conditioned media that had similar angiogenic activitytothe fresh media(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Conditioned media from HK-2 normal cell cultures did not exert angiogenesis activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). A similar pattern of angiogenesis activity secretion from cancer and not normal cultures was observed when A2780 ovarian cancer cells and IOSE-80 ovarian normal cells were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). To avoid artifacts caused by different media formulations, identical media was used for each set of cancer and control cultures: McCoy&#x02019;s growth media for Caki-1 cancer and HK-2 normal kidney cultures, and IOSE-80 growth media for A2780 cancer and IOSE-80 normal ovarian epithelial cultures.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>SHetA2 inhibition of secretion of angiogenic cytokines and promoting activity</title><p id="P32">In evaluating the effects of SHetA2 on secretion of angiogenic factors from the epithelial cultures it is important to control for potential direct effects on endothelial cells by residual SHetA2 drug remaining in the media after conditioning. Therefore, conditioned media were compared to media that were incubated with the same drug and time frame in the absence of cells. Comparison of the -SHetA2 and +SHetA2 bars <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, demonstrates that the residual SHetA2 remaining in the media incubated without cells had no effect on the number of branches formed. The ability of Caki-1 cancer cells to restore incubated media to the level of angiogenesis activity exhibited by fresh media that was observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, was significantly reduced by SHetA2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>; two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test <italic>P</italic>=0.001). This inhibitory activity of SHetA2 on angiogenic cytokine secretion from cancer cells could be counteracted by replenishing the media with exogenous recombinant TP for both renal and ovarian cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).

A dose-responsive inhibition of endothelial vascular tube branching was caused in both cell types by SHetA2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). The EAhy.926 cells formed thicker tubules, possibly due to the fused carcinoma component of this cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). SHetA2-treated EAhy.926 tubules developed increased thickness at 1 &#x003bc;M and increasing proportions of solitary clumps of cells at 5 and 10 &#x003bc;M indicated that SHetA2 may be inhibiting endothelial cell migration. Although addition of exogenous recombinant TP to the culture media slightly decreased tubule branching in the absence of SHetA2, recombinant TP treatment was able to attenuate the SHetA2 inhibition of endothelial tubule branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Induction of endothelial cell G1 phase cell cycle arrest, but not apoptosis</title><p id="P34">Since SHetA2 is known to induce cell cycle arrest at concentrations below 5 &#x003bc;M and apoptosis at concentrations above 3 &#x003bc;M, HUVEC cells were evaluated with flow cytometry for cell cycle and apoptosis response to SHetA2 treatment.

Intracellular communication through secretion of cytokines represents the primary mechanism by which tumors recruit developing blood vessels. The inhibition of secretion of angiogenesis activity from cancer cell cultures by SHetA2 appears to be due to effects on several specific cytokines. The SHetA2 down-regulation of TP mRNA and protein was found to occur in cancer, but not normal cells and therefore may be related to the mechanism of differential induction of apoptosis. TP-catalyzed nucleotide salvage is an essential component of cellular and mitochondrial DNA replication and cell survival. TP and the 2-deoxy-D-ribose metabolite can inhibit intrinsic mitochondrial-driven apoptosis induced by hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Therefore, the TP reduction by SHetA2 may be involved in the mechanism by which this drug induced the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Although angiogenesis effects of TSP-4 have not yet been characterized, the presence of type III repeats, similar to the anti-angiogenic modules present in TSP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], suggests that TSP-4 is likely to be anti-angiogenic. Thus, SHetA2 up-regulation of TSP-4 mRNA and protein secretion is consistent anti-angiogenic activity. Although VEGF mRNA was induced twofold, by SHetA2, the ultimate outcome of treatment across all normal and cancer cell lines tested was an inhibition of VEGF protein secretion, consistent with anti-angiogenic activity. The SHetA2 up-regulation of bFGF may not be severely interfering with the net anti-angiogenic effect because it is not up-regulated until after hours of treatment and only at high concentrations that can only be briefly achieved in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>].</p><p id="P38">The process of developing and maintaining tumor blood vessels is controlled by a balance of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. Our hypothesis that the net effect of SHetA2 on this balance would be to reduce angiogenesis activity secreted from cancer cells was supported by SHetA2 reduction of angiogenesis stimulating activity in conditioned media from cancer cells. The role of TP in this net effect was supported by the partial reversal of this reduction upon addition of exogenous recombinant TP. Since TP has no known transcriptional regulatory activities, but plays a critical role in mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], the mechanism by which TP attenuates SHetA2 reduction of angiogenic secretion is most likely through interference with SHetA2 mitochondrial alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. SHetA2 regulation of the cytokines at the mRNA level, suggest that this drug may exert activities through transcriptional regulation. Preliminary data indicate that SHetA2 regulates gene expression through the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;) transcription factor pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].</p><p id="P39">The hypothesized direct effect of SHetA2 on endothelial cells was supported by the dose-dependent inhibition of endothelial tube formation in an in vitro assay. While the induction of G1 cell cycle arrest by SHetA2 on endothelial cells is likely to contribute to the mechanism of action inhibiting endothelial tube formation, it is not likely to be primarily responsible. This is because the G1 cell cycle arrest was not prevented by exogenous TP, while the endothelial tube formation was counteracted by TP. Also, the G1 arrest is induced in both cancer and normal cultures by SHetA2, while regulation of apoptosis and TP expression by SHetA2 occurs with a strong differential effect on cancer cells over normal cells. Necrosis or apoptosis are not likely to contribute to the mechanism by which SHetA2 inhibits endothelial tubule formation because only at concentrations above that used in the tubule assay are able to induce a slight increase in necrosis/apoptosis in endothelial cells.</p><p id="P40">The induction of TP expression in endothelial cells is in contrast to the down-regulation of this protein in multiple cancer cell lines. Increased TP mRNA is not observed in endothelial cells within the first 8 h of treatment indicating that it is a late responding event. The ultimate outcome on endothelial tube formation however is inhibition, and the endothelial attempt to counteract this inhibition by increased TP expression does not appear to be able to counteract SHetA2 effects in vitro or in vivo.</p><p id="P41">SHetA2 inhibition of angiogenesis in vivo was confirmed in histologic evaluation of Caki-1 renal cancer xenografts. The 40% reduction in tumor size induced by SHetA2 in this animal model (Liu et al. 2008, in preparation) was associated with alterations in blood vessels. Necrosis occurred in tumors from both untreated control and SHetA2-treated animals. The type of necrosis in the untreated controls was associated with tumor cell invasion of blood vessels causing hemorrhage, while the type of necrosis that occurred in the tumors from treated animals was associated ischemia apparently due to lack of oxygen. This hypoxia appeared to be due to interference of the blood supply through blockage of the blood vessels causing swelling of the vessels and necrosis of the tumor cells within a short distance of the blood vessels. The dose-dependent up-regulation of TP in the tumors was confirmed by Western blot analysis. A time-dependent experiment is planned to test the hypothesis that this up-regulation is a late response to hypoxia induced by SHetA2 inhibition of angiogenesis.</p><p id="P42">The results of this study demonstrated in vitro and in vivo anti-angiogenesis activity of SHetA2 through reduction of cancer cell secretion of angiogenic activity and through direct effects on endothelial cells. Reduction of the pro-angiogenic cytokines, TP and VEGF, and induction of the potential anti-angiogenic cytokine TSP-4, appear to be involved in the mechanism. The response of endothelial cells to SHetA2 anti-angiogenesis appears to involve up-regulation of TP expression in vitro and in vivo. The complexity of angiogenesis regulation by SHetA2-induced alterations in the balance of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors will require a systems biology approach to provide sufficient understanding of the angiogenesis regulation to appropriately design planned clinical trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Patience Masamha, M.S. for her training and assistance with cell cycle analysis and Jim Henthorn (Director of the Flowand Image Cytometry Laboratory at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center) for the training and advice.

H&#x00026;E stained sections (<bold>a</bold>) demonstrate hemorrhagic necrosis in tumors for the untreated control group and ischemic necrosis in the tumors from the group gavaged with 60 mg/kg/day SHetA2. The photographs of untreated tumors show the carcinoma invading the venous system and causing massive backup of blood and necrosis that is hemorrhagic. The last photo of this panel shows a dilated blood vessel in the midst of a large area of necrosis. The photographs of the treated tumors show an ischemic type necrosis with little or no blood. This is caused by the blood supply being interrupted and occurs almost totally in the treated animals. Trichrome staining in of the sections (<bold>b</bold>) shows blockage and increased disorganization of blood vessels in the treated tumors in comparison to the controls. In untreated tumors, there is a certain degree of vascular organization where blood vessels penetrate the tumor from the edge and go toward the center. In general, smaller blood vessels extend from larger vessels and travel parallel to the tumor surface. In SHetA2 treated tumors show marked vascular disorganization. There is a greater amount of necrosis in areas not nourished by vessels and many necrotic areas that have blood vessels running through. Immunohisto-chemical analysis of TP expression (<bold>c</bold>) documents up-regulation of TP expression at the end of the 30-day treatment period.

The null hypothesis (H0) is tested and considered true if gene expression in the experimental group presented as replicated residuals (deviations from averaged control group profile) is associated with the highly representative (several hundreds members) normally distributed set of residuals of gene expressions in the reference group. The significance threshold was corrected to make the appearance of false positive determinations improbable. <italic>T</italic><sub>s</sub> is the result of the Student <italic>t</italic> test for replicates</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></back></article>
