The DNA sequences of four clones containing cDNA copies of mRNAs belonging to one zein subfamily were determined. The data support the following conclusions: a) genes encoding the larger of the two zein species contain eleven instead of nine repeat units within the coding sequence of the gene; b) transcription can be terminated at either of the two polyadenlation signals and c) transcription starts 31 basepairs downstream from the first T in the TATA box. To facilitate this analysis a new method for the construction of cDNA libraries was developed. The mRNA was annealed to linearized and oligo-dT tailed pUC9 plasmid DNA, which then primed synthesis of the first strand of the cDNA. Oligo-dG tails were added to the cDNA-plasmid molecules, which were then centrifuged through an alkaline sucrose gradient. The gradient step removed small molecules and separated the two cDNAs which were formerly attached to the same double stranded plasmid molecule. An excess of oligo-dC tailed denatured pUC9 DNA was added and the DNA was renatured under conditions that favor the circularization of monomers by the oligo-dC and oligo-dG tails. The oligo-dC tail served as primer for the synthesis of the second strand of the cDNA. The library was screened by colony hybridization using 32P-labelled cDNA and DNA from genomic zein clones as probes. We obtained 20,000 clones hybridizing total cDNA starting with 1 microgram of plasmid DNA and 1 microgram of mRNA.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0234-a" xlink:role="4897"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0228.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4891"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0229.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4892"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0230.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4893"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0231.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4894"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0232.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4895"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0233.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4896"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0234.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4897"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0235.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4898"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0236.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4899"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0237.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4900"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0238.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4901"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0239.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4902"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0240.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4903"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0241.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4904"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0242.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4905"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00359-0243.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4906"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
