To investigate the relative importance of these events in the regulation of gene expression, we targeted the human &#x003b2;-globin LCR in two opposite orientations to a gene-dense region in the mouse genome containing mostly housekeeping genes. We found that each oppositely oriented LCR influenced gene expression on both sides of the integration site and over a maximum distance of 150 kilobases. A subset of genes was transcriptionally enhanced, some of which in an LCR orientation-dependent manner. The locus resides mostly at the edge of its CT and integration of the LCR in either orientation caused a more frequent positioning of the locus away from its CT. Locus association with transcription factories increased moderately, both for loci at the edge and outside of the CT. These results show that nuclear repositioning is not sufficient to increase transcription of any given gene in this region. We identified long-range interactions between the LCR and two upregulated genes and propose that LCR-gene contacts via chromatin looping determine which genes are transcriptionally enhanced.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="pgen-1000016-box001" position="float"><sec id="s1a"><title>Author summary</title><p>Regulatory DNA elements are stretches of DNA that control transcription of genes even when they are located at a distance on the same chromosome. They are often included in DNA vectors to ensure transcription of rescue genes in gene therapy approaches. It is known that upon integration in the host genome, they can influence expression of host genes surrounding the integration site, but it is not known how they do so and over what distance they can function. Here, we targeted a prototype strong regulatory DNA element, the &#x003b2;-globin Locus Control Region, to a defined position in the mouse genome and we analyzed its effect on surrounding genes. We show that the locus control region can enhance transcription of at least seven genes that may be as far as 150 kilobases away. In the presence of the locus control region, the genes occupy a different location in the nucleus in a subset of cells, which may explain how some, but not all of these genes are activated. The locus control region also physically contacts the genes it activates by formation of DNA loops. We propose that these contacts are most important for the long-range activation of gene expression by regulatory DNA elements.</p></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s2"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the main aims in the post-genomic era has been to understand how genes are regulated at the level of transcription, giving rise to cell-type specific transcriptomes. Most of our knowledge on the regulation of gene transcription is biased towards studies of a small number of atypical genes showing highly restricted expression patterns. Expression of these tissue-specific genes is often controlled by distant transcription regulatory DNA elements. The &#x003b2;-globin locus control region (LCR) is a prototype of a strong mammalian regulatory DNA element. At its endogenous position, the LCR enhances the expression of the mouse &#x003b2;-globin-like genes 25&#x02013;100 fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Epner1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

At the level of nuclear organization, LCR activity has been correlated with repositioning of loci away from their chromosome territory (CT) and towards the nuclear interior, and increased association with transcription factories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Ragoczy1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Francastel1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the relative importance of these events for the enhancement of gene transcription is currently unclear.</p><p>Remarkably little is known about the regulation of more ubiquitously expressed genes, which comprise the major part of the coding genome. High-throughput expression studies revealed that housekeeping genes often cluster in large gene-dense regions on mouse and human chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Caron1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Lercher1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Breakpoints of synteny were shown to be under-represented in these regions, suggesting that this organization is under natural selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Singer1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Gene expression seems to benefit from clustering along the linear genomic sequence. When genes are integrated at random positions in the genome, their expression is often subject to position effect variegation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Grosveld1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, reporter genes express at higher levels when integrated in active gene-dense regions, indicating the existence of domain-wide regulatory mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Gierman1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It has been suggested that gene clustering promotes the maintenance of transcriptionally competent domains of open or decondensed chromatin across the gene-dense region, with expression of individual genes being dictated by the availability of specific transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Gierman1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Sproul1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Another emerging hypothesis is that clustered genes may collectively stabilize their position at nuclear zones of increased transcriptional competence, which in turn would positively affect the expression levels of genes within the cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Lercher1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Chakalova1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The location of genes relative to several nuclear landmarks has been correlated with gene expression. For example, activation of MHCII cluster genes, epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) and Hox genes promotes a large-scale relocation of the subchromosomal regions that contain them, away from the respective CT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Volpi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Williams1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Chambeyron1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Gene-rich R-bands are more frequently associated with &#x02018;splicing speckles&#x02019; than their gene-poor counterparts, G-bands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Shopland1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, and transcriptional activity of the globin genes also correlates with increased association with speckles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Brown1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Whilst it is clear that transcription, and therefore co-transcriptional splicing, can occur both away and near splicing speckles, it appears that locus association with these structures may facilitate mRNA processing, especially in the case of intron-rich transcripts, such as COL1A1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Johnson1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Lastly, proximity to clusters of multiple active RNA polymerases (RNAP), known as transcription factories, may facilitate expression of genes that lie adjacent on the linear DNA template <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Iborra1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Pombo1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-FaroTrindade1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Osborne1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

Here, we generated transgenic mice, isolated primary tissues and analyzed in detail gene expression, chromatin structure and nuclear positioning of a gene-dense region in the absence or presence of an integrated &#x003b2;-globin LCR in opposite orientations. We found that insertion of the LCR induced a relocation of the locus away from the edge of its CT and increased the association with RNAP II factories. The latter occurred independently of the locus being positioned at the edge or outside the CT. Changes in gene expression occurred bi-directionally and as far as 150 kb from the site of LCR insertion, but were variable for individual genes, depending on the orientation of the integrated LCR. The fact that both orientations of the LCR caused a repositioning of the locus away from its CT, yet genes within the locus responded selectively to only one LCR orientation, shows that the observed repositioning is not the only factor determining the increase in transcription of the individual genes. The gene expression patterns seem incompatible with tracking or spreading mechanisms, and we demonstrate that the LCR physically interacts with the two most upregulated genes. We propose that LCR-gene contacts via chromatin looping are key to the upregulation of at least a number of genes in this gene-dense region.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Introduction of the &#x003b2;-globin LCR into a gene-dense region</title><p>In order to study the relationship between chromatin structure, nuclear organization and transcription regulation, we introduced the human &#x003b2;-globin LCR in two orientations into a region on mouse chromosome 8 that contains 18 genes within 300 kb.

For this, we performed cryo-FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization on thin cryosections), a novel technology that offers increased resolution in the z-axis (150&#x02013;200 nm) compared to standard 2D- and 3D-FISH protocols (&#x0003e;500 nm) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Branco1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

The distances between the center of each locus and the nearest CT edge were then measured. As observed previously for other actively transcribed gene clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Scheuermann1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, WT 8C3/C4 in fetal liver was already found mostly near the edge of its CT (61&#x00025; within 0.2 &#x000b5;m of the edge), and 7&#x00025; was &#x0003e;0.4 &#x000b5;m away from the edge, looping out from the CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000016-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Insertion of the LCR in either orientation caused a highly significant shift of the distribution of distances between 8C3/C4 and the CT edge towards a more external position (p&#x0003c;0.001; K-S test). The percentage of loci found looped out at &#x0003e;0.4 &#x000b5;m away from the CT increased from 7&#x00025; in wild-type to 19&#x00025; in LCR-S and 17&#x00025; in LCR-AS mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000016-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, the LCR induces relocation of 8C3/C4 away from its CT, independently of its orientation in the locus.

As the LCR is inactive in brain cells, these results suggest that the repositioning of the locus in liver cells is dependent on LCR activity.

Integration of the &#x003b2;-globin LCR had a small positive effect on the frequency of association of 8C3/C4 with RNAP II foci, increasing from 51&#x00025; to 60&#x00025; in wild-type versus LCR-S &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; fetal liver sections (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.03; Fisher's test using pooled data from two independent hybridizations). To more carefully determine the association of 8C3/C4 with factories in an unbiased fashion, we performed distance measurements between the centers of the fluorescent signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000016-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The two distance distributions differed significantly, with loci in LCR-S cells being closer to transcription factories than those in WT cells (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.003, K-S test), confirming the previous results. The largest difference observed in individual distance categories was for loci closest to a factory (&#x0003c;0.2 &#x000b5;m). In wild-type cells 15&#x00025; of the loci were scored in this category, while this percentage doubled to 29&#x00025; in LCR-S cells. To test whether these frequencies may also be explained by random, non-functional associations with RNAP II foci, we performed an in silico experiment. We used the experimental images of nuclei labeled with RNAP II and applied a computational algorithm to generate a randomly positioned locus within each nuclear section. We subsequently measured the distance to the nearest factory and found that the overall distribution of randomly positioned loci was very different from the distributions measured for the wild-type and the LCR-containing locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000016-g004">Figure 4B</xref>; p&#x0003c;0.001, K-S test), which were more frequently close to the factories. These results suggest that the measured associations between 8C3/C4 loci and transcription factories reflect functionally significant interactions that are increased in the presence of the LCR. The increased factory association may reflect the increased overall transcriptional activity of the region and/or be a consequence of the capacity of the LCR to recruit RNAP II.</p><fig id="pgen-1000016-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000016.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Effect of LCR insertion on the association of 8C3/C4 with transcription factories.</title><p>(A) Nuclear sections from WT and LCR-S fetal livers (blue) were immunolabeled with an antibody against the Ser2-phosphorylated form of RNAP II (green), hybridized to the 8C3/C4 BAC probe (red), and the association of the locus with transciption factories was scored (n&#x02265;231 loci).

Distances between 8C3/C4 and, respectively, the CT edge and RNAP II foci were measured, and RNAP II association frequencies (&#x0003c;0.2 &#x000b5;m) were scored for loci inside, outside and at the edge (&#x000b1;0.2 &#x000b5;m) of the CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000016-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).

Logistic regression analysis shows that the increased association of 8C3/C4 with RNAP II is not dependent on CT position (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.26), but solely on the presence of the LCR (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0002). Logistic regression also indicates that the apparently smaller effect of the LCR insertion for loci inside the CT is not statistically different from effects at the edge or outside the CT, although we cannot exclude that a regional effect was not observed due to the small number of loci observed in this region. Additionally, we found no correlation between distance to the CT edge and distance to transcription factories for both WT (R&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.01) and LCR-S (R&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.08) cells.

Similar observations were made when we analyzed H3K4 trimethylation across 8C3/C4, although here we noticed that increased levels of H3K4 tri-methylation corresponded with elevated expression levels at some genes (&#x02212;4, &#x0002b;4, &#x0002b;6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000016-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In general though, the minor changes observed in the presence of the LCRs in acetylation and trimethylation levels of histone H3 appeared not to be strictly related to each other or to changes in transcriptional activity. Most likely, the changes in gene expression levels (2 to 6-fold) are too subtle to be reflected by changes in histone modification patterns. To analyze whether our data were influenced by differences in histone H3 occupancy, we performed ChIP with an antibody against the C-terminus of histone H3 against a subset of sites in WT and transgenic livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000016-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Considerable differences in H3 enrichment were observed in a pattern generally opposite to the one found with the antibodies against acetylated and trimethylated H3.

Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that the LCR can act on a relatively large number of genes (at least seven) spread over at least 150 kb, causes nuclear repositioning of the targeted locus and physically contacts the most upregulated genes via chromatin looping.

We showed that introduction of the &#x003b2;-globin LCR into a gene-dense region of functionally unrelated genes caused (1) the more frequent positioning of this locus away from its CT, (2) a small but significant increase in association frequency with transcription factories, (3) no change in association frequency of the locus with splicing speckles and no change in the nuclear radial position. We also found an increase in expression levels of multiple genes surrounding the integration site. LCR-driven repositioning of the locus may facilitate increased transcriptional activity. Nevertheless, we consider it unlikely that the subset of cells in which 8C3/C4 is looped out from the CT can account for the overall increased levels of expression. Transcription also takes place at the interior of CTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Abranches1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Verschure1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Scheuermann1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Branco1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and we show here that 8C3/C4 association with transcription factories increases both for loci at the edge and outside the CT. Moreover and as discussed below, our data demonstrate that at least for some genes repositioning is not sufficient to drive increased transcriptional activity.</p><p>Transcriptional enhancement was maximally 4&#x02013;6 fold, which is modest compared to the impact the mouse LCR has at its endogenous position, where it increases &#x003b2;-major gene expression 25&#x02013;100 fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Grosveld1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. An explanation for this difference could be that more genes compete for interaction with the LCR at 8C3/C4. Furthermore, gene promoter intrinsic properties could preclude that the LCR increases their expression more efficiently. In agreement with this notion is the fact that both the mouse and human &#x003b2;-globin locus contain a second adult &#x003b2;-globin-like gene (called &#x003b2;-minor and &#x003b4;-globin, respectively) that is activated much less dramatically than their prototypic counterparts (&#x003b2;-major and &#x003b2;-globin). For example, mouse &#x003b2;-minor expression is 10-fold less than &#x003b2;-major expression and the difference between human &#x003b4;- and &#x003b2;-globin gene expression is even more pronounced.</p><p>When we integrated an oppositely oriented LCR at the same genomic position at 8C3C4, it had an identical impact on the positioning of the locus relative to these nuclear landmarks, but upregulated a partially overlapping yet different set of genes. Previously it has been shown that tissue-specific genes surrounded by housekeeping genes maintain their inactive status upon nuclear repositioning in unrelated tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Brown1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. This observation may be explained by the absence of cell-type specific transcription factors in these tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Sproul1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In another recent study, <italic>Lnp</italic>, a gene located near the <italic>Hoxd</italic> cluster, was shown to be active and not change its expression level upon looping away from its CT during ES cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Morey1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. We observed a similar phenomenon at 8C3/C4, where genes at position &#x02212;6 (<italic>Btbd14b</italic>), &#x02212;5 (<italic>Trmt1</italic>), &#x02212;3 (<italic>Nfix</italic>), &#x0002b;2 (<italic>Farsla</italic>) and &#x0002b;5 (<italic>Klf1</italic>) did not change their expression. An explanation for this may be that gene or chromatin intrinsic properties preclude the more efficient transcription of these genes. Importantly, the genes at position &#x02212;4 (<italic>Lyl1</italic>) and &#x0002b;3 (<italic>Syce2</italic>), and to a less significant extent &#x02212;7 (<italic>Ier2</italic>) increased their transcription activity, but responded to only one orientation of the LCR (as confirmed independently by Affymetrix microarray expression analysis (data not shown)). This shows that at least for these genes repositioning is not sufficient to drive their upregulation and that other mechanisms are involved.</p><p>Transcription regulation by the &#x003b2;-globin LCR has also been associated with the spreading of histone acetylation (in case of the LCR of the human growth hormone cluster) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Ho1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and of the methyltransferase MLL2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Demers1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. We find the same punctuated pattern of acetylated and lysine-4 methylated histone H3 specifically at the active promoters of 8C3/C4 before and after LCR integration and find no evidence for spreading of these marks. The data do not exclude that the LCR attracts MLL2 and subsequently spreads the methyltransferase across the locus. However, the finding that genes distant to the LCR are upregulated, while genes more proximal are not, is difficult to explain by a mechanism involving the linear spreading of any signal from the LCR. If spreading occurs, it also not clear why a gene like <italic>Syce2</italic> (&#x0002b;3) is upregulated by the LCR in one, but not the other, orientation.</p><p>Previously, we have shown that the &#x003b2;-globin LCR contacts the active genes in the &#x003b2;-globin locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Tolhuis1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Palstra1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we find such contacts being formed between the LCR and the most strongly upregulated genes, suggesting that the ectopic LCR also acts by looping. Looping is thought to result from random collisions between chromatin sites that are stabilized when proteins bound to these sites have affinity for each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Droge1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, looping could also be the outcome of the LCR tracking along the intervening chromatin fiber towards gene promoters. The latter seems less compatible with our observation that LCR-S fails to activate <italic>Syce2</italic> at position &#x0002b;3 (a gene that is upregulated by LCR-AS), while being able to upregulate the genes at position &#x0002b;4 and &#x0002b;6 further down the chromatin fiber. Spatial proximity of the LCR with active genes is thought to increase the local concentration of transcription factors and/or RNA polymerase II, which might allow for more efficient transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Droge1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-deLaat1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Productive loop formation is predicted to depend on affinities between trans-acting factors bound to the LCR and to the gene. Thus, at 8C3/C4, the genes at position &#x02212;6 (<italic>Btbd14b</italic>), &#x02212;5 (<italic>Trmt1</italic>), &#x02212;3 (<italic>Nfix</italic>), &#x0002b;2 (<italic>Farsla</italic>) and &#x0002b;5 (<italic>Klf1</italic>) that are not upregulated in the presence of an LCR would lack proteins that can interact with LCR-associated factors. This is especially surprising for gene &#x0002b;5 (<italic>Klf1</italic>), since it encodes an erythroid specific transcription factor, and therefore could be expected to bind similar trans-acting factors to the promoter as the LCR. We notice, however, that an erythroid-specific enhancer less than 1 kb upstream of the promoter acts on this gene and may compete out the LCR. Why would the productive formation of a loop be dependent on the orientation of the LCR, as was found for some, but not all, genes at 8C3/C4? The LCR encompasses more than 20 kb of DNA and is asymmetric with regard to nucleotide sequence and transcription factor binding sites. One explanation may therefore be that physical constraints intrinsic to the chromatin fiber allow one, but not the other LCR to correctly juxtapose itself relative to a given gene. Interestingly, the genes that respond to only a single LCR are always located downstream of that particular LCR. We found CTCF bound to the outer hypersensitive site 5 and we propose that CTCF-mediated loops may interfere with contacts between the LCR and some of the upstream genes.</p><p>How to interpret the looping out of 8C3/C4 from the CT particularly when it contains an integrated LCR? One possibility is that this reflects increased local decondensation of chromatin after the insertion of 5 additional (erythroid-specific) DNase I hypersensitive sites, which may result in increased mobility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Volpi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Gilbert1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Regulatory DNA elements, such as the LCR, serve as binding platforms for trans-acting factors that locally disrupt the nucleosome fiber, as revealed by DNaseI hypersensitivity, and cause decondensation of the region. Indeed, live cell imaging studies that measured the compaction of a transgene array demonstrated that decondensation was not dependent on transcription but was dictated by the binding of transcriptional activator proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Tumbar1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. A region-wide increase in accessibility may facilitate the regulation of individual genes and the simultaneous increase in mobility of the locus may promote the interaction with RNAPII foci. The collective stabilization of a decondensed chromatin state could explain why housekeeping genes tend to cluster in the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Sproul1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s5"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Gene targeting and the generation of transgenic mice</title><p>For the insertion of the human &#x003b2;-globin LCR into the mouse <italic>Rad23a</italic> gene, the <italic>ClaI</italic> Neo resistance cassette of an existing <italic>Rad23a</italic> targeting construct that removes <italic>Rad23a</italic> exon II&#x02013;VII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000016-Ng1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> was replaced by a <italic>ClaI</italic> fragment containing a PGK-Puro resistance cassette coupled to a 21.5 kb <italic>SalI-ClaI</italic> fragment containing the human &#x003b2;-globin LCR.
