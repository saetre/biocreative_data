Defects in post-squalene cholesterol biosynthesis, such as in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS, MIM 270400) or desmosterolosis (MIM 603398), disrupt the synthesis of cholesterol and cause a variety of severe developmental abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. SLOS is a complex inborn error of cholesterol biosynthesis caused by mutations of the 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysterol-&#x00394;7 reductase gene (<italic>DHCR7</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The lack of <italic>Dhcr7 </italic>expression in mouse mimics the early postnatal lethality observed in severely affected individuals (those with the condition formerly referred to as SLOS type II). The biological changes in development caused by disruption of normal cholesterol biosynthesis that result in this early postnatal lethality remain obscure. As a genetic model for understanding of the SLOS in human, mice lacking Dhcr7 provide a useful model to determine which affected tissues are critically responsible for the lethality and which ones may contribute to the morbidity.</p><p>One cause of early postnatal death in the Dhcr7 null animals appears to be associated with anoxia due to diffuse atelectasis of the late gestational lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which may cause immature formation of gas-exchange unit and subsequent respiratory insufficiency after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Therefore, lung involvement seems to be a cause of neonatal death in Dhcr7 null mouse model. However, there is still uncertainty regarding the mechanism(s) responsible for the late gestational lung hypoplasia caused by the loss of endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice. As with any biological aspect of a generalized cholesterol deficiency, the pathophysiology is likely to be complex and multi-factorial. It remains unclear whether the delayed lung maturation is caused by a developmental defect intrinsic to lung or whether it represents a systemic abnormality, especially of the central nervous system (CNS), because of impaired cholesterol homeostasis during embryogenesis. A different variety of developmental abnormalities in brain have also been noted in both human patients and, to some extent, in Dhcr7-deficient animal models. In this regard, we have also recently demonstrated that <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice can be partially rescued from neonatal death by a low level restoration of DHCR7 expression in brain, indicating that neuropathophysiology is one cause of their neonatal lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In attempting to rescue <italic>Dhcr7</italic>-deficient mice, we felt that it was necessary to consider the liver because that organ is a major source of cholesterol for most developing organs, except for brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that restoration of normal cholesterol synthesis in the liver might be able to abrogate the lethality. In the current study, we asked whether the specific reconstitution of DHCR7 expression in liver would alleviate the cholesterol deficiency and afford protection from early postnatal death in Dhcr7 null mice. Our results suggest that, although expression of DHCR7 in liver alone during development induced a significant improvement in cholesterol homeostasis in non-brain tissues and promoted lung maturation, it failed to rescue the neonatal lethality. These results provided further evidence that CNS defects caused by Dhcr7 null likely play a major role in the lethal pathogenesis of <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice, with the peripheral organs contributing the morbidity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characterization of TgDHCR7 lines</title><p>Three mice (one female and two males), referred as to TgDHCR7-1, TgDHCR7-2 and TgDHCR7-3, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), were identified as transgenic on the basis of PCR and Southern blot analyses of tail samples of genomic DNA. Multiple tissues were collected from N2 transgenic progeny from the founder mice crossed with C57Bl/6J at postnatal day (P) 10 and analyzed for transgene expression by RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Both TgDHCR7-2 and TgDHCR7-3 transgenic lines expressed human DHCR7 mRNA robustly in the postnatal livers, but not in the other tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,C</xref>) and western blotting analyses showed expression of HA-tagged protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). TgDHCR7 mRNA transcript was detected in transgenic liver at E11.5 (the earliest we could dissect liver tissue) by RT-PCR determination (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and was quantitatively ~5 fold higher than endogenous murine Dhcr7 mRNA in the transgenic liver at E16.5 as judged by real-time PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining with anti-HA antibody showed that TgDHCR7 was highly expressed in hepatocytes in liver sections, but such signal was not detectable in control liver (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Further studies therefore utilized these two lines, which were backcrossed with C57Bl/6J for 4 to 5 generations. Since no differences between either line were identified, these lines were used interchangeably.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of <italic>TgDHCR7 </italic>mice</bold>. <bold>Panel A </bold>shows a cartoon of the transgene construct used for microinjection.

However, Dhcr7 null pups also exhibit other defects that indicate other organs/systems are also disrupted by absence of normal cholesterol synthesis. A key question is therefore which of these organs (whose lack of normal development) leads to the neonatal lethality. The hypoxia and abnormal lung phenotype would suggest this could be a major defect, though it is also possible that a failure to integrate respiration at the CNS level could be equally important. In our preliminary effort to restore DHCR7 activity in the CNS, we reported a stochastic rescue of pups up to 3 weeks beyond birth, despite almost no increase in brain cholesterol, or fall in precursor sterol concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. At the same time, we had also embarked upon restoration of cholesterol synthesis in peripheral (non-brain) tissues to see if this could abrogate the lethality. We report herein the effects of restoration of cholesterol synthesis in the developing liver, an organ that can circulate lipoproteins and cholesterol at a very embryonic age.</p><p>Selective reconstitution of liver cholesterol biosynthesis resulted in significant improvement of cholesterol homeostasis in all of the tissues examined in Dhcr7 null mice with the exception of the brain, confirming the embryonic liver's ability to supply cholesterol to peripheral tissues and the inability of cholesterol in the circulation to cross the blood-brain barrier. Cholesterol was detectable in liver and lung of non-transgenic Dhcr7-null term pups at ~40% of normal levels, which represents maternal transfer of this cholesterol and confirmed previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Cholesterol levels in both liver and lungs of transgenic Dhcr7-null term pups increased to ~80% of WT level (and statistically not different from WT levels), indicating robust transgenic liver expression of DHCR7 led to adequate delivery of endogenously synthesized cholesterol to the lungs (presumably via lipoprotein-mediated transfer). The alleviation of the non-brain tissue cholesterol deficit in the transgenic Dhc7-null embryos led to improvement in the lung development, but not complete restoration of normal development.</p><p>Although our data support the conclusion that the lung defects may not be the major reason for the neonatal mortality, some caveats need to be mentioned. Despite significantly increased cholesterol in the lung, the sterol precursors were reduced by ~40% and not completely suppressed. Sterol precursors have been demonstrated to be part of plasma membranes and their presence may have significant implications in altering membrane signaling, by altering raft formation and functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In this study, membrane sterol distributions were further investigated and compared between transgenic and non-transgenic <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>lungs. Adapting an established method, lipid-rafts and non-rafts were prepared by sucrose gradient fractionation of Triton X100 extracted tissue homogenates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Bimodal profiles of cholesterol and 7/8DHC in sucrose gradient fractions were found, with first peak enriched in "raft" fractions and the second peak found in non-raft fractions. Thus, the bimodal profile may represent sterol portions distributed in lipid-raft microdomains and subcellular membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. As expected, although significant restoration of cholesterol level, a considerable amount of 7/8DHC was still accumulated in the rafts of transgenic <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/- </sup>lungs. Thus one mechanistic possibility is that raft-mediated signaling may be important for the terminal differentiation of Type 1 AECs (and capillary endothelial cells), and that this defect was not fully complemented by increasing the uptake of cholesterol from exogenous sources and thus the lung-associated mortality was not altered. The defect in cholesterol biosynthesis in the lungs will continue to lead to generation of precursor sterols and since these sterols are readily incorporated into plasma membranes, restoration of normal raft function may require direct restoration of Dhcr7 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Another possibility is that pulmonary surfactant alteration may also play a role in the Dhcr7-deficient lung phenotype, since pulmonary surfactant, the lipid-protein material that stabilizes the respiratory surface of the lung, has been described to function as lipid microdomains. However, we have reported that expression of surfactant proteins, both at the mRNA and at the immunohistochemical level, was indistinguishable between Dhcr7-null and wild-type embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Cholesterol concentration, a critical parameter in modulating the lateral structure of pulmonary surfactant membranes as evidenced by in-vitro studies, may provide a structural scaffold for surfactant proteins to act at appropriate local densities and lipid composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A difference in the condensing ability of cholesterol and 7DHC in monolayer films of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), a major surfactant phospholipid, and their different abilities to form lateral domains with DPPC has also been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Sterols can induce upregulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis in cultured fibroblasts and this process is affected by the double-bond position in the sterol tetracyclic ring structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Therefore, markedly reduced cholesterol content and the massive accumulation of precursor sterols, such as 7/8DHC, may affect lung developmental at late gestational stages by the modulation of surfactant properties, even if surfactant protein expression is normal. However, restoration of DHCR7 activity in the lung using a transgene that expressed DHCR7 activity did not rescue this lethality (Yu and Patel, unpublished observations). Additionally, our previous brain-specific DHCR7 transgenic expression studies showed that some rescue was possible, even though lung sterol profiles were not altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Thus, while lung defects remain a contributory factor for this lethality, we contend that a defect in the CNS is the major reason why SLOS pups die soon after birth.</p><p>Some positive aspects should also be highlighted. Since the only cells that could synthesize cholesterol were the hepatocytes in the developing liver, yet there was robust restoration of cholesterol in the peripheral organs, this further confirms previous studies on the importance of lipoprotein-mediated liver-derived cholesterol delivery to these organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Additionally, this study also confirms the now well-established physiological observation that the blood-brain barrier is an absolute barrier for entry of pre-formed cholesterol into the brain and it is operational as early as E10 in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>One curious finding confounding the above interpretations is that, although cholesterol levels in the transgenic Dhcr7-null livers increased to almost WT levels, the precursor levels in the liver were reduced by only 70 %, despite an almost 5-fold increase in the relative expression of the transgene in the liver. Our explanation for this is that the fetal and neonatal mouse liver contains more than hepatocytes, with a significant amount of hematopoetic activity that persists beyond birth. The ApoE promoter chosen will only result in robust hepatic-specific expression. Since total dissected organ tissue sterols are measured, we presume that the precursor accumulations are therefore primarily in these non-hepatic cells and not hepatocytes. If so, it also suggests that close proximity of the hepatocytes and hematopoetic stem cells does not result in complementation or clearance of the precursor sterols from the latter. Thus, while cholesterol can be efficiently delivered to the various tissues readily via the lipoprotein-mediated pathways, removal of the precursor sterols back to the liver may not be as efficient.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Restoration of liver cholesterol synthesis is an efficient method to restore peripheral tissue cholesterol in Dhcr7-null embryos, and this can lead to an improvement in the lung developmental defects reported previously and a minimal improvement in the neonatal lethality was also observed.

The endogenous murine Dhcr7 and &#x003b2;-actin were amplified using <italic>Dhcr7 </italic>cDNA primers (forward: 5'-CCAAAGTCAAGAGTCCCAACGG-3' and reverse: 5'-ACCAGAGGATGTGGGTAATGAGC-3') and the &#x003b2;-actin gene primers, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. PCR amplification was carried out as follows: denaturation for 3 min at 94&#x000b0;C and then a succession of 30 cycles by 30 sec at 94&#x000b0;C, 30 sec at 58&#x000b0;C, 1 min at 72&#x000b0;C, and a final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. <italic>TgDHCR7 </italic>RT-PCR products (350 bp) were gel-purified and sequenced to confirm it contained correct spliced products using an automated capillary sequencer (Beckman Coulter CEQ 8000, CA), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. SYBR-Green real-time PCR quantification of transgene transcripts was performed with ABI 7300 Real-time PCR system, using human DHCR7 cDNA primers (forward: 5'-CCCAGCTCTATACCTTGTGG-3' and reverse: 5'-CCAGAGCAGGTGCGTGAGGAG-3'), murine Dhcr7 cDNA primers (forward: GCCAAGACACCACCTGTGACAG-3' and reverse: 5'-TGGACGCCTCCCACATAACC-3') and &#x003b2;-actin primers (forward: ACCCTGTGCTGCTCACCGAG-3'and reverse: 5'-TGCCTGTGGTACGACCAGAGG-3'). Quantification of <italic>TgDHCR7 </italic>mRNA levels in transgenic livers on E16.5, relative to endogenous murine Dhcr7 mRNA, was performed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), with normalization performed to the &#x003b2;-actin mRNA abundance from the same sample.</p><p>For immunoblotting analysis of TgDHCR7, tissue membrane fractions were extracted using ProteinExtract native membrane protein extraction kit (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, approximately 50 mg of frozen tissues from brain, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, or skeletal muscle was homogenized in 2 ml of ice cold homogenate buffer added with cocktail of protease inhibitors, using a tissue homogenizer (PRO Scientific Inc., Oxford, CT) by three pulses of 10 seconds each and then subjected to Dounce homogenizer, pestle A, by 20 strokes. The homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 15 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C and supernatants referred as to cytosolic fractions. The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer and gentled shaken for 30 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C, followed by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 15 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatants were collected and referred as to membrane fractions. Protein concentrations in each cytosolic and membrane fractions were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and 40 &#x003bc;g of protein from each sample was separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, incubated with HA monoclonal antibody (1:400, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Calnexin polyclonal antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or caveolin-1 (1:400, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 hours, followed by HRP second antibodies (1:4000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and visualized by chemiluminescent detection according to manufacturer's protocols (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA).</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical analyses</title><p>Sterol composition in tissues and plasma (pooled plasma collected by decapitation from 9 animals, pooling performed by combining plasma from 3 pups) were identified and quantitated by gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Histology and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Timed pregnant females at embryonic day (E) 19.5 were sacrificed.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] was used to isolate lipid rafts from neonatal lung tissues. Briefly, frozen lung tissues were homogenized in an ice-cold lysis buffer containing 5% glycerol in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml aprotinin, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF). Tissue debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 <italic>g </italic>for 5 minutes. Protein concentration of the postnuclear supernatants (PNS) was measured using Protein Reagent (Bio-Rad) and adjusted to 2 mg/ml. 10 % Triton X-100 (TX) was added to 2 ml of PNS to a final concentration of 0.5 % TX followed by a 30 min incubation on ice. The samples were mixed with equal volume of 80 % (w/v) sucrose in buffer A, and then overlaid with 2.0 ml each of 35, 30, 25, and 5 % (w/v) sucrose (all in buffer A). Sucrose gradient was spun at 38,000 rpm in a Sorval 90 ultracentrifuge using TH-641 rotor for 15 hr at 4&#x000b0;C. Twelve fractions of each 1.0 ml were collected from the top to bottom. Sterol composition in each 12 fractions and pooled lipid-raft and non-raft fractions was quantitatively determined as described above and normalized to organic-phosphate as determined by a phosphate assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Based on cholesterol profile, as well as cellular organelle protein markers and sphingolipid profile (data not shown), lipid rafts or detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) were defined as the membrane materials that floated at the interface of 5% and 25% sucrose in the density range 1.055~1.115 g/ml (fraction 2~4); non-raft materials were collected in the density range 1.130~1.180 g/ml (fraction 8~11).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HY and SBP conceived of the study and designed the experiments.
