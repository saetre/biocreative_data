The serine/threonine kinase Atg1 plays an essential role in autophagosome formation. However, the role of the mammalian Atg1 homologues UNC-51&#x02013;like kinase (ULK) 1 and 2 are not yet well understood. We found that murine ULK1 and 2 localized to autophagic isolation membrane under starvation conditions. Kinase-dead alleles of ULK1 and 2 exerted a dominant-negative effect on autophagosome formation, suggesting that ULK kinase activity is important for autophagy. We next screened for ULK binding proteins and identified the focal adhesion kinase family interacting protein of 200 kD (FIP200), which regulates diverse cellular functions such as cell size, proliferation, and migration. We found that FIP200 was redistributed from the cytoplasm to the isolation membrane under starvation conditions. In FIP200-deficient cells, autophagy induction by various treatments was abolished, and both stability and phosphorylation of ULK1 were impaired. These results suggest that FIP200 is a novel mammalian autophagy factor that functions together with ULKs.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: Cvt, cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting; E, embryonic day; FIP200, FAK family&#x02013;interacting protein of 200 kD; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PAS, preautophagosomal structure; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; ULK, UNC-51&#x02013;like kinase.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Autophagy is a primary route by which cytoplasmic contents are directed to the lysosome to be degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuervo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levine and Klionsky, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rubinsztein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mizushima, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mizushima et al., 2008</xref>). There are three types of autophagy: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy. Among them, only macroautophagy (referred to as autophagy hereafter) is mediated by the autophagosome. Upon induction of autophagy, a membrane cisterna called the isolation membrane (also termed the phagophore) enwraps a portion of cytoplasm to generate an autophagosome. The autophagosome then fuses with an endosome and, finally, with the lysosome, leading to degradation of cytoplasm-derived materials sequestered inside the autophagosome. Although autophagy occurs at low levels under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Komatsu et al., 2006</xref>), autophagy is extensively activated under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mizushima and Klionsky, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanism of autophagy has been revealed by genetic analyses performed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klionsky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suzuki and Ohsumi, 2007</xref>), in which 31 autophagy-related <italic>ATG</italic> genes have been identified so far. Among these genes, Atg1&#x02013;10, 12&#x02013;14, 16&#x02013;18, 29, and 31 (collectively called AP-Atg) are required for autophagosome formation. In yeast, autophagosomes are generated at a special site near the vacuolar membrane, called the preautophagosomal structure (PAS), where most AP-Atg proteins are recruited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suzuki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suzuki and Ohsumi, 2007</xref>). Although autophagy requires only these AP-Atg proteins, an autophagy-related pathway called cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway, which delivers two vacuolar enzymes, aminopeptidase 1 and &#x003b1;-mannosidase 1, from the cytoplasm to the vacuole, requires almost all Atg proteins except Atg17, 29, and 31.</p><p>AP-Atg proteins are classified into six functional groups: the Atg1 protein kinase complex; the Atg2&#x02013;Atg18 complex; the Atg8 conjugation system; the Atg12 conjugation system; the Atg14&#x02013;phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex; and Atg9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Suzuki et al., 2007</xref>). Among these functional units, the Atg1 complex has a unique feature: it apparently receives the starvation signals. Atg1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase, and its kinase activity can be up-regulated after autophagy-inducible treatments such as nutrient starvation or rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamada et al., 2000</xref>). The kinase activity of Atg1 is believed to be required for autophagy, although there have been debates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamada et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abeliovich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kabeya et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheong et al., 2008</xref>). The Atg1 complex includes Atg13, Atg17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamada et al., 2000</xref>), Atg29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawamata et al., 2008</xref>), Atg31/Cis1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kabeya et al., 2007</xref>), Atg11/Cvt9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2001b</xref>), Atg24/Cvt13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nice et al., 2002</xref>), Atg20/Cvt20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nice et al., 2002</xref>), and Vac8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scott et al., 2000</xref>). Atg17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamada et al., 2000</xref>), 29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawamata et al., 2005</xref>), and 31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kabeya et al., 2007</xref>) are specifically involved in autophagy, whereas Atg11, Atg20, Atg24, and Vac8 are specifically required for the Cvt pathway. Atg13 and 1 are involved in both pathways. A recent systematic analysis revealed that Atg17 and 11 are essential for PAS organization, and Atg17 has been suggested to behave as a scaffold protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Suzuki et al., 2007</xref>). The Atg1&#x02013;Atg17 interaction largely depends on Atg13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kabeya et al., 2005</xref>), but a yeast two-hybrid analysis suggested that Atg1 and 17 can also directly interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheong et al., 2005</xref>). Interactions between Atg13, 1, and 17 are enhanced by starvation treatment, and both Atg13 and 17 are important for proper regulation of Atg1 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamada et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kabeya et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The function of the Atg17&#x02013;Atg13&#x02013;Atg1 complex has yet to be fully understood. Although Atg1 and 13 sense nutrient conditions, this complex does not appear to function as a simple transducer of starvation signaling. For example, Atg1 is required for a late step of micropexophagy in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mukaiyama et al., 2002</xref>) and for the Cvt pathway, which is a constitutive biosynthetic pathway proceeding under nutrient-rich conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamada et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abeliovich et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, Atg1 is known to be important for retrieval of Atg9 and 23 from PAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reggiori et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Homologues of Atg1 have been found in other species such as <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Otto et al., 2004</xref>), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ogura et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Melendez et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scott et al., 2004</xref>), <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanaoka et al., 2002</xref>), and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yan et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">1999</xref>). Mutants of Atg1 in the species examined thus far indeed exhibit autophagy-defective phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Melendez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Otto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scott et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In metazoa, however, the role of Atg1 seems not to be limited to macroautophagy. <italic>C. elegans</italic> Atg1 is known as UNC (uncoordinated movement)-51. The <italic>unc-51</italic> mutants show neurological abnormalities such as paralysis and defects in axonal elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ogura et al., 1994</xref>). In mammals, two Atg1 homologues have been reported: UNC-51&#x02013;like kinase (ULK) 1 (also known as Unc51.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tomoda et al., 1999</xref>) and ULK2 (also known as Unc51.2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tomoda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yan et al., 1999</xref>). RNAi-mediated suppression of ULK1 expression alone is sufficient to inhibit autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2007</xref>) and redistribution of mAtg9 from the TGN to endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Young et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to the autophagy phenotype, a dominant-negative form of ULK1, K46R, suppresses neurite extension of cerebellar granular neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tomoda et al., 1999</xref>), which is consistent with the neurological phenotype of the <italic>unc-51</italic> worm.</p><p>The observations that Atg1 is a multifunctional protein suggest that Atg1 should function in concert with several distinct partners. Indeed, <italic>C. elegans</italic> UNC-51 interacts with UNC-14, a protein involved in coordinated movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ogura et al., 1997</xref>). In mammals, ULK1 interacts with SynGAP, a negative regulator of Ras, and Syntenin, a Rab5-interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tomoda et al., 2004</xref>). These interactions have been suggested to be important for axon guidance/elongation. Another recent paper also suggested that ULK1 is recruited to the TrkA&#x02013;NGF receptor complex by p62 and regulates non&#x02013;clathrin-coated endocytosis in growth cones, filopodia extension, and branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>). However, homologues of the yeast Atg1-interacting autophagy proteins have not been reported in higher eukaryotes (except for plant Atg13; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanaoka et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the role of the Atg1/ULK family, we screened for ULK-interacting proteins and identified the FAK family&#x02013;interacting protein of 200 kD (FIP200), which is also called RB1CC1 (retinoblastoma 1&#x02013;inducible coiled-coil 1). FIP200 was reported to interact with multiple proteins, including FAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbi et al., 2002</xref>), Pyk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ueda et al., 2000</xref>), TSC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gan et al., 2005</xref>), p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Melkoumian et al., 2005</xref>), ASK1, and TRAF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gan et al., 2006</xref>), thereby regulating a variety of cellular functions such as cell migration, proliferation, cell size, and apoptosis. FIP200 was also independently identified as a novel inducer of RB1. We found that ULK1, ULK2, and FIP200 are present on autophagic isolation membrane. Using <italic>FIP200</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we revealed that FIP200 is a novel mammalian autophagy factor that functions together with ULKs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>ULK1 and ULK2 localize on the isolation membrane (phagophore)</title><p>We found four ULK homologues in the mouse database. Although ULK1 and 2 are closely related to <italic>C. elegans</italic> UNC51, ULK3 and 4 show similarity to UNC51 only in the kinase domain (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712064/DC1">http://jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712064/DC1</ext-link>). We therefore analyzed the role of ULK1 and 2 in autophagosome formation. We first determined the subcellular distribution of ULK1 and 2 using NIH3T3 cells stably expressing ULKs fused with GFP at the N terminus (GFP-ULK1 and GFP-ULK2). Under nutrient-rich conditions, GFP-ULK1 and GFP-ULK2 were mostly found to distribute evenly throughout the cytoplasm, with few punctuate dots (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>, complete). We occasionally observed GFP-ULK1 and -ULK2 at the ruffled membrane in some cells (Fig. S2). After amino acid and serum starvation, GFP-ULK1 and -ULK2 localized to punctuate structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>, starvation). These punctuate structures immediately disappeared after replenishment with nutrient medium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>, starvation&#x02192;complete). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2007</xref>), these data suggest that ULK1 and 2 are targeted to autophagy-related structures. We then examined the localization of GFP-ULK in more detail and found that both ULK1 and 2 colocalized with endogenous Atg16L1 almost completely (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). Because Atg16L1, together with the Atg12&#x02013;Atg5 conjugate, specifically localizes to elongating isolation membrane (also called the phagophore; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mizushima et al., 2001</xref>), these data suggest that both ULK1 and 2 are targeted to the isolation membrane.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>ULK1 and 2 localize to the isolation membrane (phagophore) under starvation conditions.</bold> (A and B) NIH3T3 cells stably expressing GFP-ULK1 (A) and -ULK2 (B) were cultured in complete or starvation medium for 30 min.

Endogenous ULK1 was precipitated with anti-ULK1 antibody, and the resultant immunoprecipitate was analyzed by an in vitro kinase assay using myelin basic protein as a model substrate. The ULK1 kinase activity level under the starvation condition is increased 1.3-fold relative to the nutrient-rich condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Although this change was modest, these data suggest that the increase in ULK1 kinase activity might be important for the induction of autophagosome formation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>The kinase-dead ULK mutants inhibit autophagy.</bold> (A) In vitro kinase assay of endogenous ULK1.

However, in mammalian cells, both wild-type and kinase-dead ULK1 suppress autophagy, as judged by the LC3 conversion assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore carefully examined the effect of wild-type and kinase-dead mutants of ULK1 and 2 on Atg16L1 puncta formation. In transient transfection experiments, moderate expression of kinase-dead HA-ULK1<sup>K46N</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yan et al., 1998</xref>) and HA-ULK2<sup>K39T</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yan et al., 1999</xref>) efficiently suppress the starvation-induced Atg16L1 puncta formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>), whereas wild-type ULK1 and 2 showed almost no effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>; note that HA-ULK dots are not as clear as those in stable transformants [<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>] because of high cytoplasmic signals caused by overexpression). In contrast, when overexpressed in higher levels, both wild-type and kinase-dead ULKs suppressed Atg16L1 puncta formation (unpublished data). The shape of wild-type ULK-overexpressing cells was abnormal (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712064/DC1">http://jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712064/DC1</ext-link>), as previously demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al.

The cells generated protrusions and, finally, detached from the culture dish, which is consistent with the previous results in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> that Atg1 overexpression caused apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scott et al., 2007</xref>). However, these abnormalities were not observed in cells overexpressing kinase-dead ULK1 and 2 (Fig. S3). Therefore, the effects of overexpression of wild-type and kinase-dead ULKs are different. The kinase-dead mutants indeed act as dominant-negative mutants, whereas wild-type overexpression may cause cytotoxicity by some other mechanism. Collectively, these data suggest that the kinase activity is important for the involvement of ULKs in autophagy.</p><p>We also generated NIH3T3 cells stably expressing GFP-ULK1<sup>K46N</sup> and GFP-ULK2<sup>K39T</sup>. Although both Atg16L1 and GFP-ULKs formed puncta in wild-type NIH3T3 cells after starvation, these puncta were only very rarely observed in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing GFP-ULK1<sup>K46N</sup> or GFP-ULK2<sup>K39T</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>), confirming that kinase-dead ULKs function as a dominant-negative mutant in autophagosome formation.</p><p>We next measured this effect by the LC3 conversion assay. Conversion of cytosolic LC3 (LC3-I) to membrane-bound phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)&#x02013;conjugated LC3 (LC3-II) occurs during autophagy, and the amount of LC3-II is correlated with the number of autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kabeya et al., 2000</xref>). This LC3 conversion during starvation was markedly suppressed in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing ULK1<sup>K46N</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>), as recently reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al. (2007)</xref>. Another assay was conducted to monitor autophagy flux. Because p62 (SQSTM1/sequestosome 1) can bind LC3, p62 is preferentially incorporated into autophagosomes and degraded by autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bj&#x000f8;rk&#x000f8;y et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mizushima and Yoshimori, 2007</xref>). The amount of p62 can therefore serve as a good indicator of autophagic activity. The base level of p62 was up-regulated in ULK1<sup>K46N</sup>-transfected cells compared with mock-transfected cells. Although the level of p62 decreased during starvation in mock-transfected cells, the decrease was modestly suppressed in ULK1<sup>K46N</sup>-transfected cells. These data suggest that autophagic flux was attenuated by expression of the kinase-dead ULKs.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of FIP200 as a ULK-interacting protein</title><p>In yeast, Atg1 forms a complex with multiple proteins including Atg13 and 17.

Because FIP200-deficient cells displayed virtually no autophagosomes, we propose that the ULK&#x02013;FIP200 complex is essential for an early step, not a later or completion step, of autophagosome formation.</p><sec><title>Comparison between yeast Atg1 and mammalian ULK in the autophagy pathway</title><p>Although yeast Atg1 and mammalian ULK possess several common features, there are some differences. One difference is that although both proteins target to autophagic structures, precise localization may not be the same. Yeast Atg1 is known to localize to the PAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Suzuki et al., 2007</xref>). However, because Atg1 is delivered to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suzuki et al., 2001</xref>), it should be present on the inner membrane of autophagosomes or captured inside autophagosomes. In contrast, we detected ULK1 and 2 only on the isolation membrane, which suggests that ULK1 and 2 associate primarily with the outer membrane of autophagosomes like the Atg12&#x02013;Atg5 conjugate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mizushima et al., 2001</xref>). Accordingly, both ULK1 and FIP200 are not degraded in lysosome because expression levels of these proteins did not change after treatments of bafilomycin A1 (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712064/DC1">http://jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712064/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>Another difference is the Atg5 dependency of Atg1/ULK dot formation. Although PAS targeting of yeast Atg1 does not depend on Atg5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Suzuki et al., 2007</xref>), puncta formation of ULK1 and 2 depends on Atg5 in mammalian cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). One possible explanation of this apparent discrepancy between yeast and mammalian Atg1/ULK would be that the PAS-equivalent structure is not visible in mammalian cells, and localization of Atg1/ULK to isolation membrane should be dependent on Atg5 both in yeast and mammals. Dissection of PAS and the isolation membrane in yeast would clarify this issue.</p><p>We did not observe any difference between ULK1 and 2 in the present study, although ULK2 has been reported to be dispensable for autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Young et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2007</xref>). The function of ULK2 thus remains unclear. Examination of endogenous ULK2 will be required.</p></sec><sec><title>FIP200, a possible counterpart of yeast Atg17?</title><p>It was previously shown that FIP200 interacted with TSC1, and phosphorylation of S6 kinase after amino acid stimulation was impaired in cells treated with FIP200 siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gan et al., 2005</xref>). However, this effect was observed only moderately in <italic>FIP200</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gan et al., 2005</xref>). We also failed to detect clear defect in this pathway as we tested the phosphorylation levels of 4E-BP1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). There might be adaptation to the FIP200-deficient conditions in permanently knocked out cells. However, our present study does not exclude the possibility that FIP200 functions with the TSC complex. FIP200 may function both upstream and downstream of mTOR, but the downstream effect can be dominant when we analyze autophagy.</p><p>As FIP200 interacts with ULK1 and 2 and is essential for autophagy, one might speculate that this protein is a counterpart of yeast Atg13 or 17. Indeed, although FIP200 (1594 aa) is much larger than Atg17 (417 aa), FIP200 shares several features with yeast Atg17. First, both Atg17 and FIP200 have multiple coiled-coil domains. Second, just as Atg17 is required for Atg1 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamada et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kabeya et al., 2005</xref>), the phosphorylation status of ULK1 is reduced in FIP200-deficient cells, which may indicate diminished ULK1 activity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). It is therefore likely that Atg17 and FIP200 can support the function of Atg1 and ULKs, respectively. We also found that ULK1 kinase activity per cell was reduced in <italic>FIP200</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (unpublished data). However, as ULK1 expression level itself was also lower in <italic>FIP200</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells than in wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), we could not conclude how much specific activity of ULK1 reduced in the absence of FIP200. Third, the C-terminal region of ULK1 is essential for both FIP200 interaction and ULK1 puncta formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that interaction with FIP200 is important for membrane targeting. This is consistent with the previous finding that yeast Atg17 is required for PAS targeting of Atg1, which is particularly apparent in the <italic>atg11</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Suzuki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawamata et al., 2008</xref>). Fourth, FIP200 has multiple binding partners other than ULK1 and 2. Similarly, systematic analyses of yeast protein interactions by two-hybrid analysis and mass spectrometry identified many potential Atg17-interacting proteins, some of which are unrelated to autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ho et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gavin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krogan et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, both Atg17 and FIP200 may function as a scaffold for multiple proteins. Finally, homologues of Atg17 are present in <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic> and <italic>Eremothecium gossypii</italic>, where FIP200 homologue is missing. On the other hand, FIP200 homologues are found in <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <italic>Gallus gallus</italic>, and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, where Atg17 homologues are absent, but not in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic> This mutual exclusiveness suggests that these two groups of proteins may serve similar functions for which one, but not both, proteins are required. Identification and analysis of a functional homologue of mammalian Atg13, a critical factor of this complex, will further clarify the functional relationship between yeast and mammalian Atg1 complex.</p></sec><sec><title>LC3 conversion in <italic>FIP200</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells</title><p>One notable finding in this study is that significant amounts of LC3-II, which is the most widely used autophagy indicator, are detectable in FIP200-deficient cells. This may indicate that a very low level of autophagy occurs even in the absence of FIP200, which is consistent with the finding that small autophagosomes are occasionally generated in yeast <italic>atg17</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kabeya et al., 2005</xref>). However, this leaky phenotype is likely mediated by Cvt-specific Atg11, which is absent in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Suzuki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawamata et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, the autophagy flux analysis of <italic>FIP200</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells suggested that autophagic degradation is nearly completely abolished (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Thus, the small amount of LC3-II detected in <italic>FIP200</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells may be generated in an autophagy-independent manner. In yeast, Atg8&#x02013;PE is generated even in <italic>atg17</italic> mutant cells as well as in several other autophagy mutants such as <italic>atg1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, <italic>6</italic>, <italic>9</italic>, <italic>13</italic>, <italic>14</italic>, and <italic>16</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suzuki et al., 2001</xref>). Atg8&#x02013;PE conjugation is severely affected only in <italic>atg5</italic>, <italic>10</italic>, and <italic>12</italic> mutant cells and is completely blocked in <italic>atg3</italic>, <italic>4</italic>, and <italic>7</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suzuki et al., 2001</xref>). The Atg12&#x02013;Atg5 conjugate was recently reported to have an E3-like enzyme activity for the Atg8&#x02013;PE conjugation reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanada et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, the Atg8&#x02013;PE conjugation can take place in an autophagy-independent manner. The Atg knockout mammalian cells reported so far are <italic>Atg5</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Atg7</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>. Although LC3-II formation is absent in these cells, this is probably caused by deficiency of Atg12 and 8 conjugation and not simply autophagy deficiency. As observed in <italic>FIP200</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, Beclin 1 silencing blocks autophagosome formation but does not cause complete suppression of the LC3 conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zeng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsui et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, it is not contradictory that <italic>FIP200</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells show some LC3-II, even if the autophagic activity is virtually suppressed. Rather, these data suggest that we should measure the autophagy flux, not the absolute amount of LC3-II, to monitor autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tanida et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mizushima and Yoshimori, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>ULK/Atg1 and focal adhesion components</title><p>We have demonstrated that FIP200 localizes to the autophagic isolation membrane and is essential for autophagy. We do not think that FIP200 is an autophagy-specific protein. The most striking evidence for this is that <italic>FIP200</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice die between E13.5 and 16.5 with defective heart and liver development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gan et al., 2006</xref>), whereas autophagy-deficient <italic>Atg5</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Atg7</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice survive embryogenesis (although they die within one day of birth). Indeed, FIP200 involvement has been suggested in various cellular processes, such as inhibition of Pyk2-induced signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ueda et al., 2000</xref>), inhibition of cell migration through FAK inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbi et al., 2002</xref>), tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chano et al., 2002b</xref>), induction of RB expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chano et al., 2002a</xref>), cell size regulation through inhibition of the TSC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chano et al., 2006</xref>), inhibition of p53-mediated G1-S progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Melkoumian et al., 2005</xref>), and inhibition of TNF-induced apoptosis, probably through inhibition with ASK1 and TRAF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gan et al., 2006</xref>). These data suggest that FIP200 is a multifunctional protein.</p><p>An important question is whether FIP200 alone or FIP200 and its interacting proteins are involved in autophagy. While we were preparing this manuscript, a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genetic analysis revealed a genetic interaction between Atg1 and paxillin, a cytoskeletal scaffolding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). The study further demonstrates that paxillin and vinculin redistribute from focal adhesions to intracellular structures under starvation conditions and that paxillin-deficient MEFs are defective in autophagy. In contrast, our analysis showed that FAK is not required for autophagy, suggesting that the focal adhesion complex per se is not involved in autophagy. FAK-independent communication between FIP200 and paxillin will be the subject of future studies in both autophagy and focal adhesion.</p><p>Given that at least three of the focal adhesion components function in autophagy, it is possible that ULKs also plays a role in cell adhesion that is independent of its function in autophagy. Indeed, GFP-ULK1 and -ULK2 were occasionally detected at the cell periphery (Fig. S2), and overexpression of wild-type ULKs caused abnormal cell morphology such as cell rounding and protrusion (Fig. S3). So far, several studies have suggested autophagy-independent roles of Atg1/ULK in various species, such as axonal elongation and branching in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ogura et al., 1994</xref>) and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tomoda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>). These functions may be related to the role of Atg1 in focal adhesion.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a novel ULK-interacting protein, FIP200, which is functionally similar to yeast Atg17. The ULK&#x02013;FIP200 complex is essential for autophagy, but the precise role of this complex is unknown. Identification of physiologically relevant substrates of Atg1&#x02013;ULK is one of the most straightforward approaches, although it has not been successful thus far in any species studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deminoff and Herman, 2007</xref>). Searching for additional interacting proteins will also facilitate understanding of the role of Atg1&#x02013;ULK complex and the regulation of autophagy induction and autophagosome formation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>IMAGE Consortium cDNA clones (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BC017556">BC017556</ext-link>) encoding human RB1CC1/FIP200 were obtained from Invitrogen.
