Floral homeotic genes encode transcription factors of the MADS-box family, which are supposed to assemble in a combinatorial fashion into organ-specific multimeric protein complexes. Major mediators of protein interactions are MADS-domain proteins of the SEPALLATA subfamily, which play a crucial role in the development of all types of floral organs. In order to characterize the roles of the SEPALLATA3 transcription factor complexes at the molecular level, we analyzed genome-wide the direct targets of SEPALLATA3. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by ultrahigh-throughput sequencing or hybridization to whole-genome tiling arrays to obtain genome-wide DNA-binding patterns of SEPALLATA3. The results demonstrate that SEPALLATA3 binds to thousands of sites in the genome. Most potential target sites that were strongly bound in wild-type inflorescences are also bound in the floral homeotic <italic>agamous</italic> mutant, which displays only the perianth organs, sepals, and petals. Characterization of the target genes shows that SEPALLATA3 integrates and modulates different growth-related and hormonal pathways in a combinatorial fashion with other MADS-box proteins and possibly with non-MADS transcription factors. In particular, the results suggest multiple links between SEPALLATA3 and auxin signaling pathways. Our gene expression analyses link the genomic binding site data with the phenotype of plants expressing a dominant repressor version of SEPALLATA3, suggesting that it modulates auxin response to facilitate floral organ outgrowth and morphogenesis. Furthermore, the binding of the SEPALLATA3 protein to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of other MADS-box genes and expression analyses reveal that this protein is a key component in the regulatory transcriptional network underlying the formation of floral organs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Most regulatory genes encode transcription factors, which modulate gene expression by binding to regulatory sequences of their target genes. In plants in particular, which genes are directly controlled by these transcription factors, and the molecular mechanisms of target gene recognition in vivo, are still largely unexplored. One of the best-understood developmental processes in plants is flower development. In different combinations, transcription factors of the MADS-box family control the identities of the different types of floral organs: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Here, we present the first genome-wide analysis of binding sites of a MADS-box transcription factor in plants. We show that the MADS-domain protein SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) binds to the regulatory regions of thousands of potential target genes, many of which are also transcription factors. We provide insight into mechanisms of DNA recognition by SEP3, and suggest roles for other transcription factor families in SEP3 target gene regulation. In addition to effects on genes involved in floral organ identity, our data suggest that SEP3 binds to, and modulates, the transcription of target genes involved in hormonal signaling pathways.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The key floral regulator SEPALLATA3 binds to the promoters of a large number of potential direct target genes to integrate different growth-related and hormonal pathways in flower development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="22"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Kaufmann K, Mui&#x000f1;o JM, Jauregui R, Airoldi CA, Smaczniak C, et al.

Modularity of plant development is based on the ability of plants to maintain pools of undifferentiated stem cells throughout the life cycle of the plant. Stem cells near the tip of the growing shoot are located in the shoot apical meristem, where different types of plant organs, such as vegetative leaves or floral organs, can be initiated from the flanks of the meristem. Leaves and floral organs are &#x0201c;variations of a theme&#x0201d;: they arise via modifications of a common basic genetic program &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Which type of organ is produced by the meristem depends on the developmental phase of the plant. Initially, leaves are produced during the early vegetative phase of the plant, followed by the transition to reproductive phase, which triggers the transformation of vegetative shoot meristems to inflorescence and floral meristems, giving rise to flowers and floral organs, respectively.</p><p>Thus, change in the identity of plant organs is initiated by reprogramming within the meristems &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. Plant developmental biologists have identified a number of key regulatory genes that trigger changes in meristem and organ identity, many of them encoding transcription factors, chromatin remodeling factors, or other signaling molecules like microRNAs (miRNAs). One family of transcription factors that is important in this process is the MADS-box gene family &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. MADS-box genes play crucial roles in the switches from vegetative to inflorescence and finally to floral meristems. These latter meristems give rise to flowers and floral organs, respectively &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Developmental transitions and organ differentiation require global changes in gene expression. The genome of the model flowering plant <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis thaliana</named-content> is roughly 20-fold smaller than the human genome; still, it encodes about 27,000 protein-coding genes, which is more than found for humans (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org">http://www.arabidopsis.org</ext-link>; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;). One of the most challenging current questions is how developmental control genes trigger global changes in gene expression during the multiple phase transitions and in organ identity determination, starting from a small pool of undifferentiated cells.</p><p>In the present study, we focus on the MADS-box transcription factor SEPALLATA3 (SEP3). SEP3 is a member of the SEP subfamily of MADS-box genes, whose members have nearly redundant functions in the specification of floral meristem identity and in the identity of all types of floral organs: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Triple mutants impaired in <italic>SEP1&#x02013;3</italic> function have flowers with floral organs converted into sepals and display a loss of determinacy in the center of the flower &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. This phenotype masks the involvement of the <italic>SEP</italic> genes in processes occurring later in development, e.g., the formation of the ovules as has been shown by Favaro et al. (2003) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. The SEP3 protein appears to be the central player, since it is part of at least a dozen different MADS domain dimer complexes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d; and it is expressed throughout flower development, from the floral meristem to fully developed floral organs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. This suggests that SEP3 is a multifunctional protein controlling a plethora of developmental processes. According to the current model of flower development, the SEP3 protein is proposed to mediate the higher-order protein complex formation between MADS-domain proteins with more specific floral organ identity functions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, it may provide the transcriptional activation potential to the floral homeotic protein complexes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. More-recent evidence suggests that the SEP3 protein may also recruit transcriptional corepressors, demonstrating that it can modulate the function of the plant protein complexes in a broader sense, depending on the availability of cofactors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. However, evidence for higher-order complex formation between MADS-domain proteins comes mostly from protein interaction studies in heterologous systems and genetic data, and there is no indication for the relevance of these interactions in target-gene recognition <italic>in planta</italic> so far. Another question is how different MADS-domain protein complexes achieve functional specificity, since the in vitro DNA-binding characteristics of MADS-domain proteins appeared rather similar, and the short DNA sequence motifs supposedly bound by MADS-domain proteins are very abundant in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In order to characterize the mode of action and general downstream pathways of floral homeotic genes, we generated genome-wide DNA-binding profiles of SEP3 in its native context. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by ultrahigh-throughput Solexa (Illumina) sequencing (ChIP-SEQ) has been shown recently to be a powerful tool to obtain genome-wide DNA-binding patterns of transcription factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. The large numbers of short individual sequence reads produced by novel instruments facilitate the digital quantification of DNA sequences that are present in a sample. An alternative method comprises the combination of ChIP and whole-genome microarrays (ChIP-CHIP) to map the genomic DNA regions enriched in the immunoprecipitated sample &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. These genomic tiling arrays are available for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and have been used to map binding sites for plant transcription factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We compared the targets of SEP3 in wild-type and the floral homeotic <italic>agamous</italic> (<italic>ag</italic>) mutant background. In the <italic>ag</italic> mutant, stamens are replaced by petals, and instead of the carpels in the fourth whorl, a new mutant flower is formed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Accordingly, the analysis of this mutant should reveal SEP3 target genes specifying petal development, whereas targets that are specific to stamens and carpels should be absent. We further studied the function of SEP3 in the regulation of downstream pathways by analyzing the effects of a dominant repressor version of SEP3 in plants.</p><p>The genome-wide identification of direct target genes of SEP3 provides a framework for a hierarchical transcriptional network underlying the formation of floral organs. SEP3 binds to thousands of genomic regions containing the consensus binding sites for MADS-domain proteins, but it also acts as part of regulatory modules with other transcription factors. These modules link floral homeotic gene functions with organ growth. Our analysis identified multiple links between SEP3 and hormonal pathways, and in particular auxin signaling. Auxin signaling is crucial for the outgrowth and development of lateral organs, and its role in flower development has been suggested previously based on mutant phenotypes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b019">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Our ChIP-SEQ data and the phenotypes of plants that repress direct SEP3 targets in a dominant-negative fashion suggest cooperation of SEP3 and genes in the auxin pathway in the regulation of floral organ growth and differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Genome-Wide Mapping of Regions Bound by SEPALLATA3</title><p>To identify genomic regions bound in vivo by SEPALLATA3 (SEP3), we used ChIP followed by deep sequencing by ChIP-SEQ &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. In a parallel experiment, the ChIP was followed by whole-genome tiling array hybridizations to identify enriched regions (ChIP-CHIP). For the ChIP experiments, we used inflorescences including inflorescence meristems and floral buds of stage 1&#x02013;12 from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> wild-type and <italic>agamous</italic> (<italic>ag</italic>-1) mutant plants. Protein&#x02013;DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using a peptide antibody specific to SEP3. As a negative control, we performed ChIP-SEQ using the same antibody on <italic>sep3</italic>-1 mutant plants. Western blot analysis revealed that the SEP3 antibody reacts exclusively with the SEP3 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000090-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>From the ChIP-SEQ experiments, we obtained between 3 to 7.5 million approximately 35-bp sequence reads after one to three independent rounds of sequencing for each sample, of which 30&#x00025;&#x02013;40&#x00025; were uniquely mapped on the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> nuclear genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000090-st001">Table S1</xref>). The uniquely mapped reads were extended to 300 bp in order to recover the average original DNA fragments that were subjected to sequencing in a similar fashion as described by Robertson et al. (2007) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. This allows positioning of the maximum of enrichment present in the samples at high resolution. The number of mapped reads was counted for every nucleotide position (defined as &#x0201c;number of hits&#x0201d;), and for each strand independently. For some genomic positions, we observed that the number of hits was only due to reads with identical sequence. Although, it is expected that some reads will have an identical sequence, it is also expected that a true peak of enrichment should be represented by several reads with partly overlapping but different sequences. In order to avoid any artifact due to identical sequence reads, we included the requirement that the number of hits at each genomic position should be supported by reads mapped in both DNA strands. To test for enrichment at each nucleotide position in the sample compared to the control, we used a score based on the Poisson distribution, as it is commonly used for statistical modeling of tag counts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. For each genomic region representing a candidate peak, the maximum score value was used to test the significance of the peak (defined as &#x0201c;peak score&#x0201d;). We used the false discovery rate (FDR) to control the error rate of our testing procedure.</p><p>The number of significant peaks for the ChIP-SEQ datasets is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000090-t001">Table 1</xref>. Notably, SEP3 binds to thousands of regions in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. At FDR &#x0003c;0.001, we found 4,282 significantly enriched regions for the SEP3 in wild-type plants, and 2,828 regions in the <italic>ag</italic> mutant. Thus, at this level of significance and given our data, SEP3 seems to bind a reduced number of regions in the <italic>ag</italic> mutant compared to wild-type plants.</p><table-wrap id="pbio-1000090-t001" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Number of Significant Peaks in the SEP3 ChIP-SEQ Datasets</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.1000090.t001"/></table-wrap><p>We used biological replicates and comparison of ChIP-SEQ and ChIP-CHIP data in order to evaluate the reproducibility of the generated genome-wide binding profiles of SEP3. To simplify the comparison of ChIP-SEQ replicates, the average score in nonoverlapping 5,000-bp windows for each replicate was calculated. A high correlation between the two different sequencing rounds and biological replicates was found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000090-sg002">Figure S2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000090-sg002">S2</xref>G). Peaks positions and ranks from independent biological replicates overlap strongly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000090-sg002">Figure S2</xref>H). Since more sequences were produced for replicate 1, we focused in our further bioinformatic analysis on this replicate.</p><p>Comparison of the ChIP-CHIP and the ChIP-SEQ experiments reveals a good agreement between the results of the two methods, as reflected in the large overlap in peak positions and similar ranking of the peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000090-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). We were also interested in comparing the positional resolution of the two platforms. The average width of the most strongly significant ChIP-SEQ peaks is around 800 bp. In contrast, the peaks with an equivalent ChIP-CHIP rank have a width of approximately 1,300 bp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000090-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). This larger window size for the ChIP-CHIP peaks compared to ChIP-SEQ peaks results in a lower positional resolution, which is particularly problematic in regions with multiple binding sites that are close to each other.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Genome-Wide Overview of Bound Regions</title><p><italic>cis</italic>-Regulatory elements controlling gene expression are preferentially found in the promoters of target genes.

As evident from our ChIP-SEQ experiments, most in vivo binding sites of SEP3 are close to or within protein-coding genes and only about 6&#x00025; to 8&#x00025; of all peaks (FDR &#x0003c;0.001) are not located within 3 kb upstream to 1 kb downstream of any genomic locus (wild-type and <italic>ag</italic> datasets). A total of 3,475 genes are targeted by SEP3 in wild type, whereas 2,424 genes are putative targets in the <italic>ag</italic> mutant at FDR &#x0003c;0.001 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000090-st002">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000090-st003">S3</xref>). In agreement with its role as transcriptional regulator, DNA-binding sites of SEP3 are predominantly located in the upstream region of genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000090-sg003">Figure S3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000090-st003">Table S3</xref>).

Surprisingly, binding sites are also enriched in the downstream region of genes, located just downstream of the 3&#x02032; UTR, although this enrichment is clearly less pronounced than the one found near the transcriptional start site of genes. Within genes, peaks are preferentially located in introns and UTR regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000090-sg003">Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000090-st003">Table S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Position of MADS-Domain Binding Motifs</title><p>It is known from in vitro&#x02013;binding studies that MADS-domain proteins bind to specific DNA elements called CArG boxes (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;). Most well known is the serum response element (SRE or SRF)-type CArG box, which has the consensus CC&#x0005b;A/T&#x0005d;<sub>6</sub>GG. A related sequence motif is the MEF2-type CArG box, which has the general consensus C&#x0005b;A/T&#x0005d;<sub>8</sub>G but is usually more strictly defined as CTA&#x0005b;A/T&#x0005d;<sub>4</sub>TAG.

This suggests that the in vivo binding data reflect a mix of affinities of different homo- and heterodimeric SEP3 protein complexes.</p><p>Since MADS-domain proteins bind as dimers to a CArG box, CArG boxes can be considered as composite elements, with each half-site contacted by a different monomer with possibly different binding preferences. We estimated the frequencies of all possible half-sites for the CArG boxes of the general consensus CC&#x0005b;A/T&#x0005d;<sub>6</sub>GG and CC&#x0005b;A/T&#x0005d;<sub>7</sub>G in the ChIP-SEQ data.

Thus, we would expect an enrichment of ChIP-SEQ peaks with regulatory modules consisting of two CArG box elements.

The module with the highest fitness score (0.748 on a scale of 0 to 1) was composed of a single pair of CArG boxes separated by a DNA stretch varying between 10 to 200 bp in length.

Their gene products also represent major protein interaction partners of SEP3, suggesting that later induced targets of SEP3 are targets of the corresponding SEP3-containing protein complexes. Thus, SEP3 can activate the flower developmental program by enhancing the expression of its interaction partners as one of its first steps. Induction of the ABC classes of genes is sufficient to form the flower, which explains the very early flowering and the terminal-flower phenotype that we observed upon SEP3 induction.

The ChIP data demonstrate that the floral MADS-box transcription factor SEP3 bind to thousands of regions in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. Thus, it apparently acts as global regulator of gene expression during the various stages of floral development from floral meristem initiation to maturity. Also, other MADS-box transcription factors bind to thousands of sites in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome (AP1; K. Kaufmann and G. C.

This indicates that the binding of SEP3 to DNA sequences is highly selective. Most binding sites are located in promoters or other regions with potentially regulatory functions, such as introns. These findings suggest that the majority of significant protein&#x02013;DNA interactions identified in ChIP-SEQ experiments are likely to be relevant. The functional importance of the DNA-binding events detected in our ChIP-SEQ experiments is also supported by the finding that there is enrichment for specific GO annotations among the targets of SEP3.</p><p>The question remains whether all of the enriched DNA regions bound by SEP3 are relevant for gene regulation. Since the plant material used for our ChIP-SEQ experiments comprises different developmental stages, a direct correlation of DNA-binding events and stage-specific changes in gene expression is difficult. However, our comparison of the ChIP-SEQ data to comprehensive gene expression microarray data suggest that the majority of the genes that are bound by SEP3 <italic>in planta</italic> are also differentially expressed during flower development in a temporal and/or spatial fashion.</p><p>In contrast to the strongly bound regions, the functional relevance of weakly enriched regions detected in ChIP-SEQ is much less clear. They might represent transient interactions of the transcription factors with DNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;, or DNA binding in only a few cells, resulting in a high dilution with tissues that lack the interaction.

These regions corresponded to genes that were poorly modulated in expression, and peaks were often located outside regulatory sequences. It is possible that the weakly enriched regions in our SEP3 ChIP experiment also contain a high proportion of inactive binding sites.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Determinants of In Vivo DNA Binding</title><p>Although in vitro studies have revealed consensus binding sites for many transcription factors, including MADS-domain proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;, it remains unknown what DNA sequence or chromosomal context determines DNA binding site recognition by MADS-box transcription factors in vivo. Our results indicate that the sequence of the cognate binding site, the presence of multiple binding sites, and binding sites for non-MADS cofactors play roles in binding site recognition. The SEP3 ChIP data revealed that not all DNA sequences corresponding to the canonical consensus motifs CC&#x0005b;A/T&#x0005d;<sub>6</sub>GG and CC&#x0005b;A/T&#x0005d;<sub>7</sub>G/C&#x0005b;A/T&#x0005d;<sub>7</sub>GG can serve as functional binding sites for SEP3 and associated MADS-domain proteins <italic>in planta</italic>. Instead, we found significant enrichment for particular types of half-sites in the SEP3 ChIP-SEQ data. In addition, there is clear interdependence between the sequence of individual half-sites, and between half-sites and surrounding bases. Thus, commonly used consensus sequences and position weight matrices, which assume independency of nucleotide positions of a binding site, are highly oversimplified. The enrichment for certain half-sites may reflect the recognition site for SEP3, while the other half of the binding site could match the recognition site of the dimer partner of SEP3. It is known that SEP3 is able to dimerize with many other MADS-domain proteins in yeast assays &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d; and <italic>in planta</italic> (K. Kaufmann and G. C. Angenent, unpublished data), which makes it difficult to determine <italic>the</italic> consensus CArG box sequence for SEP3. Combining ChIP-SEQ data obtained from different MADS dimer partners (e.g., SEP3 and AP1) and determining the overlap in binding sites will elucidate the recognition sites for particular MADS-box dimers. We found that there is a clear overlap of target genes in wild type compared to the <italic>ag</italic> mutant, although there are differences in number of binding sites and binding affinity at individual sites. Although at this point we cannot exclude that the wild-type binding sites are enriched for perianth-specific targets, these results support the hypothesis that different MADS-domain protein complexes (e.g., AG-SEP3 and SEP3-AP1) may bind to overlapping sets of target genes, but regulate them in a different way, for instance by recruiting different sets of cofactors leading to differences in activation or repression of genes. In line with the idea that cofactors play a role in differential regulation of downstream targets, it has been shown that SEP3 and AP1 can recruit the corepressor SEUSS, and that this complex acts to repress AG expression in petal development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Our finding that individual peaks are more likely to be affected by loss of AG than target genes makes it also possible that different higher-order complexes may bind to subsets of binding sites present in the promoter. Considering that plant MADS-domain proteins differ in their DNA bending characteristics as determined by gel retardation experiments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, different protein complexes may have specific effects on the structural properties of the promoter and by that influence target gene expression.</p><p>The interplay between different proteins implicates that the dynamics in the floral developmental network is strongly dependent on relative quantities and affinities of individual homeotic proteins competing for common protein interaction partners and key downstream targets. The large number of targets suggests that floral homeotic protein complexes globally control and modify the genetic programs that are active in all plant organs, so that only a limited number of targets would be expected to be unique for the individual floral homeotic protein complexes.</p><p>In addition to CArG box elements, we found several other transcription factors consensus DNA-binding sequences to be enriched in the center of the peaks, suggesting that these transcription factors act in a combinatorial fashion with MADS-domain proteins in common regulatory modules. Until now, there has been very limited information about interactions between plant MADS-domain proteins and other transcription factors, and this rare information is based on artificial yeast and/or in vitro protein interaction data. The types of transcription factors whose binding sites are enriched in the peaks link MADS-domain proteins with other cellular, developmental, and hormonal pathways.

Whether there are direct protein interactions between these classes of transcription factors still needs to be resolved.</p><p>In addition to primary sequence characteristics, the accessibility of binding sites, and thus the chromatin structure, can influence the recruitment of MADS-box transcription factors to specific sites in the genome. We observed a strong enrichment of binding sites close to the transcriptional start site of genes, suggesting that the recognition sites are not randomly distributed in the genome. Assuming that any small sequence motif is randomly distributed in the genome, it suggests that not only the primary sequence itself, but also the position of the <italic>cis</italic>-element is relevant for transcription factor binding. Chromatin remodeling, which is active throughout plant development, is likely affecting the accessibility of transcription factors and transcriptional activity. It occurs during postembryonic developmental transitions (e.g., flowering) and is required for maintenance of meristematic cell identity as well as for the formation of organ primordia, with different chromatin factors acting at different stages (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d; and references therein). Current models of gene regulation suggest that chromatin remodeling and transcription factor binding dynamically alternate due to transient exposure of DNA by displacement of nucleosomes (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d; and references therein). MADS-box transcription factors form large complexes <italic>in planta</italic> (K. Kaufmann and G. C. Angenent, unpublished data), making it even possible that there is a direct interaction between these transcription factors and chromatin remodeling factors. Interesting in this respect is that we identified four out of five members of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes as targets of SEP3 in the ChIP experiments, suggesting an interdependence relationship.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Auxin Signaling as a Target Pathway of SEP3</title><p>Our ChIP-SEQ data indicate that there are multiple direct molecular links between floral homeotic genes and hormonal pathways. Interestingly, ARF genes are targets of SEP3 but could also be coregulators, suggesting that autoregulatory circuits exist involving members of unrelated transcription factor families.</p><p>In addition to specifying floral meristem and organ identity, an important role of SEP and AP1-like proteins is to trigger organ growth.

This hypothesis of a mutual role of AP1/CAL and SEP proteins in organ outgrowth provides a link to auxin-mediated organ development.

These plants are characterized by defects in lateral organ outgrowth (floral buds and floral organs) and a pistil lacking a functional ovary. Although we observed variable homeotic conversions in SEP3-EAR expressing plants, which would be expected from the down-regulation of SEP3 function, the majority of plants was only affected in outgrowth and differentiation of the floral organs. The mode of action of the SEP3-EAR fusion protein and how it interferes with outgrowth without affecting the homeotic function remain to be studied further. A possible explanation could be that auxin homeostasis is more sensitive to the dominant repression by the SEP3-EAR protein than the floral homeotic functions. Alternatively, SEP3-EAR may suppress ARF function by interacting with ARF proteins in a larger transcriptional complex, a model that is supported by our SEP3-ChIP experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Transcriptional Networks in Flower Development</title><p>Developmental transcription networks are composed of positive and negative regulatory loops, which often unite into larger transcription units.

It acts as a hub by linking various developmental programs that occur in the inflorescence and floral meristems and at later stages during organ differentiation. Our ChIP-SEQ data demonstrate that SEP3 is indeed able to bind to the promoters of many floral homeotic genes, supporting the conclusion that SEP3 is a key regulator of flower development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000090-g010">Figure 10</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio-1000090-g010" position="float"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>Autoregulatory Network of MADS Box Transcription Factors in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Flower Development</title><p>The network was visualized using the BioTapestry program &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;.

The finding that most of these MADS-domain proteins also physically interact with each other suggests that combinatorial interactions of floral homeotic MADS-domain proteins and SEP3 protein are required for multiple positive autoregulatory feedback and feedforward loops. These mutual interdependencies may have evolved in order to enable stable organ-specific expression patterns by attenuating stochastic fluctuations in expression levels that may be more frequent if regulation was mediated by single proteins instead of heteromeric protein complexes.</p><p>Previously, negative feedback loops were suggested between AP1, which is a protein interaction partner of SEP3, and some of the flowering-time MADS-box genes to prevent the expression of these vegetative factors in the flower &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;. Our data also suggest that SEP3 has a role in repression of genes that control flowering time (e.g., <italic>SOC1</italic> and <italic>AGL24</italic>). In line with this idea, binding sites of SEP3 and AP1 overlap at the <italic>SOC1</italic> promoter (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d; and our ChIP-SEQ data). Interestingly, the binding sites also partially overlap with those of positive regulators at the <italic>SOC1</italic> locus (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d; and our ChIP-SEQ data). It is possible that positively and negatively acting factors compete for the same binding sites. Since SEP3 is also able to interact with SOC1, it is also possible that a SEP3-SOC1 protein dimer is important for negative autoregulation of the SOC1 locus in floral meristems &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. In general, direct negative (auto)regulatory feedback loops may enable an efficient and persistent switch between developmental phases, i.e., from inflorescence identity to floral identity.</p><p>Transcription factor complexes and their target genes are major components of transcriptional cascades that drive plant developmental processes. Once we have genome-wide datasets describing more of these interactions, we can integrate the data into transcriptional networks and models describing the interactions of the components of the network and predicting the outcome of modulation of the biological system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000090-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;. Here, we have shown that ChIP-SEQ is a powerful tool providing these essential datasets to address questions in plant biology. Our findings suggest that many direct regulatory interactions exist in plant developmental networks. Additional information is needed, in particular the dynamics of the interactions in time and space. Furthermore, not only DNA&#x02013;protein interactions, but also protein&#x02013;protein interactions of transcription factors need to be resolved for a better understanding of developmental processes in complex organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant material and growing conditions.</title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis thaliana</named-content>, wild-type (Col-0), <italic>sep3</italic>-1 (Col-0), and <italic>ag</italic>-1 (Ler) mutant plants were grown under standard greenhouse conditions (20 &#x000b0;C, long-day light regime: 16-h light, 8-h dark cycle).
