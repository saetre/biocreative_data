RPA participation in these pathways is mediated by single-stranded DNA binding and protein interactions. We herein identify a novel protein, Replication Protein Binding Trans-Activator (RBT1), in a yeast two-hybrid assay employing the second subunit of human RPA (RPA32) as bait. RBT1&#x02013;RPA32 binding was confirmed by glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation. Fluorescence microscopy indicates that green fluorescence protein-tagged RBT1 is localized to the nucleus <italic>in vivo</italic>. RBT1 mRNA expression, determined by semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR, is significantly higher in cancer cell lines MCF-7, ZR-75, SaOS-2 and H661, compared to the cell lines normal non-immortalized human mammary epithelial cells and normal non-immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells. Further, yeast and mammalian one-hybrid analysis shows that RBT1 is a strong transcriptional co-activator. Interestingly, mammalian transactivation data is indicative of significant variance between cell lines; the GAL4&#x02013;RBT1 fusion protein has significantly higher transcriptional activity in human cancer cells compared to human normal primary non-immortalized epithelial cells. We propose that RBT1 is a novel transcriptional co-activator that interacts with RPA, and has significantly higher activity in transformed cells.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x962ef40.0x9ac1420" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession no.

In yeast, RPA is found to bind specific regulatory sequences in the promoters of DNA repair and metabolism genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c7">7</xref>) suggesting that RPA may have a role in the regulation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c8">8</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that RPA function requires an ability to bind and destabilize dsDNA and that its specific activity is mediated by protein interaction and&#x0002f;or RPA phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c9">9</xref>). RPA&#x02013;protein interactions appear to be largely mediated by the large 70 kDa subunit (RPA70). Of note, RPA70 has been reported to interact with p53, GAL4, VP16, EBNA1, SV40 large T-antigen and DNA polymerase &#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c14">14</xref>). RPA binding is also important for the proper function of DNA repair proteins involved in damage recognition and excision&#x02014;interaction with Xeroderma Pigmentosum Complementation Group F (XPF) stimulates its 5&#x02032; junction-specific endonuclease activity and interaction with XPG targets this endonuclease to damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c16">16</xref>).</p><p>The possibility of interaction by the aforementioned repair proteins with the second subunit of RPA (RPA32) has not been clearly elucidated. However, interactions with some DNA repair proteins appear to be mediated by RPA32, such as interaction with XPA and uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c18">18</xref>). A region of homology between XPA and UDG is suggestive of a common binding motif to RPA32. Furthermore, some important protein interactions, such as with RAD52, appear to involve all three subunits of RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c19">19</xref>).</p><p>The physiological role of RPA phosphorylation is less clearly understood. RPA phosphorylation occurs on amino acid residues proximal to the N-terminal of RPA32 resulting in retardation in the electrophoretic mobility of this subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c22">22</xref>). Although RPA is phosphorylated throughout the S phase, in response to radiation and during apoptosis, mutations of the major phosphorylation sites do not produce a clear, detectable phenotype in the model eukaryote, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, nor do they affect DNA binding, SV40 DNA replication <italic>in vitro</italic> or nucleotide excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c30">30</xref>). It is plausible that phosphorylation, rather than being an absolute requirement for physiological function, affects the conformation of RPA modulating its affinity for DNA and its protein interactors, and altering the balance between DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c9">9</xref>). It is interesting to note that the interaction between RPA and p53 is disrupted by UV damage suggesting at least one mechanism by which DNA replication and repair are co-ordinated with checkpoint controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c31">31</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, protein&#x02013;protein interactors of RPA32 were screened by the yeast two-hybrid assay. We describe a novel protein interactor of RPA32 which we refer to as Replication Protein Binding Trans-Activator 1 (RBT1). RBT1, a 196 amino acid protein, is able to transactivate reporter genes in both yeast and mammalian one-hybrid experiments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>RPA32 nucleotide sequence was PCR amplified from cDNA derived from cell line MCF-7 and cloned into the yeast two-hybrid plasmids pBTM116 and pACT2 in frame to LexA (1&#x02013;202) and GAL4-TA, respectively.

All washing and incubations with both primary (RPA32) and secondary (Texas Red conjugated) antibodies were done in PBS containing 0.2&#x00025; BSA. After labeling, the coverslips were mounted in Airvol (Air Products and Chemicals Inc., Allentown, PA) and photographed with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescent microscope.

Eight of the interactors were identified as the 14 kDa subunit of RPA (RPA14) by PCR and&#x0002f;or cycle sequencing. RPA32&#x02013;RPA14 binding represents the highest affinity of interaction in this system based on the vigorous growth of the colonies on dropout media lacking histidine (containing 25 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) and strong &#x003b2;-gal activity; the isolation of RPA14 suggested that RPA32 is faithfully translated in yeast and that its conformation is not compromised.</p><sec><title>RBT1 sequence</title><p>A putative positive identified as a probable RPA32 interacting protein was sequenced and found to have no strong homology to any other previously characterized protein and is subsequently referred to as RBT1. The original clone obtained by yeast two-hybrid was fully sequenced and used in a BLAST search of human ESTs (expressed sequence tags). Sequence overlap was used to pick AI003615 as representing the full coding sequence of RBT1 and part of the 5&#x02032;-UTR and 3&#x02032;-UTR. The full RBT1 sequence is derived from automated sequencing of human EST clone locus AI003615. The nucleotide sequence of clone AI003615 corresponds to the clone obtained by yeast two-hybrid except that this latter clone is truncated at the N-terminal and putatively reads from amino acid 22 (P-A-G-L-Q-S....). The RBT1 cDNA has an open reading frame of 196 amino acids; the nucleotide and amino acid sequence is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd524f1">1</xref>A. <italic>In vitro</italic> translated RBT1 migration corresponded to the theoretical protein size of &#x0223c;22 kDa and this corresponded with western blot analysis using the generated polyclonal anti-RBT1 antibody (data not shown).</p><p>Although RBT1 does not share significant homology with previously characterized proteins, it does contain four motifs with proline residues arranged in a manner similar to the core consensus sequence for SH3 binding proteins or the PY motif of WW domain-binding proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd524f1">1</xref>B). These motifs are arranged pseudo-symmetrically with the first and fourth SH3-like binding motifs sharing the common sequence P-P-E-P, and the second and third P-P-Q. Also, a W-E-W motif is evident 19 amino acids from the N-terminal and 15 amino acids from the C-terminal end of RBT1. In concert with the SH3-like binding motifs, RBT1 may be a protein with &#x02018;mirrored symmetry&#x02019; possibly important for protein&#x02013;protein interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>GST pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitation</title><p>The binding of RPA32 to RBT1 was analyzed by performing a GST pull-down assay. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd524f2">2</xref>, the GST&#x02013;RBT1 and GST&#x02013;RPA14 bind to RPA32 <italic>in vitro,</italic> whereas GST alone does not bind. RPA32 pulled down by GST&#x02013;RPA14 appears significantly stronger than that of GST&#x02013;RBT1; this was as expected since the affinity of interaction between RPA32 and RPA14 is extremely strong. Further, we verified that RPA32 had specificity in this binding assay by including in one experiment GST-tagged Basal Transcription Factor 3 (BTF3) and IKK&#x003b3; both of which did not pull down the <italic>in vitro</italic> translated RPA32 (data not shown).</p><p>Co-immunoprecipitation using anti-RBT1 antibody and revealing with anti-RPA32 antibody also showed RBT1 binding to RPA32 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd524f3">3</xref>); the presence of RBT1 in the anti-RPA32 immunoprecipitate was not demonstrated because of significant background on the immunoblot. While the proportion of RPA32 brought down by the anti-RBT1 polyclonal antibody is less than that of RPA14, it was able to bind more RPA32 than the same amount of anti-XPA polyclonal antibody, a known interactor of RPA32 (data not shown). RPA32 binding to RPA14 has extremely high affinity, but this does not preclude RPA32 binding to other proteins with moderate affinity.</p></sec><sec><title>RBT1 mRNA size and semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR</title><p>A single transcript of &#x0223c;1.6 kb was detected by northern blot analysis in cell line H322 (data not shown). Semi-quantitative PCR and analysis of the clonal origins of the <italic>h</italic>ESTs of RBT1 in GenBank suggest that RBT1 is expressed in various human tissues, but with variance in abundance. We noted a high frequency of EST matches from cancer cell lines and sought to ascertain whether there was a difference in expression between cancer and normal cell lines. Indeed, RBT1 expression levels appear to be significantly higher in all cancer cell lines examined by semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR in comparison to non-transformed cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd524f4">4</xref>). Levels of RBT1 mRNA appear to be at least 5&#x02013;10 times more abundant in cancer cell lines MCF-7, ZR-75, SaOS-2 and H661 as compared to both NHMEC and NHBEC normalizing to GAPDH mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Localization of RBT1</title><p>Cells transfected with GFP alone displayed diffuse green fluorescence throughout the cells. On the other hand, a distinct nuclear fluorescent pattern was observed in cells expressing GFP&#x02013;RBT1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd524f5">5</xref>). RPA32 immunofluorescence overlapped GFP&#x02013;RBT1 demonstrating that the fluorescence is localized to the nucleus. A putative nuclear localization sequence, K-R-K-H, is also found near the N-terminal end of RBT1.</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast one-hybrid and two-hybrid data</title><p>Interactions between RPA32 and RPA14, RPA32 and XPA, and RPA32 with UDG were confirmed by yeast two-hybrid (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd524tb1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd524f6">6</xref>). The protein product of pACT2-RBT1 did not show interaction with the protein products of pBTM116, pLexA-UDG or pLexA-RPA14 suggesting that it is not a spurious positive interactor with RPA32.</p><p>RBT1 and RPA32 were shuffled into pBTM116 and pACT2, respectively, to further verify the interaction. However, we were unable to do so using pLexA-RBT1 because of extremely strong transactivation of the yeast reporter genes by itself. This observation suggested the possibility that RBT1 has characteristics of a transcriptional co-activator (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd524tb1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd524f6">6</xref>). Truncations of the RBT1 sequence suggest that the transactivation domain of RBT1 lies proximal to the C-terminal end of the putative protein. Furthermore, RPA32 interacts with RBT1-&#x00394;C79 which suggests that the binding domain lies somewhere in the N-terminal half of RBT1; RBT1-&#x00394;C79 by itself does not activate the HIS3 reporter gene and has minimal &#x003b2;-gal expression.</p><p>Of note is that the fusion product of LexA-XPA alone transactivates both reporter genes approximately twice as strongly as that shown by the XPA and RPA32 interaction in yeast. The pLexA-XPA transformed yeast cells were plated on media containing leucine, but this difference does not necessarily explain the significant difference. In the context of GAL4 (BD), another group was able to show by yeast two-hybrid the physiological interaction of XPA with RPA32; to perform the yeast two-hybrid screen, XPA is not likely to have had significant reporter gene activity in the context of GAL4 (BD) by itself. Similarly, RBT1 transactivates much more strongly alone than when co-transformed with RPA32&#x02014;binding appears in these cases to repress the strong transactivation by both XPA and RBT1 possibly because the GAL4 transactivation domain is weak relative to these genes or because there is conformational interference between the transactivation domains of the interacting proteins.</p><p>The choice of DNA-binding domains in the yeast two-hybrid may affect the conformation of the gene of interest and therefore impact on observed interactions or physiological effects. It is, however, unlikely that RBT1 is affected by the choice of LexA or GAL4 DNA-binding domain since both such fusions gave transcriptional promoting activities in yeast and mammalian cells, respectively; we cloned into a yeast vector (pAS2-1), RBT1 downstream from GAL4 (DB) and transformation into yeast demonstrated transactivation by the protein product of this construct (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd524tb1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mammalian one-hybrid</title><p>RBT1 in the context of the mammalian one-hybrid system demonstrated strong trans-activity in support of our yeast data. A clone representing the C-terminal 22 amino acids showed extremely high luciferase activity suggesting that much of the transactivation potential of this protein lies within this small domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd524f7">7</xref>A). The initial clone obtained via yeast two-hybrid which lacks 22 amino acids from the putative N-terminal (RBT1-FULL) also gives relatively high activity within the context of the mammalian one-hybrid system.</p><p>The activity of RBT1 was examined in several cell lines, both cancerous and non-transformed, and compared to the activity produced by GAL4-TLS. As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd524f7">7</xref>B, relative luciferase activity is significantly higher in cancer cell lines in comparison to non-transformed lines. RBT1-FULL showed highest activity in MCF-7 cells. These results are not a function of transfection efficiency since the data are reported as ratios of firefly to <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase activity and the raw data was indicative of transfection efficacy.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>RPA plays a pivotal role in DNA metabolism. Its physiological role is associated with DNA destabilization, binding and recognition; it is not surprising then that it has numerous functional interactions with different proteins involved in one or more aspects of DNA replication, repair or recombination. While conventional biochemical methods have described the major interactors of RPA, our library screen suggests that there may be other physiologically relevant interactions that remain uncharacterized. RBT1 may be one of these.</p><p>We attempted to determine the protein interactors of RBT1 by shuffling the clone obtained in the screen into the bait plasmid and subsequently screening our library, but were unable because of the extremely high trans-activity produced by the LexA&#x02013;RBT1 fusion protein alone. We therefore examined whether RBT1 has a functional transactivation domain. Indeed, several proteins have been serendipitously characterized as transcriptional co-activators prior to the initial yeast two-hybrid screen for protein&#x02013;protein interactors; proteins such as BRCA1 and Npw38 were found to contain transcription-promoting activities in yeast and were subsequently found to have similar activities in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c35">35</xref>).</p><p>RBT1 does not have significant homology to any previously characterized protein. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis (TBLASTN) using the RBT1 amino acid sequence did not show any EST homologs in other species with the exceptions of human and mouse. However, we note the presence of SH3-like (or WW domain-like) consensus binding sites arranged in mirrored symmetry. Interestingly, the PY motif is found in the activation domains of many transcriptions factors, including c-Jun, AP-2 and NF-E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c36">36</xref>). One hypothesis for the relevance of the PY motif suggests that transcription stimulation is partially conferred by interaction with WW domain-containing proteins which themselves contain strong transactivation domains. The significance of the proline rich sites in RBT1, which are similar to the PY motif, remains to be determined, but they may be important for interaction with enhancers or repressors of its transactivation function.</p><p>The minimal transactivation domain at the C-terminal end of RBT1 has no significant homology to previously described domains that impart transcription-promoting activities. However, this domain is not particularly acidic suggesting that it is not a spurious trans-activator as can often be the case with acidic amino acid regions. Furthermore, the relative luciferase activity by this domain as well as for full-length RBT1 is at least comparable and often much higher than that observed with our positive control for transactivation, Translocated in Liposarcoma (TLS). TLS was previously described within the context of the mammalian one-hybrid system to have trans-activity similar to levels observed with GAL4 fused to VP16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd524c37">37</xref>). We used TLS as a positive control, and while trans-activity was similar in most cell lines, this was not the case in MCF-7 and Hs578T cells where RBT1 had significantly stronger activity. This suggests the possibility that, at least in some cellular contexts, RBT1 trans-activity is affected by more than one component or pathway of transcription.</p><p>While some random amino acid sequences can produce non-physiological trans-activity in the context of one-hybrid systems, the extremely high level of activity observed for RBT1 in cancer cells indicate that it is likely that the activity observed is physiologically relevant. We suggest that the short, minimal transactivation domain of RBT1, as well as the full-length RBT1, is functionally strong. Mutational analysis of this region will allow us to determine which amino acids are essential for basal transcriptional activity. While binding of co-factors may be necessary for optimal RBT1 trans-activity, the strong transactivation data obtained using the C-terminal of RBT1 suggests that it may itself interact with the basal transcription machinery.</p><p>The observed RBT1 transactivation, within the context of the mammalian one-hybrid system, is high in cancer cell lines in comparison to non-transformed cell lines; transcript level is correlated to this upregulation and this was found to be well correlated to protein levels&#x02014;we were able to detect RBT1 protein in extracts from cancer cell lines but not from normal cell lines (data not shown). We suggest the possibility that RBT1 may play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation or may contribute to the maintenance or promotion of oncogenesis. Overexpression of the GAL4&#x02013;RBT1 construct does not show similar levels of luciferase reporter gene activity in cancerous and non-transformed cell lines suggesting that a co-factor present in abundance in cancerous cells is necessary for optimal transactivation and&#x0002f;or that an inhibitor is not present or is non-functional. Since cancer cell lines usually proliferate with greater vigour, they likely have an abundance of proteins involved in replication and would be conducive to strong RBT1 transactivation.</p><p>One candidate for inhibition of RBT1 transactivation is p53. Preliminary data in this laboratory show significant inhibition of RBT1 transactivation by wild-type (wt) p53. Expression of wt p53 in several p53 null cells &#x0005b;SaOS-2, Hep3B and NIH-3T3(null)&#x0005d; results in a &#x0003e;50&#x00025; decrease in transactivation by RBT1 (data not shown). While the mechanism of this inhibition is yet to be clearly defined, it is plausible that binding of p53 by RPA is correlated to a reduction in the affinity of binding between RBT1 and RPA or that inhibition of RPA by p53 leads to a concomitant inhibition of RBT1. It is also possible that p53 binds RBT1. These possibilities are currently being investigated in conjunction with the determination of the specificity of the inhibition of RBT1 by wt p53 versus p53 mutant forms.</p><p>RBT1 is a novel cDNA encoding a nuclear protein capable of binding RPA32 within the context of the yeast two-hybrid system, as well as GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation. We plan to address other significant questions such as: whether the phosphorylation state of RPA32 affects the affinity of binding to RBT1, whether RBT1 binds to the other subunits of RPA and in which aspects of cellular function including DNA metabolism and DNA repair does RBT1 play a role.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd524f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Structure of RBT1 cDNA.
