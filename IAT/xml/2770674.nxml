During HR, the Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 endonuclease cleaves 3&#x02032; branches of DNA and aberrant 3&#x02032; DNA ends that are refractory to other 3&#x02032; processing enzymes. Here we show that yeast strains expressing fluorescently labeled Rad10 protein (Rad10-YFP) form foci in response to double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by a site-specific restriction enzyme, I-<italic>Sce</italic>I or by ionizing radiation (IR). Additionally, for endonuclease-induced DSBs, Rad10-YFP localization to DSB sites depends on both <italic>RAD51</italic> and <italic>RAD52</italic>, but not <italic>MRE11</italic> while IR-induced breaks do not require <italic>RAD51</italic>. Finally, Rad10-YFP colocalizes with Rad51-CFP and with Rad52-CFP at DSB sites, indicating a temporal overlap of Rad52, Rad51 and Rad10 functions at DSBs. These observations are consistent with a putative role of Rad10 protein in excising overhanging DNA ends after homology searching and refine the potential role(s) of the Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 complex in DSB repair in yeast.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) is highly conserved between the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In both organisms, double-strand breaks (DSBs) are resected, generating 3&#x02032; single-stranded regions that are coated with replication protein A (RPA). Subsequent strand invasion of single-stranded end(s) into a homologous duplex requires that Rad51 recombinase displaces RPA and forms a nucleoprotein filament. In mammalian cells, displacement of RPA and activation of Rad51 is mediated by BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In budding yeast, Rad52 protein facilitates formation of Rad51 filaments by displacing RPA protein and recruiting proteins of the <italic>RAD52</italic> epistasis group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Among these, Rad52 functions downstream of the Mre11&#x02013;Rad50&#x02013;Xrs2 (MRX) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Hence, Rad52 function is required in advance of the functions of many proteins participating late in homologous recombination (HR) (downstream of key nuclease processing events), including those required for homology searching, and excision of extraneous DNA following homology searching and DNA ligation.</p><p>The Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 endonuclease complex in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> participates both in HR and in nucleotide excision repair (NER), recognizing junctions between single- and double-stranded DNA, and cleaving in the double-stranded region a few nucleotides 5&#x02032; to the junction to remove 3&#x02032; nonhomologous ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that the complex is also required for microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), a mode of DSB repair that functions independently of Rad52. MMEJ is also Ku-independent (Yku70&#x02013;Yku80), and is thus distinct from nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). In human cell lines ERCC1 protein, the human homolog of Rad10, also facilitates a mode of homology-mediated DSB repair that is Ku86-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). On the basis of existing evidence, the most likely model is that the Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 endonuclease functions downstream of Rad52, cleaving nonhomologous DNA ends prior to gap filling and DNA ligation of the recombination site. However, the precise timing of Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 recruitment to DSB sites relative to other DSBR proteins has not been directly demonstrated. Additionally, recent work has revealed that Saw1 recruits the Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 complex to DSBs in the context of single-strand annealing (SSA), one mode of DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Other than for SSA, the mechanism by which Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 is recruited to DSBs remains largely unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of fluorescence microscopy in monitoring biochemical events in live yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Three advantages of this experimental approach are especially noteworthy. First, the gene that encodes a given fluorescent protein under study is in the same chromosomal location as the native gene, and is also under control of its endogenous promoter. Thus, physiologically irrelevant overexpression associated with the use of ectopic genes expressed from non-native promoters is avoided. Second, this technique avoids fixation of cells prior to staining with fluorescent antibodies, as is typically the case in mammalian fluorescence microscopy experiments. Thus, the dynamics of the proteins under study are observed in real time in live cells, allowing for the accurate analysis of temporal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Third, HR is monitored at the single-cell level, which allows for the analysis of individual repair events separately. Using this technology, the present study demonstrates that yeast Rad10 tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (Rad10-YFP) is recruited directly to DSB repair foci.</p><p>When a site-specific DSB is induced by the restriction endonuclease I-<italic>Sce</italic>I in a DNA sequence context lacking direct repeat sequences, recruitment of Rad10-YFP to DSB foci requires functional <italic>RAD51</italic> and <italic>RAD52</italic> genes, but not <italic>MRE11</italic>. In contrast, when DSBs are induced by ionizing radiation (IR) during which DNA damage can occur in random DNA sequence contexts including those with direct repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), we find that recruitment of Rad10-YFP to Rad52-CFP foci is <italic>RAD51</italic>-independent. These observations provide the first direct evidence that Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 functions downstream of Rad52 during DSB repair and that its recruitment to DSB sites has different genetic requirements depending on the method by which DSB induction occurs and therefore, probably, the location of the DSB within the genome and the level of DNA sequence homology flanking the DSB. Moreover, the results support a model of HR in which the primary role of Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 is cleavage of DNA ends following homology searching.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Engineering of yeast strains Rad10-YFP and <italic>rad10&#x00394;</italic></title><p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae RAD10</italic> gene was genetically fused in frame at the chromosomal locus with the DNA coding region of YFP to prepare the Rad10-YFP strain in the haploid W303-1A genetic background by the adaptamer-mediated PCR method as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).

Integration time for image acquisition was 800 ms for Rad10-YFP, 400 ms for Rad52-CFP and 400 ms for TetR-RFP. For both setups, microscopes and cameras were controlled by the Volocity software package (Improvision v 3.7.0 for the Zeiss or v 5.0.2 for the Leica). Foci were counted by inspecting images from each focal plane of the <italic>Z</italic>-stack. As is commonly the case in fluorescence microscopy work, with each fluorophore it was necessary to contrast enhance the original images, which was optimized using the gain, offset and gamma contrast parameters of Volocity. The same contrast enhancement settings were used for all images of a given fluorophore. For publication quality images, the settings were re-optimized so that foci could be seen when printed and, for merged images, the opacity and fill settings were changed so that the various colors could be viewed in a single image. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Rad10-YFP strain exhibits an increased polypeptide size consistent with Rad10 expressed as a YFP fusion protein.

The resulting yeast strain expresses a Rad10-YFP fusion protein (Rad10-YFP) that migrates as a 54 kDa polypeptide during SDS PAGE, whereas the untagged protein migrates as a 24 kDa band (compare lanes 2 and 4 with lanes 5&#x02013;7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). A control lane containing GFP protein alone (lane 1) exhibits no signal with &#x003b1;-Rad10 antibody, and extracts from a <italic>rad10</italic> deletion mutation (<italic>rad10&#x00394;</italic>, lane 3) exhibit only background signal of the antibody. As expected, by fluorescence microscopy, the Rad10-YFP strain exhibits yellow fluorescence in the nucleus as indicated by colocalization of the YFP signal with DAPI-stained DNA in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>Next, the functionality of the Rad10-YFP protein <italic>in vivo</italic> was examined. A plasmid-based assay was used to test Rad10-YFP function in SSA and GC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Densitometric analysis of genome blot results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B) shows that the efficiencies of SSA and GC are somewhat lower (86 and 54%, respectively) in the YFP-tagged strain compared with wild-type. However, the fluorescent label does not compromise the function of Rad10 protein during NER, as evidenced by examining the UV radiation sensitivity of the Rad10-YFP strain. Indeed, the Rad10-YFP strain exhibits wild-type levels of survival following exposure to UV-C irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C).</p><p>To determine whether Rad10 protein is recruited to DSBs, such lesions were generated <italic>in vivo</italic> in a strain containing both Rad10-YFP and a unique DSB labeling system previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Specifically, a yeast strain was prepared that expresses the coding sequence for the TetR fused to monomeric red fluorescent protein (TetR-RFP). The strain additionally contains a DNA cassette with 224 copies of the TetR binding sequence abutted with one copy of the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I restriction endonuclease site. I-<italic>Sce</italic>I enzyme was introduced into the strain via a selectable extrachromosomal plasmid under the control of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter (pWJ1320) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Subsequent induction of I-<italic>Sce</italic>I generates a single DSB in close physical proximity to many copies of TetR-RFP protein bound to DNA, thereby enabling visualization of the DSB site as a bright red focus (DSB-RFP) within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Such induction of DSBs results in increased punctate yellow foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, Rad10-YFP panel), indicating the presence of a high local concentration of Rad10-YFP. A significant subset of Rad10-YFP foci colocalized with DSB-RFP foci in DSB-induced cells, indicating that Rad10-YFP protein is indeed recruited to DSB sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Rad10-YFP foci were also observed spontaneously in uninduced cells, but in fewer numbers and they rarely colocalized with the DSB site (see below). Some of these spontaneous events likely reflect the recruitment of the tagged protein to spontaneous DSBs, as previously reported for proteins of the <italic>RAD52</italic> epistasis group, suggesting that Rad10 is recruited to both endonuclease-induced and naturally occurring DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Indeed, cells co-expressing Rad10-YFP and Rad52-CFP exhibited spontaneous Rad52-CFP foci that colocalized with Rad10-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Since spontaneous Rad10 foci were consistently observed at a higher frequency (70&#x02013;80%) than spontaneous Rad52 foci (5&#x02013;10%), many of the Rad10 foci likely reflect the involvement of Rad10 in other DNA repair pathway(s), such as NER and MMEJ.</p><p>To determine the cell cycle dependence of Rad10 foci, cells were scored not only for Rad10-YFP and DSB-RFP foci, but also for cell cycle phase (S, G2/M or G1, see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section). S phase cells manifested the greatest magnitude of DSB-colocalized Rad10 foci, exhibiting approximately a 12-fold increase in DSB-induced cells over that in uninduced controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, wild-type). Colocalized foci were also induced in G2/M and G1 cells, but to a much lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that the repair of DSBs by HR transpires primarily during S phase of the cell cycle, presumably due to ongoing functions of Rad10 such as repair of spontaneous DSBs and NER. The great majority (70&#x02013;80%) of uninduced cells contained at least one Rad10-YFP focus. However, upon DSB induction the increase in the numbers of Rad10-YFP foci matched the increase in the numbers of Rad10-YFP foci colocalized to DSB sites.</p><p>We next examined the genetic requirements of recruitment of Rad10-YFP to DSBs. Isogenic strains deleted for the <italic>MRE11</italic>, <italic>RAD52</italic> or <italic>RAD51</italic> genes (<italic>mre11&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>rad52</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>rad51&#x00394;</italic>) were transformed with the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I expression plasmid, pWJ1320. DSBs were induced and the formation of DSB-colocalized Rad10-YFP foci was monitored in parallel with wild-type controls. The frequency of DSB-colocalized Rad10-YFP foci observed in the <italic>mre11&#x00394;</italic> strain was not appreciably altered relative to the wild-type, (<italic>P</italic>-values &#x0003e; 0.19 in all phases of the cell cycle) indicating that Mre11 protein is not required to recruit Rad10-YFP to DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, compare black wild-type and <italic>mre11&#x00394;</italic> bars). Hence, while visual examination of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> suggests a small reduction in the number of Rad10-YFP foci colocalized with DSB-RFP foci in the <italic>mre11&#x00394;</italic> background, this difference is not statistically significant under the experimental conditions employed. In contrast, <italic>rad52</italic> and <italic>rad51</italic> deletion mutants exhibited very few Rad10-YFP foci localized to sites of DSBs upon I-<italic>Sce</italic>I induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, compare wild-type, <italic>rad52&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>rad51&#x00394;</italic> bars).</p><p>To determine whether Rad10 colocalizes with Rad52 or Rad51 at DSB sites, DSB induction experiments were conducted using triple-labeled Rad10-YFP/DSB-RFP/Rad52-CFP or Rad10-YFP/DSB-RFP/Rad51-CFP strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Triple-labeled experiments were imaged as single focal planes owing to photobleaching of the Rad10-YFP chromophore which precluded the formation of <italic>Z</italic>-stack images (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section). Accordingly, the overall percentage of cells containing Rad10-YFP is reduced in single-plane images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B) versus <italic>Z</italic>-stack images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), since a single focal plane reveals only a portion of the total thickness of the average cell.</p><p>In both strains, colocalization of all three labels (YFP, RFP and CFP) was observed, indicating that Rad10-YFP is present at DSB sites at the same time as Rad52-CFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) or Rad51-CFP (data not shown). Furthermore, &#x0223c;75% of the Rad10-YFP foci that colocalized with the DSB-RFP marker were also colocalized with Rad52-CFP, both in S and G2/M phase cells, while essentially no G1 cells exhibit similar triple colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Hence, most of the Rad10-YFP foci localized to the induced DSBs also had Rad52-CFP present indicating considerable temporal overlap of the functions of Rad10 with Rad52. Altogether, we conclude that Rad10 protein colocalizes with Rad51 and Rad52 proteins at DSBs during S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle.</p><p>Since the repair of DSBs induced by a restriction enzyme can differ from the repair of breaks induced by IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), a series of experiments were done using a gamma source to induce DSBs. Experiments were conducted in both <italic>RAD51</italic> and <italic>rad51&#x00394;</italic> strains containing Rad10-YFP and Rad52-CFP. Two hours post-irradiation, individual and colocalized foci were counted and compared with results from non-irradiated controls. Following IR, the numbers of cells containing at least one Rad10-YFP focus increased similarly in both the <italic>RAD51</italic> and the <italic>rad51&#x00394;</italic> strains relative to non-irradiated controls (1.3- and 1.7-fold, respectively; data not shown). The numbers of cells containing at least one Rad10-YFP/Rad52-CFP colocalized focus also increased in both strains relative to non-irradiated controls (6.2-fold for <italic>RAD51</italic> and 4.2-fold for <italic>rad51&#x00394;</italic>, respectively; data not shown). As with the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I experiments, most of the foci were observed in the S, G2 or M phases of cell cycle. Upon IR induction, the number of S, G2 or M phase cells containing at least one colocalized Rad10-YFP/Rad52-CFP focus increased 4.8-fold for <italic>RAD51</italic> cells and 2.5-fold for <italic>rad51&#x00394;</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, IR induction of colocalizing Rad10 and Rad52 foci is <italic>RAD51</italic>-independent unlike that observed following I-<italic>Sce</italic>I induction. Interestingly, in the absence of IR induction, the number of S, G2 and M phase cells containing at least one spontaneous colocalized Rad10-YFP/Rad52-CFP focus was 2.5-fold higher in <italic>rad51&#x00394; </italic>cells than in <italic>RAD51</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here we monitored in real time, in living yeast cells, several proteins involved in DNA repair, which are expressed from their native chromosomal locations and endogenous promoters. This approach provides a more physiologically relevant aspect to <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical experiments involving cell free extracts or overexpression systems. Our experiments demonstrate that Rad10-YFP foci are induced in response to the formation of DNA DSBs, and that such foci are localized specifically to such sites in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The total number of cells that contained at least one Rad10-YFP focus was high (&#x0223c;70&#x02013;80%) even without induction of DSBs and many of the foci observed are not localized to the induced DSBs. These foci presumably reflect other roles of the Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 complex in yeast, notably NER, MMEJ and spontaneous mitotic recombination, and indicate that Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 is active in a majority of cells at all phases of cell cycle. The observation that the number of spontaneous Rad10-YFP foci is reduced in G1 cells when compared with S and G2/M phase cells suggests that a significant fraction of foci observed is associated with DNA replicative activity, such as spontaneous mitotic recombination events.</p><p>Although the Rad10-YFP protein is regulated by its natural promoter and from its native site, it appears slightly compromised in SSA function (86% of the wild-type level) and GC function (54% of the wild-type level), the two DSB repair processes in which Rad10 plays a role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and data not shown). We suspect that this attenuated functionality is the result of a kinetic lag in the recruitment of Rad10-YFP to the repair site, the YFP tag occluding the binding of other accessory factors, or the YFP tag causing faster dissociation from DSB sites, thus limiting the time available to execute Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 function. However, the fact that the YFP tag does not compromise Rad10 function in NER as measured by UV resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C) suggests that the Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 endonuclease activity itself is fully functional. Indeed, the functionality of the Rad10-YFP fusion protein is comparable to other YFP-tagged DNA repair and checkpoint proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Previous genetic studies have implicated <italic>RAD1</italic> and <italic>RAD10</italic> with <italic>RAD51</italic> and <italic>RAD52</italic> in DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). However, this study constitutes the first direct experimental evidence for the involvement of either <italic>RAD51</italic> or <italic>RAD52</italic> in recruiting Rad10 to DSBs. It is well established that <italic>RAD1</italic> and <italic>RAD10</italic> are required for several modes of HR in yeast, including SSA, MMEJ and synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Here we show that two ways of creating of DSBs (I-<italic>Sce</italic>I and IR) give rise to the formation of Rad10-YFP foci and recruitment to sites of DSBs. However, the genetic requirements observed for Rad10 recruitment are dependent on how and, hence, where we create the break in the genome and likely reflect which modes of repair are being used.</p><p>Following IR, Rad10-YFP/Rad52-CFP colocalized foci are induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that Rad10 is recruited to IR-induced DSBs. The extent of induction is approximately the same whether or not the <italic>RAD51</italic> gene is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). These observations auger well with existing genetic and biochemical evidence for the several modes of DSB repair requiring <italic>RAD10</italic>, not all of which require <italic>RAD51</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). For example, ribosomal DNA, which makes up almost 10% of the genome, is a multiple tandem array containing 150&#x02013;200 repeats. When a DSB occurs in one of these repeats, it is largely repaired by SSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Similarly, events initiated in other repetitive sequences such as Ty elements or delta sequences can also be repaired by SSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). SSA requires <italic>RAD52</italic> but does not strictly require <italic>RAD51</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Since DSBs induced by IR occur in a broad range of DNA sequence contexts throughout the genome, many sequences flanked by DNA repeats are likely repaired by SSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, we explain the 2.5-fold increase in the percentage of <italic>rad51&#x00394;</italic> cells containing spontaneous Rad10-YFP/Rad52-CFP colocalized foci relative to that observed in <italic>RAD51</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) by a shift in repair of spontaneous damage from <italic>RAD51</italic>-dependent GC to <italic>RAD51</italic>-independent SSA. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Model for Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 recruitment to sites of SDSA and SSA in response to either I-<italic>Sce</italic>I- or IR-induced strand breaks. In response to I-<italic>Sce</italic>I-induced strand breaks, Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 is recruited to DSB repair locations following strand invasion and homology searching requiring <italic>RAD52</italic> and <italic>RAD51</italic>. During SDSA, the invading strand copies the homology on the sister chromatid (shown in red) and, after it is displaced, it anneals with the homologous region on the originally cut chromosome (shown in black). Any overlap between the newly annealed strands is removed by the Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 endonuclease. Alternatively, Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 might be recruited to any of the branched structures present during the strand-invasion/DNA synthesis stage of repair without endonuclease function ultimately being utilized. Following IR, however, a broader range of DSB sequence contexts gives rise to Rad10 participation in other DSB repair modes in addition to SDSA. After IR, SSA would presumably represent a fraction of repair events involving Rad10 and would be recruited in a <italic>RAD51</italic>-independent fashion. Following annealing of repeat regions (shown in gray), Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 trims overlap regions, which are then filled, if necessary, and ligated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp709f7"/></fig></p><p>In contrast, the I<italic>-Sce</italic>I<italic>-</italic>induced DSBs in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) are not flanked by DNA repeats and therefore not repaired by SSA. We find that <italic>RAD51</italic> is required for recruitment of Rad10 to the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I sites, consistent with SSA-independent repair. It is unlikely these breaks are repaired via MMEJ, another mode of DSB repair known to require both <italic>RAD1</italic> and <italic>RAD10</italic> since MMEJ has an absolute requirement for <italic>MRE11</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and we show that Rad10 foci form independently of <italic>MRE11</italic>. The break-induced replication (BIR) pathway, which requires <italic>RAD52</italic> and has both <italic>RAD51</italic>-dependent and <italic>RAD51</italic>-independent modes could, in principle, be consistent with the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I-induced repair observed in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). However, we do not think it is the preferred pathway since a strict requirement for <italic>RAD1</italic> or <italic>RAD10</italic> in BIR has not been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30">28&#x02013;30</xref>).</p><p>To explain the <italic>RAD52</italic> and <italic>RAD51</italic> dependence we observe for Rad10 focus formation after I-<italic>Sce</italic>I-induced DSBs, we suggest that the breaks are repaired by SDSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). In a dividing cell where one sister chromatid has been cleaved by I-<italic>Sce</italic>I and the other is still intact, SDSA would be initiated by <italic>RAD52</italic> and <italic>RAD51</italic>-dependent strand invasion. The branched structure may be recognized by Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Indeed, genetic evidence for the requirements of <italic>RAD52</italic>, <italic>RAD51</italic> and <italic>RAD10</italic> in SDSA is consistent with this notion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>Results from experiments in which triply labeled strains containing Rad10-YFP/Rad51-CFP/DSB-RFP or Rad10-YFP/Rad52-CFP/DSB-RFP were induced with I-<italic>Sce</italic>I show that a significant number of Rad10-YFP/DSB-RFP foci also contained either Rad51-CFP or Rad52-CFP suggesting that significant temporal overlap occurs in the functions of Rad10 with either Rad51 or Rad52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). The observation that I-<italic>Sce</italic>I-induced DSBs require Rad51 to recruit Rad10 leads us to speculate that Rad51 strand-exchange activity may be required for efficient recruitment of Rad10 to I-<italic>Sce</italic>I-induced DSBs. Conceivably, the strand-exchange reaction generates a DNA structure in which a region of duplex DNA is abutted next to a region lacking homology in the 3&#x02032; direction (i.e. a 3&#x02032; nonhomologous end). It is possible that Rad51 or Rad52 recruits the Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 complex at the point-in-time when the junction between homologous and nonhomologous DNA is encountered. It will be interesting in the future to determine whether a <italic>rad51</italic> mutant deficient in strand-exchange activity can still recruit Rad10 to I-<italic>Sce</italic>I-induced DSBs and to determine the extent to which Rad51 and/or Rad52 precedes Rad10 temporally during a repair event. Nonetheless, our existing data support a model in which the Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 complex functions after Rad51 and Rad52 helping to execute the final processing of DNA ends by trimming DNA ends prior to ligation.</p><p>In humans, Rad52 protein participates in a three-protein complex with XPF/ERCC1 endonuclease, the human counterpart of Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). However, it remains to be determined whether an analogous three-protein complex involving Rad52 and the Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 endonuclease is generated in yeast, and, if so, whether Rad52 protein recruits Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 to DSB sites via a direct physical interaction. The triple-labeled colocalization experiments presented herein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) show that Rad10 and Rad52 are both present at DSB sites at the same time, but do not provide evidence for a direct protein&#x02013;protein interaction since other proteins may ultimately &#x02018;bridge&#x02019; direct physical interaction between Rad52 and the Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 complex as has been shown for Saw1 in processing recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). It will be of interest to see whether a direct Rad52&#x02013;Rad1&#x02013;Rad10 complex forms <italic>in vitro</italic>, and if so, whether this interaction is required for the recruitment of Rad10.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>California State University Northridge&#x02019;s Competition for Research, Scholarship and Creative Activity Awards [to P.L.F.], the <funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> [<award-id>5-R01-ES011344</award-id> to E.C.F., <award-id>SC2GM081155</award-id> to P.L.F., <award-id>GM50237</award-id>, <award-id>GM67055</award-id> to R.R.], the Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation [to M.L.], the Villum Kann Rasmussen Foundation [to M.L.] and Fundaci&#x000f3;n Alfonso Mart&#x000ed;n Escudero [to S.G.-B.].
