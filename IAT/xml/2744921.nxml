Rapid effects of progesterone on ciliary beat frequency have been reported in the fallopian tubes of cows, but the identity of the receptors mediating this non-genomic action of progesterone is not known. We recently identified a member of the non-genomic membrane progesterone receptor family, mPR gamma, as a candidate for mediating these actions of progesterone. Here, we investigated the possible presence of a related receptor, mPR beta, in the fallopian tubes of mice and women as well as the possible hormonal regulation of mPR beta and gamma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Western blot and immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies were used to characterize the expression and cellular localization of the mPRs in mouse and human tissues. Taqman (Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) assays were used to quantify mRNA levels in the fallopian tubes of two different mouse models after injections with different hormones and specific antagonists.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the fallopian tubes of both mouse and human, the expression of mPR beta and mPR gamma proteins was exclusively found in the ciliated cells. Whereas mPR beta was found on the cilia, mPR gamma was localized at the base of the same ciliated cells, as previously reported. In gonadotropin-primed mice, both mPRs genes were down-regulated after an injection with progesterone. Treatment with estradiol rapidly down-regulated the level of mPR beta mRNA and protein in immature mice. The mPR gamma protein was down-regulated around the time of ovulation in cycling women, similar to the regulation observed in mice stimulated to ovulate via gonadotropin injections.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings show the presence and hormonal regulation of two distinct mPRs associated with the cilia of the fallopian tubes in both mice and women. It is hypothesized that these receptors are involved in the control of ciliary movement and, thus, gamete transport in the fallopian tubes of mammals.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The fallopian tube (oviduct) of mammals consists mainly of muscular, ciliated and secretory cells. A central function of the fallopian tube is to facilitate gamete transport, fertilization and early embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Gamete transport in the fallopian tube is reported to depend on both smooth muscle contractility and the action of cilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, inhibition of muscle contractility by isoproterenol did not affect ovum transport in fallopian tube of rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and much of the literature supports ciliary activity as the most important factor regulating gamete transport rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Sex steroids are involved in the control of gamete transport and ciliary activity in the fallopian tube. Estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) treatment accelerates ovum transport from 72 h to 24 hours in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], facilitates sperm migration and induces adhesion of spermatozoa to the oviductal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Concomitant treatment with progesterone (P<sub>4</sub>) blocked E<sub>2</sub>-induced ovum transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], whereas P<sub>4 </sub>alone retarded the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Progesterone also acts directly on the sperm membrane to promote sperm motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and induces the acrosome reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The cumulus cells surrounding the travelling ovum is a source for P<sub>4 </sub>in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], rabbit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and pig [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It is possible that P<sub>4 </sub>secreted from the oocyte cumulus complex acts as a beacon to the cilia of the fallopian tube, indicating its detailed position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Indeed, understanding the underlying mechanism of E<sub>2 </sub>and P<sub>4 </sub>action in the regulation of tubal function is important.</p><p>Traditionally, P<sub>4 </sub>is thought to mediate its effects through its nuclear receptors, PGR-A and PGR-B, which are often co-expressed within the same cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], to alter gene transcription. Not all effects of P<sub>4</sub>, however, can be explained by this classical mechanism of steroid action. It has been suggested that P<sub>4 </sub>together with PGR present in the cytoplasm could initiate a non-genomic signaling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Rapid responses to P<sub>4 </sub>have also been reported in tissues or cells naturally lacking nuclear PGR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and in <italic>Pgr </italic>knockout models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], suggesting an involvement of other non-related receptors. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A few years ago, a novel family of putative receptors (mPRs), including mPR&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;, were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The mPRs belong to the Class II progestin and adipoQ receptors family (PAQR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. There is a growing set of data, to suggest a supporting role of the mPRs as functional progestin receptors in different vertebrates, although there are still some controversies about their function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The best described forms are the mPR&#x003b1; and mPR&#x003b2; proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], whereas mPR&#x003b3; is less studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>We have previously shown that mPR&#x003b3; is expressed at the apical cell membrane of ciliated cells in the mouse and human fallopian tube, leading us to hypothesize that mPR&#x003b3; can be a mediator of rapid effects of P<sub>4 </sub>on ciliary activity in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Monkkonen et al. (2007) reported the expression of the mPR&#x003b2; gene in a fallopian tube cell line possessing secretory epithelial cell properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and Romero-Sanch&#x000e9;z et al. (2008) reported expression of the mPR&#x003b2; and &#x003b1; protein in all epithelial cells of the human fallopian tube, but the intracellular localization of the receptors remained unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In this study we demonstrate a distinct membrane-associated localization of both mPR&#x003b2; and &#x003b3; in ciliated cells of the fallopian tube in mice and women. Whereas mPR&#x003b3; is found at the base of the cilia, mPR&#x003b2; is located along the cilia themselves. Furthermore, we show regulation of both mPR&#x003b2; and &#x003b3; by sex steroid treatment in mice and a variable mPR&#x003b2; expression in fallopian tubes of women during the menstrual cycle. Our results suggest the possibility for a cooperative role of mPR&#x003b2; and &#x003b3; in gamete transport.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies, hormones and reagents</title><p>For Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry studies, the following primary and secondary antibodies were used: mPR&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], mPR&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], &#x003b2; tubulin-IV (T7941; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), PGR (sc-539; C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc, Santa Cruz, CA) and FSHr (sc-7798; N-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc).

To examine whether exogenous E<sub>2 </sub>and P<sub>4 </sub>regulate mPR&#x003b2; and &#x003b3; expression, individual groups of 21-day-old female mice were therefore given one i.p. injection E<sub>2 </sub>(0.3 mg/kg) or P<sub>4 </sub>(4 mg/kg). To investigate whether the nuclear estrogen receptors (ESRs) and PGRs are involved in the regulation of mPR, we used the ESR antagonist ICI 182,780 (ICI, 8.3 mg/kg) and the PGR-A/B antagonist CDB2914 (CDB, 1 mg/animal). All compounds were suspended in 100 &#x003bc;l of sesame oil (Sigma). After 2 h and 6 h of treatment, one group of animals (n = 5) was killed, and the tissues were frozen immediately for RNA preparation. To study the regulation of the mPR proteins, fallopian tubes were sampled 6 h and 24 h after injection with either E<sub>2 </sub>or oil and were frozen in liquid nitrogen for Western blot analysis. Whereas RNA analyses were performed on individual samples, pooling of tissue from ten individual mice was required for each protein analysis. Thus, the experiment with E<sub>2 </sub>and oil was repeated several times to generate three independent pools of tissue from each treatment group for the analyses of mPR&#x003b2; and &#x003b3;.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of mPR&#x003b2; and &#x003b3; in eCG-stimulated female mouse fallopian tube following hormonal treatment</title><p>In the mouse, the levels of expression of PGR and ESR are increased after hormonal treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Therefore, to verify the effect of steroid treatment in a model expected to have higher levels of nuclear receptors, as well as being closer to a developmental stage when the control of gamete transport becomes important, we also used a gonadotropin-primed mouse model. Immature female mice (21-day-old) were given a single i.p. injection of 5 IU equine Chorionic Gonadotropin (eCG).

In mice given this treatment, serum E<sub>2 </sub>concentrations are increased by 24 h after eCG administration, reaching a peak after 48 h, whereas P<sub>4 </sub>concentration are increased after post-hCG administration and peak around 48 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The serum levels of E<sub>2 </sub>and P<sub>4 </sub>in immature mice upon treatment with eCG/hCG is similar to those of adult cyclic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].

Prior to the operation, informed consent from the patients and approval by the institutional committee on the use of human subjects in Gothenburg (RS175-99 to A. Thurin) were obtained. All women had a clinical examination before surgery and had regular menstrual cycles (cycle length, 25-32 days). No woman had used hormonal medication within three months of surgery. The menstrual phase of each patient at the day of operation was classified based on previous menstrual history, serum steroids and luteinizing hormone-levels in urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. A cross-section of the isthmus part of the fallopian tube was taken from each patient. One part was fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned and mounted.

A single batch of 0.5 &#x003bc;g of total RNA from each sample was used to synthesize single-stranded cDNA using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits (Applied Biosystems). Primers targeting the cDNA sequence of mPR&#x003b2; (sense, 5'-CGGCGGCTGCTTTCTGT-3' and antisense, 5'-TAAGGCCGTCGGTAGCGATA-'3), mPR&#x003b3; (sense, 5'-CTCCCTAGGCTATTCCGCATAG-3' and antisense, 5'-GGATGCCCTGCTCATGGA-3') and GAPDH, used as an endogenous control (sense, 5'-TGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA-3' and antisense, 5'-ATGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCT-3') were designed by using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) and purchased from Cybergene AB, Stockholm, Sweden. The corresponding cDNA fragments were denatured at 98&#x000b0;C for 2 min, annealed at 59&#x000b0;C for 30 sec. The number of RT-PCR cycles was chosen to generate detectable signals without approaching saturation in any samples.

The PCR parameters were set according to the manufacturer's protocol. All reactions were performed in duplicate for both target genes and endogenous controls. The efficiencies of target and the endogenous controls were similar. Because not all samples could be run at the same time, one standard sample was run five times as duplicates in all assays to compensate for possible run to run variations. The expression of each target gene was normalized to the endogenous control (GAPDH) by subtracting the CT- value from the target gene with the CT-value of the endogenous control. To compare levels relative to a calibrator (mean of Group 1), &#x00394;CT of group 1 was subtracted from the &#x00394;CT of each sample.

Samples from male and female mice used in the tissue distribution experiment were prepared according to Bordier et al. (1981) and Nutu et al., (2007). Thirty &#x003bc;g of protein were run by electrophoresis on 4-12% one-dimensional Bis-Tris gels (Novex, San Diego, CA, USA). In experiments in which both mPR&#x003b2; (1:5000), mPR&#x003b3; (1:100), PGR (1:250) and follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHr; 1:250) were assessed, the gels were cut into two pieces along a line corresponding to approximately 60 kDa. The section containing higher molecular weights was exposed to antibodies against PGR, or FSHr, and the lower molecular weight section was exposed to antibodies against mPR&#x003b2; or &#x003b3;. Separate gels and membranes were run for the two mPRs as they have very similar molecular masses. The immunosignal-CDP-Star ready-to-use substrate for the alkaline phosphatase system (Tropix, Bedford, MA, USA) was used to visualize protein bands. Immunoblotted signals were quantified by densitometry using the Quantity One Software package (version 4.2, BioRad, Hercules, CA) directly after detection in a Fluor-S multi-imager (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Sundbyberg, Sweden). The loading was evaluated by staining the gels with Coomassie blue. Signal intensities of the individual protein were normalized to the gels stained with Coomassie blue and presented as ratios that represent arbitrary densitometric units (ADU) of relative abundance.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemical analysis and confocal microscopy</title><p>Single and dual-fluorescence immunohistochemistry were based on the previously described methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Approximately 4 &#x003bc;m thick tissue sections were placed on glass slides, deparaffinized, rinsed in ethanol and re-hydrated through a series of decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Antigens were retrieved by boiling with an antigen unmasking solution for 20 min at 120&#x000b0;C, which was followed by cooling in dH<sub>2</sub>O for 5 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked with the background sniper (Biocare medical, Concord, CA USA), for 10 min at a room temperature.

The MACH 3 rabbit AP (alkaline phosphatase) polymer kit and MACH 3 mouse HRP (horse radish peroxidase) polymer kit (Biocare Medical) were used as the detection systems, and the immunostaining was visualized by using Vulcan Fast Red Chromagen Kit and Romulin AEC Chromagen Kit (Biocare Medical) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sections were counter stained with hematoxylin, dehydrated through a series of increasing concentrations of ethanol to clear the tissue and cover-slipped. The immunostaining and detection of mPR&#x003b3; protein were performed using the same protocol as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Negative control slides were prepared in an identical manner and processed with a ready-to-use mouse or rabbit IgG negative control (Biocare Medical) instead of the primary antibody. Slides were viewed on a Nikon EFD-3 (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) microscope under bright field optics and photographed. The immunofluorescences on the slides were viewed on an Axiovert 200 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a laser-scanning confocal imaging LSM 510 META system (Carl Zeiss) and was photomicrographed. Background settings were adjusted from examination of negative control specimens. Images of positive staining were adjusted to make the optimal use of the dynamic range of detection.

In contrast to earlier reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], we show a distinct expression of mPR&#x003b2; on the cilia proper and of mPR&#x003b3; at the base of the same cilia. We hypothesize that mPR&#x003b2; and mPR&#x003b3; have cooperative, but still distinctive functions in controlling ciliary movement and, thus, gamete transport in the fallopian tube of mammals. A demonstrated down-regulation of both mPRs after exogenous P<sub>4 </sub>treatment adds support to the previously proposed roles of the mPRs as functional P<sub>4 </sub>receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]</p><p>We previously reported a detailed tissue distribution of mPR&#x003b3; in male and female mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the present study, we show that the mPR&#x003b2; protein is expressed in reproductive tissues such as fallopian tube, ovary and testis of both male and female mice. In other species, including human, pig, rat and fish, the expression of mPR&#x003b2; has been reported not only in reproductive tissues, but in non-reproductive tissues as well, including brain, heart and liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This was also the case in the mouse; however, the relative expression level of mPR&#x003b2; between different organs appears to vary between species. The mPR&#x003b2; appears to be expressed more evenly between tissues compared with mPR&#x003b3;. In contrast to the high expression level of mPR&#x003b3; in liver, mPR&#x003b2; was almost undetectable in this organ. There were no marked differences in expression between the sexes for mPR&#x003b2;, except for the reproductive tissues. We did not find a particularly high level of mPR&#x003b2; expression in the brain, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]; however, this may be because we only studied the general tissue distribution in pre-pubertal animals.</p><p>Membrane progesterone receptor &#x003b2; was found in the motile cilia of epithelial cells in fallopian tube of both mice and women. The co-localization of mPR&#x003b2; and &#x003b2;-tubulin IV, a cellular marker for cilia, also confirms the specific localization. In contrast, Romero-S&#x000e1;nchez et al. (2008) reported immunostaining of all epithelial cells, including both secretory and ciliated cells, in the human fallopian tube using the same mPR&#x003b2; antibody as in our study. However, the localization within these cell types was unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. We have experienced that different fixation and staining techniques can give rise to a rather general intracellular staining using this and other antibodies (unpublished data). Qui et al. (2008) also show that the staining technique can be crucial, as addition of Triton X100 switched the staining by another antibody against mPR&#x003b2; from the plasma membrane to a general intracellular staining in porcine cumulus cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to optimize the protocol to achieve the most specific staining possible. Several other studies, which used the same antibody used in the present study, report a plasma membrane localization of mPR&#x003b2; in different cells and species, including human myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], human T lymphocytes and Jurkat cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and mouse gonadotropes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Other studies report an intracellular localization of mPR&#x003b2; and &#x003b3;, possibly in the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The transcript for mPR&#x003b2; has endoplasmatic reticulum export and endocytosis internalization motifs, which is in agreement with a potential intracellular localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. It is important to stress that steroids easily pass the plasma membrane, thus the ligand(s) for mPR&#x003b2; could quite possibly reach the receptor irrespective of its cellular localization.</p><p>Within the fallopian tube of mice and women, both mPR&#x003b2; and &#x003b3; are expressed exclusively in the ciliary epithelial cells. We previously reported that mPR&#x003b3; was associated with the apical membrane at the base of the cilia of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Here, we show that mPR&#x003b2; is expressed on the same cells, but in contrast to mPR&#x003b3;, the receptors are found on the cilia themselves. The close association of both receptors with the cilia suggests an involvement in the regulation of ciliary activity by P<sub>4</sub>. In the cow, P<sub>4 </sub>decreases ciliary beat frequency within 15 minutes, and the effect cannot be blocked by a nuclear P<sub>4 </sub>receptor antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The co-occurrence of both receptors in the same cells also provides a possibility for a cooperative role. Cooperative roles for different mPR subtypes have been demonstrated previously in the induction of oocyte maturation in fish and in the regulation of PGR transactivation in human myometrial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Interestingly, recent studies indicate the stimulatory effects of progestins on flagella activity and motility of fish and human sperm are mediated through a mPR subtype, mPR&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. A clear relationship between the abundance of the mPR protein on sperm membranes and sperm motility has been observed both in fish and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Taken together the results suggest a possible widespread involvement of mPRs as intermediaries in progesterone modulation of the activities of ciliated and flagellated cells.</p><p>The classical PGR is also expressed in the fallopian tube; however, there is somewhat conflicting data regarding its distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. In the mouse, immunostaining for PGR was reported in the nuclei of luminal epithelial, stroma and smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], whereas in women the staining for PGR was restricted to the nuclei of epithelial and stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. In another study, no immunostaining was found for the classical PGR in the nuclei of any cell type in the mouse fallopian tube, whereas an intense staining was demonstrated in cilia proper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], quite similar to the staining for mPR&#x003b2; reported here. In this context, it may be stressed that there are no apparent sequence similarities between the classical PGR and mPR&#x003b2;, thus little risk for one antibody to have high affinity for the other receptor. Several studies report a possible non-genomic, rapid signaling of P<sub>4 </sub>through PGR in different cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Also, a plasma membrane localization of the classical PGR has also been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Together, this suggests that the ciliated cells of the fallopian tubes are equipped with a suite of P<sub>4 </sub>receptors, which all could be involved in controlling the beating of the cilia or possibly being involved in feedback systems by controlling receptor expression.</p><p>There is accumulating evidence that the family of mPRs (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;) act as receptors. Criteria, supporting a receptor function of the mPRs include information on plausible structure, tissue specificity, sub-cellular localization, steroid binding, signal transduction, hormonal regulation and biological relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Although the aim of the present study has not been to scrutinize the classification of the mPRs as receptors, the generated data adds to the body of observations supporting such a role. One important observation is the plasma-membrane-association of mPR&#x003b2; and mPR&#x003b3; on the ciliary cells, i.e. a plausible sub-cellular localization. Also, the location of mPR&#x003b2; on cilia of the fallopian tube, a cell-type known to respond rapidly within minutes to P<sub>4</sub>, is coherent with a receptor-role of mPR&#x003b2; and mPR&#x003b3;. Furthermore, treatment with exogenous P<sub>4</sub>down-regulates both mPR&#x003b2; and mPR&#x003b3; in gonadotropin-primed female mice within a few hours in the mouse fallopian tube. Indeed, it is very common that steroid receptors are regulated by their own ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The functional fish progestin 17, 20&#x003b2;-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20&#x003b2;-DHP) down-regulates mPR&#x003b2; mRNA in the ovary of the channel catfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. In human myometrial cells, however, P<sub>4 </sub>does not affect the expression of mPR&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. We could only demonstrate a down-regulation by P<sub>4 </sub>in gonadotropin-primed mice, but not in immature mice. Thus, it appears that the regulation of mPRs by P<sub>4 </sub>differs between species, tissues and developmental stages.</p><p>The regulation of mPR&#x003b2; and mPR&#x003b3; by exogenous P<sub>4 </sub>could be mediated via a direct stimulation of P<sub>4 </sub>receptors on the cililary cells, or for example by modulating the release of gonadotropins. Receptors for FSH in the fallopian tube have been reported, but their physiological function in this organ is yet unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. In estrogen-primed, castrated rats P<sub>4 </sub>induces the release of both FSH and LH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. This model resembles the eCG-injected immature mouse model where the eCG injection induces endogenous estrogen production. We could demonstrate a regulation of both mPR&#x003b2; and mPR&#x003b3; by P<sub>4 </sub>in mice primed with eCG, but not in immature mice. This observation would be coherent with P<sub>4 </sub>regulating the mPRs via a hypothalamic/pituitary action and a stimulated gonadotropin secretion, although this hypothesis needs to be further tested. There was a similar trend of a reduced expression of both mPR&#x003b2; and mPR&#x003b3; in the estrogen-treated eCG-primed mice, consistent with an expected feedback on the gonadotropin release, but the effect was not statistically significant. On the other hand, E<sub>2 </sub>rapidly and significantly reduced the expression of mPR&#x003b2;, but not mPR&#x003b3; in the immature mouse model, clearly suggesting a gonadotropin-independent regulation. Tentative E<sub>2 </sub>and P<sub>4 </sub>response elements have been identified upstream from both the mPR&#x003b2; and mPR&#x003b3; genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], suggesting the possibility of a direct effect mediated via the classical steroid receptors. Direct regulation in vitro of mPRs by P<sub>4 </sub>and other progestin hormones has also been demonstrated previously in human myocytes and teleost ovaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. As the travelling cumulus complex actively produces and releases steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the epithelium of the fallopian tube probably encounters higher steroid levels for a brief time period than do most cells in the body. Thus, it is possible that it is not the circulating steroids that are most important for regulating mPR expression in the fallopian tube, but rather steroids produced inside the fallopian tube. Indeed, the activation of sperm swimming by P<sub>4 </sub>is thought to be due to a gradient of locally produced P<sub>4 </sub>as the spermatozoa approaches the ovum inside the fallopian tube [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Notably, there is no intra-tubal steroid production in either the immature or the eCG model.</p><p>Access to samples from women undergoing tubal ligations at different time points in their menstrual cycles allowed us to start addressing the physiological regulation of mPRs in the human fallopian tube. Both mPR&#x003b2; and mPR&#x003b3; are expressed on the ciliated cells of the human fallopian tube, similar to their location in mice. Interestingly, the expression of mPR&#x003b3; was lower in women sampled close to mid cycle, i.e., around the time of ovulation, whereas there was no clear regulation of mPR&#x003b2;. The general pattern of a down-regulation of mPR&#x003b3; and a more stable expression of mPR&#x003b2; was also observed in mice induced to ovulate via two injections with gonadotropins. This pattern suggests that there are commonalities between the regulation of mPRs in the fallopian tube of mice and women, adding confidence to the use of mice as a human model in this context. The lack of apparent regulation of mPR&#x003b2; in both ovulating mice and women may be somewhat difficult to interpret in relation to the results from the steroid injections, as there indeed are marked variations in the circulating steroid levels before and after ovulation in both species. Possibly, more frequent sampling could have revealed variations in the receptor expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated the presence of mPR&#x003b2; and &#x003b3; in ciliated cells of the fallopian tube of mice and women and the regulation of these receptors by P<sub>4 </sub>and/or E<sub>2</sub>. These observations further strengthen the role of the ciliated cells of the fallopian tube as important physiological targets for P<sub>4</sub>.
