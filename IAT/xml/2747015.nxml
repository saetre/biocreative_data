We have recently demonstrated that NK cells respond to human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-infected autologous T-cells, in part, through the recognition of ligands for the NK cell activating receptor NKG2D on the surface of the infected cells. Uninfected primary CD4<sup>pos</sup> T-cell blasts express little, if any, NKG2D ligands. In the present study we determined the mechanism through which ligands for NKG2D are induced on HIV-1-infected cells. Our studies reveal that expression of <italic>vpr</italic> is necessary and sufficient to elicit the expression of NKG2D ligands in the context of HIV-1 infection. Vpr specifically induces surface expression of the unique-long 16 binding proteins (ULBP)-1 and ULBP-2, but not ULBP-3, MHC class I-related chain molecules (MIC)-A or MIC-B. In these studies we also demonstrated that Vpr increases the level of ULBP-1 and ULBP-2 mRNA in primary CD4<sup>pos</sup> T-cell blasts. The presence of ULBP-1 and ULBP-2 on HIV-1 infected cells is dependent on the ability of Vpr to associate with a protein complex know as Cullin 4a (Cul4a)/damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1) and Cul4a-associated factor-1(DCAF-1) E3 ubiquitin ligase (Cul4a<sup>DCAF-1</sup>). ULBP-1 and -2 expression by Vpr is also dependent on activation of the DNA damage sensor, ataxia telangiectasia and rad-3-related kinase (ATR). When T-cell blasts are infected with a <italic>vpr</italic>-deficient HIV-1, NK cells are impaired in killing the infected cells. Thus, HIV-1 Vpr actively triggers the expression of the ligands to the NK cell activation receptor.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Natural killer (NK) cells are part of the innate immune response against virus infection and cancer. Recently we demonstrated that ligands for the NK cell activation receptor, NKG2D, trigger NK cell-mediated response to infected cells. These ligands are expressed on HIV-1-infected cells and not on uninfected cells. Despite the observation that NKG2D ligands are expressed on infected cells, it is unclear how HIV-1 induces their expression. In the present study, we demonstrate that HIV induces the ligands of the NKG2D receptor through the viral gene product Vpr. Vpr triggers a DNA damage response in infected cells, which in turn, increases virus production. We also demonstrate that by blocking the activity of ATR, a major component in the DNA damage response, we were able to prevent NKG2D ligand expression. When Vpr was removed from the virus genome, NK cells lost their ability to lyse the HIV-infected cells. Thus, HIV-1 actively triggers NK cells through the activity of its viral gene product, Vpr.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>NK cells are involved in the immune response against tumor cells and virus-infected cells without the requirement for previous exposure to their targets or their products.

CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells express less perforin than CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells but higher concentrations of cytokines and as such are important in regulating immune responses.</p><p>NK cell release of cytotoxic contents is regulated by a large array of signals provided by a variety of membrane-bound, activating receptors expressed on NK cells that interact with their corresponding ligands on target cells (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Lanier1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> for a current list of all known activating receptors and their ligands). Almost all NK cell activating receptors interact with adaptor proteins containing activation domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Lanier1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Activation receptors can be divided into those associated with intracellular tyrosine activation motifs (ITAM)-containing adaptor molecules and those associating with adaptor molecules lacking ITAMs. ITAM-dependent receptors include: CD16 (low affinity IgG receptor), and the natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs; NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Moretta1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The NKG2D receptor is an example of an ITAM-independent activation receptor. NKG2D is found on almost all peripheral blood NK cells and is a member of the NKG2 receptor family. NKG2D does not associate with CD94, but forms homo-dimers on the membrane of NK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Houchins1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Wu1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Although NKG2D specifically recognizes its ligands on target cells and is important for activation of NK cells, it does not induce signal transduction within the cells. For this purpose, NKG2D associates, on the membrane, with the DAP10 adaptor molecule.

Although we did not directly assess the role of soluble Vpr, our observations produced no evidence that soluble Vpr released by HIV-infected cells would induce NKG2D ligands on uninfected cells. We base this notion on the fact that uninfected (HIV-1 p24<sup>neg</sup>) cells within infected cultures do not express NKG2D ligands on their surface. Only HIV-1 p24<sup>pos</sup> cells express NKG2D ligands (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000613-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000613.s002">S2</xref>). Hence, we propose that Vpr must be expressed within the infected cells in order to induce NKG2D ligand expression.</p><p>HIV-1 accessory gene products other than Vpr appear to have no effect on the expression of NKG2D ligands. Our observations here are in contrast to those of Cerboni <italic>et al.</italic> who showed that HIV-1 Nef down-regulates ULBPs from the cell surface of Jurkat T-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Cerboni1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. The contradictory observations made in our studies may suggest that there are differences in the ability of Nef to modulate NKG2D ligands between activated primary T-cells and transformed T-cell lines. The &#x00394;Nef virus we used in our study does not express Nef even though it expresses Vpr (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000613.s008">Figure S8B</xref>).</p><p>The Cul4a<sup>DCAF-1</sup> ubiquitin ligase contributes to the ability of Vpr to arrest HIV-1-infected cells in G<sub>2</sub> phase of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-DeHart1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-DeHart2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>; in our current studies we showed that this ligase is important in Vpr-induced NKG2D ligand expression as well. E3 ubiquitin ligases transfer ubiquitin molecules to specific substrates. Poly-ubiquitination can mark substrates for degradation by the proteasome. We attempted to test the role of proteasomal degradation in induction of NKG2D ligands. Unfortunately, proteasome inhibitors were highly toxic to primary T-cells and, therefore, the possible role of proteasomal activity in degrading NKG2D ligands is unknown at this time (data not shown).</p><p>Our expectation was that induction of cell-surface expression of ULBP-1 and ULBP-2, would trigger NK cells to kill infected cells. This indeed is what we found, since NK cells have a decreased ability to lyse virus-infected cells lacking Vpr. Moreover, the reduction in killing activity of the &#x00394;Vpr virus was strikingly similar to that obtained against WT virus-infected cells in which we masked the NKG2D receptor. We have reported, in previous published studies, that variations exist between HIV-infected donors in the capacity of their NK cells to kill autologous HIV-infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Fogli1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. We observed killing from as little as 4&#x00025; and as high as 20&#x00025; in 8 donors using an E&#x02236;T ratio of 10&#x02236;1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Fogli1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, The level to which NK cells lysed HIV-infected targets directly correlated with the extent to which ULBP2 was expressed on the surface of the infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Fogli1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Those observations provide indirect support to our model that Vpr, through enhancing ULBP expression, may prime cells for lysis by NK.</p><p>NK cell function in HIV-infected individuals is similar to that of uninfected individuals unless the patient is highly viremic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Mavilio1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.

Despite the presence of dysfunctional NK cells in viremic individuals, there are subpopulations of functional NK cells in these patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Mavilio1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref> with residual ability to lyse autologous HIV-infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Fogli1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been shown that this residual activity required recognition of NKG2D ligands on the infected cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Fogli1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Based on our studies, the expected consequence of Vpr's induction of ULBP-1 and -2 would be that HIV-1-infected cells would become sensitive to killing by NK cells. This scenario would clearly be detrimental to virus replication. A logical explanation for this paradox is that up-regulation of ULBPs by Vpr is a downstream consequence of its biological activity (e.g., Vpr induces LTR transactivation in the G<sub>2</sub> phase of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Goh1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that other unknown cellular factors may compensate for the activity of Vpr to collectively modulate the sensitivity of HIV-infected cells to lysis by NK cells.</p><p>It is difficult to reconcile how HIV-1 could persist if it increases the likelihood of being destroyed by NK cells through induction of ULBP-1 and ULBP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000613-g004">Figure 4</xref>) by Vpr on the cell surface and down modulating ligands (i.e., HLA-A and &#x02013;B) to NK cell inhibitory receptors by Nef <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Cohen1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Part of the answer may lie in the fact that Nef does not down modulate HLA-C and HLA&#x02013;E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Cohen1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Bonaparte1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. We have published previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Bonaparte1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref> that NK cells lacking HLA-C and &#x02013;E inhibitory receptors kill infected cells by 5-20-fold over unsorted NK cells. Blocking HLA-C and &#x02013;E on HIV-infected cells from interacting with inhibitory receptors on NK cells enhances NK cells' ability to kill HIV-infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Bonaparte1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Overall these findings indicate that HLA-C and &#x02013;E on the infected cells prevent NK cells from killing the infected cells because inhibitory receptors are engaged on NK cells. However, our previous study also indicated that a sufficient number of NK cells lack HLA-C and HLA&#x02013;E inhibitory receptors and thus would not be inhibited by these MHC class I molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Cohen1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Bonaparte1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The presence of ULBP-1, ULBP-2 on the infected cell surface would allow the subpopulation of NK cells not regulated by HLA-C and HLA&#x02013;E to kill the HIV-1-infected cells. However, NK cells are also regulated at the level of coactivating receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Bryceson1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Degranulation by NK cells following the triggering of NKG2D requires simultaneous engagement of co-activating receptors such as 2B4 or NTB-A by their ligands on target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Bryceson1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the relatively low lytic activity induced by Vpr through ULBP-1 and -2 induction could be explained on the basis of lack of concomitant induction of coactivating ligands. Recently we demonstrated that co-activating ligands are important for NK cell destruction of HIV-1-infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Ward1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and that HIV-1 down modulates the coactivating receptor ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Ward1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000613-Fogli1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. This would then make the infected cell less vulnerable to destruction since activated NK cells will have a reduced ability to degranulate. We are currently investigating how HIV-1 down modulates the ligands for the NK cell coactivating receptors in order to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Our observation that HIV-1 Vpr induces NK cell ligands opens a new set of questions that will need to be addressed in the near future. Specifically, it will be compelling to ascertain whether up-regulation of ULBP-1 and 2 by Vpr can be exploited therapeutically, such that HIV-1 infected cells can be manipulated to become more susceptible to NK lysis; (ii) whether other accessory or, in general, viral proteins can manipulate other aspects of the NK response; and (iii) the signaling steps linking activation of cell cycle checkpoint proteins and the increase in steady-state mRNA levels for NKG2D ligands.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies and fusion proteins</title><p>The mouse anti-human CD4, CD16, CD56, CD112 and MIC-A/MIC-B monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were obtained from BD Biosciences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www. bdbiosciences.com/">http://www. bdbiosciences.com/</ext-link>).
