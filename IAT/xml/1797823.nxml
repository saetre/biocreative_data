In zebrafish, it has been proposed that Her proteins repress the transcription of their own mRNA. However, in its simplest form, this model is incompatible with the fact that morpholino knockdown of Her proteins can impair expression of their mRNA. Simple self-repression models also do not account for the spatiotemporal pattern of gene expression, with waves of gene expression shrinking as they propagate. Here we study computationally the networks generated by the wealth of dimerization possibilities amongst transcriptional repressors in the zebrafish somitogenesis clock. These networks can reproduce knockdown phenotypes, and strongly suggest the existence of a Her1&#x02013;Her7 heterodimer, so far untested experimentally. The networks are the first reported to reproduce the spatiotemporal pattern of the zebrafish somitogenesis clock; they shed new light on the role of Her13.2, the only known link between the somitogenesis clock and positional information in the paraxial mesoderm. The networks can also account for perturbations of the clock by manipulation of FGF signaling. Achieving an understanding of the interplay between clock oscillations and positional information is a crucial first step in the investigation of the segmentation mechanism.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Vertebrate embryos acquire a segmented structure along the anteroposterior axis. Segmentation is critical for patterning of other structures (such as nerves, vertebrae, muscles, and blood vessels) and occurs by the rhythmic separation of balls of cells, called somites, from the anterior end of their precursor tissue, called the presomitic mesoderm. These rhythmic events are associated with oscillatory gene expression in the presomitic mesoderm: waves of gene expression originate at the posterior end and spread anteriorly. When a wave reaches the anterior end, a pair of new somites detaches. The set of genes whose expression oscillates is termed the &#x0201c;somitogenesis clock.&#x0201d; Even though the zebrafish somitogenesis clock has been the subject of intensive study, it is not clear how its oscillations are generated. It has been proposed that the mechanism involves a simple negative feedback loop, with proteins of the Her family periodically repressing their own expression. However, this is incompatible with some experimental results and does not explain how the spatiotemporal pattern of gene expression is generated. Here I propose a model&#x02014;based on physical interactions between Her proteins&#x02014;that is compatible with experimental results, and that explains how positional information is used to generate the spatiotemporal pattern of gene expression.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Cinquin O (2007) Repressor dimerization in the zebrafish somitogenesis clock.

In the model proposed here, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030032-g001">Figure 1</xref>, all dimer combinations between Her1, Her7, and Her13.2 compete for binding to these sites, and repress <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> transcription with strengths specific to each dimer combination.

To investigate the behavior of the model, we therefore sampled values from extended, biologically realistic ranges. We screened for suitable oscillations, with at least a 5-fold difference between mRNA peak and basal levels (see Methods for a full definition), and for reproduction of experimental results obtained by perturbation of the oscillatory machinery. Because mRNA and protein copy numbers often reach low absolute levels at the trough of their oscillatory cycle, the effect of internal noise was assayed using stochastic simulations, with the same parameter sets that were identified as providing suitable deterministic oscillations. Possible reactions in the system were the same in the deterministic and stochastic cases, but stochastic simulations considered all individual reaction events explicitly.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mathematical Formulation of the Model</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Single cells.</title><p>In the deterministic case, the framework used was that of delay differential equations, with variables representing a continuous approximation of mRNA and protein copy numbers in each cell. Binding and unbinding reactions between proteins were considered explicitly (rather than considering dimers to be at equilibrium), because&#x02014;though they happen at a very high rate&#x02014;it could not be excluded outright that the reactions could have had a detectable effect on the kinetics of oscillations (no such effect was directly observed, however). It was assumed that Her proteins are quickly and efficiently imported into the nucleus, and that dimerization occurs following the law of mass action, independent of DNA binding. (DNA can influence dimerization of bHLH proteins in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030032-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, but data about kinetics and equilibria of in vivo dimerization is missing.)

The function used to describe repression of transcription by Her proteins is a phenomenological one and does not explicitly take into account the binding of proteins to the promoters.

Different dimer species are assumed to exert their activity on the promoter with a phenomenological cooperativity of three, which could stem from cooperative binding of each dimer species to Hairy sites in the promoter (a cooperativity of two leads to similar oscillations). Dimer species are assumed to compete for the establishment of a certain level of repression on the promoter (the more of dimer species X, the closer the repression level gets to that set by X, all other things being equal). Repressive activity is saturable, as suggested by experiments that show incomplete repression of reporters in situations where Her proteins should be in vast excess of the promoters they repress &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030032-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;.

Such parameter sets occurred at a low frequency (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030032-g002">Figure 2</xref> for a representative example). While general robustness of the model with these parameter sets was comparable with that in the general case (30&#x00025; of parameter sets were found to be robust), the parameters with the strongest influence on the oscillation period were found to be strikingly different. Parameter sets leading to correct reproduction of the morpholino phenotypes also led to a very high sensitivity of the oscillation period to the degradation rate of the Her1&#x02013;Her7 dimer (and to a lower extent to various parameters describing its repressive activity): for 30&#x00025; of identified parameter sets, variation of the Her1&#x02013;Her7 degradation rate yielded a higher variation in period than variation of any parameter not related to delays of transcription and translation. In the general case, period-sensitivity to individual parameter variation was more even across parameters and highest for the <italic>her1</italic> mRNA degradation rate. (For 10&#x00025; of identified parameter sets, variation of that degradation rate led to the highest period variation amongst parameters other than delays.)

However, Her13.2 provides such a link in the zebrafish clock &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030032-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, which makes it possible to investigate the detail of the mechanism.</p><p>To assess whether graded expression of <italic>her13.2</italic> could prompt a linear chain of oscillators to form the correct collective pattern of oscillatory expression, a screen was carried out in which the dynamic structure of the PSM was reproduced by adding cells at regular intervals at the posterior end of the chain (corresponding to convergent extension and ingression from the tailbud &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030032-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;) and removing cells at the anterior end. (Cells were removed continuously, rather than in blocks corresponding to somites, because the process of segmentation, which is controlled by poorly understood molecular mechanisms, is not the subject of this study.) Each cell influenced its two anterior and posterior neighbors by providing them with the ligand Delta for Notch receptor activation, leading to increased <italic>her</italic> and <italic>deltaC</italic> transcription (the dynamics of Notch signaling were not modeled explicitly).

The rates of <italic>her13.2</italic> mRNA decay and of cell addition at the anterior end set the length of the PSM, and therefore the number of oscillations each cell experienced while in the PSM (that number was set to 12, as can be estimated from &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030032-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030032-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030032-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>A number of parameter sets were identified for which <italic>her</italic> and <italic>deltaC</italic> waves of expression swept from posterior to anterior, their width becoming restricted as they went along (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030032-g003">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030032-g003">3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030032-sv001">Video S1</xref> for a representative example). The number of stripes observable at any given time depends on parameter sets and spans the range observed experimentally (from one in old embryos at specific phases, to up to three in younger embryos &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030032-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;); it was not attempted to reproduce precisely the rate at which stripes decrease in length. Positional information provided by Her13.2, as identified experimentally, is therefore sufficient to arrange oscillatory expression in the PSM in the correct pattern, within the framework of the model proposed here.</p><p>To determine whether the role of Her13.2 is to modulate intercellular coupling or to act on individual oscillators, simulations were run with no intercellular coupling (this was performed by abolishing DeltaC translation, or by replacing Notch signaling with fictitious autocrine signaling). For all parameters studied, it was found that intercellular coupling could be removed without destroying the spatiotemporal pattern. For some parameter sets, this loss of Notch needed to be compensated by an increase in the transcription rates of <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic>. A shift in oscillatory phase and a slight change in the oscillatory period occur when <italic>her13.2</italic> mRNA expression drops (unpublished data); this is sufficient to set up the spatiotemporal pattern. Note that this does not contradict the fact that Notch signaling is necessary for oscillations in vivo. The model studied here has parameter sets for which Notch signaling is required for individual cellular oscillations with the correct pattern (by providing a sufficient level of <italic>her</italic> expression) as well as for intercellular coupling. In addition, the model has parameter sets for which Notch is required for intercellular coupling only. The first set of parameters corresponds to the in vivo behavior of the oscillator (such a parameter set was used to produce <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030032-g002">Figures 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030032-g006">6</xref>). In vivo, intercellular coupling through Notch signaling could have the additional role of setting up the very first waves of expression, which are not the object of this study.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Oscillator Coupling and Noise</title><p>Even if intercellular coupling has no role in the establishment of the oscillatory pattern under the simplified conditions studied here, it could have a crucial role in synchronizing cells in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030032-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030032-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. Perturbations were simulated by delaying a number of oscillators in the chain by 5 min. For some parameter sets, such perturbations were resorbed within a few rounds of oscillation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030032-g003">Figure 3</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030032-g003">3</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030032-sv001">Video S1</xref> at 50 min for an example). Synchronization was much stronger for cells located in posterior PSM than for cells in anterior PSM.

Due to the high computational and memory costs of simulating individual reaction events with delays for a system comprising more than 50 oscillators with 13 variables each, only a very small number of parameter sets could be studied. Nonetheless, parameter sets were identified for which the patterns of oscillation in stochastic simulations were as expected, close to the deterministic form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030032-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030032-sv002">Video S2</xref>). For such parameter sets, closely similar successive rounds of oscillation showed low variability between stochastic realizations. A stochastic simulation was run with disrupted coupling, with the same parameter set as used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030032-g003">Figure 3</xref>. A few cells went noticeably out of synchrony with their neighbors, and local synchrony was generally not as strong as with coupling, but the global spatiotemporal pattern was not disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030032-g004">Figure 4</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030032-g004">4</xref>F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030032-sv003">Video S3</xref>). Thus, even though this parameter set leads to perturbation resorption in posterior PSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030032-g003">Figure 3</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030032-g003">3</xref>E), the molecular clock is sufficiently precise that this capacity is not required to maintain the spatiotemporal pattern with the molecular noise simulated here.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Disruption of the Spatiotemporal Pattern</title><p>Morpholino knockdown of <italic>her1</italic> leads to residual <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> oscillations in posterior PSM and to defective stripe formation in anterior PSM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030032-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

These residual oscillations were also present in anterior PSM, but no clear stripes of expression were formed, in agreement with experimental data. The simulations showed that <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7,</italic> with the biochemical parameters used, have essentially symmetrical roles. (This is because many parameters for <italic>her7</italic> were chosen to be the same as that of their <italic>her1</italic> counterpart, to make the computational study tractable.) Some asymmetry has been reported based on knockdown phenotypes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030032-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;; for example, <italic>her1</italic> knockdown leads to some <italic>her1</italic> expression in anterior PSM, while <italic>her7</italic> knockdown leads to loss of expression of <italic>her7</italic> in anterior PSM. It is possible that some of this asymmetry stems from differences in mRNA in situ hybridization detection thresholds, which are unknown (<italic>her7</italic> could have a higher detection threshold than <italic>her1</italic>).</p><p>Simulated knockdown of <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> together showed upregulated expression in posterior PSM and a salt-and-pepper pattern in anterior PSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030032-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030032-sv006">Video S6</xref>). This is consistent with experimental results showing generalized upregulation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030032-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. There was a slight discrepancy in that salt-and-pepper expression has been reported to occur throughout the PSM rather than specifically in anterior PSM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030032-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;; this remains to be investigated. Strikingly, individual cells oscillated in the anterior PSM, even though the global pattern appeared constant. This brings computational confirmation to the hypothesis that a salt-and-pepper pattern can occur by desynchronization of cells, rather than by blocking of oscillations at different phases of the cycle in different cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030032-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. In the double morphant, the clock started oscillating around the transition between posterior and anterior PSM. Because the oscillation period was roughly similar, the number of cycles experienced by cells in the PSM was about 50&#x00025; lower than normal.</p><p>Another way in which the spatiotemporal oscillatory pattern can be disrupted is by grafting FGF-8 coated beads. This leads to minimal disruptions of oscillations when the bead is adjacent to posterior PSM, but to anterior extension of waves in the anterior PSM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030032-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Such grafting experiments were simulated by assuming that an ectopic stripe of high <italic>her13.2</italic> mRNA expression is induced around the bead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030032-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030032-sv007">Video S7</xref>). When the bead was adjacent to posterior PSM, oscillations were not affected because the bead was assumed not to further increase <italic>her13.2</italic> expression. When the bead reached anterior PSM, posterior oscillations were still unaffected, but anterior oscillations, if imaged at the right phase, could show anterior extension of a wave in anterior PSM.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Direct characterizations of molecular interactions in the zebrafish somitogenesis clock network are scarce.
