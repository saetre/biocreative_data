We purified this polypeptide from HeLa cells using a Western blot assay, and named it p54nrb (for nuclear RNA-binding protein, 54 kDa). cDNAs encoding p54nrb were cloned with probes derived from partial sequence of the purified protein. These cDNAs have identical coding sequences but differ as a result of alternative splicing in the 5' untranslated region. The cDNAs encode a 471 aa polypeptide that contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). Human p54nrb has no homology to yeast PRP18, except for a common epitope, but is instead 71% identical to human splicing factor PSF within a 320 aa region that includes both RRMs. In addition, both p54nrb and PSF are rich in Pro and Gln residues outside the main homology region. The Drosophila puff-specific protein BJ6, one of three products encoded by the alternatively spliced no-on-transient A gene (nonA), which is required for normal vision and courtship song, is 42% identical to p54nrb in the same 320 aa region. The striking homology between p54nrb, PSF, and NONA/BJ6 defines a novel phylogenetically conserved protein segment, termed DBHS domain (for Drosophila behavior, human splicing), which may be involved in regulating diverse pathways at the level of pre-mRNA splicing.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0165-a" xlink:role="4087"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0166-a" xlink:role="4088"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0167-a" xlink:role="4089"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0168-a" xlink:role="4090"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0168-b" xlink:role="4090"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0163.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4085"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0164.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4086"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0165.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4087"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4088"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4089"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4090"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4091"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0170.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4092"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
