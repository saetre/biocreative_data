Human-bone mesenchymal stem cells can be utilized as an effective therapy for ischemic brain injury. In this study, we found that glutamate could induce apoptosis in human-bone mesenchymal stem cells, accompanied by increased expression of <italic>Par-4</italic> gene and <italic>Smac</italic> release from mitochondria. Repressing <italic>Par-4</italic> expression attenuated the glutamate-induced apoptosis. Both <italic>Par-4</italic> protein and E2F1 protein could bind to E2F1-binding BS3 site on <italic>Smac</italic> promoter and participated in the formation of a proteins-DNA complex. Moreover, in the complex, E2F1, not <italic>Par-4</italic>, was found to be directly bound to the <italic>Smac</italic> promoter, suggesting that <italic>Par-4</italic> exerted indirectly its transcriptional control on the <italic>Smac</italic> gene though interacting with E2F1. Expression of full-length <italic>Par-4</italic> in human-bone mesenchymal cells resulted in increased activity of the <italic>Smac</italic> promoter. In addition, the indirect transcripional regulation of <italic>Par-4</italic> on <italic>Smac</italic> depended on its COOH terminus-mediated interaction between <italic>Par-4</italic> and E2F1. We conclude that the formation of proteins&#x02013;DNA complex, containing <italic>Par-4</italic> protein, E2F1 protein and the <italic>Smac</italic> promoter, contributes to the pro-apoptotic effect on glutamate-treated human-bone mesenchymal stem cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>As a major contributor to death and disability, ischaemic brain injury does not only affect adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), it is also an important cause of mortality and severe neurodevelopmental morbidity in children, such as cerebral palsy, mental retardation, epilepsy and learning disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Human-bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) are self-renewing multipotent cells, which can be utilized as an effective therapy for ischemic brain injury. However, although considerable studies have been devoted to investigating the therapeutic efficacy of hBMSCs transplantation in ischemic brain, rather less attention has been paid to the biochemical regulation of the stem cell itself in a pro-apoptotic microenvironment of ischaemic brain tissue. Thus, it is of paramount importance to investigate the events and factors that predispose hBMSCs to undergo apoptosis in ischaemia tissue.</p><p>Glutamate, an excitatory amino acid, binds to postsynaptically located glutamate receptors that regulate calcium channels in ischaemic brain tissue. The resulting calcium influx activates proteases, lipases and endonucleases, which in turn destroy the cellular skeleton, finally leading to cells necrosis or switch on apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The implanted stem cells will suffer from the impairment of excitotoxic glutamate as well in such a microenvironment. Hence, for alleviating suffering and improving survival of implanted cells in ischaemic brain tissue, it is important to determine how hBMSCs respond to glutamate.</p><p>The <italic>prostate apoptosis response factor-4</italic> (<italic>Par-4</italic>) gene was originally identified by differential screening for up-regulated genes in apoptotic prostate cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Subsequently, <italic>Par-4</italic> was found to possess potent apoptotic activity in various cellular systems. In the past few years, several studies have investigated the role of <italic>Par-4</italic> in cell apoptosis and found that <italic>Par-4</italic> had been attributed a crucial function to its COOH terminus domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). One of the most noticeable structural features of <italic>Par-4</italic> COOH terminus was the leucine zipper repeats, a putative death domain, which was found in several other proteins involved in apoptosis, suggesting the importance of this region in <italic>Par-4</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, despite the advances made in understanding the role of <italic>Par-4</italic> in apoptosis, little was known about whether <italic>Par-4</italic> is involved in the response of glutamate-treated hBMSCs.</p><p><italic>Smac</italic> (the <italic>second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase</italic>), also known as <italic>DIABLO</italic> (<italic>direct IAP-binding protein with low pI</italic>), is a pro-apoptotic protein and is normally compartmentalized and stored in mitochondria upon receiving apoptotic stimuli; <italic>Smac</italic> is released into cytosol, where it binds to IAPs, and active caspases either by eradicating the binding capability of IAPs to caspases or enhancing the proteosome-mediated degradation of IAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In addition, E2F1, a member of E2F transcription factor family, can bind to the <italic>Smac</italic> promoter and transcriptionlly upregulate <italic>Smac</italic> expression, which results into the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether <italic>Smac</italic> plays a role in glutamate-induced hBMSCs apoptosis.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that excitotoxic glutamate can induce hBMSCs apoptosis, accompanied by increased expression of <italic>Par-4</italic> and <italic>Smac</italic> release from mitochondria. Our results indicate that the glutamate-induced pro-apoptotic effect on hBMSCs is partially due to the formation of multimolecular complex of <italic>Par-4</italic>, E2F1 and <italic>Smac</italic> promoter. Our results show that <italic>Par-4</italic> can transcriptionally modulate <italic>Smac</italic> expression through the indirect interaction between <italic>Par-4</italic> and <italic>Smac</italic> promoter. The association of <italic>Par-4</italic> with E2F1 which depended on the COOH terminus of <italic>Par-4</italic>, enhances the capability of E2F1 binding to <italic>Smac</italic> promoter. In conclusion, our findings provided the detailed molecular mechanisms responsible for glutamate-induced apoptosis in hBMSCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p><italic>Par-4</italic> rabbit polyclonal antibody, E2F1 rabbit polyclonal antibody and FITC conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation was done as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Cells were plated in a 100-mm dish. About 70% confluent dishes were treated with formaldehyde (1%) for 10 min at 37&#x000b0;C to cross-link proteins to DNA. The cells were washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4, containing protease/inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and then lysed with lysis buffer containing 1% SDS. Sonication of cross-linked chromatin was performed at 30% of maximum power with two rounds of 10 s pulses so that chromatin fragments thus obtained ranged from 500 to 2000 bp in size. Soluble chromatin was subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation with either anti-E2F1 antibody or anti-<italic>Par-4</italic> antibody. A portion of the chromatin solution was kept to check the amount of input DNA in different samples before immunoprecipitation. Following immunoprecipitation and elution, the eluent was heated to 65&#x000b0;C for 6 h to reverse the cross-link. Phenol/chloroform extraction was performed, and the supernatant was ethanol-precipitated. DNA thus obtained was resuspended in 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 and subjected to PCR.

Hence, we could set up a hypothesis that the COOH terminus of <italic>Par-4</italic> might contribute to proteins complex formation of <italic>Par-4</italic> and E2F1, and then via recruitment of E2F1 to <italic>Smac</italic> promoter, <italic>Par-4</italic> induced indirectly <italic>Smac</italic> transcription. In order to further corroborate this hypothesis, we performed the co-immunoprecipitation assays for measuring the interaction between <italic>Par-4</italic> and E2F1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B (lane 2), from nuclear extracts of the cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-myc-<italic>Par-4</italic> and following treated with glutamate, myc-<italic>Par-4</italic> was immunoprecipitated using anti-myc antibody, and associated E2F1 were detected by immunoblotting.

The findings validated the essentiality of the COOH terminus of <italic>Par-4</italic> for <italic>Par-4</italic>-E2F1 complex formation. Taken together, we concluded that the COOH terminus of <italic>Par-4</italic>, by which <italic>Par-4</italic> associated with E2F1 and bound to <italic>Smac</italic> promoter, was functionally required for <italic>Par-4</italic>-mediated activation of <italic>Smac</italic> promoter in hBMSCs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we report for the first time that glutamate can induce apoptosis in hBMSCs by a mechanism involving pro-apoptotic gene <italic>Par-4</italic>. Glutamate-induced neurotoxicity is an important contributor in acute neuronal damages and in chronic neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Therefore, implanted stem cells will be sure to suffer from glutamate-mediated injury. We observed that glutamate induced a dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in hBMSCs, which was consistent with previous studies carried out in neural cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>). As a pro-apoptotic factor, <italic>Par-4</italic> is initially identified as a product of gene upregulated in prostate tumour cells undergoing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Recently, growing evidence show that increased expression of <italic>Par-4</italic> also regulates neuronal apoptosis, especially when exposed to metabolic insults such as glutamate and intracellular calcium elevation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In the current study, we demonstrated that the suppression of <italic>Par-4</italic> expression greatly attenuated apoptosis in glutamate-treated hBMSCs, whereas <italic>Par-4</italic> overexpression increased the percentage of apoptotic cells, implying that <italic>Par-4</italic> played a critical role in glutamate-induced hBMSCs apoptosis.</p><p>Previously, several signal pathways, including WT1/Bcl-2, Fas/Fas ligand, PKC/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Ras/NF-kB, DAP-like or ZIP kinase (DIK/ZIP kinase), extracellular signal regulated-kinase (ERK), have been demonstrated to be involved in <italic>Par-4</italic>-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Our studies showed that <italic>Par-4</italic> ectopic expression in hBMSCs resulted in increased release of <italic>Smac</italic> protein from mitochondria and elevation of <italic>Smac</italic> message RNA, suggesting a previously undefined transcriptional mechanism for <italic>Par-4</italic>-mediated <italic>Smac</italic> upmodulation. However, previous studies did not provide any evidence to support the direct interaction between <italic>Par-4</italic> protein and <italic>Smac</italic> promoter. Our data showed that blocking endogenous E2F1 decreased <italic>Par-4</italic>-induced <italic>Smac</italic> transcription, indicating that both <italic>Par-4</italic> and E2F1 were required for <italic>Smac</italic> transcription regulation. Numerous studies showed that ectopic expression of E2F1 induced apoptosis by different mechanisms. Apoptosis-related E2F1 target genes, such as <italic>p73, Apaf1, noxa, bim</italic> and <italic>akt</italic>, are involved in both p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptotic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24 B25 B26 B27">22&#x02013;27</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that enhanced accumulation of nuclear E2F1 upregulated <italic>Smac</italic> expression and subsequently accelerated mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, implying that <italic>Smac</italic> was an E2F1 target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In agreement with the study, our data showed that the increased expression of <italic>Smac</italic> gene in glutamate-treated hBMSCs were E2F1-dependent, at least partially.</p><p>We further confirmed that both <italic>Par-4</italic> and E2F1 proteins participated in the formation of a complex that bound to the BS3 site (&#x02212;200 to &#x02212;193 bp relative to ATG) on <italic>Smac</italic> promoter, which was previously identified as a site where E2F1 bound to and increased transcription of <italic>Smac</italic> gene in human H1299 non-small lung carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Our results indicated that this site was also employed to drive the transcription of <italic>Smac</italic> in hBMSCs. Similar mechanism of <italic>Par-4</italic> mediated indirect transcriptional regulation was delineated by Sangeeta and colleagues as well. They demonstrated that <italic>Par-4</italic> associated with WT1 and bound to the bcl-2 promoter to transcriptionally regulate Bcl-2 expression in an androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In particular, our results suggested that it was E2F1, not <italic>Par-4</italic>, that directly bound to <italic>Smac</italic> promoter in the DNA&#x02013;proteins complex, which implied that <italic>Par-4</italic>, indirectly, exert its transcriptional control on <italic>Smac</italic> gene though interacting with E2F1.</p><p>Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), our study validated the functional significance of the COOH terminus of <italic>Par-4</italic> protein in hBMSCs apoptosis. The COOH terminus of <italic>Par-4</italic> protein containing a leucine zipper domain has been shown to be essential in <italic>Par-4</italic> binding to PKC, WT1, ZIPK/Daxx and THAP, and their interactions promoted cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Here we showed that the mutant of <italic>Par-4</italic>, which lacked 70 amino acids at the COOH terminus, failed to co-immunoprecipitate with E2F1 protein, implying that this region was also required for the interaction between <italic>Par-4</italic> and E2F1. With luciferase activity analysis, we found that the increased expression of <italic>Par-4</italic> resulted in an increased activity of <italic>Smac</italic> promoter in a dose-dependent manner, whereas <italic>Par-4</italic> mutant failed to active <italic>Smac</italic> promoter. Therefore, we further corroborated that the indirect transcripional regulation of <italic>Par-4</italic> on <italic>Smac</italic> was depended on its COOH terminus-mediated interaction between <italic>Par-4</italic> and E2F1.</p><p>Recently, it was reported that the COOH terminus of or possibly the full-length <italic>Par-4</italic> protein was not required for apoptosis in primary fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). This discrepancy may be due to the different cell types, since in the same experiment settings, depletion of <italic>Par-4</italic> in HeLa cells conferred a significant resistant to various apoptotic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we show that the proteins&#x02013;DNA complex, containing <italic>Par-4</italic> protein, E2F1 protein and <italic>Smac</italic> promoter, contributes to glutamate-induced apoptosis in hBMSCs. The <italic>Par-4</italic> mediated indirect transcripional regulation on <italic>Smac</italic> gene depended on its COOH terminus-mediated interaction between <italic>Par-4</italic> and E2F1. Our studies provide a further understanding of molecular mechanism in glutamate induced hBMSCs apoptosis, which benefit stem-cell therapy in ischemic brain damage.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn426/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkn426_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkn426_nar-00555-x-2008-File008.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by Medical Grants of Scientific and Technological Development from the Health Department of Jiangsu Province in China (No. K200504), National Natural Science Foundation of China (30570863) and the Medical Academic Key Talent Program of Jiangsu Province in China (RC2007050).
