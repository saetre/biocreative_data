In our previous study, psoriatic skin lesions showed marked decreased levels of ceramides and signaling molecules, specially protein kinase C-alpha (PKC-&#x003b1;) and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in proportion to the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) scores, which suggested that the depletion of ceramide is responsible for epidermal hyperproliferation of psoriasis via downregulation of proapoptotic signal cascade such as PKC-&#x003b1; and JNK. In this study, we investigated the protein expression of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) and ceramidase, two major ceramide metabolizing enzymes, in both psoriatic epidermis and non-lesional epidermis. The expression of SPT, the ceramide generating enzyme in the de novo synthesis in psoriatic epidermis, was significantly less than that of the non-lesional epidermis, which was inversely correlated with PASI score. However, the expression of ceramidase, the degradative enzyme of ceramides, showed no significant difference between the lesional epidermis and the non-lesional epidermis of psoriatic patients. This might suggest that decreased expression of SPT protein is one of the important causative factors for decreased ceramide levels in psoriasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Serine C-Palmitoyltransferase</kwd><kwd>Ceramidase</kwd><kwd>Ceramides</kwd><kwd>Psoriasis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ceramides are the main lipids in the stratum corneum, and their depletion is thought to be one of the etiological factors for barrier disruption in various levels of skin conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).

All the subjects had psoriasis vulgaris as identified through clinical and histological assessment and had not been treated either systemically or topically for at least 1 month before punch biopsies were done (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Using a 4-mm punch, biopsies were taken from lesional and non-lesional skin on the lower extremities, back, or arms. The epidermis was separated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Specifically, the epidermis was separated from whole-skin biopsies by overnight incubation at 4&#x02103; in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of dispase solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Manheim, Germany) and Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS; Gibco BRL, Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, U.S.A.).</p></sec><sec><title>Assessing the clinical severity of psoriasis</title><p>The clinical severity was assessed using the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score, which is calculated as follows: PASI=0.1 (E<sub>h</sub>+I<sub>h</sub>+D<sub>h</sub>)A<sub>h</sub>+0.2 (E<sub>u</sub>+I<sub>u</sub>+D<sub>u</sub>)A<sub>u</sub>+0.3 (E<sub>t</sub>+I<sub>t</sub>+D<sub>t</sub>)A<sub>t</sub>+0.4 (E<sub>l</sub>+I<sub>l</sub>+D<sub>l</sub>)A<sub>l</sub>, where E=erythema, I=infiltration, D=desquamation, A=area, h=head, u=upper extremities, t=trunk, and l=lower extremities. A numerical value is given to the extent of the lesions in each area: 1=&#x0003c;10%, 2=10-30%, 3=30-50%, 4=50-70%, 5=70-90%, and 6=90-100%. E, I, and D were scored on a five-point scale (0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, and 4=very marked) to obtain a final PASI score between 0 and 72. The PASI scores of the patients who took part in this study ranged between 2.0 and 27.4. The patients with PASI scores &#x0003c;30 were enrolled in this study in order to determine whether alterations in the levels of SPT and ceramidase are closely correlated to the clinical severity in psoriatic patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). All patients with PASI scores &#x0003e;30 were excluded in this study because their skin lesions were shown to be transformed into severe variants of psoriasis, such as the erythrodermic type.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Every frozen skin sample was added to 400 &#x000b5;L of Folch solution (CHCl<sub>3</sub>: MeOH 2:1, v/v mixture) and was homogenized using a polytron homogenizer, and 200 &#x000b5;L of 0.1 M KCl was added. The mixture was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min each. The upper phase containing the extracted proteins was separated. This process was repeated one more time. The protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fifty micrograms of protein was fractionated on 10% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electrophoresis. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 hr at room temperature and incubated with prepared human SPT, ceramidase, and tubulin antibody (Labfrontier, Seoul, Korea) at a 1:250 dilution with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TSB-T) for 1 hr. After washing with TBS-T for 1 hr, the membranes were reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, U.K.) diluted 1:250 with TBS-T for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing the membranes with TBS-T for 1 hr, the protein level was detected using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Bioscience, Buckinghamshire, U.K.).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The statistical significance of the difference in the levels of SPT/tubulin and ceramidase/tubulin between the lesional and the non-lesional samples of psoriasis patients was assessed using a paired t-test.

Among the epidermal sphingolipids, ceramide is the main lipid in the stratum corneum and its depletion is thought to be one of the etiological factors for barrier disruption in skin conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Moreover, as a signal transduction molecule, ceramide is involved in the cell proliferation and apoptosis signaling pathway via activation of several signal transduction molecules, and its depletion is related with various skin disease such as atopic dermatitis or psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Synthesis of ceramide is regulated by several enzymes such as sphingomyelinase, &#x003b2;-glucocerebrosidase, and ceramidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Also a <italic>de novo</italic> pathway mediated by SPT functions as a key pathway of ceramide systhesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>SPT is a key enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesisis. It is the first committed and rate-limiting step in sphigolipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). One of the substrates for SPT is various acyl-CoAs. In the mammalian cells, palmitoyl CoA is one of the most abundant acly-CoA types and it is the predominant acyl-CoA substrate of SPT in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). However, SPT strictly utilizes L-serine as its amino acid substate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In human epidermis, SPT catalyzes the palmitoyl CoA and L-serine to synthesize ceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>Ceramidase hydrolyzes ceramide into shpingophosphorylcholine and free fatty acid. It is demonstrated that marked elevated activity of this enzyme is responsible for low levels of cermaide in stratum corneum of atopic dermatitis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>In our previous study, decreased ceramide in psoriatic skin lesions is shown to be responsible for epidermal hyperplasia via downregulation of proapoptotic signal cascade such as PKC-&#x003b1; and JNK. In contrast, DAG levels were elevated and free fatty acid levels were not changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, in the past study, we could not elucidate what makes ceramide decreased in psoriatic skin lesion.</p><p>In this study, we measured the expression of SPT and ceramidase in both psoriatic epidermis and non-lesional epidermis. SPT is one of the enzymes, which is related to the synthesis of ceramide, and ceramidase is a catalytic enzyme, which is related to the decrease of the levels of ceramide. The results of this experiment showed that levels of SPT were significantly decreased in the psoriatic skin. However, the levels of ceramidase showed no significant difference between psoriatic epidermis and non-lesional epidermis. We also evaluated the relationship between the PASI score and decreased levels of SPT to determine the role of decreased SPT on the severity of psoriasis. The correlation between the percentage reduction in the ratio of SPT/tubulin in the lesional epidermis and the PASI scores showed a significantly negative correlation. Considering above results, decreased levels of ceramide in psoriatic skin, as shown in our previous study, are responsible for decreased levels of SPT in psoriatic skin lesion, and their levels of reduction are highly related to the clinical severity of psoriasis. However, according to this experiment, ceramidase does not seem to have a relation with psoriatic epidermal changes, and this result is different from that of the previous study on ceramidase activity in atopic dermatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that the decreased levels of ceramide in the psoriatic epidermis is related to its <italic>de novo</italic> synthetic pathway, which is associated with levels of SPT, and the levels of SPT are closely related to the clinical severity of psoriasis. Considering that psoriasis is one of the inflammatory skin diseases, several cytokines or growth factors secreted by keratinocytes, Langerhans cells, or T-cells in the psoriatic skin lesion seem to affect the expression of serine palmitoyltransferase, and this postulation need further studies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Elias</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>Menon</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Elias</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Structural and lipid biochemical correlates of the epidermal permeability barrier</article-title><source>Skin Lipid.
