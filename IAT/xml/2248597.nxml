Virus properties that rely on receptor recognition such as host range or pathogenicity could potentially be affected by polymorphisms that alter the receptor or the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the virus. In previous studies we identified two unusual ecotropic mouse leukemia virus (MLV) variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Both of these viruses have altered host range, both are cytopathic, and both have amino acid substitutions at the same site in their RBDs. Spl574 is a Moloney MLV (MoMLV) variant with the substitution S82F, and F-S MLV is a Friend MLV (FrMLV) variant with the substitution S84A. Both viruses cause the formation of large multinucleated syncytia on cells derived from the wild mouse species <italic>M. dunni </italic>two days after infection, and syncytium formation is accompanied by the accumulation of large amounts of unintegrated viral DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These two viruses also differ from each other and from their respective parental MLVs in host range. Spl574 replicates efficiently only in <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells and very inefficiently in other mouse cells such as NIH 3T3 and SC-1 cells. F-S MLV shows no unusual pattern of infectivity in mouse cells, but is capable of infecting hamster cells that are normally resistant to ecotropic MLVs.</p><p>The fact that these two viruses are only cytopathic in <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells suggests involvement of the receptor-virus interaction for two reasons. First, the amino acid residue that is modified in both viruses has been identified as one of the critical amino acids forming the receptor binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Second, <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells differ from other mouse cells in their resistance to MoMLV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and these cells are known to carry a modified CAT-1 receptor (dCAT-1). The dCAT-1 gene of <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells differs from the prototypical CAT-1 gene of the laboratory mouse (mCAT-1) in that the third extracellular loop that contains the virus binding region has a substitution (I214V) as well as an inserted glycine after Y235, a residue critical for receptor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>(A) </bold>Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the third extracellullar loop of the CAT-1 receptor. Glycosylation sites are underlined. Sequences for mCAT-1 (NIH 3T3) and dCAT-1 (<italic>M. dunni</italic>) were previously determined (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="M26687">M26687</ext-link>, [6]). dCAT-1-g was generated by mutagenesis. <bold>(B) </bold>Expression of HA-tagged CAT-1 genes in various cell lines. a, Tb-1-Lu cells with mCAT-1; b, Tb-1-Lu with dCAT-1; c, MA139 cells with mCAT-1, d and e, MA139 with dCAT-1; f, <italic>M. dunni </italic>with m-CAT-1.

Molecular weight markers are given for each panel.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-5-2-1"/></fig><p>In this study, we examined the role of the dCAT-1 receptor in syncytium formation and susceptibility to infection by different ecotropic MLVs. We generated an expression vector containing dCAT-1 and transfected either this clone or the mCAT-1 gene into cells of non-rodent species that are not normally infectible by ecotropic virus. The transfected cells were then evaluated for susceptibility to infection by ecotropic MLVs and for virus induced syncytia. While virus induced syncytia were only seen in the dCAT-1 transfectants, a different panel of virus isolates was capable of efficiently infecting and/or inducing syncytia in these transfectants suggesting that virus-cell fusion and cell-cell fusion are distinct receptor mediated phenomena. The possible contribution of differential glycosylation to these phenotypic differences was evaluated using Western analysis, treatment by glycosylation inhibitors and mutagenesis to remove glycosylation sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Syncytium formation in cells expressing mCAT-1 or dCAT-1</title><p>HA-tagged mCAT-1 and dCAT-1 clones were transfected into three cell lines that are not naturally susceptible to infection by ecotropic mouse gammaretroviruses: MA139 (ferret), Tb-1-Lu (bat lung), and MDCK (canine kidney) cells. As a control, mCAT-1 was transfected into <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells. Pools of stably transfected cells were used for analysis along with single cell derived clones of transfected MA139 cells. mCAT-1 and dCAT-1 expression in transfected cells was confirmed by Western analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Consistent with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], CAT-1 was detected as a heterogeneously glycosylated protein in each cell line. The size range distribution for the mCAT-1 and dCAT-1 proteins was similar for each cell line, but the size range and band patterns were variable between cell lines suggesting cell specific differences in glycosylation. Thus, for example, the molecular weight range of CAT-1 was lower in MDCK cells (not shown) and Tb-1-Lu cells than in MA139 cells and <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><p>These stable transfectants of MA139, Tb-1-Lu and MDCK cells were infected with a panel of ecotropic gammaretroviruses including two, Spl574 and F-S MLV that induce multinucleated syncytia in <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells but not in other mouse cell lines. The infected cells were examined for cytopathicity over a period of 2&#x02013;5 days. Transfectants of all 3 cell lines expressing mCAT-1 showed no signs of cytopathicity following virus infection as shown for the MA139 and MDCK transfectants in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. In contrast, dCAT-1 expressing MA139 and MDCK cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) as well as Tb-1-Lu cells (not shown) formed syncytia within two days of infection with Friend virus isolate F-S MLV.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Cytopathic effects of virus infection on two cell lines, MA139 and MDCK cells, transfected with mCAT-1 or dCAT-1. Transfected MA139 cells are shown in the four panels on the left, transfected MDCK cells on the right.

Virus-induced syncytia were observed in two independently derived pools of dCAT-1 transfected MA139 cells as well as three independently isolated clonal lines (FerrD2, N65FerrC2 and N65FerrB6), but not in 3 independently derived pools of mCAT-1 transfected MA139 cells.</p><p>Among the ecotropic isolates tested, F-S MLV was most efficient in inducing syncytia in all dCAT-1 transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), but syncytium formation was also observed following infection with the Friend MLV isolates FBLV and FrMLV57. Infection with MoMLV or Spl574 occasionally resulted in syncytium formation in these transfectants, but these syncytia were smaller and fewer in number, and, appeared 1&#x02013;2 days after the appearance of syncytia in parallel cultures infected with the most cytopathic isolate, F-S MLV. Thus, cells expressing the dCAT-1 receptor can, like <italic>M. dunni</italic>, produce syncytia in response to virus infection, but these transfectants differ from <italic>M. dunni </italic>in their relative insensitivity to Spl574 and their sensitivity to syncytium formation by virus isolates that are not typically cytopathic in <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA in infected transfected cells</title><p>Virus induced syncytium formation in <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells was previously shown to be accompanied by the appearance of high levels of unintegrated viral DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], a phenomenon also observed for other pathogenic retroviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. To determine if the transfected cells show this same response to cytopathic virus, we extracted Hirt DNA from CAT-1 transfected MA139 cells 3 days after infection with F-S MLV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Unintegrated viral DNA in F-S MLV infected <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells and MA139 cells transfected with mCAT-1 or dCAT-1.

In contrast, virus-induced syncytia were observed in all 3 dCAT-1 transfectants. 2 of these 3 transfectants had large multinucleated syncytia that involved &#x0003e;50% of the cells in infected cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>); levels of unintegrated linear DNA in these cells were high (53% and 68% of <italic>M. dunni</italic>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref>). The third dCAT-1 transfectant showed fewer and smaller syncytia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>); increased unintegrated DNA was detected in this line but levels were only about twice that of FerrM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref>), Thus, viral DNA accumulation is observed in dCAT-1 but not mCAT-1 transfectants, increased viral DNA is associated with virus-induced cytopathicity in the transfected cells, and the amount of viral DNA varies with the severity of the cytopathic response.</p></sec><sec><title>Virus replication in cells expressing CAT-1</title><p>To define the relationship between syncytium formation and productive virus infection, transfected cell lines carrying either mCAT-1 or dCAT-1 were tested for susceptibility to a panel of ecotropic MLVs using the XC plaque overlay test (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In this assay, clusters of infected cells expressing ecotropic Env glycoprotein are identified by plaques of syncytia formed by overlaid rat XC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. For the cytopathic viruses Spl574 and F-S MLV, the number of syncytia induced directly by these viruses in susceptible cells is approximately equivalent to the titer determined by this XC overlay assay; for example, parallel cultures of infected <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells produced an XC titer of 10<sup>5.1 </sup>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) compared to Spl574 syncytium titer of 10<sup>4.6</sup>.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Virus titers of ecotropic gammaretroviruses on mouse cells and mouse or ferret MA139 cells transfected with mCAT-1 or dCAT-1</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center" colspan="4"><bold>Log<sub>10 </sub>Virus Titer<sup>a</sup></bold></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Cells<sup>b</sup></bold></td><td align="center"><bold>F-S MLV</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>FBLV</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Spl574</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>MoMLV</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">NIH 3T3</td><td align="center">5.7</td><td align="center">5.3</td><td align="center"><bold>3.2</bold></td><td align="center">5.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>M. dunni</italic></td><td align="center">5.1<sup>c</sup></td><td align="center">4.1</td><td align="center">5.1<sup>c</sup></td><td align="center"><bold>2.2</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>M. dunni </italic>(mCAT-1)</td><td align="center">5.5<sup>c</sup></td><td align="center">5.5</td><td align="center">5.2<sup>c</sup></td><td align="center">4.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">FerrM (mCAT-1)</td><td align="center">4.5</td><td align="center">4.2</td><td align="center"><bold>0.3</bold></td><td align="center">3.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left">FerrD2 (dCAT-1)</td><td align="center">4.7<sup>c</sup></td><td align="center">4.2<sup>c</sup></td><td align="center"><bold>0.8</bold></td><td align="center">4.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Virus titers were determined by the XC overlay test in which the indicated cells were infected with virus dilutions, irradiated and overlaid with XC cells to identify virus infected cells [9].

No difference was noted in the XC plaque titer of Spl574 in <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells expressing mCAT-1 in addition to the endogenous dCAT-1, and no viruses other than Spl574 and F-S MLV were cytopathic in the mCAT-1 transfected <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells.</p><p>The differences between <italic>M. dunni </italic>and NIH 3T3 cells in susceptibility to ecotropic viruses were not reproduced in MA139 cells expressing dCAT-1 (FerrD2) or mCAT-1 (FerrM). In fact, there were no significant differences in the XC titers of different MLVs in FerrD2 and FerrM (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). FBLV, F-S MLV, and, surprisingly, MoMLV efficiently infected both FerrM and FerrD2 with slightly higher XC titers for all viruses in FerrD2. Also, even though Spl574 efficiently replicates in <italic>M. dunni</italic>, Spl574 produced comparably low XC titers in both FerrD2 and FerrM. Thus, FerrD2 does not resemble <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells in its susceptibility to infection by MoMLV and Spl574; this difference suggests the involvement of additional factors independent of the CAT-1 receptor sequence.</p><p>The cytopathicity of different virus isolates did not always correlate with the efficiency of virus replication in FerrD2 as determined by XC virus titer. While on the one hand, Spl574 produced low XC titers on FerrD2 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and was also poorly cytopathic, high XC titer viruses did not all produce syncytia in these cells. Thus, the most cytopathic virus in FerrD2 cells, F-S MLV, produced an XC titer comparable to that of the rarely cytopathic MoMLV. Efficient virus replication is thus not sufficient to generate a cytopathic response.</p></sec><sec><title>Pseudotype infections</title><p>To further investigate the observed differences in XC titers for cells expressing different CAT-1 genes, we assessed infectivity using viral pseudotypes in a single round infectivity assay (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

However, both of the transfected MA139 lines, FerrD2 and FerrM, were equally susceptible to the MoMLV pseudotype; the LacZ titers for this pseudotype in the two MA139 transfectants were similar to that of fully susceptible NIH 3T3 cells.

In contrast, the Spl574 pseudotype was not restricted in FerrD2 or FerrM cells although Spl574 virus produces low XC titers in both of these transfectants. This shows that the failure of Spl574 to replicate efficiently in the transfected cells is not entry related and suggests the involvement of factor(s) restricting post-entry stages of Spl574 virus replication in ferret cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Syncytium formation and virus replication in cells expressing dCAT-1 lacking glycosylation sites</title><p><italic>M. dunni </italic>and FerrD2 cells express the same dCAT-1 receptor, but these cells differ in their relative infectivity by MoMLV and Spl574, and they produce syncytia in response to different virus isolates. One possible explanation for these differences is that CAT-1 may undergo different post-translational modification in the two cell lines. It has been shown that resistance of <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells to MoMLV infection is reduced by treatment with the inhibitor of glycosylation, tunicamycin (Tu) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The involvement of glycosylation is also suggested by the observation that the CAT-1 glycosylation patterns differ in transfected MA139 and <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>; lanes e,f).

Also, the fact that the effect on entry is seen with inhibitors other than Tu suggests that inhibition may be due to N-glycan type or size.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Three factors contribute to the observed variations in host range and/or cytopathicity of mouse ecotropic gammaretroviruses: specific sequence differences in the viral <italic>env</italic>, differences in the CAT-1 receptor, and glycosylation of cellular proteins. The role of specific <italic>env </italic>sequence variations in virus-induced syncytium formation was previously suggested by our identification of two MLV isolates that are uniquely cytopathic in <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells. Both isolates have amino acid substitutions at the same RBD residue that is critical for receptor binding: S82F in Spl574 and S84A in F-S MLV. That mutations in the viral receptor binding site contribute to cytopathicity is also supported by the observation that a third MLV variant, TR1.3, is cytopathic in SC-1 cells and brain endothelial cells because of a single substitution, W102G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], at a site that together with S82 and D84 forms the receptor binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The involvement of CAT-1 in the cytopathic response in <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells was suggested by the specific sequence differences that distinguish the dCAT-1 receptor variant from mCAT-1. These 2 receptors differ by 4 amino acids of which two are within the third extracellular CAT-1 loop that contains the virus binding site: I214V, and a glycine insertion within the YGE virus binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. As shown in the present paper, all cells expressing the dCAT-1 variant and none expressing mCAT-1 are susceptible to virus-induced syncytium formation. This indicates that one or both of these two amino acid changes, I214V and &#x00394;236G, are responsible for the cytopathic response mediated by this receptor variant.</p><p>Previous studies with cytopathic retroviruses such as HIV have identified the accumulation of unintegrated DNA as a hallmark of cytopathicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Analysis of MA139 cells expressing the naturally occurring mouse receptor types, mCAT-1 and dCAT-1, shows that receptor type also correlates with this aspect of cytopathicity, and that in different dCAT-1 transfected lines the amount of unintegrated DNA corresponds to the extent of syncytium formation. This cell-virus system may thus be useful in further studies on the mechanisms thought to be involved in this cell killing such as endoplasmic reticulum stress induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>It is known that the glycans on various cell surface receptors can modulate virus entry (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]). The CAT-1 receptor is glycosylated at two sites, and previous studies have shown that glycosylation inhibitors reduce resistance to ecotropic MLV infection in rat and hamster cells expressing the rCAT-1 and haCAT-1 receptor variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], as well as resistance to MoMLV in <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells with dCAT-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It has also been shown that in mink cells expressing mCAT-1, glycosylation affects SU binding and the down-modulation of receptor by virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our results show that glycosylation modulates virus entry mediated by the laboratory mouse CAT-1 receptor, mCAT-1, in NIH 3T3 cells. This resistance is specific to Spl574 and is not seen in heterologous cells expressing mCAT-1. The control of this differential sensitivity of mCAT-1 to a specific ecotropic isolate by cell specific glycosylation has not been previously described.</p><p>The present study also considered whether altered glycosylation could explain why two cells expressing the same dCAT-1 receptor, <italic>M. dunni </italic>and FerrD2, produce syncytia in response to different viruses. As shown by the inhibitor results, however, while N-glycans contribute to the restriction of MoMLV entry into <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells, comparisons of ferret transfectants expressing the dCAT-1 or dCAT-1-g receptor variants produced no evidence that N-glycans modulate virus infectivity or virus-induced cytopathicity in the MA139 cells.</p><p>N-glycans can have high mannose, complex or hybrid structures. The various glycosylation inhibitors target different steps in protein glycosylation and can be used to manipulate the carbohydrate composition of glycoproteins. The inhibitor CST blocks glucose trimming, and DMM and SW inhibit successive steps in mannose trimming. The fact that all of these inhibitors along with the sugar analog 2DG and glycosylation inhibitor Tu relieved the resistance of <italic>M. dunni </italic>cells to MoMLV and of NIH 3T3 to Spl574 suggests that these viruses are most effectively blocked by the large complex oligosaccharides produced in the terminal stages of glycosylation. These results, taken together, suggest roles for N-glycans in virus entry that are virus-specific and cell-specific, and also indicate that this regulation may be sensitive to small sequence changes in both virus and receptor. These results indicate that N-glycans broadly regulate ecotropic gammaretrovirus interactions with the CAT-1 receptor in cells of their natural host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], although it is possible that glycosylated proteins other than CAT-1 may contribute to this resistance.</p><p>Our demonstration that not all infectious viruses are cytopathic in <italic>M. dunni </italic>and FerrD2 cells supports the idea that virus-cell fusion and cell-cell fusion are distinct receptor-mediated phenomena. A similar lack of correlation between infectivity and syncytium formation has been reported, for example, in a mouse cell line that is unusual in its resistance to HTLV Env-mediated syncytium formation although it is highly susceptible to virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It has also been shown that, for a transformed NIH 3T3 cell line subject to MoMLV-induced syncytium formation, chloroquine treatment blocks MoMLV entry but does not also block syncytium formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our results further distinguish cell fusion and virus entry as separate receptor functions.</p><p>Finally, these studies also identify differences between <italic>M. dunni </italic>and FerrD2 cells that are clearly not receptor mediated. Use of LacZ pseudotypes shows that Spl574 Envs efficiently mediate entry into FerrD2 cells, but XC titers in Spl574 virus infected FerrD2 cells are clearly reduced as is virus-induced syncytium formation. This indicates a post-entry block to virus replication leading to reduced surface Env, and the nature of this block is under investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The CAT1 receptor mediates ecotropic gammaretrovirus entry and the cytopathic response to virus infection. Use of virus <italic>env </italic>variants, receptor mutations, and inhibitors of glycosylation demonstrate that both of these virus-receptor interactions are modulated by a small number of critical amino acid residues in virus and receptor, and that N-linked glycans can modulate entry for specific virus-cell combinations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Viruses</title><p>Three ecotropic MLV isolates were obtained from J.
