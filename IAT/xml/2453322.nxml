We recently identified <italic>&#x00391;2ML1</italic>, a new member of the <italic>&#x003b1;2M</italic> gene family, expressed in epidermis. &#x003b1;2ML1 might contribute to the regulation of desquamation through its inhibitory activity towards proteases of the chymotrypsin family, notably KLK7. The expression of LRP1 in epidermis as well as its ability to internalize &#x003b1;2ML1 was investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Principal Findings</title><p>In human epidermis, LRP1 is mainly expressed within the granular layer of the epidermis, which gathers the most differentiated keratinocytes, as shown by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence using two different antibodies. By using various experimental approaches, we show that the receptor binding domain of &#x003b1;2ML1 (RBDl) is specifically internalized into the macrophage-like cell line RAW and colocalizes with LRP1 upon internalization. Coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that RBDl binds LRP1 at the cell surface. Addition of RAP, a universal inhibitor of ligand binding to LRP1, prevents RBDl binding at the cell surface as well as internalization into RAW cells. Silencing <italic>Lrp1</italic> expression with specific siRNA strongly reduces RBDl internalization.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions and Significance</title><p>Keratinocytes of the upper differentiated layers of epidermis express LRP1 as well as &#x003b1;2ML1. Our study also reveals that &#x003b1;2ML1 is a new ligand for LRP1. Our findings are consistent with endocytosis by LRP1 of complexes formed between &#x003b1;2ML1 and proteases. LRP1 may thus control desquamation by regulating the biodisponibility of extracellular proteases.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) is a member of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family of endocytic receptors.

Beside endocytosis, LRP1 can also regulate signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-May2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, LRP1 has been directly involved in migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Cao1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and cancer progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Montel1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. LRP1 is essential for embryonic development, as blastocysts fail to transform into embryos after LRP1 targeted gene disruption in the mouse. The biological importance of LRP1 has also been highlighted by the generation of tissue-specific LRP1 knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Rohlmann1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Boucher1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-May3">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>LRP1 is synthesized as a 600-kDa precursor protein which by proteolytic processing matures into a 515-kDa chain (&#x003b1; chain) and a 85-kDa chain (&#x003b2; chain). LRP1 has been initially described as an endocytic receptor for apolipoprotein E and for the tetrameric protease inhibitor &#x003b1;2-macroglobulin (&#x003b1;2M) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Kristensen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Ashcom1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Strickland1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon formation of a complex consisting in &#x003b1;2M and a protease, a conformational change within the C-terminal domain of each &#x003b1;2M subunit results in the exposure of a previously hidden receptor binding domain (RBD). Such an &#x003b1;2M molecule, designated as the activated form, is able to bind LRP1, in contrast to the native form that is not. LRP1 mediates clearance of the &#x003b1;2M-protease complexes by endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. As &#x003b1;2M is also a cytokine carrier, LRP1 may also function as a regulator of inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-LaMarre1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Wu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Arandjelovic1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We recently identified a new gene of the &#x003b1;2-macroglobulin family, <italic>A2ML1</italic>, and characterized the expression of the corresponding protein, &#x003b1;2ML1, in the epidermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Galliano1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. &#x003b1;2ML1 is expressed by keratinocytes of the uppermost granular layer of the epidermis, where it is secreted through the lamellar bodies into the extracellular space. Distinct from &#x003b1;2M, which is tetrameric, &#x003b1;2ML1 appears to be monomeric, but shares specific features of the &#x003b1;2M family: it presents a broad-spectrum anti-protease activity and is able to form covalent binding with proteases.</p><p>To better understand the role of &#x003b1;2ML1 in the epidermis, we investigated whether &#x003b1;2ML1 can bind LRP1. LRP1 is expressed by multiple cell types, and is especially abundant in hepatocytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, and neurons. In a study using an immunohistochemical approach, LRP1 expression was detected in skin fibroblasts and dermal dendritic cells, but was absent from the epidermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Feldman1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, while another study reported the presence of LRP1 in human epidermis and cultured keratinocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Birkenmeier1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the precise location of LRP1 in human epidermis by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence using two different antibodies. LRP1 appears mainly present in the granular layer of the epidermis at the periphery of the cells. We show that the putative &#x003b1;2ML1 RBD domain (RBDl), comprised of the 143 C-terminal residues, binds to LRP1 and is internalized with this receptor in RAW 264.7 cells. The receptor-associated protein (RAP), a protein chaperone that inhibits binding of many ligands to LRP1, inhibits binding and internalization of RBDl. Down-regulation of <italic>Lrp1</italic> mRNA by siRNA reduces the internalization of RBDl, demonstrating that LRP1 is required for RBDl endocytosis. Comparative amino acid and structure analysis between the RBD domains of &#x003b1;2M and &#x003b1;2ML1 together with competition experiment suggest that the binding site of &#x003b1;2ML1 to LRP1 may be identical from that of &#x003b1;2M.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Antibodies and Reagents</title><p>The following monoclonal (mAbs) or polyclonal antibodies were used in this study: mouse 8G1 mAb (Calbiochem), which recognizes the 515-kDa extracellular &#x003b1; chain of LRP1 (amino acids 1&#x02013;72), mouse 5A6 mAb (Calbiochem), which recognizes the 85-kDa intracellular &#x003b2; chain of LRP1, polyclonal goat anti-&#x003b1;2M antibody (R&#x00026;D Systems), polyclonal rabbit anti- pan desmocollin antibody (Serotec), polyclonal rabbit anti-involucrin antibody (BTI), anti-EEA1 mAb (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-GST mAb (Pierce), anti-actin mAb and MOPC IgG2 mAb (Sigma).

We used either 8G1 or 5A6 mAbs, which recognize the &#x003b1; chain and the &#x003b2; chain of LRP1, respectively. Immunohistochemistry (A, C) and immunofluorescence (B, D) revealed that LRP1 is mainly expressed in the granular layer of the epidermis. The granular layer is the uppermost layer of living cells beneath the stratum corneum and is constituted by the most differentiated keratinocytes. We also detected LRP1 in dermal fibroblasts with the same mAbs, a finding in agreement with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Birkenmeier1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. We then performed double staining with three well-known markers for differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes, namely corneodesmosin (late marker, cytoplasmic and secreted, specific of the granular layer) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002729-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), involucrin (early marker, cytoplasmic) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002729-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), and with the desmosome protein desmocollin 1 (late marker, transmembrane, specific of the granular layer) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002729-g001">Figure 1G</xref>).

By homology with the RBD domain of &#x003b1;2M, we defined the potential RBD domain of &#x003b1;2ML1. This domain, denoted RBDl, was produced as a GST-fusion protein. We first asked whether the RBDl protein could be internalized into RAW cells, as those cells have been described by others as expressing LRP1 at high levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-LaMarre2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Uptake experiments were performed by incubating RBDl, GST alone as a negative control, or the activated form of &#x003b1;2M (&#x003b1;2M-MA) as a positive control, onto RAW cells at 37&#x000b0;C for different times. Immunoprecipitations of recombinant proteins from the cell extracts were then analyzed. RBDl was internalized in a time-dependent fashion into RAW cells, and this was similar to the uptake of the activated form of &#x003b1;2M albeit with a slower kinetic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002729-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The GST protein alone as well as the central bait domain of &#x003b1;2ML1 (recombinant protein CBD) were not internalized. To confirm that RBDl uptake was specific and mediated by endocytosis, we carried out, in parallel, an incubation of RBDl in the presence of 0.4 M sucrose, which has been shown to inhibit clathrin-dependent endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Heuser1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Grey1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002729-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Additionally, to exclude the hypothesis that immunoprecipitated RBDl only resulted from binding at the cell surface during incubation, parallel incubations of RBDl were performed at 4&#x000b0;C. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002729-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, sucrose prevented the uptake of RBDl, supporting the hypothesis that RBDl is internalized by endocytosis. When incubation was performed at 4&#x000b0;C, RBDl was poorly detectable, thus revealing that in our experimental conditions for RBDl uptake, immunoprecipitated RBDl mainly corresponds to the protein that has been internalized. It should be noted that the relative high level of RBDl detected at 37&#x000b0;C as compared to the level of cell-associated RBDl at 4&#x000b0;C may account for accumulation of the protein into the cells before degradation. We then asked whether RBDl could be coimmunoprecipitated with LRP1. Binding experiments were performed by incubating RBDl onto RAW cells in serum-free medium for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C to prevent internalization, followed by immunoprecipitation of LRP1 by 8G1 mAb. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002729-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, RBDl was coimmunoprecipitated by 8G1 mAb, but not by the irrelevant MOPC mAb. Moreover, the CBD protein did not coimmunoprecipitate with the LRP1 antibody. Thus, the specific immunoprecipitation of RBDl together with LRP1 suggests that RBDl interacts with LRP1. To further demonstrate the specificity of interaction between RBDl and LRP1, we analyzed the binding of RBDl at the cell surface in the presence of RAP, a universal ligand competitor for LRP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Herz2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Williams1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

After 2 hours of incubation at 4&#x000b0;C, RBDl binding at the cell surface was clearly detected.

For example, the regions that constitute the BS3 and BS7 &#x003b2;-sheets are highly conserved in all sequences. In contrast, the &#x003b1; helical domains are not conserved between the two groups. Notably, the predicted &#x003b1;-helix 1 is conserved in all A2ML1 orthologs. Interestingly, the two lysine residues positioned in tandem in close vicinity with the &#x003b1;-helix 1 are conserved, suggesting that these residues may be important for the binding to LRP1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we demonstrate that the Receptor Binding Domain of &#x003b1;2ML1 (RBDl) interacts with and is internalized by LRP1. By down-regulating <italic>Lrp1</italic> expression, we show that LRP1 is necessary for RBDl internalization. Our finding suggests that &#x003b1;2ML1, like many other macroglobulins, is a ligand of LRP1. Distinctively, &#x003b1;2ML1 misses the exposed &#x003b1; helix region of the RBD domain of &#x003b1;2M that contains the two lysine residues implicated in binding to LRP1. However, the predicted 3D model of RBDl indicates that &#x003b1;2ML1 may bind to the same site of LRP1 than &#x003b1;2M does <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Dolmer1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, RBDl contains a distinct, and conserved, predicted &#x003b1;-helical region of which two lysine residues are positioned in close vicinity. In the future, it will be interesting to further delineate the region of RBDl required for binding to LRP1.</p><p>Thus far, the expression of LRP1 in the epidermis has been controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Feldman1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Birkenmeier1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we validate the presence of LRP1 in human epidermis. Using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, we found that LRP1 is expressed in the granular layer of epidermis where it appeared to locate at the plasma membrane. Previously, Birkenmeir <italic>et al</italic> had used immunofluorescence labeling and found expression of LRP1 throughout the epidermis with pronounced labeling in the basal layer of epidermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Feldman1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Birkenmeier1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The discrepancy with our immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses may be explained by the use of different antibodies. However, the mAb used by Birkenmeir is no longer commercially available. We believe that the concordant staining we obtained with both the 8G1 and 5A6 mAbs support our conclusions. In agreement with Birkenmeir, we found by immunofluorescence analysis that LRP1 was expressed in the cytoplasm of actively proliferating primary keratinocytes grown <italic>in vitro.</italic> Also, we observed that LRP1 labeling was more intense at the periphery of the cells when keratinocytes were induced to differentiate by 48 h exposure to 1.5 mM calcium (our observations). It will be interesting to study the regulation of LRP1 expression during the differentiation of keratinocytes.</p><p>We have previously shown that &#x003b1;2ML1 is expressed specifically in the granular layer of keratinocytes and is secreted into the extracellular space between the granular layer of keratinocytes and the uppermost layer of corneocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Galliano1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, &#x003b1;2ML1 inhibits diverse proteases and particularly, we have shown that &#x003b1;2ML1 binds to the kallikrein KLK7, a chymotrypsin-like protease important for desquamation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Galliano1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. While a role of LRP1 in the epidermis remains to be determined, it is tempting to speculate that LRP1 might have a role in the endocytosis of complexes formed by &#x003b1;2ML1 and proteases such as KLK7 or other members of the kallikreins.</p><p>An additional role for LRP1 in epidermis may be to regulate the activity of some lipases. It is known that LRP1 plays an important role in lipid metabolism by binding lipoproteins (or chylomycron remnants) generated by hydrolysis of triglycerides by lipoprotein lipases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Rohlmann1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Beisiegel1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Willnow1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, LRP1 also binds directly the lipases that process triglycerides and subsequently mediates catabolism of these lipases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Chappell1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Kounnas1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Verges1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. In the epidermis, extracellular lipids such as ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids, and cholesterol esters, are essential for the barrier function (for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Candi1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>). Of interest are three new genes we have recently identified which encode putative secreted hydrolases specifically expressed in the epidermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002729-Toulza1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. These newly identified lipases are strong candidates for the extracellular hydrolysis of triglycerides in the intercellular space of the stratum corneum. In the future, it will be of particular interest to analyze whether LRP1 can regulate the activity of theses lipases.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that LRP1 can mediate internalization of the RBD domain of &#x003b1;2ML1, suggesting that complexes formed by &#x003b1;2ML1 with proteases may undergo endocytosis via LRP1, a mechanism that could contribute to regulate desquamation. Furthermore, we revealed a new, unknown function for LRP1 in epidermis, which we assume to be crucial in view of the biological importance of this multifunctional receptor in other tissues.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. B.
