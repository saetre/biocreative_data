Recently, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM) molecules were suggested to be important regulators of immune function. In this study, we wanted to investigate whether TIM molecules could play a role in sarcoidosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We used real-time polymerase chain reaction to investigate the differential gene expression of TIM-1 and TIM-3 as well as a few Th1 and Th2 cytokines (IL-2, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13) in CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients <italic>(n = 28) </italic>and healthy controls <italic>(n = 8)</italic>. Using flow cytometry, we were also able to analyse TIM-3 protein expression in 10 patients and 6 healthy controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A decreased TIM-3 mRNA <italic>(p &#x0003c; 0.05) </italic>and protein <italic>(p &#x0003c; 0.05) </italic>expression was observed in patients, and the level of TIM-3 mRNA correlated negatively with the CD4/CD8 T cell ratio in BALF cells of patients. Compared to a distinct subgroup of patients i.e. those with L&#x000f6;fgren's syndrome, BALF CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells from non- L&#x000f6;fgren's patients expressed decreased mRNA levels of TIM-1 <italic>(p &#x0003c; 0.05)</italic>. mRNA expression of IL-2 was increased in patients <italic>(p &#x0003c; 0.01) </italic>and non-L&#x000f6;fgren's patients expressed significantly higher levels of IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA <italic>(p &#x0003c; 0.05</italic>) versus patients with L&#x000f6;fgren's syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings are the first data on the expression of TIM-1 and TIM-3 molecules in sarcoidosis. The reduced TIM-3 expression in the lungs of patients may result in a defective T cell ability to control the Th1 immune response and could thus contribute to the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis. The down-regulated TIM-1 expression in non-L&#x000f6;fgren'spatients is in agreement with an exaggerated Th1 response in these patients.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Sarcoidosis is a T helper (Th) 1-mediated inflammatory disease with unknown aetiology, characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas, and involving accumulations of macrophages and T cells, primarily affecting the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In pulmonary sarcoidosis, an acute onset usually indicates a self-limiting disease course, whereas an insidious onset may be followed by persistent disease with a risk for fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. An imbalance in the expression of Th1/Th2 cytokines by alveolar cells has been suggested to be of importance for the outcome of a pulmonary immune response in sarcoidosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. L&#x000f6;fgren's syndrome is regarded as a distinct clinical group with an acute onset of disease with erythema nodosum (EN) and/or ankle arthritis, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL), fever and with a characteristic favourable disease outcome, often with complete spontaneous resolution. In contrast, non-L&#x000f6;fgren's patients more often have an insidious onset of disease with symptoms such as dry cough, low grade fever, fatigue, shortness of breath and more pronounced chest radiographic changes.</p><p>The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1*0301 allele has been reported to be overrepresented in sarcoidosis patients with L&#x000f6;fgren's syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Additional studies have revealed a strong association between HLA-DRB1*0301 and remarkable expansions of CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells expressing T-cell receptors using the AV2S3 gene segment in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of Scandinavian sarcoidosis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The expansion of AV2S3<sup>+ </sup>cells at disease onset was found to correlate with a better prognosis, suggesting a protective role for these cells in sarcoidosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, any functional role of these cells has not been determined.</p><p>Recent investigations of mechanisms that regulate activation and function of CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells have shown that T cell immunoglobulin -mucin (TIM) proteins are important regulators of immune function. TIM family members are type I transmembrane proteins, with extracellular immunoglobulin and mucin domains and intracellular domains of different lengths. TIMs are differentially expressed on Th1 and Th2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The TIM gene family includes eight genes in mice and three genes in human. In humans, the gene encoding the TIM-1 protein has been considered as an important atopy susceptibility gene and is associated with Th2 T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], suggesting that TIM-1 controls critical regulatory pathways in the immune system. Studies on mice have indicated that TIM-1 is involved in T helper cell differentiation and suggested that the protein is a positive regulator of T cell activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, blocking of TIM-1 during <italic>in vivo </italic>development of T-cell responses in a mouse model of asthma was followed by decreased Th2 immune responses and airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Another member of TIM family proteins is TIM-3, which in contrast to TIM-1 preferentially is expressed on fully differentiated CD4<sup>+ </sup>Th1 cells but not on Th2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The ligand for TIM-3 has been identified as galectin-9, with expression mostly on CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Galectin-9 has been shown to induce apoptosis of T cells via the calcium-calpain- caspase-1 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In mice, interference with the TIM-3-TIM-3-ligand binding resulted in hyperproliferation of Th1 cells with spontaneous production of Th1 cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], as well as macrophage activation and accelerated Th1-mediated autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Accumulating data suggest that TIM-3 negatively regulates Th1-type immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In the current study we examined the mRNA expression of TIM-1 and TIM-3 as well as Th1 and Th2 cytokines in CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells sorted by means of flow cytometry from BALF of patients with active sarcoidosis and healthy subjects. In addition using flow cytometry, the protein expression of TIMs on BALF and blood Tcells was investigated. The patients were stratified depending on whether they had L&#x000f6;fgren's syndrome or not. The expression of the same genes was also investigated in compartmentalized BALF CD4<sup>+</sup>AV2S3<sup>+ </sup>T cells from patients with lung restricted AV2S3 T cell expansions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study subjects</title><p>The study was performed on 47 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis and 14 healthy controls (table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

In comparison to L&#x000f6;fgren's patients, patients without L&#x000f6;fgren's syndrome had reduced TIM-1 mRNA levels, whereas the IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA level was increased.</p><p>The investigation of CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cell clones from cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MS (a Th1-mediated disease) and control subjects showed that TIM-3 expression was down-regulated in MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Indeed, these clones secreted significantly higher amounts of IFN-&#x003b3;, but expressed reduced levels of TIM-3 mRNA compared to clones from healthy subjects. By using small inhibitory (si) RNA, to knock down TIM-3 expression, increased T-cell proliferation and IFN-&#x003b3; secretion was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, a down-regulation of TIM-3 has been considered as an essential T-cell defect to control inflammation in diseases such as MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Sarcoidosis is a Th1-mediated disease with accumulated CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells in the lungs resulting in an increased BALF CD4<sup>+ </sup>to CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cell ratio, which has become a clinically important marker of sarcoidosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The observed reduction of TIM-3 mRNA levels in BALF CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells of patients was associated with an increased CD4<sup>+ </sup>to CD8<sup>+ </sup>ratio in the lungs of patients, implying that a reduced TIM-3 expression on CD4<sup>+ </sup>BALF T cells may lead to more intensive CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cell accumulation in the lungs. The down-regulation of TIM-3 on CD4<sup>+ </sup>but not CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells, as analysed by flow cytometry, may allow Th1 cells to escape galectin-9- induced cell-death, which is consistent with previous results from our group demonstrating that BALF lymphocytes from sarcoidosis patients displayed a non-apoptotic morphology and seemed to be resistant to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The fact that there was no difference in TIM-3 expression between L&#x000f6;fgren's and non- L&#x000f6;fgren's patients is also in line with the almost identical CD4/CD8 ratios in these patient subgroups, suggesting a similar disability of CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells to undergo apoptosis in both patient subgroups.</p><p>The decreased TIM-3 expression could hypothetically be caused by a genetic defect that leads to lower expression of TIM-3 on lung T cells in sarcoidosis patients. This notion may be supported by the association of genetic polymorphisms in human TIM-3 with susceptibility to the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We found no association between HLA-DRB1*0301, known to correlate with a better prognosis in sarcoidosis, and TIM-3 expression.</p><p>The recently identified Th-17 cells, which are highly pathogenic and implied to be involved in the development of various human autoimmune diseases, have also been shown to express low levels of TIM-3 relative to Th1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition, analysing the expression of the TIM-3 ligand, galectin-9, in CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells showed no difference either between patients and controls or between patient subgroups, suggesting TIM-3 as a key factor involved in the uncontrolled Th1 response in the lungs of patients.</p><p>Furthermore, in both controls and patients, we found a higher percentage of TIM-3-expressing CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells in BALF versus blood, suggesting more pronounced regulatory mechanisms to be executed by TIM-3 in the BALF compartment compared with the blood.</p><p>Our patient group includes a large number of patients with L&#x000f6;fgren's syndrome, which is a rather common disease presentation in Sweden, enabling separate studies of this distinct patient group. However, patients with non-L&#x000f6;fgren's phenotype may be more representative for global sarcoidosis patients. In sharp contrast to patients with L&#x000f6;fgren's syndrome, who usually have a very good prognosis with a high rate of spontaneous disease resolution, Swedish non-L&#x000f6;fgren's patients tend to have a non-resolving disease course (own observation). This has also been demonstrated in numerous studies from different countries, reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. As we recently reported, the Th1 response in the lungs of L&#x000f6;fgren's patients is decreased compared to non-L&#x000f6;fgren's patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In our present study, non-L&#x000f6;fgren's patients had a relatively increased IFN-&#x003b3; and a reduced TIM-1 mRNA level compared to L&#x000f6;fgren's patients. The differences in TIM-1 expression may be related to differences in Th1/Th2 profiles. Umetsu et al showed that TIM-1 expression is highly increased on newly activated cells, but with time Th1 cells lose its expression, while it is sustained on Th2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus, the down-regulated TIM-1 expression in non-L&#x000f6;fgren's patients goes well with the exaggerated Th1 response in these patients as also previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The reason why there is no difference in TIM-3 expression between patient subgroups despite higher IFN-&#x003b3; in non-L&#x000f6;fgren patients could be that, even if TIM-3 is a marker of Th1 cells, there is not a strict correlation between the total CD4<sup>+ </sup>cell mRNA expression of IFN-&#x003b3; and the mRNA expression of TIM-3 and/or frequency of TIM-3 expressing cells.</p><p>Similarly, studies on CSF mononuclear cells obtained from patients with MS revealed that higher mRNA expression of TIM-1 associated with clinical remissions and low expression of IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], which could be due to the regulatory role of TIM-1 in inflammation.</p><p>In this study we could not find any differences in expression of the Th2 associated cytokine IL-13 between patient subgroups, and IL-4 and IL-5 were not detectable. However, we previously observed an exaggerated Th1 immune response in non- L&#x000f6;fgren's patients versus L&#x000f6;fgren's patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The possible role of Th2 cells in the lungs of L&#x000f6;fgren's patients is an unexplored area that needs to be further investigated.</p><p>The expansion of AV2S3<sup>+ </sup>T cells in the lungs of HLA-DRB1*0301 positive patients implies that AV2S3<sup>+ </sup>T cells have been selected by interaction with a specific antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. AV2S3<sup>+ </sup>CD4<sup>+ </sup>lung T cells express activation markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and high numbers of these cells correlate with disease activity and a better prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], which indicates a protective roll for this particular T cell subset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Our recent observation of reduced expression of regulatory T cell associated molecules, CD25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and FOXP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] in AV2S3<sup>+ </sup>compared to AV2S3<sup>- </sup>cells suggests an effector rather than regulatory function for these cells. However, in this study we found no differences in either TIMs or cytokine expression in AV2S3<sup>+ </sup>BALF T cells. Further investigations are needed to clarify the exact function of these cells in sarcoidosis.</p><p>Strong correlations were observed between TIM-1 molecule mRNA expression and IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA levels in L&#x000f6;fgren's patients and controls, but not in non-L&#x000f6;fgren's patients.

Further studies on human TIM-3 polymorphisms and function in sarcoidosis may provide us with knowledge to further explain the pathogenesis of the disease. The reduced TIM-1 expression together with increased IFN-&#x003b3; levels in non-L&#x000f6;fgren's patients may relate to the more pronounced inflammatory reaction in these patients. Collectively, the reduced TIM-3 expression on Th1 cells in inflammatory sites may represent a T cell defect to control the Th1 response, which might contribute to the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lungs and the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Hypothetical model of inflammatory reactions in sarcoidosis, comparing the immune response in the lungs of patients with L&#x000f6;fgren's syndrome and those without</bold>. The triggering event is the presentation of an (unknown) antigen by antigen-presenting cells (APC) to T cells. In the lungs of patients, there are fewer regulatory T cells, as well as a lower CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cell expression of TIM-3, compared to healthy controls. Both these factors may contribute to the characteristic Th1-type inflammation. Differences in the exact type of antigen(s) presented in the respective patient subgroups, as well as antigen clearance or persistence, may contribute to the enhanced Th1 response seen in non-L&#x000f6;fgren's patients, which is associated with a lower CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cell TIM-1 expression compared to L&#x000f6;fgren's patients.
