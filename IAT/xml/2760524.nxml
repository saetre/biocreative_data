How tissue architecture and cell polarity are linked and coordinated with cell proliferation control, and how alterations in cell morphology can impact upon the outcome of oncogenic signalling pathways, are now central questions in cancer biology. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Scribble (Scrib), Discs large (Dlg) and Lethal giant larvae (Lgl), cooperatively establish and maintain apico-basal cell polarity and repress inappropriate cell proliferation and neoplasia (invasive overgrowth with a failure to differentiate) in both epithelial and neuronal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, in a fly 'two-hit' model of tumourigenesis, the loss of any one of these three genes has also been shown to cooperate with oncogenic alleles of Ras resulting in neoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. As the function of this group of proteins is conserved in humans (including human Scrib's ability to cooperate with oncogenes in promoting tumourigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]) a deeper understanding is needed of the way in which these genes function to repress neoplasia. <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a powerful model organism, can be used to investigate these questions as pathways regulating cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and tumour cell invasion are all highly conserved between flies and humans [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]].</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, homozygous <italic>scrib</italic>, <italic>dlg </italic>or <italic>lgl </italic>mutants develop to the third instar larval stage but fail to pupate and die as overgrown larvae. Some of the mono-layered epithelial imaginal discs, notably the wing discs, become multi-layered, fail to differentiate and over-proliferate throughout the extended larval stage of development. These overgrown masses of tissue exhibit characteristics of human cancers, including a failure to cease proliferation and differentiate, loss of tissue structure and a propensity to fuse and invade the surrounding tissues. Using clonal analysis in the eye imaginal disc we have previously examined <italic>scrib </italic>mutant clones and shown that, although loss of Scrib is associated with altered cell morphology (indicative of aberrant cell polarity), ectopic expression of Cyclin E (CycE) and excessive cell proliferation, the mutant clones of tissue do not become overgrown because they are removed by Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. If, however, activated oncogenic alleles of either the small GTPase Ras (<italic>dRas1</italic><sup><italic>V</italic>12 </sup>or shortened to Ras<sup>ACT</sup>) or the receptor/transcription regulator Notch (<italic>N</italic><sup><italic>intra </italic></sup>or shortened to N<sup>ACT</sup>) are specifically expressed within the mutant tissue, tumours are formed which become massively overgrown throughout an extended larval stage of development and which then invade the adjacent brain and ventral nerve cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Most of what is known of the way in which Scrib represses epithelial neoplasia in <italic>Drosophila </italic>has focused on how Scrib regulates cell polarity, particularly in the embryonic ectoderm [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]]. Genetic analysis suggests that Scrib, in cooperation with Dlg and Lgl, promotes basolateral membrane identity and functions antagonistically towards two other protein complexes, the Crumbs (Crb) complex and the Bazooka (Baz) complex, both functioning to promote apical cell identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The Crb complex, incorporating Crb, Stardust (Sdt) and Patj, is anchored apically through Crb's transmembrane domain. The Baz complex is also apically enriched and can include Cdc42, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and Par6. Although a mechanistic understanding of how Scrib and the Crb or Baz complexes act antagonistically towards one another is still incomplete, aPKC directly phosphorylates Lgl resulting in its inactivation and the binding of Lgl to aPKC has the potential to repress the ability of aPKC to phosphorylate other targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to what is known about how Scrib regulates cell polarity, much less is known about how it acts to restrain tissue overgrowth. Studies have suggested that the proliferation and polarity functions of Scrib can be separated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, whether Scrib operates antagonistically to Crb and aPKC to repress proliferation is not known. In <italic>lgl </italic>mutants, tumour overgrowth can be rescued through reduced levels of aPKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and aPKC over-expression is capable of inducing CycE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, it is not known if aPKC functions upstream of Lgl, or if Lgl acts to restrain aPKC phosphorylation of alternative key targets that promote epithelial overgrowth. In fact, aPKC can activate Crb through phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and Crb over-expression in the wing disc promotes epithelial neoplasia similar to loss of function mutants in <italic>scrib</italic>, <italic>dlg </italic>or <italic>lgl </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Thus, deregulated Crb activity could be primarily responsible for neoplastic overgrowth in <italic>scrib </italic>mutants as has been suggested for mutants in the syntaxin <italic>avalanche </italic>(<italic>avl</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Deciphering the hierarch that operates amongst these key polarity players in <italic>scrib </italic>mutant epithelial neoplasias is required.</p><p>Similarly, clarification is needed of how <italic>scrib </italic>mutants cooperate with oncogenes in mediating transformation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. A number of studies have shown how Ras<sup>ACT </sup>subverts the pro-apoptotic JNK signalling response in <italic>scrib </italic>mutants into a potent inducer of tumour overgrowth and invasion through the JNK-dependent expression of Matrix metalloproteinase 1 (Mmp1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, whilst there is agreement on the key role of JNK in mediating cooperative overgrowth, these reports give conflicting conclusions about the role of Scrib. It has been suggested that loss of Scrib contributes JNK-independent roles in promoting cooperation with Ras<sup>ACT </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], while others offer evidence that JNK is itself sufficient for the cooperation with Ras<sup>ACT </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and, thus, cell polarity genes such as Scrib repress oncogene-mediated transformation merely by restraining JNK activation. As mammalian studies have recently demonstrated that human Scrib similarly restrains Ras<sup>ACT</sup>-mediated transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], it is important to more fully understand how <italic>Drosophila </italic>Scrib exerts its tumour suppressor function.</p><p>In this study, we define for the first time the relationship between Scrib and other cell polarity regulators in the control of cell polarity and proliferation in imaginal discs. Analysing <italic>scrib </italic>mutant clones in the eye disc, we found that although the over-expression of Crb or aPKC mimics many of the <italic>scrib </italic>mutant defects, the excessive proliferation and alterations in cell morphology in <italic>scrib </italic>mutants are independent of Crb but can be rescued through the expression of a dominant negative aPKC transgene. Furthermore, we identified distinct aPKC and JNK-dependent modes by which <italic>scrib </italic>mutants promote oncogene-mediated transformation. Our data support the critical role of JNK signalling in <italic>scrib </italic>mutants in mediating cooperation with Ras<sup>ACT </sup>and show that JNK is also essential for N<sup>ACT</sup>-driven tumourigenesis. However, our studies also show that aPKC signalling can play a pivotal role in promoting oncogene-mediated tumour overgrowth and these findings are likely to be of relevance to the way in which loss of human Scrib can similarly potentiate oncogene-mediated transformation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Drosophila stocks</title><p>Fly crosses were carried out at 25&#x000b0;C and grown on standard fly media.

However, they do not overgrow because cells die via JNK-mediated apoptosis. Levels of apoptosis were increased in <italic>scrib </italic>mutant mosaic discs and blocking JNK signalling in <italic>scrib </italic>mutant clones by expressing a dominant-negative form of <italic>Drosophila </italic>JNK, Basket dominant negative (Bsk<sup>DN</sup>), dramatically increasing the <italic>scrib </italic>mutant clonal tissue size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In agreement with these observations and other previously published reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], we confirmed that expressing Bsk<sup>DN </sup>in <italic>scrib </italic>mutant clones reduced apoptosis in the mutant tissue, although cell death was still observed in some wild type cells abutting the mutant clones (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, panels A-C). Furthermore, using a reporter of JNK signalling, the <italic>lacZ </italic>enhancer trap, <italic>misshapen </italic>(<italic>msn</italic>)-<italic>lacZ </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], we also confirmed that JNK signalling was ectopically activated within some <italic>scrib </italic>mutant cells, including those undergoing apoptosis, and that expressing Bsk<sup>DN </sup>in <italic>scrib </italic>mutant clones effectively prevented the ectopic expression of <italic>msn-lacZ </italic>in the mutant tissue (see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, panels D-G).</p><p>Thus, having confirmed that ectopic JNK signalling in <italic>scrib </italic>mutant cells promoted cell death, we next wished to determine if any of the other <italic>scrib </italic>mutant defects, including the ectopic cell proliferation and altered cell morphology, were also dependent upon JNK. Proliferation in the eye disc follows a stereotypical pattern that can be visualized by CycE levels and bromedeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Cells normally arrest cell proliferation within the morphogenetic furrow (MF) and undergo a synchronous S phase just posterior to the MF before commencing differentiation, although some unspecified cells undergo a further round of division more posteriorly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). Differentiation in the posterior half of the eye disc can be marked with Elav staining to identify the apically localized nuclei of the developing photoreceptor cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C-E</xref>), although in <italic>scrib </italic>mutant clones the disruption to cell morphology results in photoreceptor nuclei being aberrantly localized basally within the epithelium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F-H</xref>). Blocking JNK signalling by expressing Bsk<sup>DN </sup>did not alter the normal pattern of cell proliferation or morphology within the eye disc (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I, J</xref>), however, <italic>scrib </italic>mutant cells expressing Bsk<sup>DN </sup>showed ectopic cell proliferation posterior to the MF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K, L</xref>) and aberrant cell morphology similar to <italic>scrib </italic>mutants alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1M</xref>). The mutant tissue tended to drop beneath the epithelium resulting in photoreceptor cell nuclei of both mutant and wild type cells being aberrantly localized basally within the epithelium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1N, O</xref>). It was therefore apparent that, while <italic>scrib </italic>mutant cells were eliminated by JNK-dependent apoptosis, the proliferative and cell morphology defects of <italic>scrib </italic>mutants were JNK-independent.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>scrib </italic>mutant clones expressing Bsk<sup>DN </sup>ectopically proliferate and have disrupted cell morphology</bold>.

To determine if this hierarchal relationship is also operative in the eye disc, we began by examining the effects of Crb loss-of-function and Crb over-expression in the eye disc.</p><p>Loss-of-function <italic>crb </italic>clones, using the null allele <italic>crb</italic><sup>11<italic>A</italic>22 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], exhibited no apparent defects in differentiation or cell morphology (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, panels A-B), although during pupal development cell morphology defects become apparent within the developing photoreceptor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In contrast, third instar larval eye disc clones over-expressing a wild-type Crb transgene were small and mutant cells tended to be excluded from the epithelium with severely altered, more rounded, cell morphology. If, however, JNK signalling was blocked within the Crb-expressing tissue by co-expressing Bsk<sup>DN</sup>, clones became considerably larger and also exhibit ectopic cell proliferation posterior to the MF (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, panels C-F). Similar overgrowth and polarity defects, but not JNK-dependent cell death, have been described when Crb was over-expressed in the wing disc epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The similarity in phenotypes between <italic>scrib </italic>mutants and Crb over-expression raised the possibility that ectopic Crb activity could account for the defects in <italic>scrib </italic>mutant cells. To test this we generated <italic>scrib</italic><sup>1 </sup><italic>crb</italic><sup>11<italic>A</italic>22 </sup>double mutant clones. Like <italic>scrib </italic>mutant cells, <italic>scrib crb </italic>double mutant cells had altered cell morphology and were under-represented in mosaic eye discs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, B</xref>). If cell death was prevented through the expression of the caspase inhibitor P35, clone viability was enhanced. The mutant cells showed extreme alterations in cell morphology and most mutant tissue no longer formed a columnar epithelium, but it was contracted and basally extruded beneath the epithelium where it continued to proliferate ectopically (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, D</xref>).

This produced a variable phenotype but generally led to only mild defects in tissue organization and very weak ectopic CycE expression (data not shown). In order to investigate the more extreme consequences of aPKC activation we analysed clones of eye disc tissue ectopically expressing an activated version of aPKC lacking its N-terminal regulatory domain (aPKC<sup>&#x00394;N</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This resulted in small eye disc clones, however, blocking JNK signalling in the aPKC<sup>&#x00394;N</sup>-expressing clones restored clone viability and most of the mutant tissue had aberrant morphology and was extruded basally to form large masses of undifferentiated tissue that ectopically proliferated posterior to the MF (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Thus, like Crb over-expression, the over-expression of aPKC<sup>&#x00394;N </sup>reproduced many of the <italic>scrib </italic>mutant defects, including the alterations in cell morphology, ectopic cell proliferation and JNK-dependent cell death.</p><p>To determine if the <italic>scrib </italic>mutant defects could be due to deregulated aPKC activity we utilized a transgene expressing a kinase-dead, CAAX membrane-tethered, allele of aPKC (aPKC<sup>CAAXDN</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The expression of aPKC<sup>CAAXDN </sup>in otherwise wild-type clones of tissue produced no discernible defects in cell morphology, proliferation or differentiation during larval stages of development (data not shown). Strikingly, however, the expression of aPKC<sup>CAAXDN </sup>in <italic>scrib </italic>mutant clones restored normal cell morphology to the mutant tissue posterior to the MF. Elav and phalloidin staining generally revealed a normal regular array of differentiating ommatidial clusters in <italic>scrib </italic>mutant clones expressing aPKC<sup>CAAXDN</sup>, although sometimes clonal borders showed separation between the mutant and wild-type tissue resulting in tissue scars (data not shown) and occasional basally retracted mutant photoreceptor nuclei (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A-C</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>scrib </italic>mutant clones expressing aPKC<sup>CAAXDN </sup>no longer exhibited ectopic CycE or BrdU incorporation posterior to the MF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D, E</xref>), although ectopic CycE and BrdU positive cells were still sometimes observed surrounding the mutant clones of tissue (data not shown). Such a phenomena is reminiscent of the non-cell autonomous compensatory cell proliferation that can be induced by dying cells within imaginal discs [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]].

Thus, blocking both JNK and aPKC signalling completely suppressed the ability of <italic>scrib </italic>mutants to cooperate with oncogenic N signalling and overcame the aPKC<sup>CAAXDN</sup>-dependent restraint in <italic>scrib</italic><sup>- </sup>+ N<sup>ACT </sup>tissue overgrowth.</p><p>Therefore, in summary, JNK signalling exerts opposing tumour-promoting and tumour-repressing forces upon N<sup>ACT</sup>-driven neoplasia. While JNK is critically required for neoplastic overgrowth in cooperation with N<sup>ACT</sup>, as it is for Ras<sup>ACT</sup>, JNK can also restrain N-driven overgrowth and the loss of Scrib can help overcome the JNK-dependent restraint through aPKC-dependent pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we have extended our original analysis of <italic>scrib </italic>mutant phenotypes in the eye disc epithelium to investigate the relationship between <italic>scrib </italic>and other cell polarity regulators in the control of epithelial neoplasia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This has revealed that the hierarchical relationship between Scrib, Crb and aPKC that regulates epithelial cell polarity in the embryo also controls neoplastic overgrowth in the eye disc, with aPKC being the likely effector of the cell polarity and proliferation defects in <italic>scrib </italic>mutants. We have also identified distinct JNK and aPKC-dependent modes by which <italic>scrib </italic>mutants cooperate with oncogenes in tumourigenic overgrowth and this has the potential to impact upon our understanding of how loss of human Scrib can also promote oncogene-mediated transformation.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Model depicting the pathways through which <italic>scrib </italic>mutants promote tumorigenesis</bold>. (A) In <italic>scrib </italic>mutant cells, inappropriate aPKC activity leads to alterations in cell polarity/morphology and excessive cell proliferation that is restrained through JNK-dependent apoptosis. Although distinct aPKC and JNK-dependent pathways could be genetically separated in <italic>scrib </italic>mutants, it is possible that aPKC-dependent defects, refractory to aPKC<sup>CAAXDN</sup>-mediated inhibition, still drive JNK activation.

This supports the epistatic relationship between <italic>scrib </italic>and <italic>crb </italic>described in the embryo, with the <italic>scrib </italic>mutant phenotype being dominant over the <italic>crb </italic>mutant phenotype, and suggesting that Crb acts upstream or independently of Scrib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In contrast, the strong rescue of <italic>scrib </italic>mutant defects by expressing a dominant negative aPKC transgene suggests that aPKC either acts to inactivate Scrib and blocking aPKC restores Scrib activity as has been proposed for Lgl, or deregulated aPKC activity accounts for the <italic>scrib </italic>mutant phenotype. We favour the latter possibility because of the inability of aPKC<sup>CAAXDN </sup>to rescue JNK-mediated cell death of <italic>scrib </italic>mutant tissue which is more consistent with aPKC functioning downstream of <italic>scrib</italic>. However, complex cross talk between the polarity regulators is likely to exist. Crb over-expression phenotypes can also be suppressed by aPKC<sup>CAAXDN </sup>co-expression, and aPKC can phosphorylate Crb to modulate its activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Similarly, aPKC can phosphorylate and inactivate Lgl, although Lgl also functions genetically upstream of aPKC in restraining the formation of neuroblastomas, by acting as a competitive substrate of aPKC and impeding aPKC's ability to phosphorylate and inactivate Numb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In mammals, Scrib can also function upstream of aPKC via the correct localization of Cdc42 during cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, in this context loss of Scrib appears to impair localized aPKC activity, suggesting that the relationship between Scrib and aPKC activity can vary in different contexts.</p><p>If Scrib does function upstream of aPKC in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, then either loss of Scrib promotes JNK activation independently of aPKC, or, alternatively, deregulated aPKC activity in <italic>scrib </italic>mutants can induce JNK-mediated cell death through a mechanism that is refractory to aPKC<sup>CAAXDN</sup>(kinase dead)-mediated inhibition. Our own work indicates that ectopic aPKC expression can induce JNK-dependent cell death, although whether the kinase dead form of aPKC can block this death is not known. In any event, the relationship between <italic>scrib </italic>and JNK is not likely to be direct since JNK was not activated in all <italic>scrib </italic>mutant tissue and was often associated with clonal borders. This is more consistent with JNK being indirectly activated due to either alterations in cell adhesion or signalling. Consistent with this, <italic>scrib </italic>mutant clones expressing both aPKC<sup>CAAXDN </sup>and Bsk<sup>DN </sup>still showed occasional scaring at clonal edges suggestive of an impaired cell adhesion.</p><p>A relatively small number of neoplastic tumour suppressor mutants have been described in <italic>Drosophila </italic>and, apart from the junctional/scaffold tumour suppressors of <italic>scrib</italic>, <italic>dlg </italic>and <italic>lgl</italic>, the other group of genes, <italic>Rab5</italic>, <italic>avl</italic>, <italic>erupted </italic>and <italic>vps25</italic>, regulate endocytic pathways. Interestingly, <italic>avl </italic>mutant hyperplasia is also rescued by the expression of aPKC<sup>CAAXDN </sup>and this was suggested to reflect the ability of aPKC<sup>CAAXDN </sup>to reduce Crb activity, since Crb levels were elevated and mislocalized in both <italic>avl </italic>and <italic>Rab5 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Whether Crb or aPKC is the key to the formation of <italic>avl </italic>or <italic>Rab5 </italic>neoplasias, clearly an intimate relationship exists between the different neoplastic tumour suppressors and the polarity complex proteins. Understanding the mechanistic links between these different proteins is therefore required.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of JNK signalling in cooperative neoplastic overgrowth</title><p>Our studies confirm previous studies with respect to the key role for JNK in mediating the cooperative neoplastic overgrowth of <italic>scrib </italic>mutants with Ras<sup>ACT </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Oncogenic signals subvert a protective apoptotic JNK response, to an invasive neoplasia. Two identified JNK targets in <italic>scrib</italic><sup>- </sup>+ Ras<sup>ACT </sup>tumours are the matrix metalloproteinase protein, Mmp1 [our unpublished observations, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]], and the integrin-associated scaffolding protein, Paxillin (this study). Mmp expression is required for the tumour invasion since blocking its activity through the expression of Timp (Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases) restrained <italic>scrib</italic><sup>- </sup>+ Ras<sup>ACT </sup>tumour cells from fusing with and invading the brain lobes but did not abrogate tumour overgrowth or restore pupal development [our unpublished observations, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]]. Both Mmp1 and Pax were induced by JNK signalling, independent of both <italic>scrib </italic>or Ras, since clones of cells expressing an activated allele of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>JNKK homologue, <italic>hemipterous </italic>(Hep<sup>ACT</sup>), also showed strong up-regulation of Pax (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>, panel F) and Mmp1 (data not shown). However, it is also likely that Ras and N synergize with JNK to drive expression of novel target genes since, in <italic>scrib </italic>mutants kept alive with P35, JNK remains activated but this does not recapitulate the oncogenic effects of Ras or N [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. One possible key to the ability of JNK to promote overgrowth in combination with Ras<sup>ACT </sup>is through blocking differentiation, since expressing Bsk<sup>DN </sup>in <italic>scrib</italic><sup>- </sup>+ Ras<sup>ACT </sup>tumours restored Ras-induced differentiation and thus restrained tumour over-proliferation enabling pupation of the larvae. However, blocking JNK signalling in <italic>scrib</italic><sup>- </sup>+ N<sup>ACT </sup>tumours could also restore pupation to the tumour-bearing larvae despite massive overgrowth of undifferentiated tumour cells with severely altered cell morphology. Therefore, benign tumour overgrowth is not in itself sufficient to prevent pupation and so synergistic targets of JNK with Ras or N must be responsible. The ability to repress pupation appears to be a property shared by all neoplastic overgrowth in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], although the contribution that JNK plays to this in other contexts is not yet known.</p><p>Many different cell polarity mutants apart from <italic>scrib </italic>share in the capacity to cooperate with Ras<sup>ACT </sup>in neoplastic transformation through JNK signalling, including genes that genetically act in opposition to <italic>scrib </italic>such as <italic>sdt </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and <italic>crb </italic>(our unpublished observation). This is consistent with JNK being activated indirectly as a consequence of disturbed cell polarity/morphology and further suggests that JNK alone might be sufficient for cooperation. Indeed, co-expression of Hep with Ras<sup>ACT </sup>has been shown to result in invasive neoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Our results are consistent with this since the cell morphology and proliferative defects of <italic>scrib </italic>mutant clones are rescued by aPKC<sup>CAAXDN</sup>, however, the mutant cells still undergo JNK-mediated apoptosis and can still cooperate with Ras<sup>ACT </sup>in tumourigeneis. As neoplastic cells between the brain lobes have an elongated mesenchymal-like appearance, JNK and Ras may promote an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by impacting on cell shape and/or cell fate pathways irrespective of the loss of Scrib or the blockade in aPKC activity mediated by the dominant negative aPKC transgene.</p><p>While JNK is clearly an essential component to neoplastic transformation, the level of JNK activation appears to be critical. Ectopic expression of Ras<sup>ACT </sup>alone in clones may induce some JNK activation, as judged by the expression of <italic>msn-lacZ</italic>, but is clearly not sufficient to cause neoplastic tumours. In contrast, co-expressing Hep<sup>ACT </sup>with Ras<sup>ACT </sup>inefficiently results in neoplastic transformation, presumably because the levels of JNK signalling are too high and this restrains overgrowth or leads to cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A loss of Scrib appears to contribute a level of JNK activity strong enough to result in either cell death or neoplastic transformation in cooperation with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of scrib in cooperative neoplastic overgrowth</title><p>The analysis of Ras<sup>ACT</sup>-driven tumourigeneisis suggests that JNK activation is both necessary and sufficient for Ras<sup>ACT </sup>cooperation. However, the fact that blocking aPKC signalling in <italic>scrib</italic><sup>- </sup>+ N<sup>ACT </sup>tumours retards tumour overgrowth suggests that loss of Scrib can also contribute an aPKC-dependent increase in either cell proliferation or cell survival that can profoundly influence the rate of tumour overgrowth. Ras-driven tumours also showed a slight retardation in tumour development with the addition of aPKC<sup>CAAXDN</sup>, although this was much less striking than the effects with N. As JNK signalling remains activated in <italic>scrib </italic>mutant clones expressing aPKC<sup>CAAXDN</sup>, it is likely that JNK can restrain N<sup>ACT</sup>-driven tumour overgrowth, and Ras<sup>ACT </sup>is more effective than N<sup>ACT </sup>at counteracting such a JNK-mediated restraint. The aPKC-dependent effects on CycE and increased cell proliferation in <italic>scrib </italic>mutants could help overcome this restraint. Further analysis will be required in order to elucidate the mechanisms involved.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results demonstrate distinct aPKC and JNK-dependent pathways through which loss of Scrib promotes tumourigenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. aPKC signalling in <italic>scrib </italic>mutants promotes loss of cell polarity and proliferation, while JNK can either restrain tumour development through cell death or, in cooperation with Ras<sup>ACT </sup>or N<sup>ACT</sup>, promote aggressive neoplastic tumour overgrowth.</p><p>Growing evidence links increased levels of aPKC with the development of human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and accumulating data support a role for human Scrib in restraining carcinogenesis [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]]. Furthermore, the knockdown of human Scrib in MCF10A cells has recently been shown to cooperate with Ras<sup>ACT </sup>or Myc in promoting transformation. In the case of Ras<sup>ACT </sup>expression with Scrib knockdown, cells grown in three-dimensional (3D) culture failed to form the normal polarized acini structures with a central luminal and, instead, adopted a highly invasive morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Cooperation with Ras<sup>ACT </sup>was linked to the ability of Scrib knockdown to potentiate MAPK signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], however, phospho-JNK levels were also increased. JNK signalling is increasingly implicated in mammalian carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], although, as in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, its role can be complex as it also promotes tumour regression through cell death in different contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In fact, MCF10A cells grown in 3D culture were also used to investigate Myc-induced transformation of human Scrib knockdown cells, and, in these experiments, luminal filling resulted from Scrib knockdown blocking Myc-induced JNK-dependent cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. While this is at odds with our <italic>Drosophila </italic>observations, that loss of Scrib promotes JNK-mediated cell death, JNK activation in <italic>scrib </italic>mutant clones was variable and possibly regulated through interactions with neighbouring wild type cells rather than through a cell autonomous up-regulation in JNK signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Furthermore, other studies in flies have revealed that the <italic>Drosophila </italic>inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (Diap1) is upregulated in <italic>scrib </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and, thus, the loss of Scrib may potentially protect <italic>Drosophila </italic>cells from apoptosis in some contexts. Our own studies have also revealed that a loss of Scrib can promote N<sup>ACT</sup>-driven tumour overgrowth through aPKC-dependent pathways involving either increased cell survival or increased cell proliferation. Clearly, further work is required to determine how closely related the tumour suppressor function of Scrib in flies is to its mammalian counterpart. Nevertheless, despite undoubted differences that will exist between the <italic>Drosophila </italic>and the mammalian systems, studies in both organisms have the potential to allow important insights into how the outcome of oncogenic stimulus can be profoundly affected by perturbations in cell polarity networks.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>aPKC: atypical protein kinase C; Avl: avalanche; Baz: bazooka; BrdU: bromodeoxyuridine; Bsk: basket; Crb: crumbs; CycE: cyclin E; Diap1: Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis 1; Dlg: discs large; DN: dominant negative; Hep: hemipterous; JNK: Jun N-terminal kinase; Lgl: lethal giant larvae; MARCM: mosaic analysis with repressible marker; Mmp1: matrix metalloproteinase 1; MF: morphogenetic furrow; Msn: misshapen; N: notch; Pax: paxillin; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; Scrib: scribble; Sdt: stardust.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>GRL carried out experiments investigating the role of JNK.
