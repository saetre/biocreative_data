The products of these yeast genes are known to play their roles in mRNA splicing, and belong to a group of proteins collectively called the DEAH family. The hrpA gene is the first example of a DEAH family gene in prokaryotes. The N-terminal region of the protein it encodes contains conserved sequence stretches characteristic of an RNA helicase. Its molecular mass is calculated to be 146 kDa. Previously, a 135 kDa protein was identified by Moir et al. [J. Bacteriol. (1992) 174, 2102-2110] in this region which is most likely identical to that encoded by hrpA. The C-terminal region of the hrpA gene product seems to contain an RNA binding motif weakly resembling that of ribosomal protein S1 of E.coli. Disruption of the hrpA gene suggested that it is not essential for the growth of E.coli.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00004-0063.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="595"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00004-0064.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="596"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00004-0065.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="597"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00004-0066.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="598"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
