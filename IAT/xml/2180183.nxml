Members of the S100 gene family participate in many important cellular functions. Psoriasin, S100A8 (calgranulin A) and S100A9 (calgranulin B) are expressed in ductal carcinoma <italic>in situ </italic>(DCIS), as well as in the hyperproliferative skin disease, psoriasis. In the latter condition, a disturbance in the STAT pathway has recently been reported. This pathway is implicated in the regulation of IFN-gamma, widely recognized as a key cytokine in psoriasis. IFN-gamma also exerts anti-tumor action in a number of tumor cell types, including breast cancer. We therefore examined the effect of IFN-gamma and STAT-signaling on the psoriasin expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We established a TAC2 mouse mammary epithelial cell line with tetracycline-inducible psoriasin expression (Tet-Off). Viability in cell culture was estimated using MTS assay. Protein and gene expression were evaluated by Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR. Statistical analyses were assessed using a one-tailed, paired t-test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We report the downregulation of psoriasin by IFN-gamma in the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line, as well as the downregulation of psoriasin induced by anoikis in cell lines derived from different epithelial tissues. In contrast, IFN-gamma had no suppressive effect on calgranulin A or calgranulin B. IFN-gamma is an important activator of the STAT1 pathway and we confirmed an active signaling pathway in the cell lines that responded to IFN-gamma treatment. In contrast, in the SUM190 breast carcinoma cell line, IFN-gamma did not suppress the expression of endogenous psoriasin. Moreover, a reduced phosphorylation of the STAT1 protein was observed. We showed that IFN-gamma treatment and the inhibition of the transcription factor NFkappaB had a synergistic effect on psoriasin levels. Finally, in TAC2 cells with tetracycline-induced psoriasin expression, we observed the increased viability of psoriasin-expressing cells after IFN-gamma treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data support the possibility that psoriasin expression is transcriptionally suppressed by IFN-gamma and that this effect is likely to be mediated by the activation of the STAT1 signaling pathway. The increased viability of psoriasin-expressing cells after IFN-gamma exposure suggests that psoriasin expression leads to the development of an apoptosis-resistant phenotype.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>S100 proteins are characterised by calcium-binding domains and they are involved in many cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and cell shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Three proteins in this family, predominantly psoriasin but also calgranulin A and calgranulin B, have been shown to be highly expressed in DCIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Both we and others have also identified psoriasin as being differentially expressed between DCIS and invasive breast carcinomas and have found a correlation to poor prognosis, suggesting its potential involvement in tumour progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Psoriasin protein was detected in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, but it was also found to be secreted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In MCF10A human immortalised mammary epithelial cells, the expression of psoriasin is very low in exponentially growing cells, but it is significantly upregulated by growth factor deprivation, loss of attachment to the extracellular matrix (anoikis), and confluent conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Moreover, we showed that psoriasin was induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Since all these conditions influence cell proliferation and survival, psoriasin may play a role in the regulation of these pathways. Consequently, psoriasin expression was shown to correlate to increased survival and NF&#x003ba;B signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Moreover, psoriasin was found to interact with Jun activating binding protein1 (Jab1), which is involved in multiple signal transduction pathways, including the regulation of JUN/AP1 transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The over expression of psoriasin in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was shown to increase nuclear Jab1 activity and enhance tumorigenesis <italic>in vivo </italic>in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We recently showed that the downregulation of endogenous psoriasin expression in the MDA-MB-468 cell line by short hairpin RNAs increased cell migration and invasion without influencing cell proliferation and survival <italic>in vitro </italic>but inhibited tumour growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. In accordance with these findings, we showed an upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) and a downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in cells with reduced psoriasin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>There is evidence that psoriasin can function as a chemotactic factor for CD4+ lymphocytes in the skin and it has recently been implicated in the anti-bacterial defence mechanism of the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The high expression of psoriasin and calgranulin B was initially observed in <italic>psoriasis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which is characterised by the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes, the infiltration of activated T lymphocytes and vascular neogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], features it shares with neoplastic tissues. Psoriasis is a T-cell-mediated disorder and the production of proinflammatory cytokines like Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), Interleukin-1 and Interleukin-12 plays an important role in the psoriatic phenotype. IFN-gamma is one of the key cytokines in psoriasis and is present at high levels in the psoriatic lesion. Its involvement in the pathogenesis of psoriasis is suggested by the finding that uninvolved psoriatic skin develops psoriasis-like lesions at the site of IFN-gamma injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>IFN-gamma has also demonstrated anti-tumor action in diverse tumor cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. IFN-gamma was shown to inhibit the cell growth of mammary carcinoma cells and also to reduce angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The characterization of genes that are regulated by IFN-gamma may lead to a better understanding of the anti-tumoral mechanisms. The purpose of this study was therefore to examine the expression of the S100 proteins psoriasin, calgranulin A and calgranulin B in mammary epithelial cells and keratinocytes <italic>in vitro </italic>after IFN-gamma treatment, with the aim of elucidating signal transduction pathways relevant for both DCIS and psoriasis. We report the suppression of psoriasin by IFN-gamma in mammary epithelial cells and in keratinocytes by the activation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and culture condition</title><p>The primary human keratinocyte cell line, HEKn, was cultured in Epilife medium, supplemented with 1% EDGS and 0. 1% calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) (Cascade Biologics&#x02122;, Portland, OR, USA). The MDA-MB-468 (mammary breast carcinoma) and MCF10A (immortalised normal breast epithelium) cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were cultivated in 10% foetal clone III in McCoy's 5A medium (Gibco, Invitrogen Corporation, UK) and in DMEM/F12 medium (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria), supplemented with 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, 0,01 mg/ml insulin and 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone. The SUM190 cell line (Asterand, Detroit, MI) was cultured in Mammary Epithelial Cell Medium MEGM BulletKit<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(cc-3150) (Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc.). TAC2 (mammary mouse epithelial cells), kindly provided by Professor R.

For suspension cultures (anoikis), cells were plated into poly-2-hydroxy-ethylmethacrylate (polyHEMA) (Sigma Aldrich, Sweden) coated (10 mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>in 95% ethanol) Petri dishes. To investigate the regulation of endogenous psoriasin expression in the MDA-MB-468 cell line, SUM190 cell line and psoriasin induced by anoikis in HEKn and MCF10A, IFN-gamma (Sigma-Aldrich, Sweden) was added to the medium at a concentration of 250&#x02013;2000 u/ml medium. To examine the effect of the NF&#x003ba;B pathway, MCF10A cells were plated in polyHEMA-coated Petri dishes and infected with 1 &#x003bc;l Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) or phosphorylation-defective dnIkk&#x003b2; adenovirus.

The membrane was then blocked in 5% skimmed milk powder in Tris-buffered saline-0.05% Tween (1&#x000d7; TBST-buffer) over night.

To determine whether the downregulation of psoriasin involved the activation of STAT1, we studied the IFN-gamma/Jak/STAT1 pathway using antibodies against STAT1 and phosphorylated STAT1. The induction of STAT1 confirms the presence of the IFN-gamma receptor and the phosphorylated form confirms an active signaling pathway. In agreement with this, we demonstrated the upregulation of STAT1 in MDA-MB-468 cells, HEKn cells and MCF10A cells after 48 hours' treatment with IFN-gamma (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). IFN-gamma treatment led to the phosphorylation of the STAT1 protein (Tyr-701) within a few minutes, thus confirming an active signaling pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>IFN-gamma upregulates STAT1 expression and stimulates the phosphorylation of STAT1</bold>. <bold>A</bold>, IFN-gamma upregulates STAT1 expression in MDA-MB-468, SUM190, HEKn, and MCF10A cells.

Endogenous psoriasin expression in MDA-MB-468 is downregulated by IFN-gamma treatment. However, in the SUM190 cell line, endogenous psoriasin expression was not affected by the treatment.

Several clones with low basal and high inducible psoriasin levels were isolated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). We found no significant difference between the proliferation of psoriasin-expressing TAC2 cells and control TAC2 cells (data not shown). We have previously shown an increase in the survival of psoriasin-expressing MCF10A cells in response to ROS, compared with control cells, and have demonstrated that this increase in survival is likely to be mediated by the NF&#x003ba;B pathway. Like ROS, IFN-gamma treatment leads to decreased viability in mammary epithelial cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). To determine whether psoriasin has an effect on cell viability after IFN-gamma treatment, we used mammary epithelial TAC2 cells with tetracycline-inducible (Tet-Off) psoriasin expression. Psoriasin-expressing TAC2 cells and control TAC2 cells were treated with IFN-gamma and viability was measured by MTS assay. The viability of the psoriasin-expressing TAC2 cells was 15% higher than in the non-expressing TAC2 cells when IFN-gamma was added at seeding (p = 0.01) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). Interestingly, psoriasin-expressing cells showed a resistant phenotype only when IFN-gamma was added when cells were plated. Treatment after cell attachment did not confer any difference in cell viability (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Psoriasin reduces sensitivity to IFN-gamma- induced cell death</bold>. <bold>A</bold>, Incubation with (+) and without (-) tetracycline in the tetracycline-responsive TAC2-tet EGFP2-psoriasin cell line demonstrates a significant amount of psoriasin expression in the absence of tetracycline.

The anti-tumoral role for this cytokine involves both immunologic and non-immunologic processes. IFN-gamma activates cells in the innate immune system to proliferate and to produce cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, IFN-gamma may have direct anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on a variety of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The activation of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) requires the activity of STAT1 transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. IFN-gamma is a potent activator of STAT1 and activated, phosphorylated STAT1 has been correlated to a good prognosis in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. IFN-gamma inhibits the cell growth of mammary carcinoma cells and also reduces the angiogenic phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In metastatic breast cancer, IFN-gamma has been shown to enhance the growth-inhibitory effects of tamoxifen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Moreover, a novel, promising anticancer drug, indole-3-carbinol (13C), was shown to increase the expression of the IFN-gamma receptor 1 and augmented the interferon responsiveness in breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The characterization of genes that are regulated by IFN-gamma may therefore lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of the anti-tumor action, as well as the improved utilization of IFN-gamma in the treatment of breast cancer.</p><p>Psoriasin, calgranulin A and calgranulin B are calcium-binding proteins with diverse biological functions. They have a high degree of structural and sequence homology and all three proteins, and psoriasin in particular, are highly expressed in DCIS and in the hyperproliferative skin disorder, psoriasis. We recently showed, by the hierarchical clustering of S100 gene expression in 22 breast cancer SAGE libraries, that one group with a distinguishable S100 gene expression profile was characterized by the high concomitant expression of psoriasin, calgranulin A and calgranulin B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We are therefore focusing our interest not only on psoriasin but also on all three proteins.</p><p>We have now shown that psoriasin induction in MCF10A cells in anoikis (suspension culture) was suppressed after IFN-gamma exposure, at both the protein and mRNA level. The same effect was observed in the HEKn cell line, suggesting that this effect was not tissue specific. The MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line, which has endogenously produced psoriasin expression, also reduced the psoriasin expression level after IFN-gamma treatment. The cells treated with IFN-gamma displayed the upregulation and phosphorylation of STAT1, which indicates an active signaling pathway. These findings suggest that IFN-gamma mediates its suppressive effect on psoriasin transcription by activating the STAT1 signaling pathway. This conclusion is further supported by the reduced phosphorylation of the STAT1 protein after IFN-gamma treatment in the SUM190 cell line, where the high endogenous expression of psoriasin was not affected by the IFN-gamma treatment.</p><p>We have previously reported the increased survival of psoriasin-expressing cells after ROS treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We now also show the increased viability in psoriasin-expressing mammary TAC2 cells after IFN-gamma treatment, which inhibits the cell growth of mammary carcinoma cells. High-grade comedo DCIS tumors demonstrate high apoptosis rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and surviving tumor cells are also likely to be relatively more resistant to apoptosis. ROS thus lead to the endogenous production of psoriasin, which may contribute to apoptosis resistance in DCIS and psoriasis. The cytoprotective role of psoriasin in IFN-gamma-induced cell death is in line with the reported anti-apoptotic role of NF&#x003ba;B in several cell types, such as the protection from Tumor Necrosis Factor-&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The increased viability seen in psoriasin-expressing cells could therefore be mediated through an NF&#x003ba;B-dependent pathway, which is supported by our data.</p><p>Interestingly, although all three S100 proteins are expressed in the MDA-MB-468 cancer cell line and in the normal epithelial cell lines in anoikis, IFN-gamma treatment had no effect on the expression levels of calgranulin A and calgranulin B. This may indicate that IFN-gamma interferes with signals that specifically modulate psoriasin expression.</p><p>In addition to the induction of psoriasin expression seen in anoikis, we have previously demonstrated the upregulation of psoriasin and calgranulin B in mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) and keratinocytes (HEKn) in response to several other differentiation-promoting stimuli, such as an increase in extracellular calcium and confluent conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We have also shown that psoriasin and calgranulin B are induced by ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We now also show that calgranulin A is induced by ROS, which supports the assumption that these three S100 proteins share, at least in part, common signaling pathways in breast cancer. Our hypothesis is that, in all the conditions that induce psoriasin, calgranulin A and calgranulin B expression, ROS are produced. Accordingly, we have demonstrated the suppression of psoriasin and calgranulin B by the antioxidants Bcl-2 and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). However, we only observed the suppression of psoriasin by IFN-gamma in the anoikis condition, suggesting that the IFN-gamma-mediated signals implicated in psoriasin expression may only be present in anoikis and not in the other differentiation-promoting conditions.</p><p>We hypothesise that psoriasin is induced in anoikis by other stimuli and not only because of the presence of ROS. This would explain the massive induction seen in anoikis as compared with the other inducing conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The finding that IFN-gamma suppresses psoriasin induction in anoikis lead to the hypothesis that the loss of adhesion signaling may contribute to the high psoriasin expression. Furthermore, the viability assay suggests that psoriasin expression may be related to the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix; we observed that viability was higher in psoriasin-expressing cells when cells were treated with IFN-gamma at seeding compared with treatment following cell attachment. Attempts to identify the adhesion signals that interfere with psoriasin expression are currently ongoing.</p><p>The finding that psoriasin is downregulated by IFN-gamma has interesting clinical implications. IFN-gamma and STAT1 have previously been shown negatively to regulate angiogenesis. Recently, IFN-gamma was shown to suppress several of the angiogenic effects of VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We have previously shown that the downregulation of endogenous psoriasin in MDA-MB-468 cells led to the corresponding downregulation of VEGF and decreased tumour size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The importance of psoriasin in mediating the anti-angiogenic properties of IFN-gamma remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We report the suppression of psoriasin by IFN-gamma in two cell lines derived from two different normal epithelial tissues and in the ER-negative MDA-MB-468 breast carcinoma cell line. Our data implies that IFN-gamma mediates its suppressive effect on psoriasin transcription by activating the STAT1 signaling pathway. Psoriasin-expressing mammary epithelial cells showed increased viability after IFN-gamma exposure compared with normal cells.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>S100A7 = Psoriasin, S100A8 = Calgranulin A, S100A9 = Calgranulin B, Ductal carcinoma in situ = DCIS, Signal transducers and activators of transcription = STAT, Interferon-gamma = IFN-gamma, CellTiter 96<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>AQ<sub>ueous </sub>One Solution Cell proliferation assay = MTS, Reactive oxygen species = ROS, Jun activating binding protein1 = Jab1, Vascular endothelial growth factor = VEGF, Poly-2-hydroxy-ethylmethacrylate = polyHEMA, Green Fluorescent Protein = GFP, Hydrogen peroxide = H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, Tet activator = tTA, and Crossing point = CP.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SP and CE participated in designing the study, acquiring, analyzing and interpreting data, and preparing the manuscript.
