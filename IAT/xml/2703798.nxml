However, how plaques accumulate and how clearance is affected by microglia is poorly understood. Early ultrastructural studies suggest that microglia affect progression of cerebral amyloidosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Wisniewski1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Such defective microglial clearance functions have recently been supported by long-term <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of amyloid plaques. These studies demonstrated long-term stability of amyloid deposits following A&#x003b2; synthesis interruption by the Tet-off system. This extravascular protein synthesis progresses even though microglia are in close proximity to the newly developed plaques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Jankowsky1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Bolmont1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Age-related microglial dysfunction for amyloid clearance also correlates with enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Hickman1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, recruitment of peripheral blood-borne macrophages into the brain parenchyma dramatically enhances amyloid clearance, suggesting the possibilities of contrasting roles of resident microglia and recruited blood monocyte-derived perivascular macrophages for amyloid clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Simard1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Town1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) is a &#x003b2;-chemokine responsible, in part, for the chemotaxis of mononuclear phagocytes (MP; microglia, peripheral monocytes and macrophages). CCL2 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and sera are linked to neurodegeneration. Indeed, the amount of CCL2 shows a negative correlation with cognitive scores in mild cognitively impaired (MCI) and AD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Galimberti1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings suggest that elevated CCL2 is a very early event in AD pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Galimberti2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to elucidate the role of CCL2 in AD pathogenesis, we developed APP/CCL2 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Yamamoto1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. These mice were made by crossing an established A&#x003b2; deposition mouse model (Tg2576) with a CCL2 over-expressing mouse under the regulation of glial acidic fibrillar protein (GFAP) promoter (JE-95) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Huang1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. CCL2 over-expression led to microgliosis and increased diffuse plaque formation in APP/CCL2 bigenic mice. Interestingly, both increased CCL2 signaling in our APP/CCL2 bigenic mice and deficient CCL2 signaling in APP/CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice worsened AD pathology in different manners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-ElKhoury1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. We now posit that intrathecal CCL2 expression (as observed in AD) accelerates beta-amyloidosis. By contrast, circulating &#x02018;inflammatory&#x02019; (Ly6-C<sup>hi</sup>/CCR2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) monocytes affect A&#x003b2; clearance in APP transgenic mice.</p><p>To address this apparent discrepancy we have now extended our studies in two ways: (1) we evaluated hippocampal neurophysiology, memory and cognition to establish the functional importance of the neuropathologic endpoints; and (2) we assessed whether microglia affect conversion of monomeric A&#x003b2; to oligomer form, a key step towards cognitive dysfunction and subsequent fibril formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Kayed1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Lesne1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Accelerated neurodegeneration was found in APP/CCL2 bigenic mice. Our findings are highly relevant to AD pathogenesis, and direct inhibition of CCL2 signaling will reduce microglial activation in a fashion that will both lower A&#x003b2; deposition and improve behavioral outcomes. Suppressing CCR2 function, by contrast, can exert an opposite effect by impairing A&#x003b2; metabolism and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Accelerated memory impairments in APP/CCL2 mice</title><p>Tg2576 mice exhibit impaired memory retention and memory acquisition by 6 and 12 months of age, respectively, when tested by hidden platform or by a radial arm water maze (RAWM) test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Arendash1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. A10-day RAWM task was employed to assess working (short-term) memory in APP/CCL2, CCL2, APP, and WT mice at 2&#x02013;3 and 8&#x02013;9 months of age but using the same mice. RAWM has been used effectively with mice to measure hippocampal function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Arendash1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Diamond1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In this learning test paradigm, an average error number of less than one by trial 4 (T4) or T5 is regarded as secured memory formation or recall, respectively. All animal groups, including APP mice, showed secured memory formation and recall except the APP/CCL2 bigenic mice, at 2&#x02013;3 months of age, when errors at T4 and T5 were assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006197-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Average latency (or time to reach the correct platform) was used, in parallel tests, to measure memory formation and recall. As a reference, the average latencies at T4 and T5 were similar among all groups with the exception of a significantly longer latency in APP/CCL2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006197-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). APP and CCL2 mice have normal memory function at 2&#x02013;3 months of age, whereas APP/CCL2 mice have already developed memory impairment. Consistent with previous reports, APP mice develop memory impairments by 8&#x02013;9 months when compared to age-matched WT or CCL2 littermates (T4 and T5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006197-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, APP/CCL2 mice show more severe memory impairments as determined by errors and latencies at T4 and T5, when compared to APP, CCL2, or WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006197-g001">Fig. 1B, D</xref>). These data suggest that memory formation and retention were more significantly impaired in APP/CCL2 than in APP mice as early as 2&#x02013;3 months and were sustained to 8&#x02013;9 months. To rule out impairment of vision, motor coordination, or motivation as causes for defective memory formation we tested the same mice for balance beam behavior, body weight, and voluntary swimming speed in the open field at two different ages (Supporting information (SI) <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006197.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). The numbers of crossed segments on the balance beam, indicative of basic sensory-motor coordination, were significantly higher in CCL2 groups when compared to the 8&#x02013;9 months age groups. Some differences in voluntary activity of animals among groups were seen but did not correlate with the RAWM results. Lower body weights were observed in the APP mice when compared to WT animal groups at 2&#x02013;3 months. Such weight differences were also observed in the APP/CCL2 and APP groups when compared to CCL2 mice at 8&#x02013;9 months. Nonetheless, voluntary swimming speeds of APP/CCL2 were similar to WT and CCL2. APP mice swam faster than the WT group at 8&#x02013;9 months excluding the possibility that a lower body weight resulted in slower swimming speeds. Overall, these data support the idea that learning and memory formation do not affect swimming or locomotor function at any mouse age. Thus, impaired working memory, measured by errors and latency, was readily seen in APP/CCL2 mice.</p><fig id="pone-0006197-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006197.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Accelerated spatial learning impairment in APP/CCL2 mice.</title><p>The same animals were tested by RAWM test at two different time points: 2&#x02013;3 (A and C) and 8&#x02013;9 months of age (B and D).

These findings are secondary to A&#x003b2; aggregation as over-expression of CCL2 alone has no effect on cognitive function. The data support the idea that CCL2 is a co-factor in A&#x003b2;-induced memory impairment for APP mice. The effect of A&#x003b2; with CCL2 co-expression was also observed for spatial learning, PPF, and input-output responses. PPF is a measure of presynaptic function, thought to result from an increase in transmitter release due to a calcium influx into the presynaptic terminal during responses to an initial stimulus. Although PPF is not a direct measure of the transmitter release from the presynaptic terminals, the impairment of PPF suggests that the presynaptic terminals in APP/CCL2 mice may be less able to sustain neurotransmitter release with repetitive stimulation. Moreover, significant enhancement of the input-output responses in APP/CCL2 mice was observed at 270 mA stimulus intensities when compared to WT mice. The enhancements of input-output responses in APP/CCL2 could explain why A&#x003b2; induces altered intracellular calcium levels and membrane excitability by blocking fast-inactivating potassium (A) currents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Good1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. We have also examined the hippocampal CA1 LTP evoked by tetanic stimulation of the Schaffer collateral pathway using APP/CCL2, APP, CCL2, and WT mice at 6 months of age, which did not affect LTP impairments (data not shown). This suggests that the effect of endogenously developed A&#x003b2; oligomers is not sufficient to induce LTP impairments and that 10-day RAWM tests are a more sensitive measure to assay neuronal dysfunction.</p><p>Our previous study on APP/CCL2 mice demonstrated that microglial accumulation enhances diffuse plaque formation, suggesting the enhancement of A&#x003b2; aggregation by CCL2. Indeed, A&#x003b2; oligomers are quantitatively elevated in APP/CCL2 mice as compared to age-matched APP littermates in this study. Since A&#x003b2; oligomer levels directly correlate with memory impairment, it is likely that CCL2 accelerates the onset of memory impairment by enhancement of A&#x003b2; oligomerization in the brain. However, extracellular A&#x003b2; oligomers in APP or APP/CCL2 bigenic mice were undetectable using our system at 2&#x02013;3 months of age (data not shown). This suggests that very low amounts of A&#x003b2; oligomer could induce memory dysfunction in young mice, or, alternatively, a combination of CCL2 and other inflammatory factors elicited by A&#x003b2; production (such as reactive oxygen species) may influence memory formation. Indeed, A&#x003b2; oligomers inhibit LTP induction partly through microglial activation and inducible nitric oxide synthase and superoxide formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Wang1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the exact mechanism behind how CCL2 enhances A&#x003b2; oligomerization is unknown, our data demonstrates that A&#x003b2; uptake by microglia was significantly enhanced by CCL2, which resulted in an increase of oligomerized A&#x003b2; species in both intracellular and extracellular fractions. Microglia mediate A&#x003b2; internalization through a nonsaturable, fluid phase macropinocytic mechanism. This mechanism is distinct from phagocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Mandrekar1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and dependent on actin and tubulin dynamics. Thus, it is possible that CCL2, which is a well-known chemoattractant protein for microglia, may prominently activate cytoskeletal dynamics as a part of its chemotactic signaling and coincidentally affect A&#x003b2; uptake. It should be noted that the NU-2 staining of microglia is 70&#x00025; preserved without cell permeabilization (data not shown). This suggests that majority of the A&#x003b2; aggregation seems to take place on the cell surface rather than intracellularly. This is also consistent with the fact that CCL2 rather suppresses A&#x003b2;-stimulated microglial phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-KoenigsknechtTalboo1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Altogether, it is possible that CCL2 mobilizes actin and tubulin cytoskeletal dynamics, which enhance A&#x003b2; uptake. In this manner, cell surface A&#x003b2; can rapidly aggregate to form A&#x003b2; oligomers. We have previously shown that A&#x003b2; oligomer uptake was strikingly negligible as compared to those of monomeric or fibrillar A&#x003b2; in monocyte-derived macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Yamamoto4">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that oligomeric A&#x003b2; will dramatically lose its binding affinity to the membrane and be secreted. This may be a mechanism for CCL2-mediated A&#x003b2; oligomer formation and A&#x003b2; seeding for developing daughter plaques surrounding the parent amyloid plaques.</p><p>We did not observe significant microgliosis in the hippocampus prior to A&#x003b2; deposition in the APP or APP/CCL2 mouse brain as compared to non-Tg littermates, although we did see accumulation of microglia surrounding either diffuse or compact plaques. This is in contrast to the report of the APP/CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse study, which shows enhanced microgliosis in APP mice prior to the parenchymal A&#x003b2; deposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-ElKhoury1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, APP/CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice develop accelerated amyloid angiopathy and shortened lifespans. These data suggest the contrasting role of CCL2 to microglia and peripheral monocytes. In brain parenchyma, CCL2 may enhance microgliosis around amyloid depositions and enhance beta-amyloidosis partly through A&#x003b2; oligomer formation in microglia. In periphery, CCL2 is a key molecule for the CNS recruitment of circulating monocytes, which are 7/4<sup>bri</sup>Ly-6G<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CCR2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>F4/80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Tsou1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> or Ly-6C<sup>hi</sup>CCR2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Mildner1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, and play a critical role in amyloid clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Simard1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Disruption of CCR2 leads to impaired mobilization of monocytes from bone marrow and their CNS recruitment, which will ultimately led to enhanced beta-amyloidosis. Thus while brain CCL2 production may enhance beta-amyloidosis, peripheral CCL2 will enhance clearance.</p><p>Neurodegeneration found in young APP/CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice suggests the impaired neuroprotective effect of brain microglia or recruited monocytes by disruption of CCR2. Although resting microglia are neuroprotective, upon stimulation of innate immunity mechanisms by a myriad of molecules, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and Toll-like receptor ligands, microglia convert to an inflammatory phenotype and become neurotoxic. In accord, microglia in APP mice show pro-inflammatory activation by aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Hickman1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, suppression of CCL2 signaling in aged brains may not develop adverse effects on neurons. Interestingly, CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed enhanced noise-induced inner hair cell loss, independent of CCL2 signaling, suggesting CCL2-independent neuroprotective responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Sautter1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, neutralization of CCL2 in CNS should not affect the neuroprotective signaling of CCR2 for therapeutic invention, and CNS suppression of chemokine-mediated microgliosis through chemokine inhibitors may be of therapeutic interest. Other chemokines, such as IL-8, upregulated in MCI and AD patients, are likely to have similar functions in microgliosis and cognitive dysfunction for APP mice. The functions of these other chemokines need to be a focus of future investigations. The cumulative prediction was that increased intrathecal CCL2 would be deleterious for APP transgenic mice. Further study will be necessary to determine how blockage of brain CCL2 affects AD progression in affected people.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>All the animal studies followed guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Nebraska Medical Center.

The errors for the last 3 days of testing of each mouse were averaged and used for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Hippocampal slices and electrophysiology</title><p>Five to six-month-old transgenic and WT mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane, decapitated, and their brains quickly removed from the cranial cavity. The brains were placed into an ice-cold (4&#x000b0;C) oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) environment. The hippocampi were dissected free and 400 &#x000b5;m-thick (transverse section in hippocampus) slices were cut using a tissue chopper. The slices were stored in a humidified/oxygenated holding chamber at room temperature for at least 1 h before being transferred into a recording chamber. In the recording chamber, single hippocampal slices were fully submerged in a continuously perfused ACSF solution at a constant flow rate of 2 ml/min with the use of a peristaltic pump (Rainin Instruments). The ACSF contained (in mM): NaCl (124.0), KCl (3.0), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2.0), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (2.0), NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (1.25), NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (26.0) and glucose (10.0). ACSF was equilibrated with 95&#x00025; O<sub>2</sub> and 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> and had a pH of 7.4&#x02013;7.5. The temperature of the perfusion was maintained at 30&#x000b1;1&#x000b0;C with an automatic temperature controller (Warner Instruments).</p><p>Field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were generated by test pulses applied every 20 sec (low frequency) with a constant current stimulation (100&#x02013;300 &#x000b5;A, 40 &#x000b5;sec in duration) of Schaffer collateral-commissural axons using an insulated bipolar tungsten electrode (except for the tip). The intensity and duration of stimulation were adjusted to generate approximately 30&#x02013;40&#x00025; of a maximal response. The evoked fEPSPs were recorded with an Axopatch-1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.) in the CA1 dendrite field. The recording microelectrodes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries with inner filaments that enable quick back-filling as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Ikezu1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Xiong1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The tip diameter of the microelectrode was about 5.0 &#x000b5;m and had a resistance of 1&#x02013;5 M&#x003a9; when filled with ACSF.</p><p>Input-output tests were conducted using fixed pulse duration of 40 &#x000b5;sec with stimulation intensities increasing from 30 to 300 &#x000b5;A in increments of 30 &#x000b5;A. Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) was assessed with twin pulses at a fixed pulse duration of 40 &#x000b5;sec and a varying interpulse interval (20, 40, 80, 160, 320 msec). The paired pulses were delivered at 20-sec intervals and six consecutive responses were averaged for each PPF test. The degree of facilitation was determined as the increase in ratio of the initial slope of the second response over first response in each pair.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Protein extraction and ELISA</title><p>CCL2 ELISA was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Yamamoto1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006197-Yamamoto3">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.
