The hypothesis is that subjects with the ALAD 1-1 genotype are more susceptible to lead exposure with impaired hematologic synthesis and therefore that iron nutrition is more important in those with the ALAD 1-1 genotype. The purpose of this study was to prove the protective effect of ALAD 1-2/2-2 against PbB with higher hematologic parameters. Data on 1,219 male workers from eight lead-using factories in the Republic of Korea were examined in this cross-sectional study. Blood samples were evaluated for PbB, ZPP, hemoglobin (Hb), and serum iron (SFe) concentrations and ALAD genotypes. The overall prevalence of the ALAD 1-2/2-2 genotype was 9.3%, which was associated with lower log ZPP (p &#x0003c; 0.001) and higher Hb (p = 0.014) levels. For the subjects with normal iron status (SFe levels &#x0003e; 60 micro g/dL), those with the ALAD 1-1 genotype were more likely to be anemic (adjusted odds ratio of 5.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-22.6) than those with ALAD 1-2/2-2. The study confirms the protective effects of ALAD 1-2/2-2 polymorphisms against PbB on hematologic pathways. In order to promote health and to minimize the toxicity of lead exposure more effectively, the nutritional management of iron in Korean workers should take both their ALAD genotypes and occupational lead exposures into account.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
