First, 10&#x02013;15 nt RNA primers are synthesized, followed by coupled short (20&#x02013;30 nt) DNA synthesis by the polymerase (pol) &#x003b1;-primase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c9">9</xref>). The RNA&#x02013;DNA primer is then extended by DNA pol &#x003b4; to full-length Okazaki fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c6">6</xref>). The primer RNA can be completely removed by the combined action of RNase HI and Fen1 while the Okazaki fragments remain hybridized to the lagging strand template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c5">5</xref>). Recently, it was shown that pol &#x003b4; displaces the 5&#x02032; end region of downstream Okazaki fragments during extension of the upstream Okazaki fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c11">11</xref>). This results in the generation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) flaps that can be efficiently processed by the combined action of Dna2 and Fen1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c11">11</xref>). During this processing step, replication protein A (RPA) plays a critical role in regulating the sequential action of Dna2 and Fen1. Dna2 is responsible for the removal of most of the flap, leaving a short (6 nt) flap region that can be removed by Fen1. Fen1 and other nucleases ultimately generate nicks that are sealed by DNA ligase I. Although it is well accepted that Dna2 is an essential nuclease involved in Okazaki fragment processing, it is not clear what fraction of Okazaki fragments is processed in a Dna2-dependent manner. The frequency of the involvement of Dna2 is probably directly related to the size distribution of the flaps generated <italic>in vivo</italic> by pol &#x003b4;-catalyzed displacement DNA synthesis.</p><p>In addition, other factors (and their homologs in other organisms) such as Werner helicase and Cdc24 from mouse and <italic>S.pombe</italic>, respectively, are likely to be involved in Okazaki fragment processing by virtue of their functional interactions with Fen1 and Dna2. The roles of these proteins, however, are not clear in Okazaki fragment processing. The Werner helicase, which possesses both 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; helicase and 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exonuclease activities, greatly stimulates Fen1-mediated cleavage of flap or nicked duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c13">13</xref>). However, neither the helicase nor the exonuclease of the Werner protein is required for this stimulation, which depends on direct protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c13">13</xref>).</p><p>In fission yeast, <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> has been implicated in Okazaki fragment processing because of its genetic and physical interactions with <italic>dna2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c15">15</xref>). The <italic>cdc24</italic> mutation resulted in a similar phenotype to that of a <italic>dna2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c14">14</xref>). Overexpression of Dna2 rescued the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the <italic>cdc24-G1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c14">14</xref>). Moreover, <italic>pfh1</italic> mutations suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> mutation and conferred cold sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c17">17</xref>). The <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene of <italic>S.pombe</italic> is homologous to <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae PIF1</italic> that has dual roles <italic>in vivo</italic>; it is required for the stable maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c18">18</xref>) and telomere integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c20">20</xref>). In addition, the temperature-dependent lethality of <italic>dna2-C2</italic> mutants was suppressed by overexpression of <italic>cdc1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or <italic>cdc27</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, both of which encode subunits of pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c16">16</xref>).</p><p>Owing to their complex genetic interactions and lack of biochemical data, it is unclear how the <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, <italic>dna2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and pol &#x003b4; proteins act in concert during Okazaki fragment processing. Nevertheless, the genetic data suggest a close functional relationship among <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, <italic>dna2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and pol &#x003b4;. Although Okazaki fragment processing in eukaryotes is highly conserved, the specific protein factors required for processing varies from organism to organism. For example, <italic>S.pombe</italic> Dna2 displays no detectable DNA helicase activity (unpublished data). Similarly, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> Dna2 has negligible ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c21">21</xref>). This is in contrast to the observation that the DNA unwinding activity of Dna2 aids its endonuclease activity by resolving any potential secondary structure present in the flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c22">22</xref>). Under these circumstances, it is conceivable that DNA helicase activity is provided by another cellular DNA helicase that interacts with the Dna2 protein. One such candidate is Pfh1. One prediction is that a Dna2-associated helicase, if it exists, may possess biochemical properties similar to those of the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Dna2 helicase. Alternatively, <italic>in vivo</italic> displacement of DNA synthesis by <italic>S.pombe</italic> and <italic>X.laevis</italic> pol &#x003b4; may not produce long flaps from the 5&#x02032; end regions of Okazaki fragments. If this were the case, these organisms would be less dependent on or entirely independent of a requirement for the DNA helicase activity of Dna2.</p><p>Like yeast Dna2, Pfh1 unwinds duplex DNA in the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; direction in an ATP-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c20">20</xref>). However, other properties of Pfh1 required to understand its precise function remain unclear. Expression of the full-length Pfh1 protein in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and other systems, including yeasts and insect cells, resulted in insoluble aggregates and extensively degraded protein preparations, which has made it difficult to examine its biochemical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c22">22</xref>) (see also Results). As a part of our ongoing study of Okazaki fragment processing, we have isolated the full-length <italic>S.pombe</italic> Pfh1 enzyme. We have also analyzed the genetic interactions of <italic>pfh1</italic> with the <italic>cdc24</italic> and the <italic>dna2</italic> genes in order to gain more insight into their function <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this study, we describe the biochemical properties of Pfh1 and show that it interacts with <italic>dna2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. Loss-of-function mutation of <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> abrogated the requirements for a fully functional <italic>dna2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, indicating that <italic>dna2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (or <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) should remain active as long as <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is functional.

To construct an expression vector (pET43-Pfh1F-R20) that produces a Pfh1-R20 mutant protein, a single amino acid change (leucine into serine at amino acid position 458) was introduced into the Pfh1 open reading frame (ORF) in pET43-Pfh1F using the Quick-Change&#x02122; Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene).</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of the recombinant Pfh1 proteins</title><p>Purification of the recombinant Pfh1 proteins was carried out using the same procedures as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c17">17</xref>) except that we introduced FLAG-affinity column chromatography and a second round of a Superdex 200 HR 10&#x0002f;30 column chromatography.

For example, a substantial (&#x0003e;90%) fraction of the NusA-Pfh1 protein eluted in the void volume during the gel filtration step in our previous purification efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c17">17</xref>), and the helicase and ATPase activities in this fraction were much lower than expected from the amount of protein present (data not shown). Even the Pfh1 protein that was included in this step displayed variable levels of helicase and ATPase activities from preparation to preparation (data not shown). In order to increase the yield of active enzyme, we improved the purification procedure by adding a FLAG epitope to the C-terminus of NusA-Pfh1 to produce NusA-Pfh1-F. The expression of this recombinant protein in <italic>S.pombe</italic> complemented the deletion of the <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene (data not shown). The NusA-Pfh1-F protein was purified using Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-nitriloacetic acid (NTA) agarose, anti-FLAG M2 Ab-agarose, and two successive rounds of Superdex 200 HR columns as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f1">1</xref>, the elution of the ATPase and helicase activities were not precisely coincidental with the amount of protein present in the fractions obtained during the second gel filtration step.

To unambiguously demonstrate that the ATPase and helicase activities detected in the peak fractions (fractions 18&#x02013;20) were intrinsic to Pfh1, we examined whether these activities in the pooled peak fractions could be simultaneously depleted by anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f2">2</xref>). Prior to this experiment, we examined whether the presence of the NusA protein tag inhibited the enzymatic activities associated with Pfh1. To this end, the NusA-Pfh1-F enzyme was digested with thrombin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f2">2</xref>A). Thrombin cleavage resulted in a small decrease in ATPase and helicase activities (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f2">2</xref>B and C), indicating that the NusA tag does not interfere with the enzymatic activities of Pfh1 <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is in keeping with the observation that the NusA-Pfh1-F complemented the deletion of <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup><italic>in vivo</italic>. We used the proteolyzed enzyme preparation for subsequent immunodepletion experiments. The addition of anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads depleted both ATPase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f2">2</xref>D) and helicase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f2">2</xref>E) activities efficiently and to the same extent, whereas the addition of buffer alone or unrelated protein G resin depleted neither of them (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f2">2</xref>D and E). These results demonstrate that both activities are intrinsic to the purified Pfh1 protein. Since the NusA moiety fused to Pfh1 did not affect any of its activities <italic>in vitro</italic> or its <italic>in vivo</italic> function, we used the fusion protein to further characterize this enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>Hydrodynamic properties of NusA-Pfh1-F</title><p>Exclusion chromatography and glycerol gradient sedimentation were used to determine the hydrodynamic properties of NusA-Pfh1-F. These experiments were carried out with the pooled fractions (fractions 18&#x02013;20) obtained from the second sizing column. NusA-Pfh1-F eluted before ferritin (440 kDa, 61 &#x0212b;) during the gel filtration step and yielded a Stokes radius of 63.5 &#x0212b; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f3">3</xref>A). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f3">3</xref>B, NusA-Pfh1-F sedimented with a sedimentation coefficient of 6.2S during glycerol gradient centrifugation. Assuming a partial specific volume of 0.725 ml&#x0002f;g, NusA-Pfh1-F was calculated to have a native molecular mass of 163 kDa and frictional ratio of 1.76 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f3">3</xref>C) by the method of Siegel and Monty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c28">28</xref>). Since the calculated molecular weight of NusA-Pfh1-F from its amino acid sequence is 152 kDa, its hydrodynamic properties indicate that NusA-Pfh1-F is a monomer and possesses a highly prolate shape. The hydrodynamic properties also suggest that our preparation of NusA-Pfh1-F was properly folded.</p></sec><sec><title>Examination of the substrate specificity of Pfh1 helicase activity</title><p>We examined whether fork-like structures stimulated Pfh1 helicase activity using two different substrates: one contained a 5&#x02032; overhang with a 5&#x02032; 25 nt ssDNA region, while the other was a Y-structured substrate possessing both 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; 25 nt ssDNA overhangs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f4">4</xref>A). The unwinding of the Y-structured substrate in the presence of 2.4 and 7.2 fmol of enzyme was substantially more efficient (20- and 13-fold, respectively) than that observed with the 5&#x02032; overhang substrate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f4">4</xref>A and C). Next, we examined whether the enzyme could unwind a duplex DNA devoid of an ssDNA 5&#x02032; tail. For this purpose, two additional substrates were prepared; one with a 5&#x02032; 60 nt ssDNA overhang and a 30 bp duplex at the 3&#x02032; end, and the other a 30 nt ssDNA flanked by 30 bp duplexes at both ends (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f4">4</xref>B). Pfh1 utilized both substrates with almost identical efficiency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f4">4</xref>B and D). This result indicates that Pfh1 can enter an internal ssDNA region and does not depend on a 5&#x02032; free end as an entry site, provided that the size of the internal ssDNA is longer than 30 nt. We further confirmed our observation that a fork-like structure stimulated the Pfh1 helicase activity using several &#x003a6;X174-based substrates; all substrates contained the same partial duplex but varied in the length of their 5&#x02032; tail. The unwinding efficiency of Pfh1 increased in proportion to the 5&#x02032; tail length (data not shown); when blunt or short (5 nt) 5&#x02032;-tailed substrates were used, unwinding was marginal. However, the levels of unwound product formed increased greatly when the length of the 5&#x02032;-ssDNA tail was &#x0003e;10 nt. Unwinding was stimulated further by increasing the tail length to &#x0003e;21 nt. Further increase in the 5&#x02032; tail length up to 40 nt did not stimulate the unwinding activity of Pfh1 (data not shown). These results are consistent with the result described above that unwinding is increased by the presence of a 5&#x02032; fork structure and indicate that a 5&#x02032; ssDNA region of at least 10 nt is required to stimulate Pfh1 helicase activity.</p><p>Since the helicase activity of Pfh1 is implicated in Okazaki fragment processing, we examined its ability to displace a flap structure containing an RNA segment in the unannealed 5&#x02032; tail, a likely structure formed during Okazaki fragment extension. Since Pfh1 cannot hydrolyze ATP in the presence of RNA as a cofactor, one possible prediction was that the 5&#x02032; end of an ssRNA would inhibit the unwinding activity of Pfh1. To test this prediction, we prepared two substrates; one with an RNA&#x02013;DNA chimeric flap that contained a 12 nt RNA and 15 nt DNA segment, and the other a flap that consisted solely of DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f5">5</xref>A). Contrary to the prediction, the RNA&#x02013;DNA chimeric flap substrate was unwound as efficiently as the DNA only substrate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f5">5</xref>A and B). This finding suggests that when the primer RNA&#x02013;DNA of Okazaki fragments is converted into a ssRNA&#x02013;DNA flap by the displacement DNA synthesis by pol &#x003b4;, it would not interfere with the helicase activity of Pfh1.</p></sec><sec><title>Processivity of Pfh1 helicase activity</title><p>To determine the maximum length of duplex DNA that can be unwound by Pfh1, three different DNA substrates were prepared that contained 30, 40 and 52 bp partial duplexes, but the same 5&#x02032; ssDNA tail length (21 nt). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f6">6</xref>A, Pfh1 unwound all three substrates, but the rate of unwinding decreased dramatically as the length of duplex DNA increased up to 40 bp. During the 20 min incubation period, the 30 bp duplex DNA was displaced efficiently by Pfh1, while the 40 and 52 bp duplex DNAs were poorly unwound (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f6">6</xref>A). We also examined the processivity of the Pfh1 helicase activity by carrying out substrate-challenge experiments in which an excess of unlabeled DNA substrate was added at different time points (0, 2 and 5 min) after initiation of the unwinding reaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f6">6</xref>B). The unwinding of the helicase substrate was blocked immediately by the addition of excess (50-fold) cold competitor DNA at any time point after initiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f6">6</xref>B). The addition of increasing levels of competitor DNA also inhibited the unwinding reaction in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the Pfh1 helicase has the ability to unwind a limited duplex length in a highly distributive manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Pfh1 efficiently can displace a secondary structure-containing flap from a template</title><p>Since the Pfh1 helicase is able to unwind a 5&#x02032;-tailed substrate preferentially and is stimulated by a fork structure (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f5">5</xref>), we examined the influence of the nature of 3&#x02032; overhang strand. To this end, we investigated whether Pfh1 could unwind a 5&#x02032;-tailed flap DNA that consists of 3&#x02032; duplex DNA, and found that the enzyme unwound both Y-structured DNA and flap DNA substrates with equal efficiency (data not shown). This finding coupled with the ability of Pfh1 to be loaded onto internal ssDNA regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f4">4</xref>B) prompted us to examine whether Pfh1 could unwind a flap DNA that contains a secondary structure in which the 5&#x02032; ssDNA end was not available to the Pfh1 enzyme. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f7">7</xref>A, the two 48 nt flap DNA substrates (one with random sequences and the other with 16 repeats of CTC) were displaced with almost identical efficiency at various levels of enzyme (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f7">7</xref>A, lanes 1&#x02013;5 and 11&#x02013;15, respectively; and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f7">7</xref>C). Interestingly, the substrate with a flap containing 16 repeats of CTG that can anneal to itself and form a hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c29">29</xref>) was also unwound efficiently using Pfh1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f7">7</xref>A, lanes 6&#x02013;10 and B). Because this substrate is likely to contain an ssDNA gap varying in size between the hairpin and the duplex junction, unwinding can occur via loading onto the available ssDNA gap. Alternatively, Pfh1 could enter directly through the duplex hairpin. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we prepared two additional substrates; one with a fixed 10 nt gap and the other lacking a gap (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f7">7</xref>B). The unwinding reaction occurred efficiently with the substrate containing the 10 nt gap (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f7">7</xref>B, lanes 8&#x02013;14 and D), but poorly with the substrate devoid of a gap between the hairpin and the junction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f7">7</xref>B, lanes 14&#x02013;19 and D).</p></sec><sec><title>Requirements of helicase and ATPase activities of Pfh1</title><p>Helicases use NTPs as their source of energy for translocation and unwinding. As expected, the Pfh1-catalyzed unwinding was absolutely dependent on ATP and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and little or no activity was observed in the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs, such as ADP (&#x0003c;5%), ATP&#x003b3;S (&#x0003c;1%) and AppNp (&#x0003c;1%) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh720tb2">2</xref>). The optimal salt concentration required for the reaction was 50&#x02013;100 mM NaCl. Helicase activity was inhibited 85 and &#x0003e;99% upon addition of 0.2 and 0.3 M NaCl, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh720tb2">2</xref>). In the presence of optimal levels of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (2 mM), unwinding occurred most efficiently in the presence of 0.8&#x02013;2 mM ATP. Among the eight NTPs, ATP and dATP supported unwinding activity with equal efficiency (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh720tb2">2</xref>). CTP and dCTP supported unwinding activity to a limited extent (50 and 58% of ATP at 2 mM) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh720tb2">2</xref>). However, this finding is not consistent with our observations that CTP and dCTP were not hydrolyzed efficiently by Pfh1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh720tb3">3</xref>), raising the possibility that the unwinding activity observed with CTP and dCTP may be due to the presence of contaminating levels of ATP or dATP. Therefore, Pfh1 appears to utilize ATP and dATP only as the energy source for unwinding duplex DNA. We also investigated the enfluence of ssDNA-binding proteins from various sources (<italic>S.pombe</italic>, human, <italic>E.coli</italic> and bacteriophage T4) on the unwinding activity of Pfh1. Pfh1 was significantly inhibited only at the highest levels (80 fmol) of <italic>S.pombe</italic> RPA. Human RPA, <italic>E.coli</italic> SSB or T4g32 hardly affected the unwinding activity of Pfh1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh720tb2">2</xref>).</p><p>The DNA-dependent ATPase activity was further characterized by using the standard reaction conditions described in Materials and Methods. As observed in the DNA helicase assay, ATP hydrolysis required Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh720tb3">3</xref>), and 0.2 mM Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> efficiently supported ATP hydrolysis while Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (&#x0003e;0.2 mM) partially supported ATP hydrolysis. In the presence of 0.2 mM ATP, ATP hydrolysis was not competitively inhibited by the addition of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs, such as ATP&#x003b3;S (up to 0.4 mM) or App(NH)p (up to 1 mM) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh720tb3">3</xref>). Consistent with the effects of NaCl on unwinding (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh720tb2">2</xref>), DNA-dependent ATPase activity was inhibited to a similar extent at high concentrations of NaCl (51% at 0.2 M and 91% at 0.3 M NaCl) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh720tb3">3</xref>). The ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity was scarcely affected by the addition of <italic>S.pombe</italic> RPA and <italic>E.coli</italic> SSB (data not shown). We also examined the hydrolysis of other nucleotides by Pfh1. The helicase hydrolyzed only dATP efficiently (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh720tb3">3</xref>), in agreement with its ability to support the displacement reaction (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh720tb2">2</xref>). Several polynucleotides were also examined for their ability to support ATP hydrolysis under standard reaction conditions. Without DNA, the enzyme was virtually inactive (&#x0003c;1% ATP hydrolyzed). M13 and &#x003a6;x174 sscDNA supported ATP hydrolysis most effectively. &#x003a6;x174 dsDNA was active, but less efficient (53% of M13 sscDNA at 50 ng) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh720tb3">3</xref>). Homopolymeric RNA such as poly(U) did not support ATPase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of wild-type <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> abolishes the ability of <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> or <italic>pfh1-R23</italic> mutant alleles to suppress the growth defect of <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> mutation</title><p>The <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> and <italic>pfh1-R23</italic> alleles contain a point mutation in conserved amino acids, but not within the conserved helicase motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c17">17</xref>).

Therefore, it is possible that these <italic>pfh1</italic> and <italic>cdc24</italic> mutant alleles result in a partial loss of function. If the loss-of-function of <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is essential to suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype of <italic>cdc24-M38</italic>, the expression of wild-type <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is predicted to restore the temperature-sensitive phenotype of <italic>cdc24-M38 pfh1-R20</italic> and <italic>cdc24-M38 pfh1-R23</italic> mutants.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f8">8</xref>, the introduction of the control plasmid (pREP81x) did not affect the phenotypes of <italic>cdc24-M38 pfh1-R20</italic> or <italic>cdc24-M38 pfh1-R23</italic> double mutants. In contrast, expression of <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (pREP81x-pfh1wt) abolished the growth of the double mutant cells at 37&#x000b0;C. The cold-sensitive growth defect caused by both <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> and <italic>pfh1-R23</italic> mutations was suppressed by pREP81x-pfh1wt, indicating that <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> complemented these mutations. Consistent with these results, genetic analysis indicates that both <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> and <italic>pfh1-R23</italic> are recessive alleles (unpublished data). In conclusion, our above results confirm that suppression of the temperature-sensitivity of <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> requires the impairment of the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Pfh1-R20 has reduced helicase and ATPase activities</title><p>To support the above genetic observations, we isolated a mutant enzyme (NusA-Pfh1-R20-F) using the same purification strategy employed for the isolation of the wild-type enzyme and examined its helicase and ATPase activities. Since <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> by itself is a cold-sensitive mutation and allows <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> temperature-sensitive mutant cells to grow at 37&#x000b0;C, its ATPase activity was measured at 18, 30 and 37&#x000b0;C. The ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of Pfh1-R20 was significantly reduced at all temperatures tested compared to that of the wild-type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f9">9</xref>A). Although the Pfh-R20 mutation is not located within the conserved helicase domain, it may alter the conformation of the enzyme such that the enzymatic activities of Pfh1 are reduced. The amount of ATP hydrolyzed by the wild-type Pfh1 at 37&#x000b0;C was slightly lower than that at 30&#x000b0;C. The efficiency of ATP hydrolysis by the mutant enzyme, however, was dramatically reduced at 37&#x000b0;C, yielding only 10% of the wild-type level of ATP hydrolysis. The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for ATP and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for ATPase activity of the wild-type and mutant enzymes were also determined: the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for ATP and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of wild-type Pfh1 (0.378 mM and 41.1 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively) were &#x0223c;6- and 10-fold higher than those (0.068 mM and 4.4 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively) of Pfh1-R20. This result suggests that though the mutant protein has a higher affinity for ATP, it hydrolyzes ATP very slowly. In addition, we examined the helicase activity of the mutant protein. Pfh1-R20 displaced the 21 bp partial duplex DNA substrate very poorly at both 18 and 37&#x000b0;C compared to wild-type Pfh1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f9">9</xref>B). This suggests that the <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> mutant allele is a loss-of-function mutation and that the enzyme produced by this allele is nearly inactive at 37&#x000b0;C. In the absence of ATP, the mutant enzyme was defective in binding the substrate DNA. However, in the presence of ATP its DNA binding activity was almost identical to the wild-type enzyme (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f9">9</xref>C). In summary, these results indicate that the ability of the mutant enzyme to hydrolyze ATP, unwind duplex DNA and bind substrate DNA in the absence of ATP was significantly lower than the wild-type. The fact that Pfh1-R20 is less active than the wild-type enzyme is consistent with the notion that suppression of the <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> mutation requires the impaired function of <italic>pfh1</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic interactions between <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>dna2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></title><p>Cdc24 is known to function via a direct interaction with Dna2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c16">16</xref>). Because we have established a genetic interaction between <italic>cdc24</italic> and <italic>pfh1</italic> alleles (above) and hence a functional relationship between Cdc24 and Pfh1, we predicted that a functional relationship might exist between Dna2 and Pfh1.

To test this possibility, we determined whether the <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> allele could suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype of a <italic>dna2-C2</italic> mutant. The <italic>dna2-C2</italic> mutation contains a single amino acid change (Leu to Ser) at position 1079, which is conserved throughout eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c16">16</xref>). <italic>dna2-C2</italic> is a temperature-sensitive loss-of-function allele with a phenotype (at non-permissive temperature) indistinguishable from that of a <italic>dna2</italic> null mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c16">16</xref>).</p><p><italic>dna2-C2</italic> (HK10) and <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> (GH101-2) strains were crossed. Tetrad dissection yielded dna2-<italic>C2 pfh1-R20</italic> double mutants whose relevant genotypes were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequence analysis (data not shown). As predicted, <italic>dna2-C2 pfh1-R20</italic> double mutant cells were able to grow at 37&#x000b0;C, indicating that <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> suppresses the temperature-sensitive phenotype of <italic>dna2-C2</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f10">10</xref>A and data not shown). Moreover, when a multicopy plasmid bearing the wild-type <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene was introduced into <italic>dna2-C2 pfh1-R20</italic> double mutants, suppression was lost (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f10">10</xref>A) and transformants grown at 37&#x000b0;C displayed a highly elongated cell shape similar to <italic>dna2-C2</italic> mutant cells grown at non-permissive temperature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f10">10</xref>B). In contrast, the same transformants displayed wild-type morphology when grown at 18&#x000b0;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh720f10">10</xref>B). Since cold-sensitive alleles of <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> can suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype of both <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> and <italic>dna2-C2</italic>, this strongly suggests that <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> plays a role in Okazaki fragment maturation.</p><p>In order to further support the significance of the genetic interactions between Pfh1 and Dna2 or Cdc24, we examined whether there were physical interactions between Pfh1 and Dna2 or Cdc24 using the yeast two-hybrid assays. These assays failed to detect any positive results (data not shown). Moreover, we found that Pfh1 did not interact with the two subunits (Pol 3 and Cdc27, the catalytic and PCNA-interacting subunits, respectively) of pol &#x003b4;, PCNA, Fen1 and DNA ligase I in the yeast two-hybrid assays (data not shown). Instead, we detected synthetic sick or lethal interactions between <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> and both <italic>pol 3-R18</italic> and <italic>cdc27-R22,</italic> two cold-sensitive mutant alleles of pol &#x003b4; that were isolated, like <italic>pfh1-R20</italic>, as suppressors of the temperature-sensitive growth defect of <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> (H.

When we analyzed tetrads from crosses of <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> X <italic>pol3-R18</italic> and <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> X <italic>cdc27-R22</italic>, we found that the <italic>pfh1 pol3</italic> and <italic>pfh1 cdc27</italic> double mutants were poorly viable, even though single mutants are viable. In addition, the number of double mutant colonies detected among viable spores was far less than the expected number as shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh720tb4">4</xref>. This suggests that mutants bearing defective pol &#x003b4; subunits cannot tolerate the loss of Pfh1 function. This genetic result is consistent with the notion that both Pfh1 and pol &#x003b4; participate in the same process during lagging strand synthesis. In addition, our data suggest that the interactions between Pfh1 and other proteins involved in Okazaki fragment processing may only be functional and not physical.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we isolated the full-length Pfh1 enzyme and characterized its helicase and ATPase activities. Fusion of the NusA and FLAG epitopes to the N- and C-termini of Pfh1, respectively, allowed us to purify the enzyme to near homogeneity. Two rounds of successive gel filtration chromatographic steps yielded an active Pfh1 enzyme preparation, which contained ATPase and DNA helicase activities. Furthermore, the activities associated with the NusA-Pfh1-F were unaltered by removal of the NusA tag by thrombin digestion and both activities were simultaneously depleted by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 Ab-coupled agarose beads. These results demonstrate unambiguously that both activities are intrinsic to the Pfh1 enzyme and that the presence of the NusA moiety fused to its N-terminus did not hinder its enzymatic activities. In contrast to these findings, the fusion of a GST moiety to an N- and C-terminal truncated version (255&#x02013;789 of the 805 amino acids) of Pfh1 (GST-Pfh1-h) resulted in an inactive recombinant enzyme, and the removal of GST moiety was necessary to render it active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c20">20</xref>). We noted that the specific activity of the ATPase activity of our NusA-Pfh1-F preparations is &#x0223c;10-fold higher than that reported with GST-Pfh1-h from which the GST moiety was removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c20">20</xref>). This suggests that either N-terminal or C-terminal deletions affect the ATPase activity of Pfh1 and probably its helicase activity as well. Whether the GST-Pfh1-h protein could functionally substitute for the wild-type Pfh1 <italic>in vivo</italic> was not determined. This experiment would provide information whether the N-terminal 255 amino acids are required for the cellular function of Pfh1.</p><p>Using the NusA-Pfh1-F enzyme that is active <italic>in vivo</italic> (data not shown), we determined a number of Pfh1's biochemical properties. The Pfh1 helicase of <italic>S.pombe</italic> shares several biochemical properties in common with Dna2 of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c22">22</xref>): (i) both unwind duplex DNA in the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; direction, preferring a 5&#x02032;-tailed DNA substrate; (ii) both act in a highly distributive manner; (iii) both are active as a monomer; (iv) both preferentially utilize ATP and dATP as the energy sources; and, most significantly; and (v) both enzymes can unwind efficiently the DNA substrate containing a flap with secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c22">22</xref>). However, it should be noted that Pfh1, with its 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; helicase activity, cannot itself resolve the secondary structure present at the flap, as this requires translocation to occur in the 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; direction. Instead, we have shown that the presence of the secondary structure in the flap does not interfere with the flap displacement ability of Pfh1 as long as a short internal ssDNA region is present. This property is unique to the Pfh1 enzyme, since <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> or <italic>C.elegans</italic> Dna2 helicase by itself cannot efficiently displace a structured flap (unpublished data).</p><p>Based on the properties of Pfh1, it is possible to infer a role for Pfh1 in assisting the removal of long DNA flaps that contain secondary structure. Our previous observations indicated that <italic>in vitro</italic> displacement DNA synthesis by <italic>S.pombe</italic> pol &#x003b4; is efficient since the removal of the primer RNA&#x02013;DNA of the preceding Okazaki fragment was markedly stimulated by RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c30">30</xref>). This finding reflects the generation of flaps long enough to support RPA binding. If this were the case <italic>in vivo</italic>, a large proportion of flaps generated by pol &#x003b4; would have the potential to form secondary structures. The generation of long flaps with secondary structure would make <italic>S.pombe</italic> cells more dependent on helicase activity before the flap cleavage by the processing enzymes, Dna2 or Fen1. Since Dna2 of <italic>S.pombe</italic> lacks detectable ATPase&#x0002f;DNA helicase activity (unpublished data), it is likely that Pfh1 can function to facilitate removal of secondary structure containing flaps that are resistant to the cleavage by Dna2 and Fen1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c17">17</xref>). Since Pfh1 is unable to directly resolve the secondary structure in the flap, it is more likely to displace the entire hairpin-containing flap from the lagging template, resulting in a gap equivalent in size to an Okazaki fragment, which can be filled in by the <italic>S.pombe</italic> pol &#x003b4; holoenzyme. We noted that Pfh1 is not stimulated by <italic>S.pombe</italic> RPA, although <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RPA stimulated both helicase and endonuclease activities of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Dna2. At present, it is not clear why <italic>S.pombe</italic> RPA fails to stimulate Pfh1 helicase activity. It may be the case, however, that Pfh1 acts <italic>in vivo</italic> before the 5&#x02032; flap grows long enough (20&#x02013;30 nt ssDNA) to stably bind RPA.</p><p>In addition to studying the enzymatic properties of Pfh1, we have characterized genetic interactions between <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> and <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> and between <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> and <italic>dna2-C2</italic> in order to establish a functional relationship between <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>dna2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. Previous genetic studies demonstrated that <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is likely to function via direct interactions with <italic>dna2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c16">16</xref>). Overexpression of wild-type <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> interfered with the suppression by <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> or <italic>pfh1-R23</italic> of the temperature-sensitive phenotype of either <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> or <italic>dna2-C2</italic>. These results indicate that when the function of <italic>dna2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or <italic>cdc24</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is compromised by mutation, inactivation of <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is required to restore growth. The established roles of Cdc24 and Dna2 in Okazaki fragment maturation, the fact that mutant alleles of <italic>pfh1</italic> can suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype of both <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> and <italic>dna2-C2</italic>, and the observation that overexpression of wild-type <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> abolishes this suppression strongly suggest that Pfh1 plays a role in Okazaki fragment maturation in concert with Cdc24 and Dna2.</p><p>At present, the precise mechanism of Pfh1, pol &#x003b4; and Dna2 function during the maturation of Okazaki fragments in <italic>S.pombe</italic> is unclear. In light of the helicase activity described in this study, Phf1 is likely to be involved in the generation of flaps from the 5&#x02032; end region of Okazaki fragments together with pol &#x003b4;. This may be accomplished by the potential for Pfh1 to facilitate pol &#x003b4;-mediated displacement DNA synthesis. Because <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Dna2 has been shown to support the processing of long flaps that can bind RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh720c11">11</xref>), the inactivation of Pfh1 in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, leading to decreased production of long flaps, would relieve the requirement for Dna2-mediated long flap processing and suppress the <italic>dna2-C2</italic> growth defect. Consistent with this model, we identified synthetic lethal or sick interactions, a close genetic link between <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and genes encoding two of the three essential subunits of pol &#x003b4; in <italic>S.pombe</italic>. These findings support the idea that <italic>pfh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and pol &#x003b4; carry out related functions during Okazaki fragment metabolism. To further define the functional interplay of Pfh1, pol &#x003b4;, Dna2 and Cdc24 during the processing of Okazaki fragments in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, a rigorous biochemical analysis of these purified proteins will be required.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh720f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Co-migration of the ATPase and helicase activities with the NusA-Pfh1-F protein.
