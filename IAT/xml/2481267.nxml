H2AX is a core histone H2A variant that is randomly incorporated into nucleosomes during DNA replication. It differs from histone H2A by a unique C-terminal tail that contains a highly conserved SQE motif with a serine residue at position 139 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Serine 139 becomes rapidly phosphorylated in response to DNA double strand breaks by protein kinases of the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase-related kinase (PI3KK) family including ATM, ATR or DNA-PK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The phosphorylated form of H2AX has been referred to as &#x003b3;-H2AX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Several lines of evidence suggest that the main function of histone H2AX is to orchestrate the DNA damage response through interactions with BRCT repeat-containing proteins that bind phosphorylated H2AX such as MDC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, H2AX has also been implicated in a number of other functions including inactivation of sex chromosomes and control of sister chromatid recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We have recently shown that histone H2AX also has non-nucleosomal functions, specifically, pro-apoptotic activities in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) cells treated with the small molecule protein kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies in yeast have shown that histone levels need to be tightly regulated and that high levels of non-chromatin bound histones are cytotoxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Soluble histones can accumulate when DNA replication and histone incorporation into the newly synthesized chromatin become uncoupled, for example after stalling of replication forks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The present study was designed to determine the mechanisms that lead to increased soluble H2AX. We found that even short-term stalling of replication forks is sufficient to cause an increase of soluble H2AX. Furthermore, we show that transient overexpression of H2AX, but not H2A, promotes apoptotic cell death. In addition, we demonstrate that overexpression of H2AX leads to a nuclear redistribution and/or loss of the active form of RNA polymerase II as well as the transcriptional co-activators CBP and p300. Taken together, our results suggest a model in which replication stress leads to increased soluble H2AX, which sensitize cells to undergo apoptosis in a process that involves a shut-down of gene transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Replication stress induces soluble H2AX</title><p>To test whether DNA replication stress can induce soluble H2AX, we used the human osteosarcoma cell line U-2 OS that, unlike GIST cells, does not depend on a single oncogenically activated tyrosine kinase such as KIT and has <italic>bona fide </italic>normal DNA damage response pathways. Cells were transfected with constructs encoding GFP-tagged H2AX, mutant GFP-H2AX-S139A or empty GFP vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Expression of overexpressed H2AX proteins was distinguishable from endogenous H2AX based on the increased molecular weight (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). After transient transfection (24 h), a considerable amount of GFP-tagged H2AX proteins were detected in the soluble nuclear compartment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>; lanes S3, untreated, middle and right panels). When these cells were treated with aphidicolin, a DNA polymerase &#x003b1; inhibitor that induces stalling of replication forks, a rapid increase of soluble proteins was detected in the S3 fractions within 1 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU), which induces replication stress through nucleotide depletion, had a similar effect (data not shown). Treatment with aphidicolin or HU also led to an increase of endogenous H2AX in the soluble fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). These results highlight previous findings in yeast showing excess levels of free histones in cells in which DNA replication and histone deposition are uncoupled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Transfection with mutant H2AX in which the phosphorylation site at S139 has been abolished (H2AX-S139A) had a similar effect as wild-type H2AX, suggesting that the increase of soluble H2AX is not dependent on this phosphorylation site. To test whether our results allow generalization, we transiently transfected the human lung cancer cell line H1299 with GFP-tagged H2AX, H2AX-S139A and empty vector. Treatment with aphidicolin for 1 h, also led to an increased fraction of soluble H2AX indicating that his response is not cell type specific (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>DNA replication stress induces soluble H2AX</bold>.

As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, transient overexpression (24 h) of H2AX is associated with a proportion of H2AX remaining in the soluble nuclear fraction. At the same time, we detected a significant 3.3-fold increase of apoptotic cells (5.9%; p &#x02264; 0.001) in comparison to empty vector controls (1.8%; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>). Apoptotic cells were identified based on the characteristic nuclear morphology including DNA condensation and fragmentation and only GFP-positive, transfected cells were counted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Likewise, overexpression of mutant H2AX-S139A also caused a 3.8-fold increase of apoptotic cells (6.9%; p &#x02264; 0.01; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>). Hence, apoptosis induction does not critically depend on serine 139 phosphorylation, which is underscored by the finding that cells transfected with H2AX-S139A lacked immunostaining for &#x003b3;-H2AX but still underwent apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>; bottom panels).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of H2AX but not H2A leads to apoptotic cell death and stimulates apoptosis</bold>.

The majority of cellular mRNA transcription is carried out by RNA pol II. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA pol II consists of tandem heptad repeats with the consensus sequence Y<sub>1</sub>S<sub>2</sub>P<sub>3</sub>T<sub>4</sub>S<sub>5</sub>P<sub>6</sub>S<sub>7 </sub>that become hyperphosphorylated and hypophosphorylated during the transcription cycle. Phosphorylation at serine 5 is associated with transcription initiation whereas serine 2 phosphorylation is predominantly found during transcription elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Active gene transcription can be visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy against RNA pol II S2 and typically results in a fine granular nuclear staining pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>; top panels) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The transcriptional co-activators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 regulate RNA pol II-mediated gene transcription by connecting sequence-specific transcription factors to the basal transcription machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These proteins display a similar staining pattern during ongoing transcription as RNA pol II. Transcriptional inhibition has been shown to induce a redistribution of the S2 phosphorylated elongating form of RNA pol II (pRNA pol II S2) into speckled nuclear domains and to lead to RNA pol II degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

We have previously shown that soluble histone H2AX is involved in apoptosis induction in GIST cells treated with the small molecule inhibitor imatinib mesylate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Here, we extend these results by showing DNA replication stress as one mechanism that can lead to an increase of the pool of soluble H2AX. We show that overexpression of H2AX sensitizes cells to apoptosis in a process that is associated with a disruption of ongoing gene transcription as evidenced by a redistribution of active RNA pol II as well as CBP and p300.</p><p>Our report raises a number of questions that warrant further investigation. First, it is unclear why the overall level of apoptosis in U-2 OS after transient overexpression of H2AX is comparatively low (in the range of 5%) in comparison to GIST cells (approximately 40%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. One possibility is that GIST cells are particularly sensitive to increased non-chromatin associated H2AX because they express oncogenic KIT. We have previously speculated that KIT may constitutively downregulate H2AX, which may render GIST cells particularly sensitive to its re-expression (see also below). Second, despite our current results the precise mechanisms that lead to soluble H2AX remain unclear. Since the reagents used here induce stalling of DNA replication forks, it is possible that the uncoupling of histone production and histone incorporation into chromatin leads to excessive levels of free histones as it has previously been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, prolonged replication arrest can also cause DNA breakage and hence the possibility that increased soluble H2AX is a result of accelerated histone eviction during DNA damage-associated chromatin reorganization cannot be dismissed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Third, the precise mechanisms of apoptosis induction by histone H2AX await further clarification. Our results suggest that chromatin aggregation and transcriptional shut down, which cannot be sustained for a prolonged period of time without affecting cell viability, are important. However, this is a relatively non-specific mechanism and other, more direct, pro-apoptotic mechanisms of H2AX may also be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that release of histones from cells undergoing apoptosis contributes to a certain degree to the increase of soluble H2AX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], the present report provides additional evidence that soluble histone H2AX is a cause for increased cell death and not simply a consequence.</p><p>It is conceivable that replication stress is a frequent event in tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Given the potentially deleterious consequences of excessive H2AX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], one prediction would be that mechanisms exist that regulate the pool of non-chromatin-associated H2AX. Such mechanisms are likely to involve the ubiquitin/proteasome machinery since we have previously shown that H2AX can become polyubiquitinated and that proteasome inhibition can stabilize H2AX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Recent findings show that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13 and the RING-finger ubiquitin ligase RNF8 are involved in DNA damage-induced H2AX ubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Whether these proteins are also involved in the modulation of H2AX levels in tumor cells remains to be tested.</p><p>The fact that soluble H2AX induces apoptosis in tumor cells opens new avenues for cancer therapy. Identification of drugs that induce soluble H2AX, e.g. by inhibiting a potential suppressor of H2AX, would be promising. Given the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the regulation of H2AX levels in GISTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], it is also conceivable that targeting the protein degradation machinery could lead to increased soluble H2AX levels. Furthermore, the GFP-tagged H2AX vectors could be used in a compound screen with chromatin aggregation as the readout.</p><p>In summary, we report here that DNA replication stress rapidly leads to an increase of soluble H2AX. Overexpression of H2AX was found to sensitize cells to undergo apoptosis, which very likely involves the disruption of ongoing gene transcription. Our findings encourage further studies to exploit H2AX and the cellular mechanisms that regulate its expression levels as novel anti-cancer drug targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This report shows that stalling of DNA replication leads to an increase of soluble H2AX in human tumor cells. Soluble H2AX was found to sensitize cells to undergo apoptosis and this activity was associated with a transcriptional shut-down. These results encourage further studies to exploit histone H2AX and the mechanisms that regulate its expression as anti-cancer drug targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfections</title><p>U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells and H1299 lung cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Cambrex, Baltimore, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Mediatech, Herndon, VA), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin (both BioWhittaker, Baltimore, MD).
