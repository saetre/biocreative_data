One critical co-factor is Cyclin T1, a subunit of a general RNA polymerase II elongation factor known as P-TEFb. Cyclin T1 is targeted directly by the viral Tat protein to activate proviral transcription. Cyclin T1 is up-regulated when resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are activated and during macrophage differentiation or activation, conditions that are also necessary for high levels of HIV-1 replication. Because Cyclin T1 is a subunit of a transcription factor, the up-regulation of Cyclin T1 in these cells results in the induction of cellular genes, some of which might be HIV-1 co-factors. Using shRNA depletions of Cyclin T1 and transcriptional profiling, we identified 54 cellular mRNAs that appear to be Cyclin T1-dependent for their induction in activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T Jurkat T cells and during differentiation and activation of MM6 cells, a human monocytic cell line. The promoters for these Cyclin T1-dependent genes (CTDGs) are over-represented in two transcription factor binding sites, SREBP1 and ARP1. Notably, 10 of these CTDGs have been reported to be involved in HIV-1 replication, a significant over-representation of such genes when compared to randomly generated lists of 54 genes (p value&#x0003c;0.00021). The results of siRNA depletion and dominant-negative protein experiments with two CTDGs identified here, CDK11 and Casein kinase 1 gamma 1, suggest that these genes are involved either directly or indirectly in HIV-1 replication. It is likely that the 54 CTDGs identified here include novel HIV-1 co-factors. The presence of CTDGs in the protein space that was available for HIV-1 to sample during its evolution and acquisition of Tat function may provide an explanation for why CTDGs are enriched in viral co-factors.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The major targets of HIV-1 infection are CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and macrophages, as these two cell types express CD4 and CCR5 or CXCR4, the receptor and co-receptor, respectively, for the viral Envelope protein. However, the ability of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and macrophages to support a productive HIV-1 infection depends upon the physiological status of the cell. Fully resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are non-permissive for HIV-1 replication and must be activated to support high levels of viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Zack1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Spina1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

In resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and monocytes, viral entry is not limiting for infection, but rather a number of post-entry steps in the replication cycle are defective, including: reverse transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Zack1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Bukrinsky1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Stevenson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>; nuclear import and integration of the viral cDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Bukrinsky2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Heinzinger1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>; nuclear export of spliced viral mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Lassen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>; RNA polymerase II transcription of the integrated provirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Pierson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. These defects in viral replication are likely, in part, to be the result of limiting levels of cellular co-factors that mediate the various steps in the viral life cycle. By expressing adequate levels of all essential cellular co-factors, activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and differentiated macrophages provide an optimal environment for HIV-1 replication.</p><p>One essential co-factor for HIV-1 replication is Cyclin T1 which is targeted by the viral Tat protein to mediate RNA polymerase II transcription of the integrated provirus (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Rice1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Garber1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>). Cyclin T1 is one of several regulatory subunits of a set of general elongation factors known collectively as P-TEFb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Peterlin1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Zhou1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The transcriptional elongation of most cellular genes is stimulated by P-TEFb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Chao1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Lam1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. All P-TEFb complexes contain CDK9 as the catalytic subunit, either the major 42 kDa protein or a minor 55 kDa protein that arises from an upstream transcriptional start site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Shore1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. P-TEFb complexes differ according to their regulatory subunit, either Cyclin T1, two isoforms of Cyclin T2 termed Cyclin T2a and T2b, or Cyclin K. A substantial portion of P-TEFb is in a catalytically repressed form because of its association with 7SK snRNA and the HEXIM1 or HEXIM2 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Yang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Michels1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The association of P-TEFb with 7SK snRNA and HEXIM proteins may sequester P-TEFb in a complex from which functional P-TEFb can be rapidly recruited to regulate RNA polymerase II transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Peterlin1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Zhou1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The HIV-1 Tat protein specifically targets the Cyclin T1/P-TEFb complex through a direct protein-protein interaction with Cyclin T1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Wei1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. In the absence of the viral Tat protein, RNA polymerase II initiates transcription within the viral 5&#x02032; long terminal repeat sequences, but the polymerase is non-processive due to the action of two negative factors, DSIF and NELF, that limit elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Barboric1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. After expression of the Tat protein, Tat binds to Cyclin T1/P-TEFb, and this protein complex then binds to the TAR RNA element that forms at the 5&#x02032; end of nascent viral transcripts. The CDK9 subunit of P-TEFb can then phosphorylate the carboxyl terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II and DSIF and NELF, thereby converting RNA polymerase to a processive enzyme that is able to transcribe the entire proviral genome.</p><p>Cyclin T1 protein expression is highly regulated in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and macrophages, and this regulation correlates with permissibility for HIV-1 replication. Cyclin T1 expression is low in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells isolated from healthy donors, but upon T cell activation, it is induced by a mechanism that appears to involve post-transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Sung1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Herrmann1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Cyclin T1 expression is also low in freshly isolated monocytes, and it is up-regulated by a post-transcriptional mechanism within one to two days after the cells are cultured under conditions that allow macrophage differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Liou1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. However, after one to two weeks in culture, Cyclin T1 protein expression is shut-off in macrophages by proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Treatment of macrophages with the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 can accelerate this proteasome-mediated shut-off of Cyclin T1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Wang1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. After it is shut-off in late-differentiated macrophages, Cyclin T1 can be re-induced by activation with agents such as LPS or by HIV-1 infection, indicating that the induction of Cyclin T1 is a component of an innate immune response in mature macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Liou2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Liou3">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to the regulated expression of Cyclin T1, the Cyclin T2 regulatory subunit of P-TEFb is expressed constitutively in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and is not further induced by T cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Sung1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our recent study utilized shRNA depletions and DNA microarrays to examine Cyclin T1-dependent genes (termed here CTDGs) in MM6 cells, a monocytic cell line that can be induced to differentiate into a macrophage-like phenotype by PMA treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Yu1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. We found that like primary monocytes, Cyclin T1 is expressed at a low level in MM6 cells and it is up-regulated by a post-transcriptional mechanism when differentiation is induced by PMA. Also like primary monocytes/macrophages, the Cyclin T2 subunit of P-TEFb is expressed constitutively in MM6 cells and is not up-regulated by PMA treatment. When Cyclin T1 expression was depleted by shRNA, the expression of more than 20&#x00025; of PMA-induced genes in MM6 cells was inhibited, indicating that the up-regulation of Cyclin T1 during monocyte differentiation is required for the expression of a large portion of differentiation-induced genes.</p><p>Our previous study identified CTDGs in PMA-treated MM6 cells, a setting that models the permissive environment for HIV-1 infection in differentiated macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Yu1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, we used shRNA depletions and DNA microarrays to identify CTDGs in LPS-activated MM6 cells, another environment that can be permissive for HIV-1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Moriuchi1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. We also identified CTDGs in activated Jurkat CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, an additional environment that is permissive for HIV-1 replication. We used the DNA microarray data to identify a common set of 54 CTDGs that are induced in activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell and differentiated and activated macrophages. The promoters for these genes are of interest, as their regulation is similar to that of the HIV-1 LTR: Cyclin T1-dependent and inducible by T cell activation and macrophage differentiation and activation. Remarkably, this set of CTDGs is highly over-represented in proteins with a reported role in HIV-1 replication. Our analysis of two genes in the list, CDK11 and Casein kinase1 gamma 1 (CSNK1G1), suggests that these two genes also play a role in HIV-1 replication. It is therefore likely that the list of CTDGs identified here contains novel HIV-1 co-factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Depletion of Cyclin T1 in MM6 and Jurkat T cells</title><p>To identify Cyclin T1-dependent genes (CTDGs), we used a shRNA vector to deplete Cyclin T1 and evaluated the effects on global gene expression with DNA microarrays. Genetic manipulation of primary macrophages and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells by shRNA methodologies poses considerable technical challenges. Additionally, variability between cells from different donors introduces a complicating factor. Because of these technical issues, we carried out Cyclin T1-depletion experiments in transformed cell lines.

We constructed a lentiviral vector, termed shRNA-T1, which expresses a shRNA that targets Cyclin T1 mRNA. We also constructed a negative control shRNA vector, termed shRNA-Con, which expresses a four-nucleotide mismatch to Cyclin T1 mRNA.

Differential splicing from these two genes generate more than 20 distinct CDK11 mRNAs that encode two related proteins, CDK11<sup>p110</sup> and CDK11<sup>p58</sup>. During apoptosis, a third CDK11 p46 isoform is generated by caspase cleavage of the p110 and p58 proteins.

The reduction in CDK9 and HEXIM1, although relatively modest, is specific and reproducible and suggests that CDK11 may somehow regulate the expression of these proteins. The effect of the depletion on HEXIM1 is quite notable, as about 50&#x00025; of P-TEFb in HeLa cells is associated in a complex with HEXIM1 (or the minor HEXIM2) protein and a small nuclear RNA known as 7SK snRNA. P-TEFb is catalytically inactive when associated with HEXIM1/7SK.

Because Cyclin T1 is a general RNA polymerase II transcription factor, its depletion will affect genes that are directly regulated by Cyclin T1. The expression levels of some additional mRNAs are likely to be dependent upon genes that are direct targets of Cyclin T1. Our shRNA depletion of Cyclin T1 therefore likely resulted in down-regulation of some mRNAs through indirect mechanisms. Additionally, as we used a single shRNA against Cyclin T1 in this study, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the CTDGs identified here are the results of off-target effects of the shRNA. Nevertheless, the CTDGs are highly enriched in SEBP1 and ARP1 binding sites in their promoters (p values&#x0003c;0.00013 and &#x0003c;0.0003) and in genes related to HIV-1 replication (p value&#x0003c;0.00021), strongly suggesting that our CTDG gene set has biological relevance. Until further characterization, it will remain possible that some of these 54 genes are false-positives for their dependency on Cyclin T1.</p><p>The 54 CTDGs identified in this study include 10 genes with a reported link to HIV-1 replication: ARPC1A acts at a pre-integration step and at viral budding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Komano1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Brass1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>; CARD6 is involved in NF-&#x003ba;B activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Dufner2">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>; SKP2 and granulin are involved in Tat function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Barboric3">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Hoque2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>; deoyhypusine synthase is involved in Rev function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Hauber2">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>; AP1M1 is involved in Nef function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-LeGall2">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Piguet2">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>; LAMP-1 appears to be involved in Gag function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Raposo1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>; VPS24 is involved in viral budding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Zamborlini2">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>; ANKRD6 and MR1 act prior to viral budding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Brass1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. As discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>, the identification of 10 of 54 genes with a link to HIV-1 replication is a highly significant over-representation (p value&#x0003c;0.00021) over the expected number (2.4) in randomly generated lists of 54 genes that are expressed in both Jurkat and MM6 cells. It is probable that future genome wide siRNA screens will identify additional genes involved in HIV-1 replication. If this is the case, random lists of 54 genes are likely to contain by chance more than 2.4 genes involved in HIV-1 replication. However, if these new co-factors are identified, it is possible that they will include some of the CTDGs identified here and our gene list may retain its over-representation of genes linked to HIV-1 replication.</p><p>An additional CTDG in our list is probably linked to HIV-1 replication &#x02013; RAB1A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003146-t001">Table 1, gene 24</xref>) interacts with RUSC2 which was identified as an HIV-1 co-factor in a recent large scale siRNA screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Brass1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. We have also provided evidence here that both CDK11 and CSKN1G1 are linked to HIV-1 replication. We conclude that this over-representation of genes with relevance to HIV-1 strongly suggests that our list of CTDGs contains a number of novel HIV-1 co-factors. Future studies using siRNA depletions will determine which of the CTDGs are important in the HIV-1 life cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Why are CTDGs enriched in HIV-1 co-factors?</title><p>During its course of evolution into an infectious agent, HIV-1 acquired Cyclin T1 to mediate Tat stimulation of RNA polymerase II elongation of the provirus. Cyclin T1 is a general transcription factor, and the induced expression of Cyclin T1 in activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and macrophage drives the expression of many cellular genes. The protein products of many of these CTDGs were therefore always present in infected cells as the virus acquired Cyclin T1 as a co-factor and optimized its replication cycle during evolution. This enrichment of CTDGs in the protein space that was available for HIV-1 to sample during its evolution in CD4&#x0002b; T cells and macrophages may explain why our list of 54 CTDGs is over-represented in viral co-factors. Our method to identify CTDGs in CD4&#x0002b; T cells and macrophages was not exhaustive and it seems likely that a number of additional CTDGs serve as viral co-factors.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Binding sites for SREBP1 and ARP1 are enriched in promoters for CTDGs</title><p>The HIV-1 LTR and the CTDGs identified here have similar patterns of regulation: Cyclin T1-dependent and inducible by T cell activation and macrophage differentiation or activation. Because the HIV-1 LTR contains two conserved NF-&#x003ba;B sites, three conserved Sp1 sites, and a conserved TATA element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Pereira1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, it is notable that binding sites for these factors are not over-represented in promoters for the CTDGs. Mutational analyses of the HIV-1 LTR have demonstrated that this set of transcription factor binding sites is especially suited to confer a high response to the Cyclin T1/p-TEFb complex when it is recruited to the viral LTR via Tat and TAR RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Berkhout1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Rittner1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we found here that many cellular genes which are dependent upon Cyclin T1 for their up-regulation in activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and macrophages do not possess the combination of transcription factor binding sites that is found in the HIV-1 LTR. Thus, the combination of binding sites for NF- &#x003ba;B, Sp1, and the TATA is not essential, and may not be common, for CTDGs in activated CD4&#x0002b; T cells and macrophages. It should be noted, however, that our study did not investigate whether the set of CTDGs are stimulated directly, rather than indirectly, by Cyclin T1.</p><p>Binding sites for the transcription factors SREBP1 and ARP1 are over-represented (p value&#x0003c;0.00013 and &#x0003c;0.0003, respectively) in the CTDGs in this study, as the promoters for 21 of 54 genes contain at least one predicted binding site for these factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003146-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). SREBP1 is a membrane-associated protein that is activated by limited proteolysis and transported to the nucleus where it regulates genes involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-BengoecheaAlonso2">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. ARP1 (also termed COUP-TFII) regulates metabolic homeostasis and can act as both an activator or repressor of target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Park1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>. The 21 CTDGs whose promoters contain binding sites for SREBP1 and/or ARP1 may be involved in regulating metabolic conditions in both CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and macrophages, and this may be important for HIV-1 replication. This raises the possibility that variation in metabolism between HIV-infected individuals may be a contributing factor to differences in the course of disease.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Potential for new therapeutic targets</title><p>Our initial experiments to examine a role of CSNK1G1 in HIV-1 replication suggests that it functions to enhance virion infectivity, as a siRNA depletion appeared to reduce infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003146-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) and a dn-CSNK1G1 protein inhibited Gag processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003146-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Additional work is required to elucidate mechanisms whereby CSNK1G1 affects virion infectivity and whether this host protein has the possibility to serve as a target for anti-viral therapeutics. Although several CTDGs identified in this study play important roles in HIV-1 infection, in most cases the encoded proteins are unlikely to be targeted by HIV-1 proteins through direct protein-protein interactions. Many of these cellular proteins may regulate general cellular processes, and other proteins involved in these processes could be the direct targets of viral proteins. For example, Tat function is sensitive to the depletion of CDK11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003146-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Rather than having a direct effect on Tat function, CDK11 may regulate the level of CDK9 protein expression or the processing of HIV-1 transcripts, and because P-TEFb function and splicing are linked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Zhou1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, the depletion of CDK11 may have an especially inhibitory effect on viral transcripts activated by Tat. HIV-1 co-factors that regulate general cellular processes are unlikely to be feasible therapeutics targets, as the actions of small molecules that interfere with their function are likely to be cytotoxic.</p><p>However, a number of cellular co-factors that mediate HIV-1 replication are feasible candidates for anti-viral drugs. Some co-factors in the 54 CTDGs identified here, and in the 273 factors identified in the recent large-scale siRNA screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Brass1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, are likely to exist in multiprotein complexes that are targeted directly by viral proteins. The future characterization of these complexes and their role in the HIV-1 life cycle can identify proteins that are direct and essential targets of viral proteins. Such proteins are feasible therapeutic targets, as small molecules can be developed that disrupt protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003146-Rice2">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>.
