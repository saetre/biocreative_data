However, HVEM also triggers inhibitory signals by acting as a ligand that binds to B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), an immunoglobulin super family member. The contribution of HVEM interacting with these two binding partners in inflammatory processes remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of HVEM in the development of colitis induced by the transfer of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T cells into recombination activating gene (<italic>Rag</italic>)<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

IBD is divided into two primary forms, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Although the etiology remains unknown, increasing evidence suggests that IBD is the result of a dysregulated mucosal inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). TNF is a particularly important contributor to intestinal inflammation, and blockade of TNF with anti-TNF antibodies is an effective treatment for a subset of Crohn's disease patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Several lines of evidence point to the TNF-related cytokine LIGHT (homologous to lymphotoxin, shows inducible expression, and competes with HSV glycoprotein D for herpes virus entry mediator [HVEM], a receptor expressed by T lymphocytes) as another important mediator of mucosal inflammation and IBD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Activated T cells and immature DCs express LIGHT, and it has been described as a proinflammatory cytokine and a potent T cell co-stimulatory molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Mature Th1-type CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and mucosal T cells isolated from patients with IBD express high levels of LIGHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Furthermore, transgenic mice with T cells constitutively expressing LIGHT developed spontaneous multi-organ inflammation that included the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), and intestinal inflammation could be induced by transfer of LIGHT transgenic T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><p>LIGHT signals via two members of the TNF receptor super family, the lymphotoxin &#x003b2; receptor, predominantly expressed by myeloid lineage, stromal, and epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), and the HVEM, broadly expressed by hematopoietic cells as well as by some somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). LIGHT-mediated IBD pathogenesis in mice has been attributed to its interaction with both of these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Whereas the interaction of LIGHT with lymphotoxin &#x003b2; receptor is thought to induce transformations in the gut mucosa that alter the normal microenvironment of the intestine, its binding with HVEM expressed by T cells promotes T cell activation and the T cell expansion required for the full development of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). In other contexts, engagement of HVEM by LIGHT delivers co-stimulatory signals leading to T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) and enhanced T cell&#x02013;mediated immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Furthermore, it has been described that engagement of HVEM by LIGHT induced activation of human mucosal T cells and increased IFN-&#x003b3; release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Therefore, it appears that HVEM may contribute to IBD pathogenesis by promoting T cell activation and Th1 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).</p><p>It has been recently discovered, however, that HVEM can also deliver inhibitory signals to T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). These inhibitory signals involve a receptor that binds HVEM, a member of the Ig super family called B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Once engaged by HVEM, the ITIM motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of BTLA become tyrosine phosphorylated, allowing the recruitment of the phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Recent studies have shown that HVEM- as well as BTLA-deficient T cells are hyperresponsive to TCR-induced stimulation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Additionally, both HVEM- and BTLA-deficient mice presented a higher susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), whereas the loss of BTLA dramatically accelerated partially MHC-mismatched cardiac allograft rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>) and prolonged airway inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Furthermore, the BTLA&#x02013;HVEM interaction limited T cell activity in vivo, negatively regulating the homeostatic expansion of a subset of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> memory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Despite its generally inhibitory role, BTLA has recently been reported to play a role in promoting the survival of T cells activated during a mouse model of graft versus host disease (GVHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, whereas some evidence indicates that HVEM is the co-stimulatory receptor responsible for LIGHT-mediated T cell activation, other data demonstrate that HVEM can be a negative regulator of T cell responses by triggering BTLA-derived inhibitory signals. The actual contribution of HVEM to T cell&#x02013;mediated immune responses, and to the pathogenesis of T cell&#x02013;mediated inflammatory conditions such as IBD, remains to be determined. Moreover, most of the studies that investigate the role of HVEM binding to its ligands have emphasized the expression of one or more of these molecules by B and T lymphocytes, and their roles in directly regulating lymphocyte responses. In this study, we investigated the role of HVEM and its binding partners in the development of colitis induced by the transfer of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T cells into <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, and the possible function of HVEM in cells of the innate immune system that are present in the <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>The role of HVEM expression by T cells in colitis induction</title><p>To investigate the participation of HVEM in colitis pathogenesis, we used an experimental mouse model initiated by the adoptive transfer of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> naive T cells, depleted of CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory T cells, into syngeneic <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. This leads to a progressive disease, with weight loss and colitis appearing 5&#x02013;10 wk after the transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). To evaluate if the expression of HVEM in T cells is required for colitis induction, we transferred CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T cells isolated from <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or WT mice into <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients. As expected, WT donor CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T cells induced a gradual weight loss in <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients that correlated with disease progression, as did the transfer of <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).

Microscopic analysis of hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E)-stained tissue sections obtained from the large intestine of transferred mice revealed severe inflammation in all of the recipients. However, mice transferred with <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells had lower mononuclear cell infiltrates in the proximal and distal colon. In addition, these recipients had a higher number of goblet cells in the distal colon, indicating that inflammation in these animals was milder (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Scoring of sections obtained from the recipients transferred with <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells showed a lower average histological score than in the animals that received WT T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that HVEM expression on donor T cells contributed to a limited extent to increasing intestinal inflammation; however, HVEM expression in T cells was not absolutely required for colitis development.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T cells do not require HVEM to induce colitis.</bold> (A) Weight loss curves of <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients transferred with 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T cells isolated from either WT C57BL/6 mice (open squares) or <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (filled squares).

In fact, human epithelial carcinoma cell lines (not depicted) and freshly isolated mouse colonic epithelial cells express HVEM (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071160/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071160/DC1</ext-link>). A feature of IBD, in particular Crohn's disease, is increased intestinal permeability arising from a defect in the intestinal epithelium. Permeability to D-[1-<sup>14</sup>C]-mannitol therefore was measured across tissues from proximal and distal large intestine, as well as the cecum, which were stripped of underlying smooth muscle and mounted in Ussing chambers. Although the trend was toward increased permeability in the distal colon of <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the difference was not significant when compared with WT tissues. However, permeability in the distal colon of both WT and <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was significantly lower than that observed in inflamed tissues isolated from WT mice with colitis that had been induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) (Fig. S2 B). Similar to the results from the distal large intestine, permeability in the proximal colon and cecum of WT and <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals was essentially equivalent (not depicted). Therefore, epithelial permeability is not compromised under noninflammatory conditions in the absence of HVEM expression. Colitis induced by DSS represents a well-established epithelial injury model of intestinal inflammation. <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also displayed no increase in susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis when compared with WT mice (Fig. S3, A and B).</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of HVEM ligand expression by T cells</title><p>An appealing hypothesis for explaining the accelerated colitis in <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients is that enhanced disease is caused by the absence of an interaction between HVEM expressed by a cell type in the <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients with an HVEM binding partner expressed by the donor T cells.

Although BTLA expression on LPLs was slightly lower than that observed on T cells from the spleens or MLNs, this was likely a consequence of the reduced surface protein expression caused by the collagenase digestion during LPL isolation. Consistent with this, the amount of CD4 was also reduced (mean fluorescence intensity &#x0003d; 7,456 for LPL vs. mean fluorescence intensity &#x0003d; 26,183 for MLNs).

Subsets of T cells constitutively express HVEM, and therefore it is perhaps not surprising that many of the experiments analyzing the role of HVEM have focused on T lymphocytes. HVEM expressed by T cells is a co-stimulatory receptor for LIGHT-mediated T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Furthermore, recent reports demonstrated that HVEM also engages BTLA and inhibits T cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice do not have a dramatic phenotype, however, which might reflect the balance between the activating and inhibitory signals mediated by HVEM.</p><p>In this report, we analyzed the role of HVEM in intestinal inflammation induced by the transfer of naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells into <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. This experimental system is well suited to the analysis of complex networks of receptor&#x02013;ligand interactions because disease development is synchronous and the genotypes of the donor T cells and the immune-deficient host can be independently varied. The most striking finding in the work presented here was the dramatic acceleration of colitis observed in <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice transferred with WT CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T cells. Clinical signs correlated with an extremely fast weight loss and elevated histological scores in the colon within 2 wk after T cell transfer. Colitis acceleration in <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipient mice was characterized by a rapid accumulation of activated T cells producing Th1 cytokines and IL-17 in the large intestine of these recipients. This suggests that colitis acceleration is probably induced by an exacerbated proinflammatory response mediated by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the large intestine.</p><p>Because of the surprising acceleration of disease in <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we performed experiments to identify the critical cell type(s) that must express HVEM. Although APCs were considered the most promising candidate, we could find little evidence for a global alteration in APC function in <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, although T cells cultured in vitro with <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MLN DCs and a soluble anti-CD3<italic>&#x003b5;</italic> mAb did exhibit a slightly enhanced proliferative response. Surprisingly, transfer experiments using BM chimeric mice revealed that HVEM expression on a radioresistant cell population in the <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals is most critical for preventing colitis acceleration. Moreover, we found that mouse IECs expressed high levels of HVEM. IECs are a main point of contact for enteric antigens, and they play a direct role in regulating T cell responses to these antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). It has been recently shown that IECs may contribute to the maintenance of T cell tolerance in the gut by preventing inappropriate activation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>), and they express PD-L1, the ligand for the inhibitory receptor programmed cell death 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Nevertheless, although epithelial cell expression of HVEM is intriguing, IEC permeability was not altered in <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, and these mice were not more susceptible to DSS colitis. Therefore, the absence of HVEM does not alter IEC physiological function in the absence of T cell&#x02013;induced inflammation, and it remains to be proven that HVEM expression by IECs is required to prevent colitis acceleration. A radioresistant, tissue-specific APC expressing CD70, and required for the proliferation of mucosal T cells after oral infection, was recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>), and therefore these cells or some other radioresistant HVEM-expressing cell type could be most responsible for preventing accelerated colitis. Conditional ablation of HVEM expression in different cell types in <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with a floxed <italic>Hvem</italic> allele ultimately will be required to identify the cell type(s) that must express this protein to prevent disease acceleration.</p><p>Although HVEM is expressed by the transferred T cells (not depicted), the absence of HVEM in the donor T lymphocytes slightly reduced the severity of colitis development. Therefore, HVEM expression by T cells apparently contributed to the enhancement of T cell effector function, opposite to the effect of HVEM expression by cells in the RAG-deficient hosts. By binding to the TNF family ligand LIGHT, HVEM mediates co-stimulatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), and it was recently shown that the severity of colitis induced by the transfer of LIGHT-transgenic MLN cells into <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients was considerably decreased when the MLN cells were obtained from <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). The authors concluded that HVEM expression on T cells is necessary for optimal LIGHT-mediated T cell activation and expansion in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Therefore, T cell&#x02013;derived LIGHT interacting with HVEM expressed by the same or an adjacent T cell may be required for the full Th1 and/or Th17 differentiation of gut-homing effector T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Evidence suggesting a potential for T&#x02013;T interactions between LIGHT and HVEM on donor T cells also has been developed in a GVHD model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Consistent with the co-stimulatory role of LIGHT, we found that mice transferred with <italic>Light</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T cells also had lower histological scores. It is noteworthy that if the effect of HVEM deficiency in the RAG-deficient host were mediated predominantly by interactions with T cell&#x02013;expressed LIGHT, colitis should have been accelerated, rather than delayed, after transfer of <italic>Light</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T cells. When either <italic>Light</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T cells were transferred into <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals, however, the disease-accelerating effects of the absence of HVEM in the <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> host were dominant over the more subtle disease-delaying effects when these molecules were not expressed by the gene-deficient donor T cells. Therefore, the predominant effect of HVEM in this colitis model system is antiinflammatory, and it is related to its expression by radiation-resistant innate cells in the <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts.</p><p>Because BTLA is an inhibitory receptor for T cells, it was a good candidate for mediating the antiinflammatory effect of HVEM expression in the <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients. Consistent with this hypothesis, treatment of <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T cells with an anti-BTLA mAb with agonistic properties was able to reverse the accelerated colitis, but only when the T cells expressed BTLA. Although our data clearly demonstrate that a major function of the anti-BTLA mAb is to attenuate T cell responses, BTLA expression by host cells is also relevant. The transfer of WT T cells into BTLA-deficient <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients also led to accelerated colitis, indicating that T cell expression of BTLA is necessary but not sufficient, and that there also is a function for BTLA expression by host cells in preventing colitis acceleration. BTLA expression has been detected on myeloid and lymphoid cells, including CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs, a subpopulation of CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> macrophages and also DX5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). Interestingly, NK cells have been shown to prevent accelerated colitis development in the T cell transfer model of colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Therefore, engagement of BTLA on one or more of these innate immune cell types could contribute to moderating colitis progression.</p><p>During the review of this paper, it was shown in human cells that HVEM binds to CD160, a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored member of the Ig super family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). The authors of this report found that the binding of CD160 by HVEM delivered inhibitory signals to human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, leading to reduced T cell activation and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). Although it is not known if this interaction takes place in mice, we cannot rule out the possibility of an antiinflammatory role for the HVEM&#x02013;CD160 interaction in the experimental colitis model. Consistent with a possible role for CD160, when <italic>Btla</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were transferred with CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, weight loss and histological scores were less severe than in <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients. Although the differences were not statistically significant, the trend was toward milder disease in <italic>Btla</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. This was also observed when <italic>Btla</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were transferred with BTLA-deficient T cells, a situation where the HVEM&#x02013;BTLA interaction is completely ablated. The difference in colitis between HVEM and BTLA deficiency is not very great, however, suggesting that most of the disease-accelerating effects of HVEM deficiency are due to interaction with BTLA as opposed to the absence of a hypothetical interaction of mouse HVEM with CD160.</p><p>Contrary to our expectations, the transfer of <italic>Btla</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T cells into <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice did not replicate the severe disease phenotype in the <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients. Surprisingly, we found that there was a significant reduction in the number of T cells in different lymphoid organs and in the large intestine after transfer of <italic>Btla</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. In accordance with this finding, it has recently been shown that under conditions of chronic stimulation in a GVHD model system, <italic>Btla</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells did not survive as well and failed to sustain GVHD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Therefore, decreased T cell survival could partially explain the absence of a dramatic colitis acceleration after transfer of <italic>Btla</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells into <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. It should be noted that after transfer of <italic>Btla</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells into <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, HVEM can still induce inhibitory signals by interacting with BTLA expressed by host cells. However, when the stromal cells cannot deliver the critical antiinflammatory HVEM-mediated signals to either the transferred T cells or to <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> host cells, as is the case in <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients, accelerated disease occurs, even after transfer of <italic>Btla</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells.</p><p>In summary, HVEM can act as a receptor to enhance immune responses through binding LIGHT and as a ligand to suppress immune response by binding BTLA. It is therefore not surprising that HVEM plays a dual role in the development of colitis. By analyzing <italic>Hvem</italic>-deficient mice and cells, previous studies and the work presented here indicate that the lack of HVEM expression by T cells decreased T cell activation and the development of effector functions. The effects of HVEM deficiency are cell type dependent; however, the lack of HVEM expression by an irradiation-resistant cell type(s) in the immune-deficient recipients caused an acceleration of intestinal inflammation. <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice do not spontaneously develop colitis, however, and it is likely that in immune-competent mice CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory T cells or other mechanisms prevent gut inflammation. Moreover, the counterbalancing effects of HVEM expression by different cell types, and the dual engagement of proinflammatory LIGHT and antiinflammatory BTLA by HVEM, may explain the absence of spontaneous colitis in <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Our findings therefore depended critically on the power of the T cell transfer model of colitis in analyzing cell&#x02013;cell interactions and the interplay of the innate adaptive immune systems, as we could separate the proinflammatory and antiinflammatory effects of HVEM expression by comparing <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cell donors and <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients to their WT counterparts. Although the majority of studies on HVEM have addressed the participation of this molecule when expressed by T cells or APCs, our studies demonstrate the unexpected and important role that this molecule plays to prevent inflammation when expressed by irradiation-resistant nonlymphoid cells. The expression of HVEM and BTLA on both innate and adaptive cells, along with the findings presented here, suggest that this ligand&#x02013;receptor system could play diverse roles in immunity and inflammation in both the innate and adaptive immune systems that have yet to be fully elucidated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>C57BL/6, <italic>Rag</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (C57BL/6 background), and C57BL/6-SJL CD45.1 congenic mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained in our facility. <italic>Btla</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), <italic>Light</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), and <italic>Hvem</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>) have been described previously.
