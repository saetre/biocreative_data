We show that a member of the low-density receptor-related protein family, Lrp4 modulates and integrates Bmp and canonical Wnt signalling during tooth morphogenesis by binding the secreted Bmp antagonist protein Wise. Mouse mutants of Lrp4 and Wise exhibit identical tooth phenotypes that include supernumerary incisors and molars, and fused molars. We propose that the Lrp4/Wise interaction acts as an extracellular integrator of epithelial-mesenchymal cell signaling. Wise, secreted from mesenchyme cells binds to BMP's and also to Lrp4 that is expressed on epithelial cells. This binding then results in the modulation of Wnt activity in the epithelial cells. Thus in this context Wise acts as an extracellular signaling molecule linking two signaling pathways. We further show that a downstream mediator of this integration is the Shh signaling pathway.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The integration of different cell signaling pathways is increasingly recognized as being of fundamental importance in development. Most attention has necessarily focused on the intracellular links between pathways since ligand-receptor-antagonist interactions that occur outside the cell are pathway specific. However the concurrent secretion of ligands in developmental processes suggests that pathways of extracellular integration must exist. Here we describe an integration between a secreted BMP antagonist, Wise (also known as USAG-1, Sosdc1 and Ectodin), and a negative Wnt co-receptor, Lrp4, that provides a novel method of extracellular communication between mesenchymal and epithelial cells based on the integration of Wnt and Bmp pathways. This integration occurs in the context of epithelial-mesenchymal signaling controlling processes that regulate tooth number.</p><p>The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family is a large evolutionarily conserved group of transmembrane proteins (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004092-Nykjaer1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004092-Herz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>). The LDL receptor was first identified as an endocytic receptor that transports the lipoprotein LDL into cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In this process, specific ligands are internalized after binding to their receptors on the cell surface from where they are moved to an intracellular vesicle (endosome) and then discharged to other compartments inside the cell. The LDL receptor mainly regulates the concentration of lipoproteins in the extracellular fluids and delivers them to cells (i.e. for uptake of cholesterol). More recent findings have shown that LDL receptor family members can also function as direct signal transducers or modulators for a broad range of cellular signalling pathways. For example, LDL receptor-related protein 1 (Lrp1) is involved in the modulation and integration of PDGF and TGF&#x003b2; signals in smooth muscle cells of the vascular wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004092-Boucher1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004092-May1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, Apoer2 (Lrp8) and its partner Vldlr controls brain development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004092-Trommsdorff1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and synaptic transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004092-Weeber1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004092-Beffert1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> through their common signalling ligand Reelin (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004092-Herz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>), and Lrp5 and Lrp6 function as co-receptors in the Wnt signalling cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004092-Pinson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004092-Wehrli1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

The first morphological sign of tooth development is thickening of the oral epithelium. The thickened epithelium progressively takes the form of &#x0201c;bud&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cap&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;bell&#x0201d; configurations as differentiation and morphogenesis proceeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004092-TenCate1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells (dental papilla) differentiate into enamel-secreting ameloblasts and dentin-secreting odontoblasts, respectively. It has been established that many different signalling pathways such as Bmp, Fgf, Wnt, Shh and Tnf are involved at multiple stages of tooth development (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004092-Thesleff1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004092-Tucker1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>). A role for Lrps in any of these signalling pathways in tooth development has however not been established.</p><p>We report here that <italic>Lrp4</italic> is expressed in spatially restricted patterns in epithelial cells during tooth development. Changes in Bmp and Wnt signalling were observed during tooth development in both <italic>Lrp4</italic> and <italic>Wise</italic> mutants. <italic>Lrp4</italic> mutants display a range of tooth number abnormalities that are identical to those seen in <italic>Wise</italic> mutants and include fused molars and supernumerary incisors and molars. We observed upregulation of both Wnt and Bmp activities in <italic>Lrp4</italic> and <italic>Wise</italic> mutants that were accompanied by a downstream loss of Shh activity. The antagonism of BMP signaling by Wise thus does not occur in the absence of Lrp4. We propose that the ability of Wise to bind BMP's and to Lrp4 allows it to act as an extracelluar, mesenchyme to epithelial signaling protein that is capable of BMP with Wnt signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Interaction between WISE and LRP4</title><p>Wise acts to modulate both BMP and Wnt signalling during development.

The extracellular domain of Lrp6 contains four EGF repeats and Wise (a cysteine knot protein) shares repeats 1&#x02013;2 of the domain of Lrp6 essential for interaction with Wnts. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of EGF-like repeats 1 and 2 of Lrp5 and Lrp6 showed this region to be highly conserved in Lrp4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004092-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), raising the possibility that Lrp4 might also interact with Wise and thereby mediate the integration of Wnt and Bmp signals during morphogenesis.

An incisor tooth phenotype was originally reported in <italic>Lrp4</italic> mutant mice which led us to investigate the tooth development in more detail in these mice.</p><p>The most obvious tooth phenotype we observed in <italic>Lrp4</italic> mutants are greatly enlarged molar teeth. These large molars arise from fusion of different molar tooth germs during development. The incidence of the different molar fusions varies between individuals but is consistently more penetrant on the maxilla than the mandible. When we compared the molar teeth from <italic>Lrp4</italic> mutants with those in mutants of the Bmp/Wnt antagonist Wise we observed an almost identical range of molar fusions and supernumerary teeth. In addition to the tooth phenotype, disorganised palatal rugae were observed in both <italic>Wise</italic> and <italic>Lrp4</italic> and mutants (data not shown). The only significant difference phenotypically between the two mutants was the higher penetrance of abnormal teeth on the mandible in Wise mutants, which we attribute to the fact that the <italic>Lrp4</italic> mutation is hypomorphic, whereas Wise is believed to be a null. This remarkable phenocopy implies that a common genetic pathway through which <italic>Lrp4</italic> and <italic>Wise</italic> control tooth development.</p><p>Since Wise had previously been shown to bind to a specific region in the extracellular domain of Lrp5/6, we aligned this region in Lrp5/6 with Lrp4 revealing a remarkable degree of conservation. Using standard biochemical protein-protein interaction assays, we found that Wise can also bind to Lrp4. Wise can modulate both the Bmp and Wnt pathways by acting as a high affinity BMP ligand antagonist and by competing for binding to Lrp's with Wnts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004092-Itasaki1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004092-Ellies1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this contexts however, Wise did not appear to have any effect on Bmp signalling. We detected altered Bmp and Wnt signalling in <italic>Lrp4</italic> mutants using phosphorylated Smads and BAT-Gal reporter mice as indicators of active Bmp and canonical Wnt pathways, respectively. Wnt and Bmp signalling was increased in those areas that are involved with molar tooth fusion, indicating that Lrp4 is essential for normal Bmp and Wnt signalling during the physical separation of molar tooth primordia. The fact that an identical phenotype was observed in Wise mutants is consistent with Lrp4 modulating Wnt and Bmp signaling by binding and thereby sequestering, presenting or endocytosing Wise in a context-dependent manner. This also implies that Wise inhibition of Bmp's may require the presence of Lrp4. However, no obvious differences in <italic>Lrp4</italic> or <italic>Wise</italic> expression could be detected in tooth germs of <italic>Wise</italic> or <italic>Lrp4</italic> mutants, respectively (data not shown).</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Fused molars</title><p>Increased Wnt and Bmp signalling and reduced Shh signalling, as a result of loss of either <italic>Wise</italic> or <italic>Lrp4</italic>, results in fusion of molar teeth.

The supernumerary teeth in <italic>Lrp4</italic> mutants closely resemble those found in <italic>Wise</italic> mutants and their development can be first visualised by an ectopic patch of Shh expression in the diastema at E14.5. Interestingly at this same stage, the expression of Shh in the developing molars, located a few microns more proximally, is significantly reduced in <italic>Lrp4</italic> mutant embryos.

This removal of ligands is of critical importance in signaling in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in development. In tooth development for example, the same ligands are repeatedly used as epithelial signals and mesenchymal signals at different times and this can only work if the ligands are removed very rapidly and effectively.</p><p>The status of Bmp proteins in the extrcellular environment is communicated to epithelial cells expressing Lrp4, which in turn modulate intracellular Wnt activitys.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Immunoprecipitation</title><p>HEK293A cells were transfected with pCDNA3-AP, pCDNA3-RAP-AP, pCDNA3- Wise-AP, pCDNA3-RSpondin2-AP, or pCDNA3-DKK1-AP constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche) in DMEM plus 0.2&#x00025; BSA medium to produce media containing AP or AP-tagged proteins.
