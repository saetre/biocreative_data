The precise molecular mechanism(s) accounting for the specific deposition of CENP-A at centromeres are still poorly understood. Centromeric deposition of CENP-A, which is independent of DNA replication, might involve specific chromatin assembly complexes and/or specific interactions with kinetochore components. However, transiently expressed CENP-A incorporates throughout chromatin indicating that CENP-A nucleosomes can also be promiscuously deposited during DNA replication. Therefore, additional mechanisms must exist to prevent deposition of CENP-A nucleosomes during replication and/or to remove them afterwards. Here, using transient expression experiments performed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kc cells, we show that proteasome-mediated degradation restricts localization of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CENP-A (CID) to centromeres by eliminating mislocalized CID as well as by regulating available CID levels. Regulating available CID levels appears essential to ensure centromeric deposition of transiently expressed CID as, when expression is increased in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, newly synthesized CID mislocalizes. Mislocalization of CID affects cell cycle progression as a high percentage of cells showing mislocalized CID are reactive against &#x003b1;PSer<sup>10</sup>H3 antibodies, enter mitosis at a very low frequency and show strong segregation defects. However, cells showing reduced amounts of mislocalized CID show normal cell cycle progression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Eukaryotic centromeres are characterized by the presence of a specific histone H3 variant (CENP-A) [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>)], which replaces canonical H3.1 in nucleosomes both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). CENP-A appears to dictate centromere identity as it is exclusively found at centromeres, recruits kinetochore components and is required for centromere function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The precise molecular mechanisms accounting for the specific deposition of CENP-A at centromeres are not well understood. It is known that targeting to centromeres is mediated by the LI/&#x003b1;2 region of the histone-fold domain (HFD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) and, contrary to canonical nucleosomes, deposition of CENP-A containing nucleosomes at centromeres is not linked to replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). However, CENP-A containing nucleosomes can also be deposited during DNA replication as expression during S phase, or over-expression, leads to its mislocalization throughout chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). These observations suggest that expression of CENP-A must be tightly regulated during cell cycle progression to prevent replication-dependent deposition at non-centromeric sites during S phase and, in fact, mammalian CENP-A is expressed during G<sub>2</sub> phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). However, expression of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of CENP-A (CID) appears to take place early during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Therefore, additional mechanisms must exist to either avoid deposition of CENP-A containing nucleosomes at non-centromeric sites during DNA replication and/or to remove them afterwards. In this paper, a CID&#x02013;YFP fusion was transiently expressed from the <italic>cid</italic> promoter in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kc cells. Our results show that proteolytic degradation restricts localization of transiently expressed CID-YFP to centromeres by, on one hand, eliminating mislocalized CID-YFP and, second, regulating available CID-YFP levels. These results are consistent with previous findings showing that, in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a proteolysis-resistant CENP-A (Cse4&#x02013;351) mutant mislocalizes throughout chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p><italic>cid</italic> Promoter (nucleotide position +1 to &#x02212;412) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and <italic>cid</italic> cDNA were obtained from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genomic DNA by PCR-amplification using appropriate primers and cloned into pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) to generate plasmid pYFP-CID, which expresses CID-YFP under the control of the own <italic>cid</italic> promoter.

In these experiments, a CID-YFP fusion was transiently expressed in Kc cells under the control of the own <italic>cid</italic> promoter. In some cells, CID-YFP shows a diffuse nuclear distribution [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A (a)</xref>] while, in others, a distinct punctuated pattern is observed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A (c)</xref>]. Cells showing CID-YFP <italic>foci</italic> on top of a diffuse background are also detected [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A (b)</xref>], indicating that both patterns of distribution can coexist. The punctuated pattern of distribution corresponds to CID-YFP localized at centromeres as it is also observed with truncated forms containing the histone-fold domain of CID, which is known to mediate targeting to centromeres, either by itself (HFD<sub>CID</sub>-YFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or in combination to the N-terminal domain of canonical histone H3 (N<sub>H3</sub>HFD<sub>CID</sub>-YFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, HFD<sub>CID</sub>-YFP <italic>foci</italic> fully co-localize with the signals obtained with a &#x003b1;N<sub>CID</sub> antibody that specifically recognizes the N-terminal domain of CID, but not the HFD<sub>CID</sub>, and, therefore, marks the positions corresponding to endogenous CID bound to centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On the other hand, the diffuse pattern of nuclear distribution arises from binding of CID-YFP throughout chromatin as it is resistant to treatment with Triton X-100 (see Supplementary Figure S2) that, otherwise, solubilizes unbound nuclear proteins, such as a truncated N<sub>CID</sub>-YFP form, containing exclusively the N-terminal domain of CID, which does not bind chromatin and gives rise only to the diffuse pattern of nuclear distribution (Supplementary Figure S2). Moreover, in some cases, binding of CID-YFP through chromatin is also observed in condensed metaphase chromosomes [Figure 3B (b)]. These observations indicate that, upon transient expression, CID shows two coexisting patterns of localization, at centromeres and throughout chromatin. Others have previously reported similar results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>During cell culture, the percentage of cells showing CID exclusively localized at centromeres increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In these experiments, the percentage of cells showing mislocalized CID-YFP [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A (a)</xref>] or where CID-YFP is exclusively found at centromeres [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A (c)</xref>] were determined at increasing times after transfection of the plasmid expressing CID-YFP. The percentage of cells showing a mixed localization pattern, at centromeres as well as throughout chromatin [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A (b)</xref>], was also determined. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, early after transfection (24 h), most cells show mislocalized CID-YFP but, as the culture progresses, the percentage of cells where CID-YFP is exclusively found at centromeres increases so that, at 48&#x02013;96 h, they are majority. Similar results were obtained when HFD<sub>CID</sub>-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) or N<sub>H3</sub>HFD<sub>CID</sub>-YFP (data not shown) were expressed. These observations suggest that, during cell culture, cells showing mislocalized CID-YFP progress to cells were CID-YFP is exclusively found at centromeres. To confirm this hypothesis, cells showing mislocalized CID-YFP were sorted by FACS 48 h post-transfection taking advantage of their much higher intensity of fluorescence and, then, cultured for an additional 24 h. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the percentage of cells showing mislocalized CID-YFP that, immediately after sorting, account for close to 75% of the total transfected cells decrease to around 40% after 24 h of additional culture while, in parallel, cells showing localized CID-YFP increase from 3 to 30%. These results indicate that transiently expressed CID-YFP, which at early times post-transfection mislocalizes throughout chromatin, is progressively constrained to centromeres during cell culture.</p><p>The process of clearance of mislocalized CID-YFP was followed <italic>in vivo</italic> by time-lapse analysis. In these experiments, living cells were immobilized in soft-agar 48 h post-transfection and, then, monitored by confocal microscopy for an additional 24 h. In most cases, clearance of mislocalized CID-YFP precedes chromosome condensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and Supplementary Movie 1). Several observations, however, indicate that clearance can also occurs after mitosis: (i) though most metaphase chromosomes show CID-YFP exclusively localized at centromeres [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B (a)</xref>], in some cases, CID-YFP is also found bound throughout the entire condensed chromosome [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B (b)</xref>] and (ii) cells showing a mixed pattern of CID-YFP localization progress normally through mitosis (Figure 6A and Supplementary Movie 3).</p></sec><sec><title>Centromeric localization of transiently expressed CID is impaired in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132</title><p>As determined from the intensity of fluorescence, CID-YFP protein levels are several orders of magnitude higher incells showing mislocalized CID-YFP than in cells where the protein is exclusively localized at centromeres that, as shown above, arise from the former. This observation suggeststhat, during cell culture, expression of CID-YFP is regulated. It might be argued, however, that decreased protein levels of cells showing centromeric localization of CID-YFP is simply the consequence of dilution of the corresponding expression vector during cell division. Several observations argue against this possibility. First, centromeric localization of CID-YFP is an early event after transfection, which occurs before any significant growth of the culture is detected, and does not correlate with cell division. For instance, from 24 to 32 h after transfection, the percentage of cells showing centromeric localization of CID-YFP increased by &#x0223c;75% in the absence of any significant growth of the culture (Supplementary Figure S3). Even at 48 h after transfection, when significant growth was observed (50%), centromeric localization of CID-YFP exceeded growth of the culture by more than 3-fold (Supplementary Figure S3). Similarly, when cells expressing high levels of CID-YFP were sorted by FACS, centromeric localization of CID-YFP was observed 24 h after sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) though, during this period, no significant cell growth was observed. These results are in good agreement with the time-lapse analysis described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and Supplementary Movie 1), where strong reduction of CID-YFP protein levels was observed in the absence of cell division.</p><p>Altogether, these results indicate that expression of CID-YFP is actually regulated during cell culture. This regulation, however, does not take place at the transcriptional level since, as determined by RT&#x02013;PCR using primers specific for YFP, the levels of CID-YFP mRNA do not change significantly from 24 to 72 h post-transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). CID-YFP expression must, therefore, be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. It is possible that, as in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), CID-YFP expression is regulated by proteolytic degradation of excess protein. Consistent with this hypothesis, centromeric localization of CID-YFP is impaired when cells are cultured in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which is known to be effective in insect cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the percentage of cells that, at 48 h post-transfection, show CID-YFP exclusively localized at centromeres decreases significantly when they are cultured in the presence of the inhibitor for 3&#x02013;9 h before harvesting of the cells. Similar results were obtained when the effects of MG132 on the localization of CID-YFP were determined on FACS-sorted cells showing mislocalized CID-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As mentioned above, after sorting, the percentage of cells showing CID-YFP exclusively localized at centromeres is &#x0223c;3%, which increases to 30% after 24 h of additional culture in the absence of any, added inhibitor. However, the percentage of cells that, 24 h after sorting, show centromeric localization of CID-YFP is strongly reduced, by &#x0003e;60%, when cells are cultured in the presence of MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Altogether, these observations indicate that proteasome-mediated degradation contributes to restrict localization of transiently expressed CID-YFP to centromeres. Proteolytic degradation of CID-YFP does not depend on the YFP-tag as no significant change in proteins levels were detected upon culturing of cells expressing N<sub>CID</sub>-YFP or N<sub>CID</sub>HFD<sub>H3</sub>-YFP fusion proteins, that do not localize to centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and Supplementary Figure S2), or YFP itself (data not shown).</p><p>After treatment with MG132 for 3&#x02013;9 h, the percentage of cells showing CID-YFP localized at centromeres is lower than at the start of the treatment when the inhibitor was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) indicating that, when proteolysis is inhibited in the presence of MG132, high CID-YFP expression levels are restored in cells showing low CID-YFP levels and that, under these conditions, newly synthesized CID-YFP mislocalizes throughout chromatin. These results strongly support the hypothesis that proteolytic degradation regulates available CID-YFP levels to ensure its preferential deposition at centromeres.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell cycle progression is affected in cells showing mislocalized CID</title><p>CID is known to play an essential role in centromere organization and kinetochore assembly. Therefore, CID mislocalization is likely to affect cell cycle progression. Consistent with this hypothesis, a high percentage of cells showing mislocalized CID are reactive against antibodies that specifically recognize phosphorylation of S10 of the histone H3 tail (&#x003b1;PSer<sup>10</sup>H3), an event that occurs in G2 preceding chromosome condensation and is detected all through mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, up to 60% of cells showing mislocalized CID-YFP are reactive to &#x003b1;PSer<sup>10</sup>H3, which is in contrast with the low percentage of &#x003b1;PSer<sup>10</sup>H3 positive cells (5%) observed among untransfected cells or those showing CID-YFP exclusively localized at centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, panel CID-YFP). A similar behaviour is observed when HFD<sub>CID</sub>-YFP was expressed. Also in this case, a high proportion of cells where HFD<sub>CID</sub>-YFP is mislocalized are positive for &#x003b1;PSer<sup>10</sup>H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, panel HFD<sub>CID</sub>-YFP). This effect is specific, as it is not observed when an N<sub>CID</sub>HFD<sub>H3</sub>-YFP fusion protein is expressed. N<sub>CID</sub>HFD<sub>H3</sub>-YFP shows only the diffuse pattern of localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) as it binds throughout chromatin. Nevertheless, in this case, the percentage of cells positive for &#x003b1;PSer<sup>10</sup>H3 is not different from that observed with untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, panel N<sub>CID</sub>HFD<sub>H3</sub>-YFP). These results indicate that mislocalization of CID-YFP delays cell cycle progression. No mitotic cells were detected among all &#x003b1;PSer<sup>10</sup>H3 positive cells analyzed showing mislocalized CID-YFP (N = 260) strongly suggesting that they enter mitosis at a very low frequency. <italic>In vivo</italic> time-lapse analysis is consistent with this hypothesis as cells showing mislocalized CID-YFP do not normally enter mitosis and, when they do so, strong aberrations on chromosome segregation are observed that, in extreme cases, result in daughter cells receiving no chromosomes at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and Supplementary Movie 2).</p><p>Interestingly, cells showing a mixed localization pattern, at centromeres and throughout chromatin, appear to progress normally through cell cycle as, in this case, the percentage of &#x003b1;PSer<sup>10</sup>H3 positive cells is not significantly different from that observed with untransfected cells or with cells showing CID-YFP exclusively localized at centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, panels CID-YFP and HFD<sub>CID</sub>-YFP). In good agreement with this interpretation, cells showing a mixed pattern of CID-YFP localization were observed to progress normally through mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and Supplementary Movie 3) and metaphase chromosomes are detected where, in addition to a strong centromeric localization, CID-YFP is also found bound throughout the entire condensed chromosome [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B (b)</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Strong evidence indicates that centromere identity is dictated by the deposition at centromeric chromatin of the specific histone H3 variant CENP-A. The molecular mechanism(s) underlying specific deposition of CENP-A at centromeres are, however, poorly understood. Components of the inner-kinetochore complex CENP-I/H are known to be required for centromeric deposition of newly synthesized CENP-A both in chicken and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). This is, however, an intriguing observation as recruitment of CENP-I to centromeres is reciprocally dependent on CENP-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). On the other hand, the identification of assembly factors responsible for the specific deposition of CENP-A nucleosomes at centromeres remains elusive. <italic>Drosophila</italic> CENP-A (CID) was shown to interact with RbAp48/p55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), a chaperone protein that participates in known chromatin assembly complexes, CAF-1 and HIRA, as well as in many chromatin remodeling and modifying complexes. The contribution of this interaction to the specific deposition of CENP-A at centromeres appears uncertain as neither CAF-1 nor HIRA appear to be associated to CENP-A chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and, in addition, these complexes are not specific for CENP-A as they also load nucleosomes containing other H3 variants (H3.1 for CAF-1 and H3.3 for HIRA). Furthermore, as shown here and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), transiently expressed CENP-A incorporates throughout chromatin indicating that deposition of CENP-A nucleosomes is a promiscuous process. Altogether, these observations suggest that additional mechanisms must exist to guarantee that stable incorporation of CENP-A nucleosomes occurs only at centromeres.</p><p>In this paper, we show that proteasome-mediated degradation contributes to restrict localization of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CENP-A (CID) to centromeres. In these experiments, a CID-YFP fusion was transiently expressed from the <italic>cid</italic> promoter in Kc cells. Our results show that, though at early times post-transfection CID-YFP mislocalizes throughout chromatin, its localization is progressively constrained to centromeres upon culturing of the cells as: (i) the percentage of cells showing CID-YFP localized exclusively at centromeres increases at late post-transfection times; (ii) FACS-sorted cells showing mislocalized CID-YFP progress to cells where CID-YFP is exclusively localized at centromeres and (iii) <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging shows clearance of mislocalized CID-YFP in individual living cells. Centromeric localization of transiently expressed CID-YFP is prevented in the presence of inhibitors of the proteasome indicating that clearance of mislocalized CID-YFP requires proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Most likely, mislocalized CID-YFP nucleosomes are exchanged from chromatin prior to degradation as, in general, histones are resistant to proteolysis when incorporated to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). As a consequence of the interaction with kinetochore components, centromeric CID-YFP nucleosomes might be exchanged at a much slower rate or, alternatively, be more resistant to proteolytic degradation.</p><p>Our results show that proteolytic degradation not only eliminates mislocalized CID-YFP but, in addition, it also regulates CID-YFP expression levels as, upon culturing of the cells, protein levels are drastically reduced though, at the mRNA level, no significant change in expression is detected. The reduction in protein levels does not correlate with cell division indicating that it is not due to dilution of the expression plasmid during growth. The regulation of available CID-YFP appears essential to ensure centromeric deposition of CID-YFP nucleosomes as newly synthesized CID-YFP mislocalizes throughout chromatin when cells showing CID-YFP localized exclusively at centromeres are cultured in the presence of proteasome inhibitors.</p><p>In all experiments described in this paper, a CID&#x02013;YFP fusion was transiently expressed in Kc cells from the <italic>cid</italic> promoter. Whether proteolysis also contributes to the centromeric localization of endogenous CID remains to be determined. However, previous work by others showed that, in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, the levels of CENP-A (Cse4) are actually regulated by the proteasome and that a proteolysis-resistant mutant mislocalizes throughout chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Moreover, in some human cancers, CENP-A is over-expressed and, also in this case, it is found mislocalized throughout chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Proteasome-mediated degradation of endogenous CENP-A was also reported in human cells infected with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Altogether, these observations strongly suggest that proteasome-mediated degradation might be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that regulates available CENP-A levels to favour its preferential deposition at centromeres.</p><p>As shown here and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), mislocalization of CID-YFP induces cell cycle arrest indicating that clearance of mislocalized CID-YFP nucleosomes is required for normal cell cycle progression. Cell cycle arrest likely reflects functional interference due to recruitment of kinetochore proteins at ectopic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). However, cells showing a mixed pattern of CID-YFP localization, at centromeres and throughout chromatin, show normal cell cycle progression indicating that functional interference of mislocalized CID-YFP occur only above a given threshold, perhaps similar to that found at endogenous centromeres.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkl902_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkl902_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkl902_FigureS1.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkl902_FigureS2.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkl902_FigureS3.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mpeg" xlink:href="nar_gkl902_Movie1.mpeg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mpeg" xlink:href="nar_gkl902_Movie2.mpeg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mpeg" xlink:href="nar_gkl902_Movie3.mpeg"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>O.M.-M. acknowledges receipt of a doctoral fellowship from CIRIT.
