Although the levels of premutation <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA in carrier cells are 5&#x02013;10-fold higher than normal, the amount of the product FMR protein is unchanged or reduced. We demonstrated previously that premutation r(CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> tracts formed quadruplex structures that impeded translation and lowered the efficiency of protein synthesis. Normal translation could be restored <italic>in vivo</italic> by the quadruplex r(CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> destabilizing action of CBF-A and hnRNP A2 proteins. Here we report that the quadruplex-interacting cationic porphyrin TMPyP4 by itself and in cooperation with CBF-A or hnRNP A2 also unfolded quadruplex r(CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> and increased the efficiency of translation of 5&#x02032;-(CGG)<sub>99</sub> containing reporter firefly (FL) mRNA. TMPyP4 destabilized <italic>in vitro</italic> a (CGG)<sub>33</sub> intramolecular quadruplex structure and enhanced the translation of 5&#x02032;-(CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate and in HEK293 cells. The efficiency of translation of (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA was additively increased in cells exposed to TMPyP4 together with CBF-A. Whereas low doses of TMPyP4, CBF-A or hnRNP A2 by themselves did not affect the <italic>in vivo</italic> utilization of (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA, introduction of TMPyP4 together with either protein synergistically augmented its translation efficiency.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) of the first exon of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene includes in normal humans 4&#x02013;55 repeats of a d(CGG) trinucleotide. Dynamic mutation that expands the d(CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> sequence to &#x0003e; 200&#x02013;2000 repeats sets off fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of inherited mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Following its massive expansion, the repeat tract and an adjacent CpG island become hypermethylated and associated histones are modified such that <italic>FMR1</italic> is silenced and its FMRP product protein is not synthesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). While not developing FXS, carriers of <italic>FMR1</italic> premutation alleles that have &#x0003e; 55&#x02013;200 d(CGG) repeats do present diverse clinical involvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Most prominently, about 20% of the premutation female carriers exhibit premature ovarian failure (POF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and up to one-third of the male carriers of a premutation allele present fragile X associated tremor-ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>).</p><p>Notably, in contrast to the absence of <italic>FMR1</italic> transcripts in FXS cells, peripheral blood leukocytes that have (CGG)<sub>100&#x02013;200</sub> premutation repeats produce 5&#x02013;10-fold higher amounts of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA than cells of normal human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>). A similar accumulation of excess mRNA was also observed in a mouse premutation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Yet, despite the excessive amounts of <italic>FMR1</italic> transcripts, levels of their product protein FMRP remain unchanged or are lower than normal in cells of premutation carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The apparent reduced efficiency of translation of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA is consistent with a reported diminished association of premutation <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA with polysomes in lymphoblastoid cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Similarly, despite their normal steady-state level of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA, cells of a mildly affected FXS individual with <italic>FMR1</italic> alleles that included more than 200 (CGG) repeats displayed markedly reduced FMRP synthesis. Moreover, the <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA molecules in these cells were shown to be associated with stalled 40S ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Put together, the gathered evidence suggested that hindered polysome formation and stalled ribosome progression along premutation <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA result in decreased efficiency of its translation <italic>in vivo</italic>. A likely source of the inefficient protein synthesis is the folding of the 5&#x02032;-UTR (CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> premutation RNA tract into secondary structures. Such structures may well hamper the formation of polysomes and diminish the productive migration of ribosomes along the mRNA. Indeed, (CGG) repeat sequences in RNA were shown to readily fold into hairpin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and to form intra- and intermolecular tetraplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Translation has been shown to be impeded by quadruplex structures in diverse mRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>). More pertinently, we reported that premutation (CGG) repeats placed in the 5&#x02032; UTR region of a firefly luciferase (FL) reporter gene fold in FL mRNA transcripts into quadruplex structures that decreased the efficiency of their translation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, two member proteins of the hnRNP family, CBF-A and hnRNP A2, that destabilize quadruplex (CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> were demonstrated to alleviate in living cells the impediment to translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Overall, these results strongly suggested that by folding into tetraplex structures, the 5&#x02032; UTR premutation (CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> sequence in mRNA obstructs translation and that the resolution of the tetrahelical secondary structure can restore protein synthesis to its normal level.</p><p>Reinstating normal efficiency of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA translation in FX carrier cells can conceivably assuage some of the clinical sequelae of the <italic>FMR1</italic> premutation. However, exogenously introduced proteins such as CBF-A or hnRNP A2 that resolve secondary structures in mRNA are unlikely to become therapeutically applicable. Rather, a more viable approach is the use of low molecular size tetraplex unfolding agents. The cationic porphyrin 5,10,15,20-tetra(<italic>N</italic>-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphin (TMPyP4) whose size and geometry approximate those of a guanine quartet, was shown to selectively interact with and stabilize quadruplex structures formed by the guanine-rich sequences of telomeric DNA or within the NHE III<sub>1</sub> promoter of <italic>c-MYC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Conversely, however, this cationic porphyrin effectively destabilized <italic>in vitro</italic> G&#x02032;2 bimolecular tetraplex structure of (CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> in DNA and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Owing to its quadruplex (CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> disrupting activity, TMPyP4 might potentially serve as a model low molecular size agent that may increase the translation efficiency of premutation <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA. Yet, being a charged molecule, TMPyP4 is unlikely to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier and it thus cannot effectively treat neurodevelopmental disorders such as FXTAS. Use of this cationic porphyrin to destabilize d/r(CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> quadruplexes <italic>in vivo</italic> constitutes, therefore, a proof of principle rather than identification of a clinically applicable therapeutic agent.</p><p>In this work we demonstrate that TMPyP4 unfolded tetraplex RNA (CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub> in vitro</italic> and enhanced the translation of 5&#x02032; UTR (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA in a reticulocyte lysate system. TMPyP4 that was added to HEK293 cells at excess over 5&#x02032; UTR (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA increased the efficiency of its translation. When introduced at a low ratio relative to the premutation mRNA, the cationic porphyrin failed to affect by itself the efficiency of translation. However, TMPyP4 together with sub-saturating amounts of either CBF-A or hnRNP A2 cooperatively augmented the efficiently of the <italic>in vivo</italic> translation of 5&#x02032; UTR (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA. Potential therapeutic implications of these findings are discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cationic porphyrins</title><p>The cationic porphyrin 5,10,15,20-tetra(<italic>N</italic>-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphin (TMPyP4) was the product of Calbiochem.

The cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection using Trypsin&#x02013;EDTA and resuspended in 1.0 ml of cold growth medium.

To this end, <sup>32</sup>P-labelled RNA transcript of pCS107(CGG)<sub>33</sub> was incubated without or with 5.0 &#x003bc;M TMPyP4 in the absence of alkali ion or in the presence of 20 mM of either KCl or LiCl which, respectively, promote or do not support the formation of stable quadruplex structures of DNA or RNA. To assess the effect of TMPyP4 on potential secondary structure of the pCS107(CGG)<sub>33</sub> RNA, its electrophoretic mobility in a non-denaturing agarose gel was compared to the migration of marker pCS107 RNA that lacked the repeat sequence. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, the mobility of the marker RNA molecules remained unaffected by TMPyP4 in the absence of alkali ion or in the presence of either KCl or LiCl. Similarly, TMPyP4 did not affect the electrophoretic migration of pCS107(CGG)<sub>33</sub> RNA both in the absence of salt or in a buffer that contained Li<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, left and right panels, respectively). In contrast, the relative electrophoretic mobility of the (CGG)<sub>33</sub> containing RNA was increased in the presence of K<sup>+</sup> ions and TMPyP4 slowed its migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, middle panel). At the same time, the mobility of the pCS107 RNA that did not contain a (CGG) repeat tract remained unchanged in the presence of K<sup>+</sup> ions without or with TMPyP4. Thus, the likeliest cause of the slowed relative electrophoretic mobility of the pCS107(CGG)<sub>33</sub> RNA was the unfolding by TMPyP4 of a rapidly migrating compact intramolecular secondary structure of the r(CGG)<sub>33</sub> tract. Potassium ions are essential for the formation and stability of quadruplex nucleic acids whereas lithium is unable to promote its generation and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Hence, the ability of TMPyP4 to slow the mobility of pCS107(CGG)<sub>33</sub> in K<sup>+</sup>-containing buffer but not in the presence of Li<sup>+</sup> ions conforms with a suggestion that the compact structure of pCS107(CGG)<sub>33</sub> was a quadruplex. Yet, the possibility that the compact RNA formation represented a different secondary structure such as hairpin cannot be excluded (see &#x02018;Discussion&#x02019; section). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>TMPyP4 destabilizes <italic>in vitro</italic> a secondary structure of 5&#x02032;-(CGG)<sub>33</sub> containing RNA.

Determination of the relative activity of FL indicated that translation of pT7<italic>FMR1</italic>-5&#x02032;-UTR(CGG)<sub>30</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA was only minimally enhanced in the presence of increasing amounts of TMPyP4. In contrast, the translation of pT7<italic>FMR1</italic>-5&#x02032;-UTR(CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA was augmented up to &#x0003e;3-fold in direct proportion to the concentration of added TMPyP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). These results were in line with the reported minimal effect of the quadruplex unfolding proteins hnRNP A2 and CBF-A on the <italic>in vivo</italic> translation of (CGG)<sub>30</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA and their robust stimulation of the translation of premutation (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B showed that in contrast to the stimulation of the translation of (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA by TMPyP4, protein synthesis was slightly depressed by its two positional isomers TMPyP2 and TMPyP3 that were shown to be incapable of destabilizing quadruplex r(CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).

Since the amount of (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA was proportional to the amount of transfecting reporter plasmid (data not shown), we empirically determined conditions for the introduction of TMPyP4 or CBF-A at low or high ratios to the reporter plasmids and consequently to their mRNA transcripts.

A slight enhancement of the translation efficiency observed upon introduction of both agents together was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B and C). As reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), the presence of a premutation 5&#x02032;-UTR (CGG)<sub>99</sub> repeat sequence in <italic>FL</italic> mRNA depressed its utilization relative to <italic>FL</italic> mRNA molecules with no repeat tract and particularly relative to (CGG)<sub>30</sub> containing mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B and C). Furthermore, this diminished efficiency of translation was not elevated by sub-saturating amounts of either TMPyP4 or CBF-A.

Cells were grown and lysed and RL-normalized relative levels of FL activity and mRNA were measured as described in the preceding section. Western analysis indicated that the expression of hnRNP A2 was unaffected by the number of (CGG) repeats in the reporter plasmid or by the absence or presence of TMPyP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A).

However, the translation efficiency of (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA was higher by 1.4&#x02013;1.9-fold in cells that were exposed to a combination of sub-saturating amounts of TMPyP4 together with hnRNP A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C). Thus, similarly to CBF-A, sub-saturating levels of hnRNPA2 cooperated with low relative amounts of TMPyP4 to synergistically increase the efficiency of the <italic>in vivo</italic> translation of mRNA molecules that included a 5&#x02032; (CGG)<sub>99</sub> premutation tract. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Low relative amounts TMPyP4 and hnRNP A2 cooperate to synergistically increase the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficiency of translation of (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA.

Although the premutation state is characterized by elevated synthesis and accumulation of 5&#x02013;10-fold higher than normal amounts of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>), levels of their product protein FMRP are reduced or remain unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). We have shown recently that impediment to translation by quadruplex structures of the 5&#x02032;-UTR (CGG)<sub>&#x0003e;55&#x02013;200</sub> premutation tract in <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA is the likely source of the apparent diminished efficacy of FMRP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Also, over-expression in living cells of two d/r(CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> quadruplex destabilizing hnRNPs; CBF-A and hnRNP A2, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) removed the obstruction to translation and reinstated normal efficiency of premutation mRNA utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). This finding suggested that quadruplex (CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> unfolding agents may be useful in partly overcoming the molecular defect in cells of premutation carriers. However, therapeutic utilization of exogenously introduced proteins such as CBF-A or hnRNP A2 is impractical and a more realistic option is the use of small quadruplex destabilizing molecules. We thus chose to examine the cationic porphyrin TMPyP4 that, contrary to its capability to stabilize quadruplex structures of the telomeric repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and of a guanine-rich tract in the <italic>c-Myc</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), was shown to paradoxically destabilize d(CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> quadruplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>In the present work we first demonstrated that TMPyP4 unfolded <italic>in vitro</italic> an intramolecular secondary structure of an r(CGG)<sub>33</sub> tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Since RNA that did not contain r(CGG)<sub>33</sub> repeat tract was unaffected by TMPyP4 and as the untangled pCS107(CGG)<sub>33</sub> RNA secondary structure was generated in the presence of K<sup>+</sup> but not Li<sup>+</sup> ions, we propose that it represented a quadruplex. In such case, similarly to its reported ability to resolve <italic>in vitro</italic> a formally defined bimolecular tetraplex structure of r(CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), TMPyP4 appeared to be able to unfold <italic>in vitro</italic> an intramolecular quadruplex form of the RNA repeat sequence. It should be cautioned, however, that although previous additional indirect evidence also indicated that (CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> RNA formed an intramolecular quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), a formal proof of the nature of the r(CGG)<sub>33</sub> secondary structure is still lacking.</p><p>TMPyP4, but not its positional isomers TMPyP2 or TMPyP3 that are unable to unfold quadruplex (CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), enhanced the translation in reticulocyte lysate of a premutation-like reporter (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Based on these findings we compared the ability of TMPyP4 or of the quadruplex unfolding proteins CBF-A and hnRNP A2 to increase the efficiency of the <italic>in vivo</italic> translation of premutation (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA. Our initial results indicated that exposure of HEK293 cells to TMPyP4, at empirically determined excess over the p<italic>FMR1</italic>-5&#x02032;-UTR(CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> transfecting reporter plasmid, elevated the efficiency of (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The extent of TMPyP4-induced stimulation was comparable to the enhancement of <italic>in vivo</italic> translation by CBF-A [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>)]. In contrast, lower amounts of TMPyP4, CBF-A or hnRNP A2 relative to the reporter p<italic>FMR1</italic>-5&#x02032;-UTR(CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> plasmid failed to increase the efficiency of (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Since the amount of (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA was proportional to the amount of transfecting reporter plasmid, it appeared that in order to enhance translation both TMPyP4 and CBF-A had to be present at an excess over the premutation mRNA. The required TMPyP4 to RNA stoichiometry and the non-catalytic quadruplex nucleic acid destabilizing activity of CBF-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) suggested that the two agents had a similar mechanism of action. Data summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> that demonstrated additive augmentation of translation efficacy by TMPyP4 and CBF-A was indeed supportive of the supposition that these agents shared a similar mechanism of destabilization of quadruplex (CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> structure in premutation mRNA. Conceivably, both the cationic porphyrin and CBF-A recognized G-quartets that were formed within the (CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> sequence, bound to the quadruplex domain and diminished its stability, as reflected by the capacity of TMPyP4 to lower the melting temperatures of tetraplex (CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Our results indicated that the efficacy of translation of (CGG)<sub>30</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA was up to 3-fold higher than that of (CGG)<sub>0</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). A 5&#x02032;-(CGG)<sub>30</sub> tract represents the most common number of (CGG) repeats in the FMR1 gene in the normal human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). It may be speculated that this size of the repeat sequence was evolutionarily conserved because it affords higher efficacy of FMRP synthesis, possibly by attracting translation factors to the <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA. Notably, however, the quadruplex disrupting agents TMPyP4, CBF-A or hnRNP A2 each by themselves or TMPyP4 together with either protein did not alter the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of translation of (CGG)<sub>30</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). We assume, therefore, that unlike a quadruplex structure of a premutation-size 5&#x02032;-(CGG)<sub>99</sub> tract, the shorter 5&#x02032;-(CGG)<sub>30</sub> sequence either did not block translation or it even promoted it. Alternatively, the 5&#x02032;-(CGG)<sub>30</sub> stretch may have been unstable at 37&#x000b0;C within the cells such that it was maintained as a single-strand also in the absence of quadruplex destabilizing agents.</p><p>Introduction of excessive amounts of TMPyP4 or of greatly over-expressed quadruplex disrupting hnRNPs is likely to be therapeutically impractical. Presented evidence showed, however, that although low relative amounts of these agents failed to stimulate by themselves the <italic>in vivo</italic> translation of (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA, combining TMPyP4 with CBF-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) or with hnRNP A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) elicited significant increases in the efficacy of translation of the premutation mRNA. The inability of a low relative dose of TMPyP4 to enhance by itself the translation of (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA suggested that the levels of available endogenous CBF-A and hnRNP A2 in HEK293 cells were insufficient to cooperate with the externally added TMPyP4. It is possible however, that TMPyP4 alone may suffice to enhance the translation of premutation mRNA in other cell types that endogenously produce higher amounts of hnRNPs.</p><p>It has been suggested that the source of neurodegeneration in FXTAS is the accumulation of excessive amounts of premutation <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA in FXS carrier cells. A proposed RNA gain-of-function toxicity model suggested that the accumulated <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA molecules bind r(CGG) repeat binding proteins (RBPs) that are thus sequestered from their normal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Interestingly, hnRNP A2/B1 was recently identified as a major RBP in a transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of FXTAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), providing independent evidence for the <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction of this quadruplex r(CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> disrupting protein with the premutation repeat tract. In addition to its association with premutation (CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> mRNA and its capacity to enhance its translation, over expressed hnRNP A2 was shown to diminish the amount of the accumulated mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Data presented in this manuscript indicated that the elevated amount of premutation mRNA was also reduced in cells that were exposed to TMPyP4 or to CBF-A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). It should be noted that both agents had to be introduced in excess over the (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA. Introduction of TMPyP4, CBF-A or hnRNP A2 alone, each at low ratio relative to the premutation mRNA, did not decrease the level of (CGG)<sub>99</sub>-<italic>FL</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Only combinations of low ratios of the porphyrin with either CBF-A or hnRNP A2 depressed mRNA accumulation. Low ratios of the quadruplex disrupting porphyrin or hnRNPs by themselves to premutation mRNA also failed to elicit enhancement of translation whereas combinations of TMPyP4 with either protein both augmented the translation of 5&#x02032;-(CGG)<sub>99</sub>-mRNA and depressed its accumulation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). It is tempting, therefore, to implicate the quadruplex destabilizing activity of the proteins and TMPyP4 in both translation enhancement and lowering of the level of premutation mRNA. In any case, whatever the mechanism is by which TMPyP4 and the two hnRNPs depressed mRNA accumulation, our observations suggested that in addition to being able to increase the efficiency of premutation mRNA translation, these agents may also be effective in decreasing the RNA toxicity in cells of FXS carriers.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Israel Science Foundation, United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation; the Fund for Promotion of Research at the Technion (to M.F.).
