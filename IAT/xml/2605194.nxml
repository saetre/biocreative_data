Stimulation of the cells with LPS+IFN&#x003b3; markedly increased superoxide production (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). This increase was attenuated by apocynin or NADPH oxidase deficiency (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).

We then investigated if PP2Ac tyrosine nitration by endogenous peroxynitrite inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation. Phospho-tyrosine was detectable in PP2Ac isolated from endothelial cells.

The explanation for this may be that most PP2Ac in unstimulated endothelial cells is inactive because of high levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in this catalytic subunit. In support of this explanation, we observed that incubating the cells with LPS+IFN&#x003b3; did not change PP2Ac protein expression but increased PP2A activity and decreased PP2Ac tyrosine phosphorylation. Inhibition of PP2A activity with okadaic acid or inhibition of PP2Ac expression with siRNA against PP2Ac attenuates LPS+IFN&#x003b3;-induced increases in PP2A activity and monolayer permeability to albumin. These results establish that LPS+IFN&#x003b3;-induced increase in PP2A activity mediates barrier dysfunction in endothelial cell monolayers. The mechanism of action for PP2A to induce barrier dysfunction has been studied extensively in epithelial cells. PP2A is associated with the junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin and can directly modulate the phosphorylation state of these junction proteins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> PP2A activity causes dephosphorylation and redistribution of the tight junction proteins, leading to epithelial barrier dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></p><p id="P30">Our results show that PP2A activity is increased by LPS+IFN&#x003b3; and this increase is not due to increased expression of PP2Ac protein. Previous studies found that PP2A activity and function can be regulated by posttranslational modifications of the catalytic subunit (i.e., cysteine oxidation, tyrosine phosphorylation, or leucine methylation of PP2Ac).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> Peroxynitrite formed in the LPS+IFN&#x003b3;-stimulated endothelial cells may oxidize the cysteine residues and nitrate the tyrosine residues in PP2Ac, leading to modulation of PP2A activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> In preliminary studies we found that the thiol-specific reagent dithiothreitol increases further the PP2A activity in PP2Ac immunoprecipitates isolated from LPS+IFN&#x003b3;-stimulated cells (data not shown), suggesting that oxidation by endogenous peroxynitrite of the cysteine residues in PP2Ac inhibits the enzyme activity. Other studies also show that oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide inhibit the phosphatase activity of PP2A in cells or cell lysates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> Therefore, oxidation of the cysteine residues in PP2Ac is unlikely to be the mechanism by which LPS+IFN&#x003b3; increases PP2A activity.</p><p id="P31">Tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2Ac is another important mechanism for regulation of PP2A activity. PP2Ac can undergo tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by p60v-src, p56lck, epithelial growth factor receptors, and insulin receptors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> The phosphorylation results in inactivation of the enzyme.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> Peroxynitrite nitrates tyrosine residues in proteins, leading to formation of 3-nitrotyrosine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> This tyrosine nitration could inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation. It has been reported that nitration by authentic peroxynitrite of tyrosine residues in a cdc2(6&#x02013;20)NH2 peptide inhibits completely phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues by p56lck tyrosine kinase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref> Moreover, studies in intact cells have shown that nitration by exogenous peroxynitrite of tyrosine residues in proteins inhibits their phosphorylation. For example, incubation of lymphocytes with authentic peroxynitrite causes protein tyrosine nitration and inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation induced by anti-CD3 antibodies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> Our data demonstrate that PP2Ac immunoprecipitates, prepared from LPS+IFN&#x003b3;- or authentic peroxynitrite-treated endothelial cells, show 3-nitrotyrosine formation, decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and increased PP2A activity. These changes in 3-nitrotyrosine, tyrosine phosphorylation and PP2A activity are not detectable in PP2Ac from iNOS deficient or NADPH oxidase deficient endothelial cells exposed to LPS+IFN&#x003b3;. We infer that either endogenous peroxynitrite induced by LPS+IFN&#x003b3; or authentic peroxynitrite can nitrate the tyrosine residues in PP2Ac and thereby inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation. Functionally this inhibition is associated with increased PP2A activity.</p><p id="P32">Our results indicate that iNOS inhibitor 1400W, iNOS deficiency, NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin, or p47phox deficiency prevents the increase in PP2A activity and preserves the permeability barrier in endothelial monolayers challenged with LPS+IFN&#x003b3;. Moreover, exposure of endothelial cells to authentic peroxynitrite leads to augmented PP2A activity and increased monolayer leak. These results suggest that PP2A is a target of peroxynitrite that increases PP2A activity to mediate endothelial monolayer leak. This effect of peroxynitrite likely depends on tyrosine nitration of PP2Ac to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation and inactivate this catalytic subunit. The observation of a moderate increase in PP2A activity in 3-nitrotyrine immunoprecipitates isolated from LPS+IFN&#x003b3;-stimulated endothelial cells further supports an association between PP2Ac nitration and PP2A activity. While nitration by exogenous peroxynitrite of the cytoskeletal protein actin has been reported to contribute to peroxynitrite&#x02013;induced permeability increase in porcine pulmonary artery endothelial monolayers,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> our results indicate that PP2Ac is another target of peroxynitrite that mediates microvascular endothelial leak.</p><p id="P33">Stimulation of cells by growth factors or serum promotes phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in PP2Ac, thereby inactivating PP2A.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> Similarly, PP2A inactivation may occur in endothelial cells under the serum-supplemented cell culture conditions employed in the present study and may contribute to the barrier integrity of cell monolayers. Peroxynitrite produced by the cells in response to proinflammatory stimulation (i.e., LPS+IFN&#x003b3; in the present study) nitrates the tyrosine residue in PP2Ac. This nitration prevents phosphorylation/inactivation of PP2A by the receptor tyrosine kinases of growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor and insulin, and consequently increases PP2A activity to mediate barrier dysfunction. It has been reported that enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> infection stimulates nitrative stress and serine/threonine phosphatase activity that mediates the increased permeability in epithelial monolayers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> Further, it also has been reported that nitrative stress-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction can be prevented by treatment of cell monolayers with epithelial growth factor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></p><p id="P34">Bacterial infection or tissue damage stimulates the innate immune response to produce proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b3;.
