Comparable expression levels of each of these proteins were observed in independently infected cells derived from the same primary population and in different MPC populations (data not shown). However, the same MPC populations displayed variable ability to maintain EWS-ERG expression and were unable to stably express either of the two FUS-ERG fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002634-g004">Figure 4</xref> and data not shown).

Both genomic DNA and total RNA from cells that had lost EWS-ERG protein expression tested positive for the presence of EWS-ERG by PCR or RT-PCR using EWS-ERG specific primers. In some samples, RT-PCR analysis showed that loss of protein expression was accompanied by non-random EWS-ERG RNA processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002634-g004">figure 4B</xref>, lane 4), reflected by the presence of two distinct transcripts of about 250 and 500 bp.

Thus, about 20&#x00025; of all of the genes induced and repressed by EWS-ERG were also induced and repressed by ERG-1 alone and less than 8&#x00025; of genes induced and repressed by EWS-FLI-1 were induced and repressed by FLI-1 alone.</p><p>The role of the DNA binding domain in the transcriptional activity of EWS-FLI-1 fusion protein was addressed by comparing the transcriptional activity of wt EWS-FLI-1 with that of the DBDM. The EWS-FLI-1 DBDM induced 98 and repressed 167 transcripts in MPCs compared to, respectively, 250 induced and 199 repressed transcripts by wt EWS-FLI-1, suggesting that impairment of EWS-FLI-1 DNA binding affects the transcriptional activation capacity of the fusion more strongly than its transcriptional repression capacity. Pairwise comparison revealed that only 65 out of a total of 649 (&#x0223c;10&#x00025;) genes that were induced and repressed were shared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002634-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Finally, comparison between the effects on MPCs of FUS-ERG fusions found in ESFT and AML revealed a similar number of induced and repressed transcripts. Of the total induced transcripts by the two fusion proteins, about 34&#x00025; were common whereas about 22&#x00025; of all of the repressed transcripts were shared between cells expressing the two fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002634-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002634.s003">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Distinct and common candidate target genes of ESFT fusion proteins and their component ets family members</title><p>Expression of fifteen of the genes that were found to be significantly up- or down-regulated in MPC expressing EWS-FLI1, EWS-ERG and FUS-ERG was validated by quantitative real-time PCR in the corresponding cells as well as in FLI-1 and ERG-1 expressing counterparts (a complete list of up- and downregulated genes is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002634.s004">Table S2</xref>, whereas shared genes are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002634.s005">Table S3</xref>). <italic>DHH, PODXL</italic>, <italic>KRT119</italic> and <italic>CDH5</italic> were up-regulated in FLI-1 and ERG-1-expressing cells as well as in all three fusion protein expressing MPCs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002634-t001">Table 1</xref>).

In all cases the fusion protein is composed of the amino terminal portion of a TET family member that provides a potent transactivating domain and the DNA binding domain of one of several possible ets family members. In more than 99&#x00025; of cases, the TET family member is EWS and in 85&#x02013;90&#x00025; of cases the ets family member is FLI-1. EWS is fused to ERG in 5&#x02013;10&#x00025; of cases whereas FUS-ERG is found in less than 1&#x00025; of cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002634-Helman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002634-Riggi1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002634-Riggi2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002634-Welford1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The difference in frequency of association of the fusion proteins with ESFT is currently unexplained, and could conceivably reflect the relative frequency of the corresponding chromosomal breaks. However, our present observations using mouse MPCs suggest that primary mesenchymal stem cells display a markedly different degree of permissiveness for the three fusion proteins. Whereas expression of EWS-FLI-1 was tolerated in all of the cell batches tested, expression of EWS-ERG was restricted to a fraction of the batches while stable expression of FUS-ERG could not be achieved. The observed differential permissiveness correlates with the relative frequency at which each fusion accompanies ESFT cases, suggesting distinct windows of opportunity for the different fusion proteins to display their putative transforming properties in MPCs.</p><p>Mechanisms whereby MPCs restrict expression of EWS-ERG and FUS-ERG remain to be elucidated. Whereas in some cases the specific RNA was not detectable or appeared degraded, in others protein expression could not be detected despite maintenance of transcripts of appropriate length. It is conceivable that discrete stages of MPC differentiation may account for the observed differences in permissiveness. Alternatively, MPCs may be composed of functionally heterogeneous cell subsets that cannot be distinguished on the basis of the restricted number of phenotypic markers used to characterize them. A plausible scenario may be that a majority of these putative subsets display a milieu that is favourable for EWS-FLI-1 expression and function, whereas only rare subsets may tolerate expression of FUS-ERG. Thus, the composition or differentiation stage of MPC populations may determine whether or not expression of ESFT-associated fusion proteins other than EWS-FLI-1 may be sustained.</p><p>The observed difference in permissiveness for fusion protein expression could not be attributed to functional differences among MPC batches because the same batches were used for expression of all of the contructs.</p><p>Although EWS-FLI-1 has been shown to have the capacity to transform primary MPCs that express functional p53 and p19<sup>ARF</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002634-Riggi3">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, EWS-FLI-1 expression and transforming potential in primary unsorted bone marrow cells were found to be facilitated by inactivating <italic>TP53</italic> mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002634-CastilleroTrejo1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is possible that several common FLI-1 and ERG-1 candidate targets are undetected because of the weakness of the intrinsic transactivation domain of the two transcription factors. The potency of EWS transactivation may provide a mechanism to unmask such putative targets. The ability of EWS to interact with numerous proteins implicated in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002634-Araya1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002634-Arvand1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002634-Gascoyne1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002634-Knoop1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002634-Yang1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002634-Zhang1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> may supply an alternative explanation. Thus, it is possible that a combination of EWS and its binding partners confer upon FLI-1 and ERG-1 the ability to induce expression of common genes. Of the fraction of induced and repressed transcripts that were common to the three fusion proteins, most are not known to be directly implicated in transformation, and it is possible that the three fusion proteins use distinct mechanisms to transform primary cells, resulting nevertheless in tumors with an indistinguishable phenotype as assessed by conventional histology and immunohistochemistry.

The effect of EWS-FLI-1 and the other fusion proteins on MPCs, on the other hand, was evaluated in primary cells at an early time point following expression, prior to transformation and tumor development.</p><p>Growth hormone induces IGF-1 and the robust growth hormone spurt during puberty may help create favorable conditions for the initial development of ESFT from mesenchymal stem cells harboring the appropriate chromosomal translocations and expressing the corresponding fusion proteins. Subsequent maintenance of tumor growth may require tumor cell-autonomous IGF-1 production and <italic>IGF1</italic> induction may provide one mechanism whereby EWS-FLI-1 and its ESFT-associated relatives ensure tumor growth and progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mesenchymal stem cells and cell lines</title><p>Mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) were isolated from bone marrow of adult C57BL/6, wild type mice according to the methods described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002634-Jiang1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, and cultured on fibronectin-coated plates (Sigma) in medium containing 2&#x00025; dialyzed FCS (Sigma), 10 ng/ml EGF (Sigma), 10ng/ml PDGF-BB (R&#x00026;D Systems) and 10ng/ml recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon).
