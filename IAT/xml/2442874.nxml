Here we provide evidence for a novel, NPS-responsive circuit that shapes neural activity in the mouse basolateral amygdala (BLA) via the endopiriform nucleus (EPN). Using slice preparations, we demonstrate that NPS directly activates an inward current in 20&#x00025; of EPN neurons and evokes an increase of glutamatergic excitation in this nucleus. Excitation of the EPN is responsible for a modulation of BLA activity through NPS, characterized by a general increase of GABAergic inhibition and enhancement of spike activity in a subset of BLA projection neurons. Finally, local injection of NPS to the EPN interferes with the expression of contextual, but not auditory cued fear memory. Together, these data suggest the existence of a specific NPS-responsive circuitry between EPN and BLA, likely involved in contextual aspects of fear memory.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The 20 residue peptide NPS, termed after its N-terminal serine residue, has recently been identified as the endogenous agonist for the orphan G-protein coupled GPR154 receptor now referred to as NPSR. Analysis in heterologous expression systems revealed a likely G<sub>q</sub> protein-mediated mobilization of intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, suggesting that NPS may enhance neuronal excitability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Xu1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

For example, the BLA is characterized by a high number of benzodiazepine receptors and mediates the GABAergic control of anxiety <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-KangPark1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The BLA also supports mnemotic functions as it is critically involved in stress modulation of hippocampus-dependent memory and serves in turn as entry site for hippocampal information to the amygdala during, e.g., contextual fear conditioning for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-McGaugh1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Phelps1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus we hypothesized that the BLA may be involved in NPS functions related to anxiety and memory formation. However, although NPSR is highly expressed in the neighboring areas such as medial and cortical amygdala, and particularly in the endopiriform nucleus (EPN), the BLA itself shows only trace amounts of NPSR mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Xu2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the current study we investigated the role of NPS in the control of neuronal activity in the EPN and its potential to modulate activity in the BLA as well as BLA-dependent expression of conditioned fear behavior. We applied electrophysiological and pharmacological techniques in the slice preparation of the mouse amygdala <italic>in vitro</italic> to characterize, for the first time, direct and indirect cellular effects of NPS in native neuronal cells. Our data reveal a hitherto undescribed neuronal circuitry shaping activity patterns in the BLA via the EPN.

We demonstrate that NPS exerts direct actions on cells in the EPN and enhances glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the great majority of encountered neurons. Cut experiments reveal that input from the EPN is required for NPS modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated feedback and feedforward inhibition in the BLA. This circuitry may be functional in the context of conditioned fear expression, as local application of NPS to the endopiriform nucleus reduces the expression of contextual, but not cued fear memory in mice.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that while projection neurons in the BLA receive increased excitatory input upon NPS stimulation, only a subpopulation of those neurons are driven to generate action potentials. At the same time, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor dependent inhibitory transmission is enhanced, likely through both, feedback inhibition via recurrent excitatory connections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Pitknen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and feedforward inhibition, as indicated by a former study showing a multiphasic IPSP following the initial depolarizing potential upon stimulation of the EPN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Gean1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Thus NPS appears to be able to selectively shape information processing in BLA circuits. However, neither direct postsynaptic actions of NPS on interneurons and projection neurons are encountered in the BLA nor effects on miniature postsynaptic currents independent of action potential propagation. Still, we cannot exclude that NPS may directly modulate voltage-dependent ionic conductances in the BLA via second messenger cascades not investigated in the present study. Also, analysis of mIPSCs may underestimate mechanisms of inhibition upstream of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry, namely inhibition of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels or activation of K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels within the nerve terminal. However, our experiments revealed that NPS neither affects paired-pulse facilitation of IPSCs in BLA projection neurons nor paired-pulse facilitation of EPSCs in interneurons, hence arguing against a modulation of presynaptic mechanisms through NPS receptors localized on the relevant terminals. In summary, these data suggest that the observed response in BLA neurons originated from another structure that is endowed with the NPS receptor and preserved connections to the BLA in the frontal slice preparation.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest the endopiriform nucleus as the source of this NPS dependent modulation: the NPS receptor is expressed most abundantly in this region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Xu2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, direct projections from the piriform cortex and endopiriform nucleus to the BLA have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Luskin1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Behan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, and stimulation of the ventral endopiriform nucleus can evoke excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the BLA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Gean1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, our data suggest that the observed modulation of neural activity in the BLA through NPS may be mediated by the EPN. Firstly, a subpopulation of neurons of the EPN developed an inward current upon application of NPS in the presence of TTX. Secondly, most neurons in the EPN were subject to elevated excitatory synaptic transmission, presumably due to the prominent intrinsic excitatory connections. Thirdly, disconnection of BLA and EPN prevented the NPS-induced increase of sIPSCs in BLA projection neurons. Fourthly, recordings from isolated BLA slices showed a complete absence of NPS-effects on sIPSC activity. And fifthly, puffing NPS locally into the EPN caused an increase in sIPSC activity comparable to that observed after bath application of NPS.</p><p>The EPN is regarded as part of the olfactory cortex, and closely associated with the piriform cortex (PC). In fact, NPS receptors are also expressed in lower layers of the PC, indicating that they may form a functional NPS-responsive unit with the EPN/PC area. The previously observed involvement of the EPN in the integration of olfactory and gustatory information has led to the suggestion that it may via its efferent connections to the amygdala be involved in food selection and &#x02013; more generally &#x02013; in emotional reactions related to chemical sensation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Fu1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the EPN is well known for its role in epileptogenic properties, and kindling-induced epileptiform potentials in PC slices were shown to originate in the EPN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Hoffman1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Demir1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Low seizure threshold in this structure is likely due to a combination of intrinsic membrane properties and heavy intranuclear connections that give rise to regenerative positive feedback and synchronous discharge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Behan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Banks1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Brevi1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Behan and Haberly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Behan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> suggested that this potentially epileptogenic mechanism may support information encoding by facilitating synaptic plasticity in EPN target areas and by providing rhythmic network activity patterns for an association of contextual with odor-related and other cue information.</p><p>Our findings may thus be of particular relevance for the modulation of emotional states through the amygdala. In fact, c-Fos mapping studies have identified the EPN as one of the brain areas that is most consistently activated by (cued and contextually) conditioned as well as unconditioned fear stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Smith2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Campeau1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. It is similarly activated by stimulation of the NPS-rich parabrachial nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Krukoff1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, which relays nociceptive and visceral information to higher brain areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Balaban1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. However, projections from the parabrachial nucleus do likely not provide NPS input to the EPN, as they target the central amygdala, but not its lateral and basolateral subnuclei or the EPN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Gauriau1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. An alternative source of NPS for the EPN may be the medial amygdala <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Xu1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, a structure that is also drastically activated by cued and contextually conditioned fear and is known to send substantial input into the EPN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Canteras1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. It should also be considered that the EPN may receive NPS innervation from the recently discovered group of NPS-positive cells in the locus coeruleus area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Xu2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Although it remains to be investigated whether the NPS expressing neurons in the locus coeruleus area indeed project to the EPN and whether or not they show similar functional properties as their noradrenergic counterparts, it is striking that increases of inhibition in the BLA recorded <italic>in vivo</italic> upon locus coeruleus stimulation could only partly be blocked by the beta-adreno receptor antagonist timolol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Chen1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The locus coeruleus is critically involved in the modulation of stress responses in the amygdala and their effect on memory formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-McGaugh1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The EPN on the other hand projects to brain regions that are critically involved in fear memory formation and retrieval, including all subdivisions of the hippocampus, the BLA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Behan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, and the lateral entorhinal cortex. The most substantial projections from the amygdala to the EPN, in turn, originate in the lateral division of the amygdalo-hippocampal area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Majak2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. It is striking, that in addition to the EPN, the lateral entorhinal cortex and amygdalo-hippocampal area are characterized by pronounced expression of NPSR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Xu2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, the NPS system is well organized to integrate fear- and stress-related information from various sources and to modulate both direct and indirect information flow between the amygdala and hippocampus, via the EPN.</p><p>Following this line of evidence, we hypothesized a potential role of an NPS-activated EPN-to-BLA circuit <italic>in vivo</italic> for the retrieval and expression of fear memories. One of the best studied fear memory paradigms is classical fear conditioning, where animals very quickly learn to associate a previously neutral sensory stimulus or context with a coinciding aversive situation. In rodents, the so conditioned stimuli can elicit a behavioral response that comprises elements of freezing, risk-assessment and other defensive reactions according to the salience of the conditioned stimulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Laxmi1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The circuitry and neural activity underlying different forms of such fear memory has been intensively studied. In general, it is considered that the amygdala is a critical site of information storage and plasticity during both cued and contextual conditioning, and that the hippocampus comes into play whenever complex, such as multimodal, contextual or temporal, information processing takes place. In addition, such functional distinction appears to exist within the amygdala itself, as auditory and nociceptive information converge on single neurons in the lateral subnucleus of the amygdala, while context information is relayed from the hippocampus mostly into the BLA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Phelps1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent data suggest that amygdala and hippocampus interact reciprocally through a synchronization of network activities during both cued and contextual fear memory retrieval <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Seidenbecher1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Narayanan1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The ability of the EPN to act as a rhythm generator may allow it to modulate or contribute to these network activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Behan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, field oscillations (&#x0223c;200 Hz) have been observed in the EPN and BLA in freely behaving rats, and it was suggested that this short-scale synchronous firing of subpopulations of projection neurons may organize the precise timing of multi-modal information flow in the BLA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Ponomarenko1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In our experiments, NPS administration to the EPN resulted in a selective disruption of contextual fear memory with reduction of both freezing and risk-assessment. At the same time, auditory cued fear memory remained largely unaffected by the treatment, excluding the possibility of a general disturbance of the retrieval or expression of conditioned fear. Moreover, NPS treated animals showed unaltered risk-assessment behavior during CS&#x0002b; exposure and a normal response to neutral acoustic stimuli (CS&#x02212;), which we determined as within-task measures of anxiety-like behavior. Together with an unaltered behavior in the elevated plus maze this rules out potentially confounding effects of changes in anxiety level during the retrieval session, as previously seen upon intracerebroventricular NPS injection at the dosage used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Xu1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In turn, these data demonstrate that the circuitry delineated in our study may not be critically involved in the modulation of general anxiety through NPS, but may rather selectively modulate fear memory functions mediated by amygdalo-hippocampal interactions. The behavioral change in our experiments is likely due to a local effect of NPS through the activation of NPS receptors in the EPN, but we cannot rule out a spreading to the NPSR-endowed lateral enthorhinal cortex. Further studies will be required to precisely delineate functionally distinct NPS circuits in the brain and their activation under different fear and anxiety conditions.</p><p>In conclusion, the present work describes a novel NPS sensitive pathway, controlling neural activity patterns in the BLA via the EPN. Endogenous NPS from the locus coeruleus area or medial amygdala similarly may enhance both excitatory and inhibitory drive onto BLA, resulting in firing of a subpopulation of projection neurons. A balancing of excitatory/inhibitory influences in the amygdala has previously been described for another neuropeptide, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002695-Shumyatsky1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. However, while GRP appears to be related to its persistence, NPS appears to control the retrieval and/or expression of contextual aspects in fear memory.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Slice preparation</title><p>All experiments were carried out in accordance with the European Committees Council Directive (86/609/EEC).

Animals were purchased at an age of six-seven weeks and kept in groups of 3&#x02013;6 with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 AM) with food and water ad libitum. One week before the experiment animals were separated and further on kept individually. All experiments were done during the dark phase of the cycle, with adaptations in the morning and afternoon and with training and retrieval session always between 1:00 PM and 5:00PM. On the first day of the experiment, mice were in two 6 min sessions accustomed to the training apparatus (TSE Bad Homburg, Germany) comprising a 36 cm&#x000d7;21 cm&#x000d7;21 cm light-blue acrylic glass arena with a grid floor for delivery of electric foot shocks. The arena was enclosed in an isolation cubicle containing a speaker, a ventilation fan providing fresh air, and background noise 70 dB sound-pressure level (SPL). During each adaptation session, a set of 6 acoustic stimuli (2.5 kHz sinus tone, 85 dB SPL, 10 s with 20 s inter-stimulus-intervals) was delivered to serve as auditory control stimulus (CS&#x02212;). On the following day, after 2 min of habituation to the apparatus animals were fear conditioned with 3 conditioned stimuli (CS&#x0002b;; 10 kHz sinus tone, 85 dB SPL, 10 s with 20 s ISIs) that each co-terminated with an unconditional stimulus (US; 1 s scrambled foot shock, 0.4 mA). No CS&#x02212; was presented during training. Three days after conditioning, guide cannula (length 10 mm diameter 1 mm) were implanted at 1.8 mm AP, 2.7 mm ML (10&#x000b0; angle) and 5.1 mm DV from Bregma under pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg/kg) and fixed to the scull with dental cement. After recovery from surgery for one week, mice were injected with 0.1 nmole NPS (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;14), 0.01 nmole NPS (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12) or vehicle (saline; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12) at a volume of 0.3 &#x000b5;l per animal. 15 min after injection, general anxiety level was assessed in an elevated plus maze (arm length 60 cm large, arm width 6 cm, wall height 15 cm, elevation 40 cm) in a single 5 min session under low-light conditions (100 Lux). Exploration of open and closed arms was evaluated using a video tracking software (ANY-maze, Stoelting, Wood Dale Il). 10 min later retrieval of conditioned fear memory was investigated.
