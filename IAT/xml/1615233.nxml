It belongs to the prolyl oligopeptidase/S9 enzyme family characterized by a Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad in the C- terminal region. In humans and most mammals, the prolyl oligopeptidase gene family consists of at least: prolyl endopeptidase (PEP), acylaminoacyl peptidase (ACPH), dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) and three proteins that have close sequence homology to DPPIV (fibroblast activation protein (FAP), DPPX and DPP10) and two peptidases called DPP8 and DPP9 that have lower sequence homology with DPPIV. The enzymes in this family share highly conserved structural features and moderately conserved amino acid sequence homology (<xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-chen1" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2003</xref>). The DPPIV enzyme and its close relatives are more highly conserved in the C-terminal (an (&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; - hydrolase domain) than in the N-terminal region where the proteins form a seven-bladed propeller region (<xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-abbott4" ref-type="bibr">Abbott et al., 2000</xref> and included references). The N-terminal region has one important 7 amino acid conserved sequence in most of the family members (DW(V/L)YEEE) and the first two glutamic acid residues in this sequence have been shown to be necessary for enzyme activity (<xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-abbott3" ref-type="bibr">Abbott et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>DPPIV is a highly specific dipeptidyl aminopeptidase that is characterized by the release of an N-terminal dipeptide, Xaa-Yaa-&#x0007c;-Zaa-, from a polypeptide, preferentially when Yaa is proline, provided Zaa is neither proline nor hydroxyproline (Prosite; BRENDA). The reactivity of the enzyme is related to the amino acid in the penultimate position that can be, after proline and alanine, the following amino acids, with reactivity in this order: pro&#x0003e;ala&#x0003e;&#x0003e;&#x0003e;ser&#x0003e;gly&#x0003e;val (and sometimes thr and leu). In addition, the structure of the substrate's length and/or amino acid sequence immediately surrounding the scissile bond and in the C terminal region can also affect reactivity and/or specificity (<xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-boonacker1" ref-type="bibr">Boonacker, et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-kuhnwache1" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;hn&#x02013;wache et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-mentlein1" ref-type="bibr">Mentlein, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-ludwig1" ref-type="bibr">Ludwig et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-gault1" ref-type="bibr">Gault et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-demeester2" ref-type="bibr">De Meester et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In many organisms DPPIV is involved not only in the proteolytic cleavage of dipeptides from the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus of a variety of biologically active peptides, but also in activation of signal transduction and cell matrix adherence processes. In humans DPPIV (also known as CD26) functions to process (primarily to inactivate) several peptides, many of which are implicated in regulation of immune, inflammatory, nervous and endocrine functions (<xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-abbott3" ref-type="bibr">Abbott et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-thoma1" ref-type="bibr">Thoma et al., 2003</xref>). No obvious phenotype is associated with this enzyme in humans other than the apparent involvement in glucose regulation and changes in its expression in association with various disease conditions (<xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-boonacker1" ref-type="bibr">Boonacker, et al., 2003</xref>; OMIM). Fischer rats lacking a functional DPPIV gene have no visible phenotype, show no change in growth rate and only minor physiological effects relating to glucose tolerance (<xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-boonacker1" ref-type="bibr">Boonacker, et al., 2003</xref>). The enzyme seems to be a ubiquitous housekeeping enzyme, but one whose synthesis is regulated in some tissues (<xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-boonacker1" ref-type="bibr">Boonacker, et al., 2003</xref>)</p><p>In insects, the enzyme activity was recognized in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> when transgenic flies with the flounder antifreeze protein gene were found to process the antifreeze protein by removal of an XP dipeptide in the hemolymph.

A simplified alignment of the proteins to display the spacing between the main conserved sites, the N&#x02013;terminal S9b conserved sequence, and the Ser&#x02013;Asp&#x02013;His catalytic triad, shows considerable agreement between the mammalian and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> DPPIVs. <xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-f902" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 9b)</xref> The distance between the 7 base conserved sequence (DWVYEEE) and the beginning of the catalytic triad is very similar for the mammalian proteins and for <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster omega</named-content> and CG11034 (<xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-f901" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9a</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="i1536-2442-5-26-1-f902" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9b</xref>). The internal spacing for the Ser&#x02013;Asp&#x02013;His triad is fairly well conserved across the list, but the distance from the 7 base consensus sequence, DWVYEEE, to the triad differs notably for the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> genes CG9059, CG11319 and CG3744 and for human DPP8 &#x00026; 9.

Note that of the four other <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> proteins, only the configuration for the CG11034 is overall similar in this respect to <italic>omega</italic> and the other eukaryotic proteins.

CG3744 compared to DPPIV 8 and 9 give similarities of 31 and 32&#x00025; respectively. It is certainly possible that these differences relate to different substrate specificities. CG9059 lacks the serine residue within the consensus sequence of the serine recognition site, the highly conserved tyrosine within the hydrolase domain, and one of the conserved glutamic acids in the propeller sequence, and so presumably is not active as a DPPIV. At least one of the 3 additional <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> gene products (CG3744, CG11319 and CG11034) must have DPPIV activity as we see it as residual activity in the <italic>ome</italic><sup>1</sup> mutant.

These data are consistent with those seen in mammalian DPPIVs where the enzyme is highly glycosylated and commonly functions as a dimer. Virtual translations for the gene transcripts of CG9059 and CG3744 give dimer molecular weights too large for the mutant <italic>ome</italic><sup>1</sup> residual activity.
