The model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> evolved to an inbreeding state through the loss of self-incompatibility, a pollen-rejection system in which pollen recognition by the stigma is determined by tightly linked and co-evolving alleles of the S-locus receptor kinase (SRK) and its S-locus cysteine-rich ligand (SCR). Transformation of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, with a functional <italic>AlSRKb-SCRb</italic> gene pair from its outcrossing relative <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, demonstrated that <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions harbor different sets of cryptic self-fertility&#x02013;promoting mutations, not only in <italic>S-</italic>locus genes, but also in other loci required for self-incompatibility. However, it is still not known how many times and in what manner the switch to self-fertility occurred in the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> lineage. Here, we report on our identification of four accessions that are reverted to full self-incompatibility by transformation with <italic>AlSRKb-SCRb</italic>, bringing to five the number of accessions in which self-fertility is due to, and was likely caused by, <italic>S-</italic>locus inactivation. Analysis of <italic>S-</italic>haplotype organization reveals that inter-haplotypic recombination events, rearrangements, and deletions have restructured the <italic>S</italic> locus and its genes in these accessions. We also perform a Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis to identify modifier loci associated with self-fertility in the Col-0 reference accession, which cannot be reverted to full self-incompatibility. Our results indicate that the transition to inbreeding occurred by at least two, and possibly more, independent <italic>S-</italic>locus mutations, and identify a novel unstable modifier locus that contributes to self-fertility in Col-0.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The mating system adopted by a species has a profound influence on extent of polymorphism, population structure, and evolutionary potential. In flowering plants, the switch from outbreeding to inbreeding has occurred repeatedly, yet little is known about the underlying genetic events. This is true even for the model species <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, a highly self-fertile member of the crucifer family. In this family, outbreeding is enforced by a self-incompatibility system controlled by the <italic>S</italic> locus, which involves the recognition of pollen by the stigma to prevent self-fertilization and familial inbreeding. We recently demonstrated that <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions may be reverted to full or partial self-incompatibility by transformation with <italic>S-</italic>locus genes isolated from its close self-incompatible relative <italic>A. lyrata.</italic> Despite much recent debate, however, we still do not know how <italic>A. thaliana</italic> became self-fertile. Here, we use our recently established <italic>A. thaliana</italic> transgenic self-incompatible experimental model to address these issues. Analysis of the <italic>S</italic> locus in accessions that can be reverted to full self-incompatibility demonstrates that self-fertility in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> arose by at least two independent <italic>S-</italic>locus mutations. Furthermore, analysis of an accession that expresses only partial self-incompatibility shows that self-fertility is associated with an unstable allele at a locus unlinked to the <italic>S</italic> locus.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sexual reproduction may have evolved because it can combine different sequence variants through recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Goddard1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and because it can remove deleterious mutations linked to advantageous ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Zeyl1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Paland1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this view, mating system switches from an outbreeding to inbreeding mode may have been selected for by pollinator scarcity or population bottlenecks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Jarne1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, with inbreeding providing the benefits of reproductive assurance and increased potential for colonization, and in some cases possibly representing a survival mechanism used as a last resort to perpetuate a species. Because the outbreeding mode of mating is typically associated with the accumulation of recessive deleterious alleles that cause inbreeding depression, self-fertile taxa can only become established if this genetic load is purged. Theoretical models of the evolution of selfing have shown that inbreeding depression can indeed be overcome and selfing alleles can spread when the advantage of reproductive assurance outweighs the reduction of fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Porcher1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However, mechanistic studies of switches from outbreeding to self-fertility have rarely been performed, and the genetic basis of these switches is poorly understood.</p><p>In the crucifer (Brassicaceae) family, switches to inbreeding have occurred frequently and entailed loss of self-incompatibility (SI). Self-incompatibility is a barrier to self-fertilization that is determined by variants of a single highly polymorphic locus, called the &#x0201c;<italic>S</italic> locus&#x0201d;. In self-incompatible plants, pollen is prevented from hydrating, germinating, and producing pollen tubes at the stigma surface if the same &#x0201c;<italic>S-</italic>locus&#x0201d; variant is expressed in pollen and stigma, whether these structures are located within the same flower or derived from different flowers on the same plant or different plants (for recent review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Rea1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>). As a result, self-incompatible plants are largely but not completely self-sterile, and autonomous seed set is typically less than 5&#x00025; that set by self-compatible plants. In all self-incompatible crucifer species investigated to date, the &#x0201c;<italic>S</italic> locus&#x0201d; is not a single gene, but rather consists of two polymorphic genes, allelic forms of which together constitute a unique <italic>S-</italic>locus haplotype (hereafter <italic>S</italic> haplotype) that defines a unique recognition specificity. One gene encodes the S-locus Receptor Kinase (SRK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Stein1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and the second gene encodes the small S-locus Cysteine-Rich protein (SCR), which is the ligand for SRK. <italic>SRK</italic> is expressed in stigma epidermal cells, and its product is anchored via a single transmembrane domain in the plasma membrane of these cells. <italic>SCR</italic> is expressed in the anther tapetum, a cell layer that lines the sacs in which pollen grains develop, from which its SCR product is secreted and becomes incorporated into the outer pollen coat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Schopfer1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. SCR proteins are delivered to the stigma surface upon pollen-stigma contact, but an SCR will bind to the extracellular domain of SRK and activate its cytoplasmic kinase domain, thus triggering the SI response, only if the SRK and the SCR proteins are encoded by the same <italic>S</italic>-locus haplotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Kachroo1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Takayama1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, i.e. when stigmas are pollinated with pollen derived from the same plant or from plants expressing the same <italic>S</italic> haplotype.</p><p>In view of this <italic>S</italic> haplotype-specific interaction, recombination events that disrupt the genetic linkage of matched <italic>SRK</italic> and <italic>SCR</italic> alleles will cause loss of SI. Consequently, there is strong selection for maintaining the tight linkage of these genes. Recombinants between <italic>SRK</italic> and <italic>SCR</italic> are rare in self-incompatible plants, either because self-compatible genotypes that might arise do not persist in nature (due to their genetic load) or because recombination is actively suppressed in the <italic>S-</italic>locus region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Boyes1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Kamau1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Firstly, we transformed several <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions with the <italic>AlSRKb-SCRb</italic> genes in an attempt to identify accessions like C24, which express a robust and developmentally-stable SI response, and would therefore harbor mutations at the <italic>S</italic> locus but not at SI modifier loci. We reasoned that only in such accessions might it be possible to determine if the transition from outbreeding to inbreeding in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> occurred by a single mutational event or by multiple independent events. Secondly, we performed a Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis of SI modifier loci that differentiate <italic>AlSRKb-SCRb</italic> transformants of the reference Columbia (Col-0) accession, which express transient SI, from those of the C24 accession.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Accessions That Express a Developmentally Stable Transgenic SI Response</title><p>To identify additional <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions, which, like C24, might express a robust and developmentally-stable SI phenotype, we transformed several previously-untested accessions with <italic>AlSRKb-SCRb.</italic> In selecting accessions for transformation, we excluded accessions that carry the <italic>&#x003a8;S<sc>A</sc></italic> haplotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-ShermanBroyles1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> and its closely-linked <italic>PUB8</italic> allele previously associated with transient SI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Liu1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, because <italic>AlSRKb-SCRb</italic> transformants of these accessions are not expected to express stable SI.

Individual plants were classified into four phenotypic groups based on autonomous seed set: plants producing empty fruits with only an occasional fruit containing seed, similar to the C24::<italic>AlSRKb-SCRb</italic> parent (1 in 80 fruits measured); plants with a full seed set similar to wild-type untransformed plants; plants producing few fruits with seed (1&#x02013;3 for every 10 fruits measured); and plants producing many fruit with seed (4&#x02013;8 for every 10 fruits counted). Subsequent manual self-pollination of these plants determined that the number of pollen tubes formed at the stigma surface was consistent with fruit set. Plants in the empty-fruit group exhibited the SI response in all self-pollination assays, while plants with full fruit set exhibited a self-compatible pollination phenotype similar to untransformed plants. Plants that produced few or many fruits with seed exhibited variable pollination phenotypes, in which breakdown of SI occurred in an apparently random fashion in individual flowers, and these plants are classified as being partially self-compatible. In addition, loss of SI was stigma specific as determined by reciprocal pollinations of self-compatible plants with the C24::<italic>AlSRKb-SCRb</italic> parent. The results of a chi-squared test based on the proportions of the phenotypic categories were consistent with segregation of two loci with dominance of SI-conferring alleles (X<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3.38; p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.3). A scan of the genome with molecular markers distributed on all five chromosomes confirmed the presence of a Col-0-derived modifier locus with strong effect located on chromosome 4 near the <italic>&#x003a8;S</italic> locus, which corresponds to the previously-identified <italic>S-</italic>locus-linked modifier on chromosome 4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Liu1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. It also determined that a second Col-0-derived modifier locus responsible for partial self-compatibility was located on the bottom of chromosome 3.</p><p>The strong-effect <italic>S</italic>&#x02013;locus-linked modifier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Liu1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> can mask the effects of weak-effect modifiers. Therefore, to ensure detection of weak-effect loci, a QTL mapping population was generated that subtracted the genetic effects of this major modifier (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). This population segregated for self-fertility, as expected. Manual self-pollination of a developing series of stigmas from two representative self-compatible plants revealed weakening of SI and some pollen tube growth in the most mature flowers. In contrast, self-pollination of a developing series of stigmas from two representative self-incompatible plants detected no pollen tubes in mature stigmas. Furthermore, reciprocal pollinations of self-compatible plants with C24::<italic>AlSRKb-SCRb</italic> transformants confirmed that the modifier alleles segregating in this population have stigma-specific effects as in the original C24::<italic>AlSRKb-SCRb</italic> x Col-0 cross. However, the self-compatible trait exhibited low penetrance in this population. On any given self-compatible plant, some flowers would not develop fruits with seeds, due to the SI response, while other flowers would develop into fruits filled with seeds. There was also great variability as to where on the stem SI would break down, the number of flowers that exhibited breakdown of SI, and the strength of the breakdown for each individual flower.</p><p>In view of this variability, manual self-pollinations of a small number of randomly-selected individual flowers, as is usually done in pollination assays, cannot reflect overall plant phenotype. Consequently, standard pollination assays are not useful for phenotypic classification of plants in the QTL mapping population. Therefore, we used the size of mature fruit produced by autonomous self-pollination as a measure of the extent of SI breakdown in individual flowers. We reasoned that fruit size was a valid proxy for pollination phenotype because of the known strong correlations between fruit size and number of seeds per fruit (as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-AlonsoBlanco1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and confirmed in our study), and between number of seed in a fruit and strength of SI (as observed in our F2 population).</p><p>QTL analysis was performed using a total of 186 individuals (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). For phenotypic classification, it was important to distinguish between empty fruits and fruits with few seeds. Based on dissection of 25 of the smallest fruits in this population, it was determined that a mature fruit containing at least one seed had a width of at least 0.6 mm. Therefore, fruits that were narrower than 0.6 mm were classified as being empty and indicative of a self-incompatible response, while fruits that had a width of 0.6 mm or greater were classified as containing seed and indicative of a breakdown of SI. Similar measurements of mature fruit produced by self-incompatible plants in the QTL mapping population gave an average fruit length of 0.42 cm&#x000b1;0.05 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;912, with only one fruit in 25 having a width of 0.6 mm), a value very similar to that of the C24::<italic>AlSRKb-SCRb</italic> parental strain, in which average mature fruit length was 0.48 cm&#x000b1;0.07 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;80, with only one fruit having a width of 0.6 mm). By comparison, the average length of seed-filled mature fruit in the self-compatible parent of the QTL population was 1.33 cm&#x000b1;0.4 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;59), while average fruit lengths in untransformed plants of the C24 and Col-0 accessions were 1.54 cm&#x000b1;0.19 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;80) and 1.38 cm&#x000b1;0.07 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;80), respectively.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000426-g004">Figure 4</xref>, the trait value distribution for the mapping population was continuous and approximately normal, suggesting the involvement of several genes in the control of fruit length.

This NIL, NIL3.2, incorporates QTL3.2 and likely corresponds to the chromosome-3 modifier that was associated with partial self-compatibility in the original C24::<italic>AlSRKb-SCRb</italic> x Col-0 F2 population. Epistasis between QTL1, QTL3.1, and QTL5 was assessed by crossing the corresponding NILs to generate &#x0201c;double NILs&#x0201d;. However, none of the &#x0201c;double NILs&#x0201d; showed a breakdown of SI based on observations of seed set. A possible explanation for this result is that these QTL do contribute to breakdown of SI, but their effect may only be detected when all three are combined with QTL3.2. Another possibility is that QTL1, QTL3.1, and QTL5 control SI-independent variation in fruit length. Although the SI response exerts the major influence on seed number and consequently on fruit size in the populations we analyzed, modifier loci affecting differences in fruit size and seed number per fruit between wild-type Col-0 and C24 may also be segregating, similar to the loci uncovered in a previous analysis of natural variation for various fruit parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-AlonsoBlanco1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

This population segregated for the 1-megabase Col-0 introgression encompassing QTL3.2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000426-t003">Table 3</xref>). F2 plants exhibiting recombination within the QTL3.2 region were identified by screening 2,016 individual plants, both phenotypically for seed set and genotypically with markers &#x0201c;NGA12&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;intron2&#x0201d; located just inside the introgressed region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000426.s002">Table S1</xref>). Three phenotypic groups were observed among recombinant plants: self-incompatible, self-compatible, and surprisingly, partially self-compatible. The occurrence of partially self-compatible plants in the recombinant pool was not expected because the gene underlying QTL3.2 was determined to be recessive in the Col-0 background. Also unexpectedly, these recombinants did not show a tight correlation between genotype and phenotype under the assumption of complete dominance of the SI-conferring C24 allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000426.s003">Table S2</xref>). Nevertheless, F3 families were generated from self-compatible NIL3.2 F2 plants. Analysis of nine such NIL3.2 F3 families failed to identify self-compatible plants in six of those families, indicating that the self-compatibility phenotype can be completely erased from one generation to the next (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000426.s003">Table S2</xref>). In view of this result, the genotype-to-phenotype correlations inferred for the self-incompatible class of NIL3.2 F2 plants become questionable. Nevertheless, with this caveat in mind and considering only the unambiguous self-compatible NIL3.2 F2 plants, QTL3.2 is tentatively mapped to a region of approximately 105,000 base pairs between genes At3g60440 and At3g60730 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000426.s003">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000426.s004">Table S3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results have extended our understanding of the genetic events at the <italic>S</italic> locus and at modifier loci that accompanied the switch to self-fertility in <italic>A. thaliana.</italic></p><p>The identification of four accessions, in addition to C24, in which self-fertility may be clearly attributed to a non-functional <italic>S</italic> locus is significant for several reasons. From a practical point of view, the availability of several strains with diverged genetic backgrounds that do not contribute SI modifier alleles in crosses to laboratory-generated mutants will greatly facilitate the mapping of these mutants and the eventual cloning of genes required for SI. From an evolutionary perspective, the finding demonstrates that rather than being unique, the C24 accession is only one of potentially many accessions whose self-fertile phenotype may be fully reverted to SI by transformation with the <italic>AlSRKb-SCRb</italic> genes. Interestingly, these accessions are not confined to one geographical region: C24 is a southern-European accession originally isolated in Portugal, whereas Kas-2, Hodja, and Sha are all central Asian accessions from Kashmir (Kas-2) or Tajikistan (Hodja and Sha), and Cvi-0 is restricted to the Cape Verdi Islands.

A major difficulty in charting the history of the <italic>A. thaliana S</italic> locus is distinguishing a primary inactivating mutation from subsequent decay of the non-functional haplotype by further mutation, sequence loss, and rearrangement.

Using the <italic>S-</italic>locus flanking markers <italic>PUB8</italic> (At4g21350) and <italic>ARK3</italic> (At4g21380), which are separated by 34 kilobases in RLD, only 1 recombinant was recovered, and this recombinant was produced by a cross-over event within the promoter region of <italic>PUB8,</italic> not within the <italic>S</italic> locus proper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Liu1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the likelihood of further <italic>S-</italic>locus restructuring by recombination between structurally-diverged <italic>&#x003a8;S</italic> haplotypes is low, despite relaxed selection on the locus.</p><p>The acquisition of a robust and developmentally-stable SI response by accessions that harbor independently-derived <italic>&#x003a8;S</italic> haplotypes provides the strongest evidence to date that <italic>A. thaliana</italic> evolved from an obligate out-crosser to a predominantly selfing species through multiple <italic>S</italic>-locus inactivating mutations in distinct outbreeding individuals. One interpretation of our data is that self-fertility in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> arose at least twice: once in an <italic>S<sc>A</sc></italic> or <italic>S<sc>C</sc></italic> haplotype (producing the Hodja/Sha, C24, and Kas-2 <italic>&#x003a8;S</italic> haplotypes) and once in an <italic>S<sc>B</sc></italic> haplotype (producing the Cvi-0 <italic>&#x003a8;S<sc>B</sc></italic> haplotype). A less conservative interpretation would invoke three origins of self-fertility if the C24 and Kas-2 <italic>S</italic> haplotypes are assumed to have arisen independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000426-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>When and how frequently mutations at SI modifier loci occurred in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> must await the molecular cloning of these loci. At least one such SI modifier was uncovered in our QTL analysis of differences in expression of SI between <italic>AlSRKb-SCRb</italic> transformants of the C24 and Col-0 accessions. This previously-unidentified recessive modifier, defined by QTL3.2, was associated with self-fertility in Col-0 and was mapped to chromosome 3. However, phenotypic instability, low heritability, and erasure of the self-compatibility trait in advanced mapping populations precluded further fine mapping and isolation of the underlying gene(s). The cause of this instability is not known. One intriguing possibility is that it might reflect an epigenetic component in control of the self-compatibility trait in these populations. Indeed, phenotypic instability is a hallmark of epigenetically-controlled traits in various organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Madlung1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-DeSepulveda1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.

Similar to other epialleles that display unpredictable patterns of instability, the instability of QTL3.2 might be due to the loss of an unlinked <italic>trans-</italic>acting &#x0201c;maintainer&#x0201d; locus through segregation in NIL populations.</p><p>In any case, our identification of an unstable modifier of SI has relevance for theoretical modeling and mechanistic studies of switches to self-fertility in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and other plant species. Clearly, approaches more suited to the identification of unstable alleles than traditional QTL analysis and association mapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Johannes1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> will be required to clone at least some of the genes associated with self-fertility. Future molecular genetic analysis of polymorphisms at SI modifier loci, as well as investigation of <italic>S-</italic>locus structure in additional accessions that might express developmentally-stable SI upon transformation with the <italic>AlSRKb-SCRb</italic> genes, will undoubtedly determine if switches to self-fertility occurred exclusively by inactivation of the <italic>S</italic> locus in the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> lineage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant Growth Conditions and Transformations</title><p><italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants were typically grown at 22&#x000b0;C and a photoperiod of 16 hours.

Two hours after pollination, flowers were fixed for 10 minutes in a 3&#x02236;1 mixture of ethanol and acetic acid at 65&#x000b0;C, softened for 10 minutes in 1N NaOH at 65&#x000b0;C, washed two times in water, stained in decolorized aniline blue, and transferred to a slide for observation by epifluorescence microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000426-Kho1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.

This method is more suitable than amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for our study because of the known or expected sequence divergence of the loci under study. Indeed, previous applications of this method to analysis of <italic>S-</italic>locus polymorphisms in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> have demonstrated that it can identify homologous sequences that are missed by PCR (27). Under low-stringency hybridization and washing conditions, DNA gel blot analysis can detect sequences that share as little as 50&#x00025; overall similarity with the probe but not small stretches of sequence similarity or sequences that have decayed to below the 50&#x00025; sequence similarity threshold.

A breakdown or absence of SI allows self pollen to fertilize the ovules, resulting in fruit expansion and elongation. Consequently, for QTL analysis, fruit size was used as a proxy for self-pollination phenotype. Data used to calculate the phenotype values for individual plants were collected by sampling three inflorescence stems, scanning them using a flat-bed scanner, and measuring the length and width of each fruit using ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). An average of 80 fruits were scanned and measured for each plant, and on average across the population, one-fourth of those fruits contained seeds and were used in the average length calculation. Each of these fruits was the result of autonomous self-pollination, because they were grown in the absence of pollinators. A flower was deemed self-compatible, if the fruit width was greater than 0.6 mm, i.e. the minimal width of one fully-developed seed. Because of variability in fruit development, the trait values reported here were calculated for each plant as the average length of fruits with at least one seed.</p><p>The QTL mapping population was generated using a self-fertile F4 plant derived from the C24::<italic>AlSRKb-SCRb</italic> x Col-0 cross, which was homozygous for the <italic>PUB8<sup>C24</sup></italic> allele and for the Col-0 allele at the chromosome-3 modifier. The F2 parent of the selected F4 plant displayed a transient SI phenotype as determined by seed set and pollination assays (&#x0003c;5 pollen tubes/stigma in young buds and &#x0003e;50 pollen tubes/stigma in older buds and flowers). The F4 plant also produced abundant seed, although some flowers remained self-incompatible throughout development and did not produce seeds. It was homozygous over most of its genome, with Col-0-derived DNA occurring in large stretches on chromosomes 1, 3, and 5, and in a small region on chromosome 4. This plant was back-crossed to C24, producing F4BC progenies that were self-incompatible, similar to the original C24::<italic>AlSRKb-SCRb</italic> x Col-0 F1 hybrid. The F4BC was subjected to forced selfing in immature floral buds (i.e. before stigmas acquire the ability to reject self pollen) to generate an F4BCF2 population for QTL analysis, which we refer to as the QTL mapping population.</p><p>Since the C24 accession was not completely sequenced when this study was undertaken, a search for markers that showed co-dominant polymorphisms between C24 and Col-0 was done by PCR screening of publicly available microsattelite markers designed for other pairs of accessions and of random amplification of repetitive elements found in the Col-0 genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org">www.arabidopsis.org</ext-link>).

Twenty-four marker loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000426.s002">Table S1</xref>) were found to be polymorphic between the two accessions and were scored on 186 individuals in the QTL mapping population.
