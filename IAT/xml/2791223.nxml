HIV-1 Nef-induced down-regulation involves endosomal trafficking and a cooperative interaction between the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of MHC-I, Nef, and the clathrin adaptor protein complex-1 (AP-1). The CD of MHC-I contains a key tyrosine within the sequence YSQA that is required for down-regulation by Nef, but this sequence does not conform to the canonical AP-binding tyrosine-based motif Yxx&#x003c6;, which mediates binding to the medium (&#x003bc;) subunits of AP complexes. We previously proposed that Nef allows the MHC-I CD to bind the &#x003bc; subunit of AP-1 (&#x003bc;1) as if it contained a Yxx&#x003c6;motif.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Here, we show that a direct interaction between the MHC-I CD/Nef and &#x003bc;1 plays a primary role in the down-regulation of MHC-I: GST pulldown assays using recombinant proteins indicated that most of the MHC-I CD and Nef residues that are required for the down-regulation in human cells contribute to direct interactions with a truncated version of &#x003bc;1. Specifically, the tyrosine residue of the YSQA sequence in the MHC-I CD as well as Nef residues E62-65 and P78 each contributed to the interaction between MHC-I CD/Nef and &#x003bc;1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, whereas Nef M20 had little to no role. Conversely, residues F172/D174 and V392/L395 of the binding pocket on &#x003bc;1 for Yxx&#x003c6; motifs were required for a robust interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data indicate that the MHC-I cytoplasmic domain, Nef, and the C-terminal two thirds of the &#x003bc; subunit of AP-1 are sufficient to constitute a biologically relevant interaction.

Nef contributes to high levels of replication and the pathogenesis of primate lentiviruses such as HIV-1 and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus. Nef is expressed in abundance early during the viral replication cycle, and it down-regulates major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) glycoproteins from the surface of infected cells. Nef has several functions in addition to the down-regulation of MHC-I molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Collins1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, such as the removal of CD4 from the surface of infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Benson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Garcia1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The Nef-mediated down-regulation of MHC-I and CD4 is dependent on specific sequences in the cytoplasmic domains of these target proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Aiken1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-LeGall1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of MHC-I, Nef induces not only internalization from the plasma membrane but also the retention and degradation of MHC-I within the endo-lysosomal system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Schaefer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Nef also affects signaling through the T-cell receptor CD3 in T-lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Baur1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. To perform these functions, Nef associates with the plasma membrane and various endosomal membranes via N-terminal myristoylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Kaminchik1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Membrane trafficking within the endosomal system is mediated in part by vesicles coated with adaptor protein (AP) complexes. The AP family consists of four members: adaptor protein complex-1 (AP-1), adaptor protein complex-2 (AP-2), adaptor protein complex-3 (AP-3), and adaptor protein complex-4 (AP-4). AP-1 and AP-2 (as well as AP-3 and AP-4) are heterotetramers. AP-1 contains the four subunits &#x003b3;, &#x003b2;1, &#x003bc;1, &#x003c3;1, whereas AP-2 contains &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;2, &#x003bc;2, &#x003c3;2. These complexes localize to different membranes: AP-1 is found on the membranes of the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes, whereas AP-2 is found on the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-RobinsonM1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The AP complexes recruit scaffolding proteins, such as clathrin, as well as cargo proteins, including transmembrane receptors and proteins that are resident throughout the endosomal system.</p><p>AP-1 is a key cellular protein complex through which Nef mediates the down-regulation of MHC-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Roeth1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Two distinct binding sites are present on the AP-1 complex for target proteins: a site on the &#x0201c;hemi-complex&#x0201d; formed by the &#x003b3; and &#x003c3; subunits that binds to dileucine-based signals which conform to the sequence E/DxxxL&#x003c6;, and a site on the &#x003bc;1 subunit that binds to tyrosine-based signals which conform to the sequence Yxx&#x003c6;, where &#x003c6; represents a bulky hydrophobic residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Owen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Kelly1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The molecular basis for the binding of tyrosine-based and dileucine-based motifs to AP complexes has been explained by X-ray crystal structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Owen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Kelly1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The crystal structure of the AP-2 &#x003bc; subunit in complex with the peptide FYRALM reveals a &#x0201c;two prong in socket&#x0201d; mechanism, in which one prong is the tyrosine residue of the Yxx&#x003c6; sequence and the other prong is the hydrophobic residue at the Y&#x0002b;3 position <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Owen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, the crystal structure of the AP-2 complex with a peptide from CD4 containing a dileucine-based motif revealed the basis for this interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Kelly1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Biochemical analyses further revealed a cooperative interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of CD4, Nef, and the &#x003c3;2/&#x003b1; hemicomplex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Chaudhuri1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>MHC-I, Nef and AP-1 appear to participate in a cooperative interaction in which the MHC-I molecule and Nef together form a novel ligand for AP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Noviello1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The molecular basis of this interaction is poorly understood: the minimal components are not defined, and its structural basis is unknown. Notably, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of MHC-I contains a key tyrosine within the sequence YSQA that is required for down-regulation by Nef. However, this sequence does not conform to the canonical AP-binding tyrosine-based motif Yxx&#x003c6;.</p><p>To identify the minimal components sufficient for the interaction between the MHC-I CD, Nef, and AP-1, the relevant proteins were expressed recombinantly in <italic>E. coli</italic>, purified, and used for GST pull down assays. In our experimental design, we used a chimeric protein in which full-length Nef was fused to the C-terminus of the cytoplasmic domain of MHC-I (MHC-I CD-Nef). We also used two N-terminal truncation proteins of &#x003bc;1: &#x003bc;121 (residues 121&#x02013;423) and &#x003bc;158 (residues 158&#x02013;423). We used truncated forms of &#x003bc;1 in our experiments, because of their better expression and solubility than the full length &#x003bc;1 (residues 1&#x02013;423)<bold>.</bold> GST pull down assays demonstrated the formation of a complex between MHC-I CD-Nef and &#x003bc;121 or &#x003bc;158. Furthermore, the tyrosine within the MHC-I cytoplasmic sequence YSQA and key residues within Nef that are important for the down-regulation of MHC-I were required for this interaction. Finally, residues F172, D174, V392 and L395, which line the tyrosine motif-binding pocket in &#x003bc;1, were also required. These data indicate that a direct interaction with &#x003bc;1 explains most of the previously defined genetic determinants for the down-regulation of MHC-I by Nef. The data also suggest that a currently unidentified residue within either Nef or the MHC-I CD binds a hydrophobic pocket on &#x003bc;1.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Antibodies and Reagents</title><p>Ni-resin was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and GSTrap columns were purchased from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ).

To test this, we constructed chimeras in which the MHC-I CD-Nef sequence was fused to the C-terminus of the lumenal and transmembrane domains of CD8. In these constructs, the MHC-I CD-Nef sequence is the cytoplasmic domain of a transmembrane protein that can be detected at the cell surface with an antibody to CD8. We expressed these chimeric proteins in T cells of the CEM line by transient transfection, and then measured their expression at the cell surface using flow cytometry &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008364-g003">Figure 3</xref> A, which shows the relative cell number vs. CD8 staining intensity (phycoerythrin) for the mid to low intensity GFP-positive (transfected) cells&#x0005d;. The mean phycoerythrin fluorescence intensities (CD8 surface levels) of the GFP-positive populations indicate that the chimeric MHC-I CD-NefLL/AA sequence decreased the expression at the cell surface by nearly 5-fold relative to the MHC-I CD alone, whereas the NefLL/AA sequence alone decreased the expression at the cell surface by only 3-fold. These date indicate that in the context of the Nef LL164/165AA mutation, which does not affect MHC-I down-regulation under native conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Riggs1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, the fusion of the MHC-I CD to Nef generates a chimeric protein sequence that is recognized in T cells by the endosomal sorting machinery. Furthermore, when we used the CD8-CD (Y320A)-Nef LL/AA chimera, we observed an almost three-fold increase in the expression at the cell surface relative to the CD8-CD-Nef LL/AA chimera in which Y320 is intact. This result validated the role of Y320 in the cytoplasmic tail of MHC-I in the down-regulation of the MHC-I CD-Nef chimera from the cell surface and substantiated its recognition by the endosomal sorting machinery. The total cellular expression of the chimeric proteins containing Nef was checked by western blot using an anti-Nef antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008364-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

Alternatively, Nef M20 could have a role distinct from participation in the ternary interaction of MHC-I, Nef, and AP-1; for example, it could be involved in the trafficking of Nef within the cell. In contrast to M20, Nef residues E62-65 and P78 each contributed substantially to the interaction with &#x003bc;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008364-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>As previously proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008364-Noviello1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, the acidic cluster E62-65 of Nef could participate by binding to a basic patch on the &#x003bc; subunit; &#x003bc;1 is predicted to be a highly basic protein and its C-terminal two-thirds contains numerous positive charge clusters that could interact electrostatically with the Nef acidic cluster.

To validate the relevance of this binding, we tested residues in both the MHC-I CD and Nef that are of known importance for down-regulation in human cells. The tyrosine residue of the YSQA sequence in the MHC-I CD as well as Nef residues E62-65 and P78 each contributed to the interaction, whereas Nef M20 had little to no role. Residues that line the binding pocket on &#x003bc;1 for Yxx&#x003c6; motifs, specifically F172 and D174 that form an acceptor site for the tyrosine residue, and V392 and L395 that form an acceptor site for the Y&#x0002b;3 hydrophobic residue, were also required for this interaction. These data indicate that the MHC-I cytoplasmic domain, Nef and the C-terminal two thirds of the &#x003bc; subunit of AP-1 are sufficient to constitute a biologically relevant interaction. The data also suggest that the hydrophobic pocket on &#x003bc;1, which typically accommodates the Y&#x0002b;3 residue of Yxx&#x003c6; motifs, recognizes the MHC-I CD/Nef complex by an as yet undetermined mechanism.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Juan Bonifacino for the plasmid encoding &#x003bc;1.
