The archaeal RNA polymerase terminated with high efficiency at the first terminator at 90&#x000b0;C when it contained five to six T residues, at 80&#x000b0;C readthrough was significantly increased. A putative hairpin structure upstream of the first terminator had no effect on termination efficiency. Template competition experiments starting with RNA polymerase molecules engaged in ternary complexes revealed recycling of RNA polymerase from the terminator to the promoter of the same template. This facilitated reinitiation was dependent upon the presence of a terminator sequence suggesting that pausing at the terminator is required for recycling as in the RNA polymerase III system. Replacement of the sequences immediately downstream of the oligo-dT terminator by an AT-rich segment improved termination efficiency. Both AT-rich and GC-rich downstream sequences seemed to impair the facilitated reinitiation pathway. Our data suggest that recycling is dependent on a subtle interplay of pausing of RNA polymerase at the terminator and RNA polymerase translocation beyond the oligo-dT termination signal that is dramatically affected by downstream sequences.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The mechanism of initiation of transcription in archaea is RNA polymerase II (pol II)-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bell and Jackson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Geiduschek and Ouhammouch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Thomm, 2007</xref>) and is dependent upon the general transcription factors TATA-binding protein (TBP) and transcription factor B (TFB), both related in structure and function to eukaryotic TBP and transcription factor IIB (TFIIB). Recent evidence suggests that a third factor, TFE that is homologous to the N-terminal part of the &#x003b1; subunit of TFIIE plays in addition a pivotal role in initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bell <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Hanzelka <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Werner and Weinzierl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Naji <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) and also in elongation by stabilizing the open complex and transcription bubble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gr&#x000fc;nberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Archaeal transcriptional terminators were early described to contain oligo-T stretches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Reiter <italic>et al</italic>., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Brown <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Thomm <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>) that are also recognized by RNA pol III as terminator signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Geiduschek and Kassavetis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Gunnery <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Braglia <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), and a detailed study using a single-round <italic>in vitro</italic> system from a thermophilic archaeon has shown that these oligo-dT sequences without preceding RNA hairpin structures are sufficient to direct termination by an archaeal RNA polymerase (RNAP) <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Santangelo and Reeve, 2006</xref>). Unlike in pol I and pol II transcripts, the 3&#x02032; ends of pol III and of archaeal transcripts are generated by transcriptional termination. Thus, both the sequences of terminators and the general mechanism of archaeal transcription termination seem to be pol III-like. However, the finding that rho-independent bacterial terminators and the bacterial rho-factor can mediate termination of transcription in an archaeal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Santangelo and Reeve, 2006</xref>) show also some superficial similarities of archaeal termination to termination in the bacterial system.</p><p>With one exception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Thomm <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>), the complete transcription cycle involving initiation elongation and termination on an intact and complete archaeal gene has not yet been studied. Such an investigation is likely to lead to important insights, because the mechanism of transcription reinitiation involving direct recycling of RNAP from terminator to promoter represents an important aspect of gene regulation in particular in the pol III, but also in other transcription systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Dieci and Sentenac, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2003</xref>). Furthermore, the sequences immediately downstream of terminator sequences have been shown to be involved in pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Palangat <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), which is a precursor of transcriptional arrest and termination, and the effects of downstream sequences on termination and recycling of RNAP have not yet been studied in the archaeal system.</p><p>Using a complete gene encoding an archaeal histone as template, we demonstrate in a hyperthermophilic system that reinitiation has been established as regulatory mechanisms in the archaeal transcriptional machinery which is thought to be the evolutionary precursor of the eukaryotic system. In addition, we show that GC-rich sequences downstream of the terminator inhibit recycling of RNAP from the terminator to promoter, and are therefore likely to reduce the levels of gene expression at high temperatures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Transcriptional termination at 90&#x000b0;C</title><p>The histone gene <italic>hpyA1</italic> from <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> was chosen for termination experiments, because it shows four consecutive oligo-dT sequences (T1 to T4) directly following the open reading frame (ORF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>) suspected to act as termination sites. The little information available on archaeal termination suggests that mechanisms that are more closely related to pol III than to bacterial RNAP. But still, archaeal termination is poorly little understood, especially in hyperthermophilic archaea. To investigate the termination events in hyperthermophilic archaea, the histone-encoding gene <italic>hpyA1</italic> was amplified from <italic>P. furiosus</italic> genomic DNA and cloned into a plasmid vector. It shows a high transcription rate in <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). It is a short protein encoding gene which can easily be transcribed completely in multiple round <italic>in vitro</italic> assays from the start point to the termination sites. Incubation of this template in linearized state at 80&#x000b0;C led to readthrough events at every termination site resulting in a predominant run-off transcript (358 b). In contrast, when incubated at 90&#x000b0;C, a temperature more close to the growth optimum of <italic>P. furiosus</italic>, the first terminator was recognized very efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>), leading to a predominant transcript of 250 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;6). When truncated, linearized templates (not containing a terminator) were used in <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments; template activity at 90&#x000b0;C was significantly lower [for <italic>hpyA1</italic> see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>, right panel; for a comparison of the template activity of <italic>Pyrococcus glutamate deydrogenase</italic> (<italic>gdh</italic>) promoter at 80 and 90&#x000b0;C, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>, left panel].

The rate of termination efficiency at 90&#x000b0;C was determined by the amount of readthrough transcripts terminated at the first back-up terminator (T2). With five or more T residues, more than 80% of the transcription products were terminated at T1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B,</xref> lanes 1 and 2). The mutations that leave four or less T residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;5) resulted in strongly decreased termination efficiency. The efficiency of duration of the pause at the T tract is partly determined by the availability of uridine triphosphate (UTP) in the reaction. By increasing the UTP concentration, a slight decrease of termination efficiency at all terminators can be observed, but still T1 acts as main termination site (data not shown).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The minimal termination signal is T<sub>5</sub>.</p><p>A.

For several pol III-transcribed genes, a palindromic sequence immediately upstream of the termination site has been described. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bogenhagen and Brown (1981)</xref> could show that these sequence elements have no influence on termination efficiency of the 5S RNA gene. In contrast, in another study it has been shown that dyad symmetry elements preceding the terminator stimulate pol III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chu <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). In a thermophilic <italic>Methanothermobacter</italic>-derived archaeal transcription system, the presence of a sequence being capable of stem-loop formation was shown to contribute to termination efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Santangelo and Reeve, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>hpyA1</italic> gene shows a palindromic sequence within the ORF located 6 nt upstream of the T stretch representing T1. It is unlikely that this stem loop consisting of a stem of 5 bp is stable in purified RNA at temperatures between 60&#x000b0;C and 90&#x000b0;C, but a RNA secondary structure might be formed in transcribing ternary complexes. For example, the phage &#x003bb; tR2 terminator has been shown to work in a <italic>Thermus aquaticus</italic> system at 65&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Naryshkina <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). To investigate the potential contribution of the palindromic sequence in the <italic>hypA</italic>1 gene to termination, we introduced single-point mutations that eliminated the dyad symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>; template <italic>mut_hairpin</italic>). At 90&#x000b0;C, the major 250 nt RNA product from the <italic>mut_hairpin</italic> template was somewhat weaker than the transcript from the wild-type (WT) template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>, lanes 7 and 8). This result would be consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chu <italic>et al</italic>. (1997)</xref>, but may as well be an effect caused by the pausing of RNAP at the <italic>mut_hairpin</italic> template upstream of the first termination site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>, lane 8 see arrows). The high-temperature conditions under which the transcription assays were performed in this study (80&#x02013;90&#x000b0;C) are likely to destabilize RNA secondary structures. Therefore, the temperature dependence of transcription from the WT and mutated template <italic>mut_hairpin</italic> was analysed also at temperatures ranging from 60&#x000b0;C to 80&#x000b0;C (60&#x000b0;C is the lowest incubation temperature allowing RNA synthesis in the <italic>P. furiosus</italic> system; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Naji <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). At 60&#x000b0;C, an evaluation of termination efficiency is difficult because of the low amounts of transcript obtained after an incubation time of 10 min at this temperature. No effect of the <italic>mut_hairpin</italic> mutation could be observed on the transcription efficiency at 70&#x000b0;C and 80&#x000b0;C. Therefore, we conclude that the palindromic sequence preceding the T tract seems to be no general requirement for archaeal transcription termination at the <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> histone gene <italic>A</italic>.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>A putative hairpin structure has no effect on termination.

To investigate whether the archaeal RNAP is recycled from the terminator to the promoter, competition experiments between two templates were performed. Both templates contained the <italic>hpyA1</italic> promoter and a C-minus cassette ranging from position +1 to +25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>). This construct allows stalling of RNAP at +25 by conducting transcription assays in the absence of cytidine triphosphate (CTP). Promoter-bound transcription factors can be removed by washing stalled complexes with N-lauroylsarcosine (NLS) and by purification of the immobilized ternary complexes which, in contrast to promoter-bound initiation factors, are insensitive to NLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Spitalny and Thomm, 2003</xref>). The second template used as competitor in the experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4C</xref> is a truncated version that did not contain a terminator (template 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>) and produced a run-off transcript of 237 nt (13 nt shorter than the RNA terminated at T1). For analysis of single-round transcription, purified stalled complexes (step 2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>) were chased by a full set of NTPs, but in the absence of additional TBP/TFB. Having the same promoter sequences, both templates were transcribed with similar efficiency at 80&#x000b0;C in single-round transcription reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref>, SR). To analyse multiple rounds of transcription, stalled RNAPs were washed with transcription buffer not containing NLS, leaving TBP and TFB bound to the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Spitalny and Thomm, 2003</xref>). As no free RNAP is present in these assays, newly initiated transcripts can be only formed under these conditions by RNAP molecules released from the terminator or end of the template or recycled from the terminator or the end of the DNA fragment to the promoter. Analysis of transcripts synthesized in multiple-round assays revealed that the ratio multiple-round to single-round transcripts was 3.1 for template 1 and 2.6 for template 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Competition experiments reveal template commitment of an archaeal RNAP.</p><p>A The <italic>hpyA1-C25</italic> containing the termination region (template 1) was incubated in transcription reaction without CTP to obtain stable transcription complexes stalled at position +25 (1).

The numbers are corrected for the varying amount of incorporated radioactivity for each transcription product which depends upon the occurrence of uridine monophosphate (UMP) in the transcript. As expected, the T1 signal decreased while the run-off signal increased with time, indicating a slow readthrough the termination signals at 80&#x000b0;C. Thus, the oligo&#x02013;dT tracts lead either to termination or to a slow elongation through the terminator region.</p><p>The competition experiments were first performed at 80&#x000b0;C as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>. Initially, transcribing polymerases were isolated while stalled at position +25. The promoter-bound transcription factors were removed by washing with 0.5% NLS (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Spitalny and Thomm, 2003</xref>). For the following elongation by RNAPs purified in ternary complexes, multiple rounds of transcription were allowed by adding a full set of NTPs and new transcription factors simultaneously with the alternative template 2. Thus, the starting conditions were the same for both competing templates. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4D</xref> left panel shows the results of the competition experiments performed with template 2 as competitor DNA. Even after 15 min, when more than 80% of the transcripts formed were released and RNAP molecules were free to choose a new initiation site on both templates (inferred from the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4C</xref>), only about 10% of the total RNAs were transcribed from template 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4D</xref> lane 3 and corresponding diagram below; the values were corrected for the varying amounts of UMP incorporated into the RNA products of different length). When RNAP ternary complexes were first formed on template 2 and template 1 was added as competitor, a ratio of transcripts from either template of almost 50:50 was observed already after 10 min. The finding that pre-incubation with the template lacking the terminator leads to an equal distribution of transcripts from both templates excludes the possibility that the effect is being caused by the proximity of terminator and promoter of the same DNA molecule. Our results show a clear preference for the initially transcribed template in subsequent cycles of transcription in a terminator-dependent manner, and this can be best explained by recycling of the RNAP from terminator to promoter.</p><p>To further investigate this, a template competition experiment was also performed at 90&#x000b0;C, using the terminator-less template 3 that showed higher stability at 90&#x000b0;C than the 335 nt template 2 used for the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4C and D</xref>. Template 3 (<italic>hyp</italic>A1&#x02013;BbsI) consisted of a 3062 bp plasmid encoding the histone gene that was linearized by digestion with BbsI and not immobilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4E</xref>). Run-off transcripts from template 3 were also transcribed with high activity at 90&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4E</xref>, lane 2). When this template was used as competitor in step 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref> at 80&#x000b0;C and 90&#x000b0;C in each case, transcription of template 1 was intrinsically favoured. At 80&#x000b0;C, only 14% of total RNA was transcribed from template 3 added as competitor, at 90&#x000b0;C only 30%. This finding shows that recycling on the first template occurs both at 80&#x000b0;C and 90&#x000b0;C in a terminator-dependent manner, and that dissociation of RNAP from the first template is increased at 90&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Both terminator and associated promoter are necessary for a high transcription rate</title><p>In the pol III system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Dieci and Sentenac, 1996</xref>), facilitated recycling is dependent on the presence of a terminator sequence. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>, this is also true for facilitated reinitiation in archaea. The histone <italic>A1</italic> gene was predicted to have a heat shock-specific promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gelfand <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>), and this provides a possible plausible explanation for the high transcription rate at 90&#x000b0;C reported in this work. In fact, run-off transcription from the histone promoter on template 3 lacking the terminator occurred with similar activity at 80&#x000b0;C and 90&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>, right panel), indicating that this promoter shows high activity at 90&#x000b0;C as predicted for a heat shock promoter. But the unusually strong increase, &#x0223c;2.4-fold increase of transcription at 90&#x000b0;C compared with 80&#x000b0;C observed only on a template containing both promoter and terminator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref>, lanes 1 and 2), is strictly dependent upon the presence of the terminator.</p><p>Can the presence of this terminator also activate the expression from additional <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> promoters? To investigate this, the histone terminators were ligated with 163 bp of a gene segment encoding the <italic>gdh</italic> promoter. Run-off transcription assays from a template lacking the terminators revealed that this promoter was highly expressed at 80&#x000b0;C, but showed significantly lower activity at 90&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>, left panel). At 80&#x000b0;C, the construct containing the <italic>gdh</italic> promoter and the histone terminators had a similar template activity as the WT histone gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref>, lanes 1 and 3). At 90&#x000b0;C, termination efficiency at T1 linked with the <italic>gdh</italic> promoter was as high as at the WT histone gene, but the level of total transcripts was low compared with the levels of transcripts formed at the <italic>hpyA1</italic> template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref>, lanes 2 and 4). These findings suggest that the identified T tracts can act independently as termination sites irrespective of the linked promoter from which initiation was started. The facilitated reinitiation pathway proposed here for the archaeal histone promoter is highly dependent on the presence of the terminator on the same template.</p></sec><sec><title>The sequences immediately downstream of the main terminator affect termination efficiency and transcription rate</title><p>As described, pausing of RNAP is a prerequisite to intrinsic termination. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Palangat <italic>et al</italic>.

The highest amount of RNA is produced by the WT DNA after 10 min of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>, lane 4). The levels of transcripts formed at the AT mutant were reduced to around 70% compared with the WT template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>, diagram). The most dramatic effect was observed with the GC mutant. After 5 min, the levels of transcript were about 60% compared with the WT. Unexpectedly, after 10 min, the transcript level was reduced to &#x0223c;30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>) of WT levels. This finding suggests that already after 5 min of incubation at 90&#x000b0;C, further RNA synthesis is significantly impaired. Our finding that two single-point mutations in the region downstream of T1 can abolish the observed activation of transcription at 90&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>, lines 4 and 6) demonstrates that the sequence within the terminator region is highly critical for recycling of RNAP. Clearly, RNA degradation is expected to occur with the same rate on transcripts from all templates shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>, but this degradation is compensated on the WT template by recycling of RNAP from the terminator to the promoter. Once this mechanism is impaired by the GC mutation, the rate of degradation is higher than the rate of RNA synthesis and, therefore, RNA levels are reduced to &#x0223c;30% after 10 min of incubation. GC-rich DNA immediately downstream of the terminator sequence seems to abolish facilitated reinitiation activity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We selected a complete archaeal histone gene containing four consecutive downstream oligo-dT sequences as template for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments designed to investigate transcription termination signals and the mechanism of termination in a system operating at 90&#x000b0;C. The results of this study provide evidence that termination is brought about by pol III-like terminator sequences, and that the archaeal enzyme uses a pol III-like mechanism for termination.</p><sec><title>Termination at high temperatures and terminator signals</title><p>The <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> histone gene <italic>hpyA1 has</italic> been predicted as heat shock gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gelfand <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>) and, in line with this prediction, we find unusual high levels of <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of the <italic>hpyA1</italic> template at 90&#x000b0;C <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>). <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> grows optimally between 90&#x000b0;C and 100&#x000b0;C, and shows slower growth at 80&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fiala and Stetter, 1986</xref>). Our finding that the termination efficiency at the first oligo-dT stretch (T1) <italic>in vitro</italic> is greatly enhanced at 90&#x000b0;C compared with 80&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) might simply reflect the adaptation of the <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> transcriptional machinery to growth at high temperatures. T1 is a weak terminator at 80&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), and even the three additional back-up terminators do not prevent readthrough to the end of the DNA fragment at this temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). Therefore, the presence of these additional terminators can reduce readthrough during growth at lower temperature, and might be an adaptation to the shallow water marine hydrothermal vent habitat of <italic>P. furiosus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fiala and Stetter, 1986</xref>) that is characterized by rapidly fluctuating temperatures. The increase of the efficiency of termination with temperature could be a mechanism preventing readthrough and the expression of downstream genes upon heat shock, and thereby contribute to a specific stimulation of expression of the <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> histone at elevated temperatures. The specific stimulation of histone gene expression upon heat shock seems to be physiologically important, because binding of histones from hyperthermophilic archaea to DNA is likely to stabilize duplex DNA at elevated temperatures. Six or five T residues were sufficient for a high termination efficiency at 90&#x000b0;C, four T residues lead to a efficiency of &#x0223c;50, three T residues or less are not recognized as significant terminator signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). By contrast, in the <italic>Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus</italic> (<italic>M. t</italic>) system, deletion of one T residue from the T6 stretch in the t<sub>R&#x02032;</sub> terminator resulted in a about fourfold reduced termination when termination efficiency of a construct containing this <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteriophage terminator was assayed <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Santangelo and Reeve, 2006</xref>). This finding suggests that the signals directing efficient termination differ slightly among archaea-like in eukaryotic pol III genes and systems from different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Gunnery <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). The minimal signal sufficing for termination of the archaeal enzyme at the <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> histone terminator resembles most of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> system, which requires also five or six T residues as termination signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Allison and Hall, 1985</xref>). A stem-loop structure upstream of the histone terminator has no effect on termination at the <italic>hpyA1</italic> terminator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). By contrast, RNA hairpins seemed to contribute to termination efficiency in the <italic>M. t</italic>. system at the same incubation temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Santangelo and Reeve, 2006</xref>). Our findings indicate great similarities of the <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> termination to pol III termination at the <italic>Xenopus</italic> 5S gene. In both systems, a stretch of T residues but no dyad symmetry sequences are required for termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bogenhagen and Brown, 1981</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The mechanism of termination is pol III-like</title><p>The findings that stem-loop structures are not necessary for termination and that addition of oligonucleotides complementary to the upstream half of the RNA hairpin stem which induces RNA release in the bacterial system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Yarnell and Roberts, 1999</xref>) has no effect on archaeal termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Santangelo and Reeve, 2006</xref>) suggest that the mechanisms of bacterial and archaeal intrinsic termination differ. In this study, several lines of evidence indicate that the mechanism of archaeal transcription is pol III-like. In the pol III system, the oligo-dT stretches in terminators induce extensive pausing of RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Campbell and Setzer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Matsuzaki <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>) without formation of a stable stem-loop structure in the RNA which causes the bacterial RNAP to pause and weakens its interactions with nascent RNA and template at rho-independent terminators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Reynolds and Chamberlin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Wilson and von Hippel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Artsimovitch and Landick, 1998</xref>). We observed a significant delay of the release of RNA from template 1 containing the set of terminators compared with template 2 lacking terminator sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4C</xref>). This finding suggests that the presence of the oligo-dT residues causes also extensive pausing of the <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> enzyme, although pausing of <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> RNAP at these terminators has not been directly shown in this study.</p><p>The high <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription efficiency of pol III genes was shown to be mediated by a reinitiation mechanism bypassing most of the steps of the initial transcription cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Dieci and Sentenac, 1996</xref>). This reinitiation of pol III on the same template was dependent upon the presence of a functional terminator. We show here that the archaeal RNAP did not equally redistribute on both genes when a second template without functional terminator was added as competitor to stalled ternary complexes in multiple-round transcription assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4D and E</xref>). The preferred transcription of the first template indicates rapid recycling of the archaeal enzyme from the terminator to the promoter of the same template. The finding that the expression of both templates is approximately equal when the template used for formation of ternary complexes lacks a terminator suggests that pausing of RNAP at the terminator is a prerequisite for recycling of the archaeal RNAP. Our finding that only &#x0223c;10% of the competitor DNA is expressed 15 min after starting transcription from ternary complexes formed at the terminator containing template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4D</xref>, lanes 5 and 6) suggests a mechanism involving reinitiation at the same gene without release of RNAP that was postulated to operate in the pol III system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Dieci and Sentenac, 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of downstream DNA on the reinitiation mechanism</title><p>The effects of downstream DNA on termination efficiency and pausing of RNAP have been studied in the bacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Ederth <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) and human pol II system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Palangat <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). In the pol III system, initial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bogenhagen and Brown, 1981</xref>) and later studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Gunnery and Mathews, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Gunnery <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>) revealed that the sequence context around oligo-dT terminator signals modulates termination efficiency. The dinucleotide CT immediately downstream of the 3&#x02032; flank of terminators containing five T residues (T5) weakened termination efficiency, whereas an A or G residue following the T5 track increased termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Braglia <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). But on terminator sequences consisting of six T residues like T1 downstream of the <italic>hpyA1</italic> gene analysed in this study, the weakening effect of the CT dinucleotide was lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Braglia <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). In general, mutation lowering the duplex stability downstream of the T5 track increased readthrough at the pol III terminator, and thus weakened terminator efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Braglia <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). By contrast, the mutation lowering the duplex stability immediately downstream of the <italic>hpyA1</italic> terminator increased termination efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B and C</xref>, AT mutant). In the bacterial system interstrand cross-linking of the DNA duplex downstream of the terminator decreased termination efficiency, indicating that forward translocation of RNAP and melting of downstream DNA favour RNA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Santangelo and Roberts, 2004</xref>). Considering the extreme temperature in the <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> system, the GC content of downstream DNA is likely to have a more important effect on DNA melting and translocation of RNAP. According to the forward translocation model, AT-rich sequences are likely to increase translocation and to reduce pausing at the terminator, GC-rich sequences probably favour pausing and inhibit downstream DNA melting and translocation of RNAP. The WT sequence downstream of <italic>hpyA1</italic> shows an intermediate GC content favouring overall transcript synthesis most likely by allowing the reinitiation mechanism to occur. The AT-rich mutant sequence is likely to reduce pausing of RNAP at the terminator by stimulating downstream DNA opening, and this is likely to impair reinitiation on the same template and to stimulate rapid release of RNA, and therefore the termination efficiency is predicted to be higher, but the overall transcript synthesis is predicted to be lower as observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>). The GC-rich downstream DNA mutant is predicted to favour RNAP pausing and to weaken downstream DNA opening and translocation. The finding that the GC-rich mutant shows after 5 min of RNA synthesis similar termination efficiency as the WT is puzzling at first sight. However, an additional weak termination site between T1 and T2 was utilized with higher efficiency by this mutant (indicated by an arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>) and, more importantly, the overall RNA levels observed after 10 min of incubation in transcription reactions were only 30% of WT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>). This finding suggests that the predicted extended pausing and the observed pausing at an additional site induced by the GC-rich sequence impair the facilitated recycling of RNAP by an unknown mechanism. Because the paused RNAP molecules are not available for reinitiation and the synthesized RNA is rapidly degraded at 90&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Hethke <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>), the overall levels of RNA decrease with extended incubation time as observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>). Our findings indicate that a subtle balance between translocation of RNAP beyond the oligo-dT stretch and pausing at the terminator is important for termination and recycling in the archaeal system. The characteristics of this <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> system, recycling and reduced stability of RNA at 90&#x000b0;C, are responsible for the unexpected and, to our knowledge, unique effects of AT-rich and GC-rich downstream sequences on termination efficiency and the level of transcripts observed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>DNA templates for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription</title><p>Histone A1 gene (<italic>hpyA1</italic>) including promoter and terminator regions was amplified from <italic>P. furiosus</italic> genomic DNA using the primers his-a1_F 5&#x02032;-GGC AAT CTA TTT GGA A<bold>T</bold>T CGC TCT G-3&#x02032; and his-a1_R 5&#x02032;-GAT ATA CTT TAA TTT C<bold>T</bold>G <bold>C</bold>AG GCT C-3&#x02032; containing a restriction site for EcoRI and PstI respectively.

For single-round transcription, TBP and TFB were omitted from the chase reactions (step 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4D</xref>). Multiple-round transcription in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref> was performed by washing with transcription buffer not containing NLS. These reactions contained no excess transcription factors but promoter-bound transcription factors directed multiple rounds of transcription by RNAPs isolated by steps 1 and 2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>.</p><p>For competition experiments, immobilized <italic>hpyA1-C25</italic> templates lacking the terminator were constructed by PCR. The M13 F primer was biotinylated and the reverse primer was complementary to the region 12&#x02013;33 nt before the terminator region. A total of 30 ng of this template was added to the chase reaction of the isolated transcription complexes performed as described above.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a
