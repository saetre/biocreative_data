Prostanoids, which include PGE<sub>2</sub>, PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>, PGI<sub>2</sub>, PGD<sub>2</sub>, and TxA<sub>2</sub>, are synthesized in nearly all human tissues and act in an autocrine/paracrine manner to elicit a broad spectrum of physiological and pathophysiological actions. Some of these actions include inflammation, wound healing, kidney function, bone metabolism, immune response, and reproductive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the context of pathological conditions, specifically in tumors, a large body of evidence from epidemiological, <italic>in vivo</italic>, and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggests the involvement of COX-2 and its downstream effectors PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> in multistage carcinogenesis, particularly in tumor promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. More recent studies using transgenic mice have suggested a direct prooncogenic role for COX-2 and have shown that targeted overexpression of COX-2 is sufficient to induce hyperplasia, dysplasia, and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, PGE<sub>2</sub> has been found to participate in tumorigenesis by inhibiting apoptosis, promoting cell proliferation and survival, and by inducing angiogenesis and immunosuppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Positive feedback between COX-2 and PGE<sub>2</sub> has also been suggested to facilitate malignant transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Compared to PGE<sub>2</sub>, there is less information available on the molecular mechanisms involved in the tumor-promoting activity of PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>.</p><p>PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> binds to what has been defined as the FP prostanoid receptor, which belongs to the family of heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The FP prostanoid receptor is coupled to Gq, and stimulation of the receptor by PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> leads to the activation of phospholipase C-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>(PLC<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>) signaling followed by downstream activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and an elevation in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>-induced activation of PKC has been demonstrated to activate the Raf/MEK/MAP kinase signaling cascade and to stimulate cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, activation of MAP kinase by PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> can be inhibited by pertussis toxin, suggesting that FP receptor can also couple to G<sub>i</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Recent studies using HEK 293 cells stably expressing alternative mRNA splice variants of the ovine FP receptor demonstrated that PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> could stimulate the activation of Rho GTPase signaling leading to actin-mediated changes in cell morphology and activation of focal adhesion kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The growth of cells in a tissue essentially represents a balance between cellular death or apoptosis, and cellular proliferation. Growth will occur if apoptosis decreases and proliferation increases, or a combination thereof. Cellular proliferation reflects the activity of the cell cycle, which is driven by the interaction of cyclins with the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Different cyclin-CDK complexes are activated at different points in the cell cycle. The transition of cells from G2 to mitosis is dependent upon the completion of several events that culminate in the activation of the cyclin B/Cdc2 kinase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. During mitosis, cells undergo nuclear division in which the duplicated chromosomes are partitioned equally between the two daughter cells. The mitotic spindle plays an essential role in this complex movement, which depends on the proper assembly, orientation and attachment of the spindle to the chromosomes. Missegregation of the duplicated chromosomes can result from abnormal spindles and/or misalignment of the chromosomes and can give rise to the gain or loss of chromosomes (aneuploidy). Genomic instability is a hallmark of tumorigenesis and the development of polyploidy and aneuploidy is one established mechanism for generating genomic instability during tumorigenesis.</p><p>Using the mouse skin model of multistage carcinogenesis, PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> has been identified as an endogenous tumor promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The exact mechanisms by which PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> promotes skin tumorigenesis are unknown but could involve increased cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis or immune surveillance, or combinations of these processes. Studies have shown that PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> can stimulate cellular proliferation, although not specifically in the context of skin tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the present study we performed a detailed cell cycle analysis on HEK cells stably expressing the human FP receptor. Activation of the FP receptor by PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> was found to disrupt mitosis progression, generating abnormal mitotic spindles and misaligned chromosomes. In addition, prolonged stimulation with PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> lead to the development of polyploidy and aneuploidy. Expression of dominant negative Rho attenuated the changes in cell cycle progression and rescued the aneuploidy caused by PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> treatment. These findings show that PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>-induced Rho signaling interferes with nuclear division and suggest that the tumorpromoting activity of PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> could be a consequence of resulting genomic instability.</p><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p><bold>Reagents.</bold> Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM), Opti-MEM, fetal bovine serum (FBS), G418, gentamicin, and hygromycin B were purchased from Life Technologies.

Cells were then treated at room temperature for 30 min with 2 M HCl containing 0.5% Triton X-100 to denature DNA and neutralized by washing once with 0.1 M borax, pH 8.5. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed by incubating the cells at room temperature for 1 h (or 4 &#x000b0;C overnight) with anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (1:100) diluted in PBS containing 0.5% Tween and 1% BSA, followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h with FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:500) at room temperature for 1 h.

For antibody staining, transfected and non-transfected cells were seeded on poly-lysine-treated coverslips in six-well plates. After treatment with PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> for the indicated times, cells were washed once in PBS and fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (freshly prepared).

Empty vector pCEP4-transfected cells were used as the control. Asynchronous cultures were treated with either 1 &#x000b5;M PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> or vehicle for 24 or 48 h and were pulse labeled with 10 &#x000b5;M BrdU for 15 min to mark the S phase of cells undergoing DNA replication. Additionally, the cells were stained with propidium iodide to determine the nuclear DNA content. As shown in figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, both vehicle-treated and PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>-treated pCEP4-HEK cells and vehicle-treated hFP-HEK cells showed similar cell cycle distribution profiles. In contrast, in PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>-treated hFPHEK cells, the G1 population was reduced to 30% in the treated cells (compared to 42% in the untreated cells), while there was a corresponding increase in the G2/M population from 12% to 24.5%.

The constant S phase population and the similar profile of S phase distribution before and after treatment indicates that PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> had no detectable effects on DNA replication as measured by BrdU incorporation. The increase in G2/M population, on the other hand, suggests either a delay in the G2/M transition or in the exit from mitosis. <fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> increases the G2/M population in HEK cells stably expressing the human FP prostanoid receptor.

Surprisingly, as shown in figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, cyclin B1 protein expression was found to increase following treatment of hFP-HEK cells with PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>. These data indicate that the delay in G2/M was not due to a decrease in cyclin B1 protein expression. As shown in figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, there was a corresponding increase in Cdc2 kinase activity following the treatment of hFP-HEK cells with PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>, which was not observed in PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>-treated control pCEP4-HEK cells.

Failure of this checkpoint can result in aneuploidy in the daughter cells and contributes to genomic instability. So far, all known delays in mitosis are mediated by the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Because PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> delayed mitosis in hFP-HEK cells, we were interested in further assessing the integrity of mitotic spindles and examining the chromosome alignment in hFP-HEK cells following treatment with PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>. The results of these studies are shown in figures 4 and 5. In contrast to pCEP4-HEK control cells and vehicle-treated hFP-HEK cells, which showed essentially normal bipolar spindle and chromosome alignment, PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>-treated hFPHEK cells exhibited a significant portion of cells with multipolar spindles (fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, panels a&#x02013;c) and misaligned chromosomes (fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, panels d&#x02013;f). These multipolar spindles were often accompanied by poles of different sizes and with disorganized arrays of microtubules and misaligned chromosomes. The bottom panel of figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows that the percentage of hFP-HEK cells with multipolar spindles increased &#x0223c;6-fold 48 h after addition of PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>, and then decreased at 96 h, but was still &#x0223c;2.5-fold higher than in the untreated cells. The percentage of hFPHEK cells with misaligned chromosomes, however, increased markedly both 48 h and 96 h after the addition of PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> (&#x0223c;3.5- and 8-fold, respectively). The outcome of these multipolar spindles and misaligned chromosomes is that free and/or lagging chromosomes will distribute randomly to the daughter cells giving rise to either a gain or loss of chromosomes (aneuploidy). Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, in fact, shows that in hFP-HEK cells treated with PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> there was a dramatic increase in the percentage of hFP-HEK cells containing micronuclei around the major interphase nuclei, which is a reflection of aneuploidy. Thus, the percentage of hFP-HEK cells containing micronuclei increased from &#x0223c;2% at the zero time point to &#x0223c;44% after 96 h of treatment with PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>. There was also an increase in hFP-HEK cells containing two or more nuclei (polyploidy) following PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> treatment; from &#x0223c;1% at the zero time point to &#x0223c;10% after 96 h of treatment. <fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> induces multipolar mitotic spindles and misaligned chromosomes in HEK cells stably expressing the human FP prostanoid receptor.

This would not be unexpected given that mitosis and cytokinesis are related events requiring close temporal and spatial coordination. Phalloidin staining of actin and fluorescence microscopy were, therefore, used to determine if the presence of multipolar spindles and misaligned chromosomes was associated with any abnormalities in cytokinesis in hFP-HEK cells treated with PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>. We found that while control pCEP4-HEK and vehicle-treated hFPHEK cells showed essentially normal patterns of actin staining, PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>-treated hFP-HEK cells showed numerous instances of abnormal staining. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows several examples of this abnormal staining.

The Rho inhibitor, C3 exoenzyme and the ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, blocked the PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>-mediated formation of actin stress fibers in hFP-HEK cells (data not shown). We hypothesized that PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>-induced Rho signaling might underlie the mechanism of defective cortical activity and failure of cytokinesis. <fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Dominant negative N19RhoA attenuates the cell cycle delay and rescues aneuploidy caused by PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> treatment of HEK cells stably expressing the human FP prostanoid receptor.

Micronuclei and multiple nuclei were defined as in the legend to figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="18_2005_Article_5303_Fig7" id="MO"/></fig></p><p>For these experiments N19RhoA, the dominant negative form of RhoA, was co-transfected with EGFP into hFPHEK cells. EGFP was used to select the positive cells and cell cycle analysis and quantitation of cells containing micronuclei/multinuclei were carried out 24 and 48 h after PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> treatment, respectively. A 96-h time point could not be examined because with the time required for the transfection itself, the cells were postconfluent and were growing in layers by 96-h. As shown in the middle panel of figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, treatment of hFP-HEK cells with PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> resulted in a twofold increase in the number of cells in G2/M which increased from 12% to 22%. Concomitantly, the number of cells in G0/G1 decreased by roughly the same amount from 43% to 32%, while the S phase population remained unchanged. Transfection with dominant negative N19RhoA alone caused a slight increase in the number of cells in G0/G1, from 43% to 48%, while causing slight decreases of a similar magnitude in the number of cells in S and G2/M. The effects of N19RhoA in the absence of PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> treatment suggest a slowing of the cell cycle, which is consistent with the well-known function of Rho in the progression from G1 to S. Rho signaling, however, also appears to be important with respect to the changes in cell cycle distribution that are mediated by PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> in hFP-HEK cells. Thus, the middle panel of figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows that in hFP-HEK cells transfected with N19RhoA, the effect of PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> to increase the number of cells in G2/M was essentially blocked. The effect of PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> to decrease the number of cells in G0/G1, however, was only slightly reduced in hFP-HEK cells transfected with N19RhoA. These effects were accompanied by a moderate increase in the number of cells in S phase. In contrast, the lower panel of figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows that the effect of PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> to increase the number of hFP-HEK cells with micronuclei following treatment with PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> was almost completely abrogated in N19RhoA-transfected hFP-HEK cells, going from about threefold to almost nothing. The effect of PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> to increase the number of hFP-HEK cells with multiple nuclei could not be observed in N19RhoA-transfected hFPHEK cells because the blockade of Rho signaling itself caused a large increase in the number of cells with multiple nuclei even in the absence of PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> treatment. Taken together these findings suggest that the observed cell cycle delay and aneuploidy generated by PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> treatment of hFP-HEK cells is mediated at least in part by a Rho signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study was aimed at exploring the possible role of PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> signaling in the cell cycle by utilizing a HEK cell line stably expressing the human FP prostanoid receptor. Here we report that PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> treatment of hFP-HEK cells leads to a delay in mitosis progression with elevated levels of cyclin B1 and increased Cdc2 kinase activity. In addition, PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> treatment of hFP-HEK cells was found to generate abnormal mitotic spindles and misaligned chromosomes resulting in the accumulation of multiple nuclei and aneuploidy. These findings are reminiscent of the outcomes of dysregulation of the centrosomal proteins involved in kinetochore-microtubule attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Given that all known delays in mitosis are due to the activation of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, we postulate that the generation of abnormal mitotic spindles and misaligned chromosomes caused by the treatment of hFPHEK cells with PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> activates the mitotic spindle checkpoint and delays the onset of anaphase. Thus, if hFP-HEK cells fail to correct the abnormalities in chromosome alignment during a prolonged mitosis, they are likely to exit mitosis with the generation of one or more cells with altered genomes.</p><p>The observation of multinucleated cells after the treatment of hFP-HEK cells with PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> further supports the notion that imbalanced Rho GTPase activity results in defective actomyosin contractility and failure of cytokinesis. It is well known that Rho signaling is involved in the progression of G1/S transition and in cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Misaligned chromosomes and aneuploidy induced by PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> treatment of hFP-HEK cells suggests a potential function of Rho in nuclear division as well. In support of this, ROCK kinase, one of the downstream effectors of Rho, has been found to exist in the same complex with Aurora A kinase. Furthermore, depletion of either protein by RNA interference (RNAi) induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and abnormal mitotic spindles, with the corresponding generation of aneuploidy and polyploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Given that Aurora A kinase plays an essential role in centrosome maturation and bipolar spindle assembly, and the evidence that both Aurora A kinase and ROCK exist in the same genetic pathway, lend additional support to the idea that ROCK and its activator, Rho, are involved in the normal functions of the centrosome, spindle assembly, and equal partitioning of the chromosomes. Cdc42 and its effector, mDia3, were recently found to be involved in the bi-orientation and stabilization of spindle microtubule attachment to the kinetochore, which thereby regulates chromosome alignment in metaphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A possible mechanism that could link PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> activation of Rho signaling with the role of Cdc42 in chromosome alignment involves the protein, ECT2, which is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 GTPases. Thus, inappropriate activation of Rho in PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>-treated hFPHEK cells could interfere with the bi-attachment of the kinetochore to microtubules by depleting ECT2 activity toward Cdc42. Evidence supporting this mechanism is that expression of dominant negative forms of ECT2, and RNAi knockdown of ECT2 protein, impair microtubule attachment to kinetochores and cause prometaphase delay and abnormal chromosomal segregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Genomic instability involving the gain or loss of chromosomes (aneuploidy) is a hallmark of cancer. One of the important features of cancer-associated aneuploidy is that it appears to be a very dynamic process. Studies suggest that pre-existing aneuploidy in transformed cells is usually associated with elevated rates of subsequent chromosome instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. As reviewed in the Introduction, PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> has been found to act as a tumor promoter in a mouse model of skin carcinogenesis. A possible basis for this tumor-promoting activity might, therefore, involve a PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub>-mediated increase in genomic instability caused by interference with proper functioning of the mitotic spindle and equal partitioning of the chromosomes. If true, this would suggest that PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> could exert a tumor-promoting action in the very early stages of carcinogenesis.</p><p>Support for a tumor-promoting action of prostanoids in general comes from the well-known protective effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the development of a number of cancers, including colon, breast, and oral cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is interesting that the tissue concentrations of both PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> are frequently highly elevated in inflammation and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Also intriguing is that epithelial cells from high-grade inflammatory bronchi, for example, show a degree of aneuploidy that is similar to that observed in tumor cells. Likewise, centrosome amplification and multipolar mitosis have been found to occur in the early stages of inflammation and are characteristic of tumors as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Thus, inflammatory conditions share several tumor-specific features that are likely to be maintained by the combined actions of PGE<sub>2</sub>, PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> and possibly other prostanoids. This study has shown that PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> can induce multipolar mitosis and increase aneuploidy in cells transfected with the human FP receptor. Further work will be needed to see if the actions of PGF<sub>2<italic>&#x003b1;</italic></sub> acting through FP receptors are responsible for some of the genomic instability observed in tumors, and whether FP receptor activation is directly involved with early stages of tumorigenesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors thank the Arizona Cancer Center Cytometry Core Facility (Cancer Center Support Grant P30CA23074) for their help with flow cytometric analysis.
