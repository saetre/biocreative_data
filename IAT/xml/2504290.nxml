The <italic>Pax-5</italic> locus generates multiple yet structurally related mRNA transcripts through the specific activation of alternative promoter regions and/or alternative splicing events which poses challenges in the study of specific isoform function. In this study, we investigated the function of a major <italic>Pax-5</italic> transcript, <italic>Pax-5B</italic> using an enhanced version of the Hepatitis Delta Virus ribozyme (HDV Rz) suppression system that is specifically designed to recognize and cleave the human <italic>Pax-5B</italic> mRNA. The activity of these ribozymes resulted in the specific suppression of the <italic>Pax-5B</italic> transcripts without altering the transcript levels of other closely related <italic>Pax-5</italic> isoforms mRNAs both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in an intracellular setting. Following stable transfection of the ribozymes into a model B cell line (REH), we showed that <italic>Pax-5B</italic> suppression led to an increase of <italic>CD19</italic> mRNA and cell surface protein expression. In response to this <italic>Pax-5B</italic> specific deregulation, a marked increase in apoptotic activity compared to control cell lines was observed. These results suggest that <italic>Pax-5B</italic> has distinct roles in physiological processes in cell fate events during lymphocyte development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that the <italic>Pax</italic> gene family controls gene expression activity at the transcription level and regulates fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and cell death events (apoptosis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Given their essential role in cell biology, deregulated <italic>Pax</italic> genes also act as oncogenes and have the potential to transform normal cells into their cancerous counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). A well-studied member of this family, <italic>Pax-5</italic>, is known to encode the B-cell specific activator protein (BSAP) which is expressed in the embryonic central nervous system, B lymphocytes, and adult testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In the past decade, the interest in the <italic>Pax-5</italic> transcription factor has been drawn to its pivotal role in B-cell lymphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). <italic>Pax-5</italic> requirement to B commitment is highlighted by its transcriptional control over key events that are essential for B-cell development and activation. Studies have identified a number of <italic>Pax-5</italic> target genes several of which are known to modulate the expression of B-cell receptor (BCR) components and associated proteins (i.e. <italic>CD19</italic>, blk etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). <italic>Pax-5</italic> selective pressure to B-cell commitment is also conveyed by its ability to negatively regulate non-conforming pathways of the B lineage leading to the differentiation of non-B cellular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>At the genetic level, human <italic>Pax-5</italic> is mapped to chromosome 9 in region p13 where it is regulated by two distinct promoters regions: first a TATA-containing upstream promoter associated with an exon 1A, and a TATA-less downstream promoter coupled with an exon 1B. Through regulated signaling processes along with the recruitment of specific transcriptional regulators, each promoter induces the transcription of a distinct 5&#x02032;UTR region and a first exon which then splices to a coding sequence (exons 2&#x02013;10) common to both transcript isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). These two mRNAs (noted <italic>Pax-5A</italic> and <italic>Pax-5B</italic>) are discriminated only by their unique 5&#x02032;UTR sequence and exon 1 of the coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic structure of the human <italic>Pax</italic>-<italic>5</italic> gene and the SOFA-HDV Rz (<bold>A</bold>) The human <italic>Pax-5</italic> gene located on chromosome 9 includes two alternative promoter regions (empty boxes\promoters A and B) which regulate the expression of exclusive exon regions (solid boxes) 1A and B, respectively, followed a common exons 2&#x02013;10 sequence. The dotted diagonal lines indicate the spliced regions from the mature coding transcripts. (<bold>B</bold>) The structure of the SOFA-HDV Rz adopts an off (left panel) and locked configuration secured by the blocker stem in the absence of its specific mRNA target (<italic>Pax</italic>-<italic>5B</italic>). In the presence of the specific substrate (right panel) the SOFA-HDV Rz adopts a catalytically active configuration which is formed through the annealing of the ribozyme's biosensor (BS) and P1 stem (P1) to the target substrate. These structures were previously described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn432f1"/></fig></p><p>Although a great number of studies have contributed to the functional characterization of <italic>Pax-5</italic> at the molecular and cellular level, few have discriminated between the physiological roles of <italic>Pax-5A</italic> and <italic>Pax-5B</italic> isoforms individually. Given the fact that most <italic>Pax-5</italic> bearing cells express both <italic>Pax-5</italic> isoforms simultaneously (almost a 1 : 1 ratio in human pre-B cells), the functional study of these alternatively spliced products has proven to be complex and very challenging. As a result, little attention has been paid to the cellular characterization of <italic>Pax-5B</italic>. Therefore, we set out to develop a <italic>Pax-5B</italic> gene suppression system using a modified ribozyme (Rz) technology to investigate the specific roles associated with <italic>Pax-5B</italic> in human B lymphocytes.</p><p>The ability of a ribozyme to specifically recognize, and subsequently catalyze the cleavage of an RNA target makes it an attractive molecular tool for the development of gene inactivation systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). It provides an interesting alternative to an RNA-interference (RNAi) approach in functional genomics, especially given the recent findings that RNAi specificity is limited and evidence shows that this mechanism can trigger immunological response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The ribozyme isolated from the hepatitis delta virus (HDV Rz) appears to be the most suited to develop a gene-inactivation in human cells since it has evolved within this particular cell environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In support of this, results have shown this catalytic RNA to be fully active in physiological concentrations of magnesium in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). However, the target recognition mechanism of the HDV Rz is dependant on the formation of a 7 base pair (bp) between the Rz and the substrate, (namely the P1 stem/<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). It has been estimated that a minimum sequence of 15 or 16 base pairing nucleotides are required for the targeting of unique RNA species in the human transcriptome, thereby limiting non-specific cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In order to fulfill these parameters, a new generation of HDV Rz was engineered which incorporates a Specific On/ofF Adaptor (SOFA) that switches the cleavage activity from off to on solely in the presence of the appropriate substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). A unique feature of the SOFA-HDV Rz allows it to limit the catalytic activity via a blocking sequence that prevents the folding of the ribozyme into an active conformation. This &#x02018;safety lock&#x02019; function prevents cleavage of a substrate that contains an appropriate P1 stem but lacks a complementary sequence to the SOFA biosensor. This new target-dependent module biosensor bearing Rz significantly reduces non-specific cleavage events.</p><p>In this study, we developed an isoform-specific SOFA-HDV Rz capable of recognizing and cleaving human <italic>Pax-5B</italic> transcripts both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using this gene suppression system, we report that the <italic>Pax-5B</italic> transcriptional element is associated with changes in target gene activation as well as to the balance of cell fate events in human B lymphocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and ribozyme DNA constructs</title><p>The <italic>Pax-5A</italic> cDNA was cloned as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).

It is important to note that the (N) segments vary in sequence depending on the targeted site accessible on the target RNA substrate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The DNA coding SOFA-HDV Rz were rendered double stranded by PCR which were later purified by phenol:chloroform extraction, precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in water.

This was done to verify whether or not there were any differences in global transcript decay rates between the REH parental cell line and REH transfectants (psiRNA-hH1 or the SOFA-HDV Rz-B75). For this experiment, relative amounts of the HPRT mRNA from the different cell line clones were analyzed at various time points by quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Following actinomycin-D treatment, a steady decline of HPRT transcripts was registered up to 12 h and these decay rates were identical in all cell lines tested. The half-lives of HPRT mRNA were calculated according to the slope which represented 2.9, 2.2 and 2.6 h for the REH, REH/psiRNA-hH1 and REH B75 cell lines, respectively.

The inherent difficulty is largely due to the fact that both genes and proteins are nearly identical differing only by their first exon. Most studies that examined the role of <italic>Pax-5</italic> have relied mainly on antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), nucleic probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), antisense oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) and/or site-directed genetic alteration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) that target common regions present in both <italic>Pax-5A</italic> and <italic>Pax-5B</italic>. It is, therefore, not possible to draw conclusions on the specific roles of the individual genes and/or proteins from these previous works. Recently, the development of gene inactivation tools has focused on the attenuation or silencing of target mRNA for the study of gene function. Reliable and selective gene suppression systems are a valuable tool to create loss and gain of function models which provide new insights for intracellular signaling discovery and pathway analysis. In this context, the findings of this study are significant. Here, we validate a novel gene-suppression system based on a genetically modified viral ribozyme for the functional characterization of highly similar gene products transcribed from the <italic>Pax-5</italic> gene locus. This new gene-silencing approach has allowed us to reveal the important contribution of the <italic>Pax-5B</italic> gene during apoptotic events in human B lymphocytes.</p><p>We have recently modified the native HDV Rz by the addition of a biosensor for the recognition of its specific substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The SOFA-HDV Rz is the only RNA-based gene suppression system of its kind to function as a riboswitch and therefore cleave only when the specific target mRNA is present. It has been shown previously that most <italic>Pax-5</italic> expressing cells simultaneously produce multiple <italic>Pax-5</italic> isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Therefore, to study the unique contributions of the different gene products, we developed several SOFA-HDV Rz designed to target unique regions found in the human <italic>Pax-5B</italic> exon 1 mRNA sequence. When tested <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, these <italic>Pax-5B</italic> specific SOFA-HDV Rz displayed a high level of target specificity. In all assays, we observed specific recognition and cleavage of the <italic>Pax-5B</italic> substrate with no suppressive off-target effects on the levels of the other major isoform <italic>Pax-5A</italic>. More interestingly, in B lymphocytes co-expressing <italic>Pax-5</italic> isoforms, <italic>Pax-5A</italic> mRNA expression levels were up-regulated following <italic>Pax-5B</italic> down-regulation. These results suggest that <italic>Pax-5B</italic> plays a negative role in the transactivity of other <italic>Pax-5</italic> isoforms. These observations are not surprising given the fact that autoregulation and negative transregulation activities between <italic>Pax-5</italic> variants have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). As a control, we also designed a functional yet non-specific SOFA-HDV Rz and when tested in similar conditions, our results show that this ribozyme does not affect levels of <italic>Pax-5B</italic> RNA. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of the SOFA-HDV Rz was not cell-type dependent since <italic>Pax-5B</italic> transcript cleavage was observed in both HEK 293 and REH cells lines.</p><p>It is important to note that substrate cleavage occurs via direct ribozyme activity and is not mediated by RNA interference since the longest complementary region between a SOFA-HDV Rz and its <italic>Pax-5B</italic> substrate is 12 bp. We further ruled out the involvment of RNAi pathway components by gene expression analysis of mRNA from SOFA-HDV Rz transfected cells which revealed no activity from any RNAi elements following SOFA-HDV Rz mediated cleavage of a specific substrate (unpublished data; F. Bri&#x000e8;re, M. Laflamme, J.P. Perreault and R. Ouellette). The dose-dependent catalytic activity of the SOFA-HDV Rz observed in our transient co-transfections was not as pronounced when studying transfected B lymphocytes. In certain cases using B lymphocytes, the highest level of gene expression knock-down was observed in transfected clones with lower cellular concentration of ribozyme expression. These observations may be due to substrate accessibility and competition between promoter elements in our co-transfection settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>The reduction of <italic>Pax-5B</italic> transcript levels had a subsequent effect on <italic>Pax-5B</italic> protein levels which was most likely due to decreases in synthesis levels. Our findings using EMSA assays revealed that ribozyme-mediated gene silencing led to a concomitant attenuation of the target protein expression as observed by a decrease in <italic>Pax-5B</italic> DNA-binding activity. This reduced binding was not associated with a general decrease in DNA-binding activity as revealed by NF-&#x003ba;B control experiments. Our findings suggest that high levels of <italic>Pax-5B</italic> suppression are incompatible with survival of B cells (REH). Following selection of stably-transfected REH clones, the maximum level ribozyme-mediated suppression of <italic>Pax-5B</italic> was 85% of control cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Despite numerous attempts, we were unable to identify any stably-transfected SOFA-HDV Rz clones with a greater reduction of <italic>Pax-5B</italic> expression. These findings are consistent with our results of <italic>Pax-5B</italic> knock-down experiments using RNAi (unpublished data; Robichaud, G.A. and R. Ouellette). In these experiments, we found that with <italic>Pax-5B</italic>-directed RNAi sequences we were able to completely suppress <italic>Pax-5B</italic> expression. However, total suppression of <italic>Pax-5B</italic> led to complete cell death of REH cells compared to control REH cells that received a scrambled RNAi sequence. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that a minimal requirement of <italic>Pax-5B</italic> expression is required for cell survival. It also reveals the usefulness of the SOFA-HDV Rz system as a tool to selectively suppress and study vital cellular elements.</p><p>We then used our <italic>Pax-5B</italic>-attenuated B-cell system to study the effects on a known downstream target of <italic>Pax-5A</italic>, in this case, the <italic>CD19</italic> gene. In previous studies, the DNA-binding motif of the <italic>Pax-5A</italic> protein or BSAP has been shown to bind the <italic>CD19</italic> promoter region via a cluster of proximal <italic>Pax-5</italic> recognition sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Subsequently, this protein&#x02013;DNA interaction induces <italic>CD19</italic> gene expression which acts as a developmental checkpoint for early B-lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed a marked increase in <italic>CD19</italic> expression both at the mRNA and protein levels in our <italic>Pax-5B</italic> knockdown B cells which, taken together, imply that <italic>Pax-5B</italic> is a negative regulator of <italic>CD19</italic>. This finding is contrary to the positive regulatory effect of <italic>Pax-5A</italic> on <italic>CD19</italic> observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>CD19</italic> is a key molecule in the B lymphocyte signal transduction complex, where it associates with other proteins including the B-cell antigen complex (BCR) which has been shown to regulate B-cell fate and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The <italic>CD19</italic> surface protein modulates basal signaling thresholds and accelerates BCR signals thus serving as a general &#x02018;rheostat&#x02019; that defines downstream signaling critical for B-cell responses, growth and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Furthermore, in certain instances, <italic>CD19</italic> has also been shown to attenuate B-cell activation and proliferation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). It is precisely these <italic>CD19</italic> events that could explain the lower proliferation rates observed in <italic>Pax-5B</italic> attenuated B lymphocytes.</p><p>Previous studies have also demonstrated that a decrease in the expression of the human <italic>Pax-5</italic> gene (with no discrimination to <italic>Pax-5A</italic> or <italic>Pax-5B</italic>) is associated with decreased B-cell growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In addition to the lower proliferation rates seen in <italic>Pax-5B</italic> knockdown cells, we observed that these B lymphocytes undergo apoptotic events that are mediated through the activity of CASPASES 3\7. Apoptosis is a key cellular pathway that mitigates the production of defective cells that occur during aberrant cellular processes such as hypersensitivity, autoimmunity, infection, mutation, anergy and oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Apoptosis is particularly important during the development of lymphocytes when it removes both ineffective and potentially harmful cells via the withdrawal of survival signals. Interestingly, <italic>Pax-5</italic> expression has been primarily associated with the development and maintenance of B-cell progenitors, then subsequently decreases and ceases in terminally differentiated plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Our findings suggest that <italic>Pax-5B</italic> may be closely involved in the differentiation checkpoints that ensure the precise regulation of the development and proliferation programs. This is consistent with data from Rahman <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), which show that the suppression of <italic>Pax-5</italic> results in the growth arrest of pre-B cells&#x02014;results that were not observed in either pro-B or mature B-cell lines.</p><p>Apoptosis also plays a role in the prevention of oncogenic transformation associated with the development of cancer. Numerous studies have shown that aberrant expression of <italic>Pax-5</italic> has been associated with the onset of different types of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), whereas others have also shown that <italic>Pax-5</italic> is overexpressed in many types of B cell lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Therefore, it appears that <italic>Pax-5</italic> gene products are responsible on the one hand for the promotion B-cell commitment, and on the other, for the homeostasis of cell fate events. As a key switch in the balance between proliferation and apoptosis, <italic>Pax-5B</italic> could represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Further analysis of other downstream cell-fate regulators and known <italic>Pax-5</italic> pathway components [i.e. p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), Ets-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), PD-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) etc.] will help elucidate the complex networks and cell-fate events involved in B-cell development and oncogenesis. We are presently addressing some of these issues.</p><p>More recently, we and others have newly identified and characterized <italic>Pax-5</italic> isoforms which result from the alternative splicing of the <italic>Pax-5</italic> coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). On a functional basis, these protein variants possess different transactivation potential and have the ability to interact with different protein partners, and in certain cases, specific <italic>Pax-5</italic> isoforms have been correlated with different types of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). These findings begin to address the complexity of the <italic>Pax-5</italic> transcript and protein isoform function in B lymphocytes. Through the use of isoform-specific gene-silencing tools such as SOFA-HDV Rz, we are now able to better interrogate these regulators involved in B-cell development, cell-fate events and oncogenesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The work in the laboratory of JPP was supported by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR; EOP-39322).
