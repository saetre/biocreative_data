Children who inherit one defective copy of the <italic>RB1 </italic>gene have an increased susceptibility to retinoblastoma. Several years after the identification of the human <italic>RB1 </italic>gene, a targeted deletion of <italic>Rb </italic>was generated in mice. Mice with one defective copy of the <italic>Rb </italic>gene do not develop retinoblastoma. In this manuscript, we explore the different roles of the Rb family in human and mouse retinal development in order to better understand the species-specific difference in retinoblastoma susceptibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that the Rb family of proteins (Rb, p107 and p130) are expressed in a dynamic manner during mouse retinal development. The primary Rb family member expressed in proliferating embryonic retinal progenitor cells in mice is p107, which is required for appropriate cell cycle exit during retinogenesis. The primary Rb family member expressed in proliferating postnatal retinal progenitor cells is Rb. p130 protein is expressed redundantly with Rb in postmitotic cells of the inner nuclear layer and the ganglion cell layer of the mouse retina. When Rb is inactivated in an acute or chronic manner during mouse retinal development, p107 is upregulated in a compensatory manner. Similarly, when p107 is inactivated in the mouse retina, Rb is upregulated. No changes in p130 expression were seen when p107, Rb or both were inactivated in the developing mouse retina. In the human retina, RB1 was the primary family member expressed throughout development. There was very little if any p107 expressed in the developing human retina. In contrast to the developing mouse retina, when <italic>RB1 </italic>was acutely inactivated in the developing human fetal retina, p107 was not upregulated in a compensatory manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose that intrinsic genetic compensation between Rb and p107 prevents retinoblastoma in Rb- or p107-deficient mice, but this compensation does not occur in humans.

If too many neural progenitor cells exit the cell cycle during the early stages of development, then the overall number of cells is reduced, and the ratio of cell types shifts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Genetically engineered mice carrying targeted deletions of tumor suppressor genes that regulate cell cycle progression have been used to study the coordination of proliferation and cell-fate specification during development. Mice lacking the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, <italic>Rb1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], were among the first characterized. In embryonic day (E) 13.5 <italic>Rb</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mouse embryos, ectopic mitosis was observed outside the ventricular zone of the developing hindbrain, and concurrent apoptosis was observed in the region where postmitotic cells normally migrate and differentiate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In contrast, the E13.5 <italic>Rb</italic><sup>-/- </sup>retina was indistinguishable from E13.5 wild-type or <italic>Rb</italic>-heterozygous retinas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Lee and colleagues proposed that specific neuronal sublineages have unique requirements for Rb during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. To explain the specific defects in neurogenesis in Rb-deficient animals, Jacks and colleagues suggested that other, closely related Rb proteins such as p107 play a more prominent role in certain lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. For example, tissues uniquely dependent on Rb (e.g., developing hindbrain) may exhibit defects in <italic>Rb</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos, but lineages that are not (e.g., embryonic retina) appear normal in its absence.</p><p>Although the Rb-deficient embryonic mouse retina develops normally up to E13.5, Rb may play an important role at later stages of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Using Cre-expressing retroviruses and a retinal progenitor-specific Cre transgenic mouse line (<italic>Chx10-Cre</italic>) mated to <italic>Rb</italic><sup><italic>Lox </italic></sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], we previously showed that the retinal defects first identified by Maandag and colleagues reflect a cell-autonomous requirement for Rb at specific developmental stages in retinal progenitor cells and rod photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Two other groups published similar findings using Cre transgenic mouse lines with broader expression in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and throughout the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Other phenotypes characterized in <italic>Rb</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos were recently found to be secondary non-cell-autonomous effects caused by changes in extraembryonic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of mice carrying targeted deletions of <italic>p107 </italic>and <italic>Rb </italic>(<italic>Rb</italic><sup>+/-</sup>; <italic>p107</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) indicated that p107 is important for retinal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

Subsequent studies using chimeric mice generated from <italic>Rb</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>p107</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and those involving conditional inactivation of <italic>Rb </italic>in the developing retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] or CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] have not elucidated individual roles of Rb or p107 in retinogenesis.</p><p>When progenitor cell proliferation is disrupted during development, secondary effects on cell-fate specification and differentiation are likely to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Therefore, distinguishing the roles of Rb and p107 in proliferation from those in cell-fate specification is a major challenge. In addition, elucidating the cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] roles of the Rb family during development can be challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Moreover, as several investigators have proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], individual Rb proteins are likely to have both unique and overlapping roles during development, thereby making it difficult to identify their individual contributions. Compensation and redundancy can further complicate analyses and obscure the individual roles of Rb proteins during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Interestingly, the response to acute inactivation of <italic>Rb </italic>in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) differs from that seen when <italic>Rb </italic>is inactivated in a chronic manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This finding increases the complexity of the genetic analyses of Rb family function in vivo.</p><p>Relatively little is known about the expression or the role of the Rb family during human fetal retinal development. Therefore, we do not know if Rb, p107 and p130 are playing different roles in the developing human and mouse retinas or if cell cycle regulation through the Rb family is evolutionarily conserved.</p><p>In this study, we used genetic tools (replication-incompetent retroviruses, in vivo electroporation, and SiRNA analyses) combined with cell cycle analysis to investigate the individual cell-autonomous roles of Rb and p107 in the developing retina. We also sought to compare Rb family expression and intrinsic genetic compensation during retinal development in mice and humans to explain why humans are susceptible to retinoblastoma following <italic>RB1 </italic>inactivation, but mice are not.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of the Rb family during mouse retinal development</title><p>Previous genetic studies have established that inactivation of Rb and p107 or Rb and p130 in the developing mouse retina can lead to retinoblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, it is not known if Rb, p107 and p130 are expressed redundantly in the developing mouse retina or if intrinsic genetic compensation by <italic>p107</italic>, <italic>p130 </italic>or both prevents retinoblastoma in <italic>Rb</italic>-deficient mice. As a first step toward distinguishing between these two possibilities, we analyzed the expression of Rb, p107 and p130 over seven stages of mouse retinal histogenesis. Real-time RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses of E14.5 to P0 mice indicated that p107 is the primary Rb protein expressed in proliferating retinal progenitor cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, D</xref>). As the levels of p107 mRNA and protein decreased at P0, those of Rb and p130 increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B&#x02013;D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, a low level of Rb was detected in a subset of embryonic retinal progenitor cells and newly postmitotic (transition) cells at the basal and apical surfaces of the developing inner neuroblastic layer (INBL) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E&#x02013;K</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Dynamic expression of the Rb family during mouse retinal development</bold>. <bold>(A-C) </bold>Real-time PCR analysis of p107, Rb and p130 was done at seven stages of mouse retinal development.

These data indicated that the embryonic retinal progenitor cells primarily express p107 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1V</xref>), which is consistent with a lack of any retinal phenotype in <italic>Rb</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryonic retinas. In the postnatal retina and in differentiated neurons and glia of the INL and GCL, Rb and p130 were expressed redundantly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1V</xref>). Rb is the only family member expressed in rod photoreceptors, a finding that is consistent with its unique role in the development of this neuronal cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Together, these data suggest that Rb and p107 are expressed in a largely nonoverlapping pattern during mouse retinal development, which raises the possibility of compensation by p107 when Rb is inactivated. Moreover, Rb and p130 expression overlaps, which supports the idea that these proteins play redundant roles in a subset of retinal neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of the Rb family during the cell cycle in retinal progenitor cells</title><p>Beyond determining when and where each Rb family member is expressed during retinal development, it is important to determine when during the cell cycle Rb, p107 and p130 are expressed. These data may help to elucidate their normal roles during development. For example, if a family member is only expressed in proliferating retinal progenitor cells, then that protein is unlikely to play a role in neuronal differentiation. It has been well established in a variety of culture systems that Rb, p107 and p130 are expressed during different phases of the cell cycle. To directly determine when during the cell cycle these proteins are expressed throughout retinal development, we scored the colocalization of [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine ([<sup>3</sup>H]thy) with p107 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;D</xref>), Rb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E&#x02013;H</xref>) or p130 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I&#x02013;L</xref>) at five time points during four stages of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The expression of p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>has been characterized previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and a parallel set of samples was analyzed for p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>expression to serve as an internal control. The p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>protein is upregulated as cells exit the cell cycle throughout retinal development, and the kinetics are different at E14.5, P0 and P2, because the length of the retinal progenitor cell cycle increases during retinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. At E14.5, 62% to 77% of proliferating cells expressed p107, and 4% to 6% expressed Rb (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The 36% reduction in the proportion of p107+ cells at the 24-h time point in E14.5 retinas was consistent with the previous finding that 20% to 25% of rat retinal progenitor cells exit the cell cycle at a similar stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of the Rb family during the cell cycle</bold>. <bold>(A-D) </bold>The E14.5 retinal explants were maintain in culture in the presence of [<sup>3</sup>H]thy for 1 h, washed and then maintained in culture for different periods.

Unlike p107+ cells, Rb+ P0 retinal progenitor cells continued to express Rb after they exited the cell cycle (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). In the P2 retina, the level of p130 peaked in the late G2/early M phase of the cell cycle and persisted into G1/G0 (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I&#x02013;L</xref>). Many cells downregulated p130 as they exited the cell cycle; this finding was consistent with the birth of rod photoreceptors (80% of the total cell population in the retina), which do not express p130 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1R&#x02013;U</xref>). Results from the [<sup>3</sup>H]thy pulse-labeling experiment combined with those from the immunostaining, real-time RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunoblot studies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) suggested that p107 is expressed primarily in retinal progenitor cells during embryonic retinal development; Rb is expressed in both retinal progenitor cells and postmitotic neurons and glia in the postnatal retina, and p130 is expressed in cells exiting the cell cycle during the late stages of retinal development. These data help us to further refine the possible compensatory and redundant roles of Rb, p107 and p130 during retinal development. Specifically, Rb and p130 may play redundant roles in postnatal retinal progenitor cells and postmitotic differentiated neurons of the INL and GCL. Rb and p107 are both expressed in proliferating retinal progenitor cells, albeit at different stages of development. Inactivation of either Rb or p107 in proliferating retinal progenitor cells may lead to compensatory upregulation of the other family member.</p></sec><sec><title>Reciprocal compensation between Rb and p107 in mouse retinal progenitor cells</title><p>To directly determine whether Rb family members compensate for each other in the developing retina, we isolated RNA from <italic>p107</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>p107</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, <italic>p107</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, <italic>Rb</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>Rb</italic><sup>+/- </sup>and <italic>Rb</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>retinas at E13.5, P0 and P6 for real-time PCR analysis.

These data suggest that the p107 compensation in the postnatal Rb-deficient mouse retina (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, C</xref>) helped to prevent deregulated proliferation but did not rescue the rod differentiation phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Rb is also expressed in a small subset of embryonic retinal progenitor cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), and subtle defects may occur in <italic>Rb</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryonic retinas if p107 does not compensate at this stage of development.

Together, these genetic analyses suggest that reciprocal compensation between Rb and p107 in retinal progenitor cells prevents deregulated proliferation during development.

There were no defects in cell-fate specification or differentiation in p107-deficient retinas; thus, we propose that p107 primarily regulates retinal progenitor cell proliferation in the embryonic retina. Rb is expressed in postnatal retinal progenitor cells and differentiating neurons and glia. Consistent with a role in cell-fate specification or differentiation, Rb was expressed throughout the cell cycle and continued to be expressed as cells entered G0. In the absence of Rb, immature cells persist in the ONL and rod photoreceptors failed to form, a finding that indicates that Rb regulates the developmental processes in this specific sublineage.</p><p>Recent studies have extended these findings by focusing on the mechanism of Rb's role in rod development. Sun and colleagues generated an exon-specific knock-in allele of <italic>Rb </italic>with a single amino acid substitution (R654W) that reduces Rb binding to E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

Moreover, we predict that inactivation of the E2F that regulates this putative "rod repressor" would rescue the rod developmental defect. Preliminary data have shown that <italic>Rb;E2F1</italic>-deficient retinas have normal rod development, a finding that suggests that E2F1 is involved in this important developmental process.</p><p>Our data suggest that Rb and p107 share the same role in regulating mouse retinal progenitor cell proliferation but the role of Rb is unique in rods. An extensive genetic analysis of p130 is beyond the scope of this manuscript, but based on our expression studies and [<sup>3</sup>H]thy-labeling experiments, we predict that Rb and p130 are redundant in newly postmitotic cells of the INL and GCL. It is not known if p130 is required for terminal cell cycle exit in the developing retina, for maintaining cells in the postmitotic state or both.</p><p>A recent study published by Spencer and colleagues characterized the expression of the Rb family in developing mouse retina and adult human retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Our data differ from theirs, and we have presented the most relevant differences in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Our analysis combined several independent methods (real-time RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, immunostaining of tissue sections, immunostaining of [<sup>3</sup>H]thy-labeled dissociated cells and immunoblotting); these approaches provided the same overall picture of the dynamic changes in the expression of the Rb family during seven stages of mouse retinal development. Spencer and colleagues provided a more limited data set with internal inconsistencies. For example, immunostaining was done on samples from just three stages of mouse retinal development (E14, P0 and P5), and in situ hybridization was carried out for Rb but not for p107 or p130. Their real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting data show high levels of p107 expression in the embryonic retinas, but no p107+ nuclei are detected in their immunostained sections. Clearly, all expression data are limited by the reagents being used. For example, it is possible that the Rb, p107 and p130 expression patterns in our study or that of Spencer and colleagues are broader than reported due to the limited sensitivity of the antibodies used. We have attempted to minimize such limitations by combining several independent approaches such as in situ hybridization, immunostaining, real time RT-PCR and dissociated cell staining. Nontheless, we anticipate that the retinal expression pattern of the Rb family will be further refined as new reagents become available.</p></sec><sec><title>Rb family redundancy and compensation in the developing mouse retina</title><p>The Rb family proteins are expressed in a dynamic manner during mouse retinal development. We show here that p107 is expressed in proliferating retinal progenitor cells in the embryonic retina and is downregulated as cells exit the cell cycle and undergo terminal differentiation. Around birth, the expression of p107 tapers off, and that of Rb takes it place in proliferating retinal progenitor cells. Rb expression persists in postmitotic differentiating neurons and glia of the mouse retina. The p130 protein is expressed in the late postnatal period of mouse retinal development. As cells exit the cell cycle, they upregulate p130, and its expression persists in postmitotic differentiating cells of the INL and GCL. Based on the expression pattern alone, one might predict that proliferation would be deregulated in p107-deficient embryonic retinas and Rb-deficient postnatal retinas. However, we report here that when p107 is inactivated, Rb is upregulated in a compensatory manner in the embryonic retina. Similarly, when Rb is inactivated, p107 is upregulated in a compensatory manner in the postnatal retina. There is no evidence for compensation by p130 in either Rb- or p107-deficient retinas.</p><p>One of the interesting features of the compensation that we uncovered in this study is the haploinsufficiency of <italic>p107 </italic>in this process. We show here that two copies of <italic>p107 </italic>are required for efficient compensation of <italic>Rb </italic>loss, but only one copy of <italic>Rb </italic>is required to compensate for <italic>p107 </italic>loss. This may indicate that there are different mechanisms for <italic>Rb </italic>and <italic>p107 </italic>gene compensation or that retinal progenitor cells exhibit different sensitivities to Rb and p107 protein levels. One intriguing possibility is that <italic>p107 </italic>haploinsufficiency for compensation may reflect the differential binding of Rb and p107 to different E2F family members.</p><p>It has been shown previously that <italic>p107 </italic>is an E2F-responsive gene; therefore, the mechanisms for p107 compensation most likely involve a direct feedback loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, the mechanism for Rb compensation in the absence of p107 has not been elucidated. We propose that Rb-deficient retinal progenitor cells fail to form retinoblastoma because p107 is upregulated in a compensatory manner. However, it is possible that there is some overlapping, redundant expression around P0 in the developing mouse retina. Interestingly, Rb and p130 are expressed redundantly in the INL and GCL. The recent observation that retinoblastoma develops in <italic>Rb;p130</italic>-deficient retinas suggests that redundant expression of these two Rb family members prevents retinoblastoma in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies using <italic>Rb</italic><sup>-/- </sup>MEFs demonstrated that inactivation of <italic>Rb </italic>in proliferating cells leads to compensatory upregulation of p107 and quiescence after serum starvation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The <italic>p107 </italic>gene is persistently expressed in these quiescent <italic>Rb</italic>-deficient MEFs and is required for maintaining them in G0. When <italic>Rb </italic>was acutely inactivated in quiescent <italic>Rb</italic><sup><italic>Lox</italic>/<italic>Lox </italic></sup>MEFs, p107 was not immediately upregulated in a compensatory manner, and the cells re-entered the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

The molecular changes that occur in MEFs as they become quiescent have been compared with those that accompany terminal cell cycle exit during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

In these experiments, we compared the effects of acute gene inactivation on proliferating retinal progenitor cells and newly postmitotic transition cells. The newly postmitotic <italic>Rb</italic>-deficient transition cells in which <italic>p107 </italic>was acutely inactivated did not show extensive ectopic cell division. These data are consistent with the idea that p107 is important in regulating retinal progenitor cell proliferation but not in preventing newly postmitotic cells from re-entering the cell cycle. However, a small subset of postmitotic cells still re-entered the cell cycle following acute <italic>Rb </italic>inactivation in <italic>p107-</italic>deficient retinas. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the retinoblastoma cell of origin is a retinal transition cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Definitive proof will rely on following the expansion of clones lacking p107 and Rb to determine whether any rare transition cells re-enter the cell cycle and expand to generate retinoblastoma or if only retinal progenitor cells continue to proliferate, as shown here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Our data on the proliferation of <italic>Rb;p107</italic>-deficient retinal cells during development contrasts with previous studies by Chen and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We show that ectopically dividing retinal cells are present at P0, P6, P12 and P30, whereas the previous study argued that proliferation ceased at P30. This difference at P30 may be due to the more sensitive and reproducible [<sup>3</sup>H]thy labeling we used in our study compared to the BrdU labeling used by Chen et al. Alternatively, it could reflect the non-cell-autonomous effect of broad <italic>Rb </italic>inactivation in <italic>Pax6-Cre;Rb</italic><sup><italic>Lox</italic>/<italic>Lox</italic></sup>; <italic>p107</italic><sup>-/- </sup>retinas examined by Chen et al. compared with the more restricted mosaic <italic>Rb </italic>inactivation in <italic>Chx10-Cre;Rb</italic><sup><italic>Lox</italic>/-</sup>; <italic>p107</italic><sup>-/- </sup>retinas that we investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Another difference between our data and the study previously published by Chen and colleagues involves the interpretation of the markers expressed in proliferating cells of the <italic>Rb;p107</italic>-deficient retinas. We found that at P0, the ectopically dividing cells were largely Pax6+ (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). By P6, the proliferating cells were Pax6+, Chx10+ (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>) and by P12, they were Pax6+, Chx10+ and syntaxin<sup>+ </sup>(see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>). Pax6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and syntaxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] are expressed in both retinal progenitor cells and differentiating amacrine cells. Chx10 is expressed in retinal progenitor cells and in differentiated bipolar cells and M&#x000fc;ller glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Interestingly, at P12 we noted that GFAP+ M&#x000fc;ller glia were also [<sup>3</sup>H]thy+. This finding is consistent with proliferation associated with reactive gliosis in <italic>Rb;p107</italic>-deficient retinas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Chx10 immunopositivity may mark the proliferating M&#x000fc;ller glia, bipolar cells or progenitor cells at this stage. However, we do not believe that the Chx10+ cells are bipolar cells, because there were no PKC&#x003b1;+ cells that incorporated [<sup>3</sup>H]thy at P12. At P30, most of the proliferating [<sup>3</sup>H]thy+ cells were syntaxin+. A smaller proportion were Pax6+, recoverin+ and PKC&#x003b1;+. Recoverin is expressed in a subset of bipolar cells as well as photoreceptors, so the PKC&#x003b1;+ and recoverin+ cells that incorporated [<sup>3</sup>H]thy are most likely a small cohort of bipolar cells that re-entered the cell cycle.</p><p>Based on the timeline of marker colocalization with [<sup>3</sup>H]thy that we present here, we propose that a Pax6+, Chx10+ and syntaxin+ retinal progenitor cell population that is biased toward the amacrine/horizontal cell fate continues to proliferate through development in <italic>Chx10-Cre;Rb</italic><sup><italic>Lox</italic>/-</sup>; <italic>p107</italic><sup>-/- </sup>retinas and eventually gives rise to retinoblastoma. This model is consistent with the extensive differentiation of mouse retinoblastomas along amacrine/horizontal cell lineage (Johnson and Dyer, in preparation). There is an occasional round of ectopic proliferation in reactive M&#x000fc;ller glia and possibly bipolar cells at P30, but based on the absence of glial and bipolar markers in mouse retinoblastomas, we propose that these cells do not contribute significantly to retinoblastoma in mice.</p><p>Chen and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] showed that Pax6+, Chx10+, Prox1+, Math3+, Crx+ and Hes5+ cells incorporated BrdU. With the possible exception of Crx, each of these markers is expressed in both progenitor cells and differentiated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We have found that several additional retinal progenitor cell markers (syntaxin 1, Fgf15, Sfrp1, Erdr1 and Eya2) are expressed in proliferating cells of <italic>Rb;p107</italic>-deficient retinas. Overall, 10 of the 11 genes that are expressed in proliferating <italic>Rb;p107</italic>-deficient retinal cells have one feature in common; they are all expressed normally in retinal progenitor cells. The morphological features of the <italic>Rb;p107</italic>-deficient retinal cells in electron micrographs are also consistent with retinal progenitor cells. While these data support the hypothesis that retinal progenitor cells continue to divide during development of <italic>Rb;p107</italic>-deficient retinas and eventually give rise to retinoblastoma in mice, marker expression alone cannot distinguish between a progenitor cell and a transition cell as the cell of origin for retinoblastoma (discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]). Definitive proof of the cell of origin for retinoblastoma will require clonal analysis of tumor formation from a single cell in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Retinoblastoma susceptibility in mice and humans</title><p>When the <italic>Rb</italic>-knockout mouse was generated over 13 years ago, it was expected that retinoblastoma would develop in <italic>Rb</italic><sup>+/- </sup>mice, as it does in <italic>RB1</italic><sup>+/- </sup>humans. However, that was not the case. We show here that the normal expression of Rb family members is dynamic during mouse retinal development and that reciprocal compensation between Rb and p107 may prevent retinoblastoma in mice.</p><p>In the human fetal retina, <italic>RB1 </italic>is the major family member expressed during much of retinal development. There is little or no expression of p107. We acutely inactivated <italic>RB1 </italic>in primary human fetal retinas by electroporating an SiRNA to <italic>RB1</italic>. We demonstrated that although the RB1 protein was downregulated 20-fold, there was no compensation by p107 or p130. These data suggest that humans are susceptible to retinoblastoma formation after <italic>RB1 </italic>inactivation, because they cannot upregulate p107 in a compensatory manner. It is possible that the 20-fold reduction in RB1 protein induced by the SiRNA used for these experiments is not sufficient to induce p107 compensation. However, we do not believe this is the case because another RB1 target gene (<italic>p14</italic><sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup>) is induced by 10-fold following acute RB1 inactivation using the same SiRNA (Laurie et al., submitted). One possible explanation for the lack of compensation in the human retina is that the <italic>p107 </italic>promoter is sequestered in an inactive chromatin conformation in human fetal retina, but it is in an active chromatin conformation in mouse retinal progenitor cells and is thus poised to respond to a loss of Rb. Indeed, it is believed that promoters and genes that have been recently transcribed remain in an active chromatin configuration. Therefore, this model is consistent with the expression data for mouse and human <italic>p107</italic>. That is, the embryonic expression of p107 in the mouse retina results in an open chromatin conformation, thereby making it readily accessible for compensatory upregulation if <italic>Rb </italic>is inactivated. Detailed promoter and transcription analyses will be required to test this hypothesis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have found that Rb and p107 are expressed in a largely non-overlapping pattern during mouse retinal development and that reciprocal compensation between these two Rb family members prevents retinoblastoma in mice. p107 compensation occurs whether Rb is inactivated chronically or acutely. In human retinal development, there is very little p107 expressed and compensation does not occur when RB1 is inactivated using an siRNA. We propose that this difference in compensation between mice and humans may explain why humans are susceptible to retinoblastoma following <italic>RB1 </italic>gene inactivation but mice require simultaneous inactivation of the <italic>Rb </italic>and <italic>p107 </italic>genes.</p><p>Our data also shed light on the retinoblastoma cell of origin. Proliferating retinal progenitor cells are disproportionately more susceptible to deregulated proliferation following <italic>Rb;p107 </italic>gene inactivation in comparison to newly postmitotic transition cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Consistent with this observation, 10 of 11 genes expressed in proliferating <italic>Rb;p107</italic>-deficient retinal cells are normally expressed in retinal progenitor cells. Electron micrographs of <italic>Rb;p107</italic>-deficient retinal cells provides further support for an immature cell with features of progenitor cells as the retinoblastoma cell of origin. However, based on our data, it remains a formal possibility that a postmitotic amacrine or horizontal cell is the retinoblastoma cell of origin. Ongoing lineage studies should help to determine if a progenitor cell, a postmitotic neuron or both can give rise to retinoblastoma in mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mouse strains</title><p><italic>Rb</italic><sup>+/- </sup>mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), and <italic>Rb</italic><sup><italic>Lox</italic>/<italic>Lox </italic></sup>mice were obtained from the National Cancer Institute.

To label S-phase retinal progenitor cells, we incubated freshly dissected retinas in 1 ml explant culture medium containing [<sup>3</sup>H]thy (5 &#x003bc;Ci/ml; 89 &#x003bc;Ci/mmol) or 10 &#x003bc;M BrdU for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C. For these pulse-labeling experiments, retinas were dissected at four stages of development (E14.5, E17.5, P0, and P2) and exposed to the label for various durations (0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h) to allow retinal progenitor cells to progress through the cell cycle. The p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>protein, which is upregulated at G1/G0, was used as an internal control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D, H, L</xref>), because its expression during retinal development has been characterized previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Autoradiography and BrdU detection were carried out as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].

Retinas were sonicated in RIPA with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to clear the lysate. The debris was pelleted, and the concentration of each lysate was determined using a Bradford assay (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Lysate (30 &#x003bc;g) was loaded onto each lane and transferred to nitrocellulose. Each antibody was used at a dilution of 1:1000, and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:5000. The Amersham ECL system (Piscataway, NJ) was used to detect antibody binding per the manufacturer's instructions. For in situ hybridization, retinas from each stage of development were rapidly dissected, fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/PBS and embedded in OCT before freezing on dry ice.
