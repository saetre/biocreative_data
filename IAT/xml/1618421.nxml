The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana FWA</italic> gene contains two tandem repeats and is an efficient target for RNA-directed de novo DNA methylation when it is transformed into plants. We showed that the <italic>FWA</italic> tandem repeats are necessary and sufficient for de novo DNA methylation and that repeated character rather than intrinsic sequence is likely important. Endogenous <italic>FWA</italic> can adopt either of two stable epigenetic states: methylated and silenced or unmethylated and active. Surprisingly, we found small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) associated with <italic>FWA</italic> in both states. Despite this, only the methylated form of endogenous <italic>FWA</italic> could recruit further RNA-directed DNA methylation or cause efficient de novo methylation of transgenic <italic>FWA</italic>. This suggests that RNA-directed DNA methylation occurs in two steps: first, the initial recruitment of the siRNA-producing machinery, and second, siRNA-directed DNA methylation either in <italic>cis</italic> or in <italic>trans</italic>. The efficiency of this second step varies depending on the nature of the siRNA-producing locus, and at some loci, it may require pre-existing chromatin modifications such as DNA methylation itself. Enhancement of RNA-directed DNA methylation by pre-existing DNA methylation could create a self-reinforcing system to enhance the stability of silencing. Tandem repeats throughout the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome produce siRNAs, suggesting that repeat acquisition may be a general mechanism for the evolution of gene silencing.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>In<italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> methylation and silencing mediated by the<italic>FWA</italic> transgene are found to require the tandem repeat sequences upstream of<italic>FWA</italic> and to be independent of siRNA association.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Chan SWL, Zhang X, Bernatavichute YV, Jacobsen SE (2006) Two-step recruitment of RNA-directed DNA methylation to tandem repeats.

Because <italic>FWA</italic> is only demethylated in the terminally differentiating endosperm, it remains heritably methylated throughout the plant life cycle.

These alleles are very stable, and remethylation that re-establishes an early-flowering phenotype has never been observed.</p><p>In both plants and animals, de novo DNA methylation of previously unmethylated sequences is mediated by DNA methyltransferase enzymes of the Dnmt3 family (DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE2 &#x0005b;DRM2&#x0005d; in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, the maintenance of pre-existing DNA methylation is sequence context&#x02013;dependent. CG DNA methylation is maintained by MET1 (a homolog of mammalian Dnmt1), whereas CNG and asymmetric methylation are maintained by the overlapping functions of CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3) and DRM2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>De novo DNA methylation can be studied in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> by transforming plants with an additional copy of <italic>FWA</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Despite the extreme stability of an unmethylated <italic>fwa</italic> endogenous allele, a transgenic copy of <italic>FWA</italic> introduced into wild-type plants by <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation is always de novo methylated and silenced. Because both endogenous and transgenic <italic>FWA</italic> are silenced, transformed plants do not display a late-flowering phenotype. However, when <italic>drm2</italic> mutant plants are transformed with <italic>FWA,</italic> the introduced transgenes remain unmethylated, and <italic>FWA</italic> overexpression causes a late-flowering phenotype. In <italic>drm2</italic> transformants, endogenous <italic>FWA</italic> retains its methylation and silencing, because DRM2 only controls de novo methylation but not maintenance methylation of CG sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Intriguingly, when unmethylated <italic>FWA</italic> transgenes from <italic>drm2</italic> transformants are outcrossed to reintroduce wild-type <italic>DRM2,</italic> the transgenes remain stably unmethylated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. This is consistent with the stability of unmethylated <italic>fwa</italic> endogenous alleles and suggests that <italic>FWA</italic> de novo DNA methylation only occurs during the process of plant transformation.</p><p>RNA interference (RNAi) is a versatile silencing pathway in which double-stranded RNA is processed by Dicer nucleases to generate 21&#x02013;24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. siRNAs can down-regulate gene expression through mRNA cleavage, translational inhibition, or transcriptional silencing. Previously, we used the <italic>FWA</italic> transformation assay to demonstrate that de novo DNA methylation by DRM2 is guided by an RNAi pathway including the NUCLEAR RNA POLYMERASE IV A (NRPD1a) subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase IV (RNA Pol IV), RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE2 (RDR2), DICER-LIKE3 (DCL3), and ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. The recent discovery that a maize ortholog of <italic>RDR2</italic> is required for paramutation demonstrates that RNA-directed DNA methylation at tandem repeats is conserved in both monocots and eudicots &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition to their defects in establishment of DNA methylation, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RNAi mutants reduce or eliminate CNG and asymmetric DNA methylation at endogenous tandem repeats and other sequences in a manner analogous to that of <italic>drm2</italic> mutants. However, at most loci, the maintenance of CG methylation in <italic>drm2</italic> or the RNAi mutants is generally unaffected. These results show that RNAi-related processes are required to propagate non-CG DNA methylation; meaning that, even after establishment, siRNA production likely persists at particular genomic loci.</p><p>Although it seems clear that de novo DNA methylation derives its sequence specificity from siRNAs, it is not known why transformed <italic>FWA</italic> is targeted for DNA methylation, unlike the majority of single-copy <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes transformed into plants. Here we show that the tandem repeats of <italic>FWA</italic> are necessary and sufficient for triggering de novo DNA methylation, and that repeated character (rather than the <italic>FWA</italic> sequence itself) is likely critical. Transformed <italic>FWA</italic> can silence the unmethylated endogenous <italic>fwa</italic> gene in <italic>trans,</italic> and this property also requires tandem repeats. Surprisingly, the methylation state of endogenous <italic>FWA</italic> can affect silencing of an incoming transgene, because <italic>FWA</italic> transformed into <italic>fwa-1</italic> is inefficiently methylated compared to wild type. The fact that DNA methylation enhances the ability of endogenous <italic>FWA</italic> to communicate with transformed <italic>FWA</italic> is particularly striking, because both methylated and unmethylated forms of endogenous <italic>FWA</italic> produce equivalent levels of siRNAs. Furthermore, we show that <italic>FWA</italic> siRNA synthesis is dependent on wild-type NRPD1a, RDR2, and DCL3, but not on the putatively downstream components NRPD1b, AGO4, DEFECTIVE IN RNA-DIRECTED DNA METHYLATION1 (DRD1), and DRM2. Our results suggest a two-step model for DNA methylation, in which tandem repeats are sufficient to recruit NRPD1a, RDR2, and DCL3 to produce siRNAs, but a second triggering event such as plant transformation is required to allow siRNAs to target downstream DNA methylation. Finally, a genomic analysis suggests that unique tandem repeats, such as those at <italic>FWA,</italic> are common targets for the siRNA machinery, indicating the potential generality of this gene silencing mechanism on an evolutionary time scale.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>FWA</italic> De Novo DNA Methylation during Plant Transformation Can Occur after Fertilization of the Female Gametophyte</title><p>Although an unmethylated <italic>fwa</italic> endogenous allele never becomes spontaneously methylated, de novo DNA methylation of transformed <italic>FWA</italic> occurs with 100&#x00025; efficiency &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, unmethylated <italic>FWA</italic> transgenes in <italic>drm2</italic> transformants are not de novo methylated when crossed to plants containing functional <italic>DRM2</italic>. This suggests that de novo methylation of <italic>FWA</italic> occurs either during the transformation process, or shortly thereafter, and we sought to determine more precisely when this event occurs. During the floral dip procedure, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</named-content> transforms the female gametophytic lineage of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (probably the egg cell itself), integrating its transferred DNA (T-DNA) only into the maternal genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. We transformed <italic>FWA</italic> into heterozygous <italic>rdr2&#x02013;1/RDR2, ago4&#x02013;1/AGO4,</italic> and <italic>drm1&#x02013;1/DRM1 drm2&#x02013;1/DRM2</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040363-g001">Figure 1</xref>). If DNA methylation and gene silencing must be established in the female gametophyte, then the haploid genotype of the gametophyte should control de novo DNA methylation and one-half of the transformed T1 progeny would be late flowering. However, if a wild-type <italic>RDR2, AGO4,</italic> or <italic>DRM2</italic> gene from the pollen could rescue de novo DNA methylation in the fertilized zygote, only one in four plants would fail to silence <italic>FWA</italic> and flower late (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040363-g001">Figure 1</xref>; this ratio could also be explained if de novo DNA methylation requires a factor that moves from the fertilized extra-embryonic endosperm into the zygote). A third possibility is that maternally supplied protein or mRNA could rescue de novo DNA methylation, causing all progeny of a heterozygous mutant to be early flowering.</p><p>We found that all three experiments showed an early:late flowering ratio close to 3:1 amongst <italic>FWA</italic> T1 transformants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040363-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This early-to-late ratio of flowering plants is consistent with zygotic control, but it could also arise if de novo DNA methylation occurred in the gamete but half the mutant gametes were rescued by maternally supplied protein or mRNA. To eliminate this possibility, we used PCR-based molecular markers to genotype 23 late-flowering T1 progeny of <italic>rdr2&#x02013;1/RDR2</italic> plants and 18 late-flowering T1 progeny of <italic>ago4&#x02013;1/AGO4</italic> plants. All were homozygous mutant for <italic>rdr2&#x02013;1</italic> or <italic>ago4&#x02013;1,</italic> respectively (unpublished data), indicating that the genotype of the fertilized zygote or endosperm determines whether an <italic>FWA</italic> transgene is silenced. Thus, although <italic>FWA</italic> de novo DNA methylation requires plant transformation, the particular conditions that facilitate de novo DNA methylation must persist until sometime after fertilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><italic>FWA</italic> Tandem Repeats Are Necessary and Sufficient to Trigger De Novo Methylation</title><p>DNA methylation of <italic>FWA</italic> is restricted to the two pairs of tandem repeats at the farthest 5' end of its transcribed region, suggesting that they play a key role in controlling gene silencing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The <italic>FWA</italic> tandem repeats are 2 &#x000d7; 38 base pairs (bp) and 2 &#x000d7; 198 bp in length. To test the role of tandem repeats in <italic>FWA</italic> de novo DNA methylation, we cloned several deletion variants of <italic>FWA</italic>. Because some of these variants did not contain the <italic>FWA</italic> open reading frame, they would not be expected to cause late flowering when transformed into wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> meaning that we could not use transgene-induced late flowering as an assay. Therefore, we took advantage of the observation that transforming the late-flowering <italic>fwa-1</italic> mutant with a cosmid containing <italic>FWA</italic> causes the occasional appearance of early-flowering plants among first generation T1 transformants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Despite the fact that <italic>fwa-1</italic> plants never regain DNA methylation during normal plant growth, both transgenic and endogenous <italic>FWA</italic> genes contain DNA methylation in early-flowering <italic>fwa-1 &#x0002b; FWA</italic> plants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. This shows that transformed <italic>FWA</italic> can target de novo DNA methylation to the unmethylated endogenous <italic>fwa</italic> gene, albeit inefficiently.</p><p>We transformed <italic>fwa-1</italic> plants with a 6.1 kilobase <italic>FWA</italic> transgene, and found that 5&#x00025;&#x02013;25&#x00025; of transformants had an early-flowering phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040363-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), an effect similar to that caused by <italic>FWA</italic> cosmid transformation. Deleting the <italic>FWA</italic> open reading frame did not abolish the ability of the transgene to silence endogenous <italic>FWA,</italic> but a version lacking the tandem repeats altogether yielded no early-flowering transformants. The tandem repeats alone cloned into an <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> vector were able to cause <italic>trans-</italic>silencing, showing that this region of <italic>FWA</italic> is responsible for the activity. Most importantly, an <italic>FWA</italic> transgene containing a single copy of each tandem repeat sequence (&#x0201c;single-copy <italic>FWA</italic>&#x0201d;) was unable to silence endogenous <italic>fwa</italic>. The &#x0201c;repeats deleted&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;single-copy&#x0201d; transgenes did not cause late flowering when transformed into the <italic>rdr2&#x02013;1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040363-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), indicating that they are not transcribed even when de novo DNA methylation is compromised. Therefore, the flowering time of <italic>fwa-1</italic> plants that were transformed with these transgenes is not influenced by transgene expression, and transgenes lacking tandem repeat character are incapable of silencing endogenous <italic>FWA</italic>.</p><p>It is possible that transcriptional activity of an <italic>FWA</italic> transgene contributes to the silencing of the endogenous copy of <italic>FWA</italic> in <italic>trans</italic>. Therefore, we sought to test de novo DNA methylation of the transgene directly by transforming single-copy <italic>FWA</italic> into wild-type plants and measuring DNA methylation of the transgene by bisulfite genomic sequencing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The complete <italic>FWA</italic> gene transformed into wild type was robustly methylated in the T1 generation, but a single-copy <italic>FWA</italic> transgene was completely unmethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040363-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). We showed previously that de novo DNA methylation of <italic>FWA</italic> requires the siRNA-metabolizing factors PolIVa, RDR2, DCL3, and AGO4. Together with the data presented here, these results suggest that RNA-directed DNA methylation is recruited to the <italic>FWA</italic> tandem repeat sequences during plant transformation. Although tandem repeats are associated with many gene-silencing phenomena, in this instance it is clear that a single copy of the same sequence lacks the behavior of the tandem repeat. We interpret these results to mean that the repeated character of transformed <italic>FWA,</italic> rather than its intrinsic sequence, is required to target DNA methylation to the unmethylated endogenous gene. An alternate explanation is that a sequence-specific factor recognizes transformed <italic>FWA</italic> and binds cooperatively in a manner that requires two copies of the repeats.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Efficient Silencing of Transformed <italic>FWA</italic> Requires DNA Methylation of Endogenous <italic>FWA</italic></title><p>Silencing of unmethylated, endogenous <italic>fwa</italic> by transformed <italic>FWA</italic> shows that an incoming transgene can communicate with an identical endogenous sequence. When unmethylated <italic>fwa-1</italic> mutants are transformed with <italic>FWA,</italic> early-flowering transformants must have silenced both the transgenic and endogenous <italic>FWA</italic> genes, because overexpression of any copy of <italic>FWA</italic> causes a dominant late-flowering phenotype. We sought to determine the fate of the <italic>FWA</italic> transgene in the majority of late-flowering <italic>fwa-1 &#x0002b; FWA</italic> transformants, where endogenous <italic>FWA</italic> is still overexpressed. We expected that the <italic>FWA</italic> transgene would be efficiently methylated in all transformants, reasoning that <italic>cis</italic> methylation of the transgene would be more efficient than <italic>trans</italic> methylation of the endogenous gene induced by the transgene (overexpression of the unmethylated endogenous gene would still cause late flowering, masking silencing of the transgenic copy). To our surprise, however, we found that transgenic <italic>FWA</italic> was completely unmethylated in late-flowering <italic>fwa-1</italic> &#x0002b; <italic>FWA</italic> T1 transformants, when assayed either by bisulfite genomic sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040363-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), or by testing 19 individual transformants using a bisulfite PCR/restriction enzyme assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040363-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). <italic>FWA</italic> transformed into wild-type plants is methylated with 100&#x00025; efficiency, yet our experiment shows that <italic>FWA</italic> transformed into <italic>fwa-1</italic> plants is seldom methylated. Thus, efficient de novo DNA methylation of transformed <italic>FWA</italic> requires DNA methylation of endogenous <italic>FWA.</italic> This demonstrates a second type of communication, in which the endogenous methylated <italic>FWA</italic> gene assists DNA methylation of an incoming transgenic copy.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>siRNAs Are Produced from Both Methylated and Unmethylated Forms of <italic>FWA</italic></title><p>We wished to correlate these gene silencing phenomena with the production of <italic>FWA</italic> siRNAs.

Tandem repeats that are found in multiple genomic locations may resemble transposons in that they could be sensed by a cellular mechanism devoted to high-copy dispersed repeats. We therefore filtered our tandem repeat library to remove any type of dispersed or inverted repeat character. We used BLAST (set to detect short, nearly perfect matches) to filter tandem repeats present at more than one genomic locus, RepBase to remove additional annotated transposons and repeats, and Inverted Repeats Finder &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d; to exclude inverted repeats. Lastly, we restricted our analysis to tandem repeats outside of pericentromeric heterochromatin, because these should be less susceptible to silencing by adjacent transposons and high-copy sequences.</p><p>This preliminary analysis identified a set of 1494 &#x0201c;unique&#x0201d; tandem repeats from euchromatic regions of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040363-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), similar to the repeats found in <italic>FWA</italic>. We compared these to previously defined dense or moderate siRNA clusters, representing regions containing &#x0003e;11 cloned siRNAs without an intervening 500-bp gap &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d; (single isolated siRNAs or sparse siRNA clusters were not considered in this study, because they might represent random matches). Thirty unique tandem repeats spread throughout the genome overlapped with siRNA clusters, representing 2.0&#x00025; of unique tandem repeats. To compare unique tandem repeats with a relevant control sample of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome, we constructed a library of random 141-bp windows (the mean length of unique tandem repeats) from the euchromatic left arm of chromosome 1 using the same filtering procedure and threshold to remove repeated sequences or transposons. From a library of 5945 random windows, we found 14 that overlapped with dense or moderate siRNA clusters (0.24&#x00025;). Thus, tandem repeats are nearly an order of magnitude more likely to produce siRNAs than random, nonrepeated sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040363-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). This enrichment is statistically significant, because the probability of selecting 30 siRNA-producing sequences at random was calculated at 1.0951 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup> using a one-sided binomial distribution.</p><p>We next analyzed whether the presence of siRNAs was positively correlated with the presence of DNA methylation at unique tandem repeats, by comparing these loci to a genome-wide DNA methylation survey in which methylated DNA was immunoprecipitated and hybridized to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> whole genome tiling microarrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040363-g006">Figure 6</xref>C) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

This difference was highly statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040363-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). As tandem repeats with siRNAs are more frequently methylated than those without siRNAs, we infer that siRNA production may contribute to the maintenance of DNA methylation at these loci.</p><p>Because only a subset of unique tandem repeats produces siRNA, some other factors must determine whether stable siRNA production can exist at a given locus. We compared unique tandem repeats with and without siRNAs for several properties, including the overall length of the tandem repeat, repeat unit length, repeat copy number, average identity of repeat units, percentage of insertions and deletions (indels), and nucleotide sequence content. We found that tandem repeats with siRNAs were not significantly different in any of these characteristics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040363-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Thus, it may be that chromosomal context, some unknown feature of the DNA repeat sequence, or a particular set of chromatin modifications may influence which tandem repeats maintain siRNA production. We also analyzed the expression level of genes with unique tandem repeats in their promoters, and found that their expression was not significantly lower than those without tandem repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040363-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). However, the importance of this result is unclear, because these tandem repeats may not affect promoter regions required for gene expression.

Furthermore, continued siRNA production is correlated with the maintenance of DNA methylation.

Most tandem repeats probably arise from single-copy sequences by internal duplication. The <italic>FWA</italic> tandem repeats were proposed to arise from a SINE transposon insertion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. However, plant SINE elements do not contain tandem repeats, and a secondary duplication event would therefore be necessary to create the current <italic>FWA</italic> 5&#x02032; untranslated region &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, the low level of similarity between the <italic>FWA</italic> tandem repeats and other <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> sequences (or any sequences in GenBank) suggests that other possibilities for their origin may be plausible. In particular, we propose a hypothetical yet parsimonious model in which the <italic>FWA</italic> tandem repeats could have arisen from an ancestral unrepeated sequence by a single internal duplication event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040363-g007">Figure 7</xref>). After their creation, tandem repeats appear to be preferential targets for siRNA-producing machinery, both at <italic>FWA</italic> and throughout the genome.</p><p>During the first step in which siRNAs are produced from tandem repeats, it seems likely that NRPD1a-containing Pol IV produces a single-stranded RNA that is a substrate for RDR2, which then produces a double-stranded RNA that is diced by DCL3. How NRPD1a-Pol IV might initially recognize a tandem repeat however is not known. Robust siRNA production can occur at this stage without the presence of DNA methylation, showing that RNAi proteins recognize the intrinsic properties of tandem repeats without features of silent chromatin. In the second step, downstream DNA methylation factors use siRNAs to cause DNA methylation. Our discovery that recruitment of siRNA production is separable from downstream RNA-directed DNA methylation is consistent with previously published data showing the existence of unmethylated <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> loci that produce siRNAs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>NRPD1b-containing Pol IV is not required to produce siRNAs, and we feel its role may be to generate a single-stranded transcript that is bound by an AGO4/siRNA complex, which in turn recruits the DRM2 DNA methyltransferase to a particular genomic locus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. DRD1 may remodel chromatin, assisting the activity of DRM2. This model for siRNA-directed DNA methylation is attractive, because it does not require the AGO4/siRNA complex to unwind the chromosomal double helix and interact with homologous single-stranded DNA. It is also consistent with evidence from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</named-content> showing that transcription by RNA Pol II plays a role in RNAi-mediated transcriptional gene silencing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>A key insight from these studies is that the ability of siRNAs to cause DNA methylation depends on the nature of the siRNA-producing locus. siRNAs produced from methylated and unmethylated forms of <italic>FWA</italic> appear to be made by the same upstream RNAi components. However, siRNAs from unmethylated <italic>fwa</italic> do not target de novo DNA methylation in <italic>cis,</italic> and lack the ability to enhance silencing of transformed <italic>FWA</italic> in <italic>trans</italic>. One possible explanation is that these siRNAs may not be loaded into AGO4 after they are released from the DCL3 nuclease, or that factors downstream of AGO4 are not recruited to unmethylated loci.</p><p>In contrast to unmethylated loci, tandem repeats with pre-existing CG DNA methylation are susceptible to RNA-directed DNA methylation when siRNA production is recruited. This is shown by the fact that non-CG DNA methylation by NRPD1b/AGO4/DRD1/DRM2 returns to <italic>FWA</italic> and <italic>MEA-ISR</italic> when RNAi proteins are restored in a <italic>nrpd1a</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>rdr2</italic> cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040363-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Exactly how CG DNA methylation facilitates RNA-directed DNA methylation is unclear. One possibility is that methyl-binding domain proteins interpret CG DNA methylation directly to recruit AGO4 and associated factors. Alternatively, another chromatin modification associated with DNA methylation could be key. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome contains many sites of CG-only DNA methylation, particularly in the coding region of genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. One hypothesis that may explain why these sites do not recruit the non-CG methylation machinery is that CG-only sites lack tandem repeats and hence do not produce siRNAs. Although the maintenance methyltransferase enzyme MET1 is capable of maintaining CG-only regions of DNA methylation though a passive maintenance mechanism, tandem repeats that have both CG maintenance DNA methylation and persistent siRNA-directed non-CG DNA methylation may be more likely to retain their silent status over evolutionary time scales.</p><p>The process of plant transformation can also facilitate RNA-directed DNA methylation, because an <italic>FWA</italic> gene introduced by <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> is efficiently de novo methylated upon integration. Transformation also allows incoming <italic>FWA</italic> to cause de novo DNA methylation of the endogenous <italic>FWA</italic> gene (at a low frequency), bypassing the requirement for preexisting CG DNA methylation in recruiting RNA-directed DNA methylation. <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> introduces its T-DNA into plant cells as a single-stranded DNA molecule, which is copied into double-stranded DNA before its integration into the plant genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Multiple steps in this pathway could be responsible for potentiating siRNA-directed de novo DNA methylation. For example, increased siRNA levels could be a key factor associated with plant transformation. The effect of very high siRNA levels on de novo DNA methylation is shown by highly transcribed inverted repeat transgenes that target DNA methylation to homologous sequences independent of plant transformation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatively, a newly integrated transgene may possess a chromatin state that is permissive for RNA-directed DNA methylation, perhaps because of a particular set of histone modifications or lower nucleosome density. Such a permissive state might be maintained for several cell divisions after transformation (consistent with our observation that de novo DNA methylation occurs after fertilization of the female egg cell). A similarly susceptible state might occur for newly mobilized transposons.</p><p>Tandem repeats within a chromosome can increase their copy number by unequal crossing over or by gene conversion. Because these processes involve DNA breakage and rejoining reactions, they may act in the same way as <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> transformation to recruit molecular components that use siRNAs to cause de novo DNA methylation. In this way, the presence of siRNAs at unmethylated tandem repeats may potentiate DNA methylation during such expansions, or during periods of genome stress when chromatin is perturbed. Most tandem repeats are found at more than one genomic location and may be associated with transposons. In these cases, siRNA production may act as a kind of &#x0201c;immune memory&#x0201d; of dispersed repeats, allowing de novo DNA methylation to respond when selfish DNAs increase their copy number. The example of maize paramutation shows that tandem repeats in their natural context can indeed silence other genes in this manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040363-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Our findings also highlight the molecular mystery of how tandem repeats are initially recognized by RNAi proteins. Double-stranded RNAs that provide a Dicer substrate can be produced from inverted repeats by monodirectional transcription and fold-back, or from high-copy sequences by transcription of dispersed repeats in opposite directions. However, the mechanism that distinguishes unique tandem repeats from single copies of the same sequence remains unclear. One possibility is that NRPD1a-containing Pol IV and/or RDR2 may recognize unusual DNA or RNA structures that can only be made by tandem repeats. Regardless of the exact recognition mechanisms involved, the cellular RNAi machinery may be poised to produce siRNAs from newly created tandem repeats. In addition to providing a defense against potentially harmful sequences, this molecular mechanism may facilitate the evolution of genes whose normal expression is controlled by siRNAs and DNA methylation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant materials.</title><p>Plants were grown under continuous light.

CG DNA methylation allows recruitment of siRNA-directed DNA methylation, providing a self-reinforcing feedback loop at silent loci.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040363.g007"/></fig></sec><fn-group><fn id="n104" fn-type="present-address"><p>&#x000a4; Current address: Section of Plant Biology, University of California Davis, Davis, California, United States of America</p></fn><fn id="ack3" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests.</bold> The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn id="ack1" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> SWLC and SEJ conceived and designed the experiments.
