Unrepaired or improperly repaired DSBs are potentially the most lethal form of DNA damage and can result in chromosomal translocations and contribute to the development of cancer. The principal mechanism for the repair of DSBs in humans is non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Ku is a key member of the NHEJ pathway and plays an important role in the recognition step when it binds to free DNA termini. Ku then stimulates the assembly and activation of other NHEJ components. DNA binding of Ku is regulated by redox conditions and evidence from our laboratory has demonstrated that Ku undergoes structural changes when oxidized that results in a reduction in DNA binding activity. The C-terminal domain and cysteine 493 of Ku80 were investigated for their contribution to redox regulation of Ku.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We effectively removed the C-terminal domain of Ku80 generating a truncation mutant and co-expressed this variant with wild type Ku70 in an insect cell system to create a Ku70/80&#x00394;C heterodimer. We also generated two single amino acid variants of Cys493, replacing this amino acid with either an alanine (C493A) or a serine (C493S), and over-expressed the variant proteins in SF9 insect cells in complex with wild type Ku70. Neither the truncation nor the amino acid substitutions alters protein expression or stability as determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. We show that the C493 mutations do not alter the ability of Ku to bind duplex DNA in vitro under reduced conditions while truncation of the Ku80 C-terminus slightly reduced DNA binding affinity. Diamide oxidation of cysteines was shown to inhibit DNA binding similarly for both the wild-type and all variant proteins. Interestingly, differential DNA binding activity following re-reduction was observed for the Ku70/80&#x00394;C truncation mutant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Together, these results suggest that the C-terminal domain and C493 of Ku80 play at most a minor role in the redox regulation of Ku, and that other cysteines are likely involved, either alone or in conjunction with these regions of Ku80.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) can be caused by ionizing radiation, reactive oxygen species and other endogenous and exogenous events. If these breaks are not repaired they ultimately result in cell death. Inaccurate repair of these breaks can generate chromosomal translocations, deletions and mutations which can lead to genetic instability and contribute to the development and progression of cancer. There are two main pathways to repair DSBs, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. HR occurs with minimal loss of genetic material increasing its accuracy and only occurs when a homologous chromosome is present providing extensive regions of sequence homology. NHEJ is error-prone, however it does not require a homologous chromosome or significant regions of homology and is the predominant pathway to repair IR-induced DNA DSBs. NHEJ is initiated upon Ku binding to the DNA termini generated from the DSB. Subsequent binding of the DNA dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) forms the activated DNA-PK holoenzyme[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Active DNA-PK then catalyzes autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of other downstream NHEJ proteins such as Artemis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and DNA ligase IV/XRCC4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Ku plays a key role in the NHEJ pathway by binding DNA ends and recruiting other downstream proteins. The crystal structure of Ku revealed a bridge and pillar region comprised of both Ku70 and Ku80 subunits that forms a ring around DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These studies revealed the ring shape in the presence and absence of DNA as well as a great deal of structure homology between the two subunits, despite the fact that they share minimal sequence homology[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The 3-dimensionial structure of Ku enables the protein to slide or translocate along the length of a DNA molecule[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, it is unclear how Ku dissociates from the DNA upon completion of the NHEJ pathway when the termini are eventually ligated. Additional studies have demonstrated that upon DNA-PKcs binding, Ku translocates inward along the DNA in an ATP independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] consistent with the sliding model. Studies have shown that Ku binds DNA in a sequence independent fashion by way of several hydrophobic residues that make contact with the major groove of DNA and several basic residues that interact with the phosphate back bone[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Studies have shown that the Ku70 subunit is proximal to the DSB and Ku80 is distal to the DSB[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>While much is known about the biochemical activities of Ku, its physiological regulation is less well understood. It has been determined that oxidative stress has a significant effect on the NHEJ pathway. Previous studies have shown that under oxidative conditions there is a marked decrease in DNA-PK activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. More specifically, oxidative stress has been shown to impair Ku's ability to bind DNA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Research has indicated a conformational change in Ku under oxidized conditions that leads to a significantly higher K<sub>off </sub>rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The affect oxidative stress has on Ku is a curious issue when thinking in terms of the crystal structure of Ku. The crystal structure does not reveal any disulfide bonds, however it is lacking several amino acids, particularly a cysteine in the C-terminal region of Ku80.</p><p>To further understand how redox conditions influence Ku structure and activity we constructed, purified and characterized several mutants of Ku. These mutations were introduced in key positions of the Ku80 subunit that have been implicated in redox regulation. The results are discussed with respect to the effect of redox on Ku structure and activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Sequencing grade bovine trypsin was purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, IN).</p><p>DNA primers and oligonucleotides used in this study were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.

Briefly, reactions were performed in a volume of 20 &#x003bc;l containing 50 mM Tris-Cl pH7.8, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 50 mM NaCl. Oxidized conditions were achieved by incubating Ku for 15 min on ice in 2 mM Diamide. Re-reduced conditions were achieved by incubating oxidized Ku with 5 mM DTT for 15 min on ice.

We have reported alterations in Ku structure as a function of redox conditions and identified C493 of Ku80 as an accessible cysteine position in a region where a modification of cysteine chemistry could potentially influence DNA binding. Chemical reactivity probes also identified the C-terminal domain of Ku which contains C638 as an area of interest that has the potential to influence the DNA binding activity of Ku [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore we prepared two mutants of C493 replacing this amino acid with an alanine or a serine. The serine substitution retains the potential to serve as a hydrogen bond donor, while the alanine does not. Both alanine and serine are not sensitive to redox conditions and thus provide an assessment of the role of C493, if any, in Ku redox regulation. To assess the role of the C-terminus of Ku80 and C638, we prepared a truncation mutant of Ku80 via PCR primers designed to introduce a stop codon after amino acid 548. Each construct was used to generate a recombinant baculovirus and co-expressed with wild type his -tagged Ku70. The recombinant proteins were purified via Ni-agarose column chromatography followed by fractionation on a Macro-prep Q anion exchange matrix. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified proteins is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The results demonstrate a 1:1 stoichiometry for each preparation which was confirmed by western blot analysis. This was especially important for the Ku70/80&#x00394;C construct where the truncated Ku80 migrates very closely to the [His]<sub>6</sub>-tagged Ku70 as judged on a Coomassie Blue stained gel. The reactivity of this protein with an antibody to the Ku80 N-terminus confirmed co-expression and 1:1 stoichiometry (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Analysis of the C493 mutants also demonstrated 1:1 stoichiometry and no alterations in protein expression or degradation as a result of this change (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Purity and stoichiometry of Ku heterodimer complexes</bold>.

Analysis of the C493A variant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) demonstrates near wild type binding to duplex DNA, indicating that the mutation to an alanine does not influence the interaction with DNA under reduced conditions. Similar results were observed with the C493S mutant with binding being similar to wild type (data not shown). The results presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> demonstrate that the Ku70/80&#x00394;C variant lacking the C-terminal domain is capable of binding DNA with only as light reduction in binding affinity compared to wild type Ku (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Quantification of the data is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>. While this C-terminal domain has been demonstrated to be involved in activation of DNA-PKcs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], these results demonstrate that DNA binding is only moderately affected by removal of this domain, a result consistent with the crystal structure of the Ku heterodimer bound to DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These data support the contention that no dramatic alteration in DNA binding activity is manifested by the introduced changes in the protein's primary structure.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>DNA binding of Ku mutants under reduced conditions as assessed by EMSA</bold>.

Previously we have shown that under these conditions Ku exhibits a reversible oxidation event that impairs DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The results presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> demonstrate that wild type Ku displays a decrease in DNA binding activity as a function of diamide concentration, consistent with our previous results[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the C493A mutant also exhibited a decrease in binding as a function of redox conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). These results suggest that the redox-dependent inhibition of Ku DNA binding activity is independent of C493. A similar line of experimentation was performed with the truncation mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and again Ku binding was reduced in both protein preparations as a function of diamide. We also reversed the conditions to re-reduce the protein by incubation with additional DTT. The result of this treatment was the restoration of DNA binding activity for the wild type protein and Ku 70/80&#x00394;C truncation variant. Interestingly, full DNA binding activity was not observed for either protein preparation, thus the potential for a persistent redox-dependent structural change exists in Ku (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). To determine if in fact a persistent structural alteration in Ku exists following diamide oxidation and re-reduction, we performed a limited tryptic digest of the Ku that was treated with DTT before diamide addition at a ratio that does not result in Ku oxidization (control) and Ku that was first treated with diamide to oxidize the proteins was then re-reduced with DTT. The final concentration of all components was identical prior to the tryptic cleavage reactions. The results presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> demonstrate that there is somewhat more tryptic cleavage under the control conditions compared to the re-reduced Ku and this is apparent in both the wild-type and Ku70/80&#x00394;C mutant. This is also apparent in the prominence of the lower molecular mass peptides (&#x0003c;37 kDa) under control conditions and the prominence of the full length proteins in the re-reduced conditions. This is somewhat surprising in that the better DNA binding conditions (control) result in greater tryptic susceptibility. Quantification of the data, which is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, bears out the interpretation that re-reduced Ku is slightly less susceptible to tryptic cleavage. A difference in peptide product distribution was observed between the wild type and Ku70/80&#x00394;C under both conditions that could not be attributed to the truncation. This suggests that the folding or conformation of the Ku70/80&#x00394;C protein differs from that of wild type Ku. Interestingly this minor difference may account for the difference in DNA binding affinity observed in the EMSA DNA binding analysis of the Ku70/80&#x00394;C.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>The effect of oxidation on DNA binding of Ku mutants</bold>.

Therefore we assessed binding of wild type and Ku variants to a duplex DNA substrate using a fluorescence polarization assay. A 30-bp duplex with a single fluoroscein label on one 5' terminus was used and Ku protein preparations were titrated into the binding reactions. Wild type and Ku mutants under reduced conditions displayed identical binding and, upon oxidation with diamide, minimal DNA binding was detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and data not shown for C493 mutants). The oxidized Ku proteins where then re-reduced by the addition of excess DTT and titrated into binding reactions. In this analysis, wild type Ku regained complete DNA binding activity while the Ku70/80&#x00394;C again regained significant DNA binding activity, though not complete. This data is consistent with the alteration in trypsin sensitivity observed following re-reduction after oxidation such that after re-reduction both wild type and Ku70/80&#x00394;C were less sensitive to trypsin digestion and suggest an alteration in structure that impacts DNA binding activity. Overall, these analyses provide insight into how Ku structural features impact redox regulation. Amore complete understanding of this complex interplay is likely to require additional genetic and structural analyses as well as an investigation of cellular redox regulators that may perform this function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>K<sub>D </sub>Values as determined by EMSA and anisotropy</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left">Conditions</td><td align="left">K<sub>D </sub>(&#x003bc;M)</td><td align="left">B<sub>Max</sub></td><td align="left">R value</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><italic>EMSA</italic></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Wild type Ku</td><td align="left">Control</td><td align="left">29.7 &#x000b1; 2.5</td><td align="left">--</td><td align="left">0.99</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ku70/80&#x00394;C</td><td align="left">Control</td><td align="left">51.0 &#x000b1; 7.7</td><td align="left">--</td><td align="left">0.99</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>Anisotropy</italic></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Wild type Ku</td><td align="left">Control</td><td align="left">25.8 &#x000b1; 2.3</td><td align="left">0.24</td><td align="left">0.995</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Oxidized</td><td align="left">--</td><td align="left">--</td><td align="left">--</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Re-reduced</td><td align="left">31.4 &#x000b1; 3.0</td><td align="left">0.20</td><td align="left">0.98</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ku70/80&#x00394;C</td><td align="left">Control</td><td align="left">25.7 &#x000b1; 1.5</td><td align="left">0.255</td><td align="left">0.999</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Oxidized</td><td align="left">--</td><td align="left">--</td><td align="left">--</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Re-reduced</td><td align="left">&#x0003c;50</td><td align="left">--</td><td align="left">--</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Anisotropy Assay of Wild Type and Ku70/80&#x00394;C under (A) Control verses Oxidized Conditions and (B) Control verses Re-reduced</bold>.

Physiologically, Ku, DNA-PK and NHEJ have all been demonstrated to be influenced by cellular redox conditions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Typically, redox dependent alterations in enzymatic or binding activity can be attributed to the formation and breaking of disulfide bonds. Interestingly, X-ray structural analysis of Ku does not reveal the presence of any disulfide bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Therefore, the oxidation effects observed <italic>in vitro </italic>are likely to be a result of the formation of cysteine sulfenic acids. This reversible modification is consistent with the near complete rescuing of DNA binding activity upon re-reduction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). Cellular modifications as a function of redox however, may be manifested by different modifications and interactions.</p><p>Specifically, glutathionine conjugations to Ku could be responsible for the decreased binding activity observed in cells exposed to ROS via treatment with glucose and glucose oxidase[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Also, protein-protein disulfide bonds between exposed cysteine residues could account for the reduction in binding. This, however, is unlikely to account for all the reduction as the Ku protein level was reduced and not observed as highly cross linked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Preliminary data demonstrate that at least 7 cysteine residues are readily accessible, one being located in the C-terminal domain, and thus glutathionine conjugates or modification to sulfenic acid could account for the reduction in DNA binding activity. While the results presented demonstrate that C493 and C638 are not likely to be the major determinants of redox regulation, the inability to completely re-reduce Ku70/80&#x00394;C suggested that C638 may play some role in redox dependent changes in Ku structure.</p><p>The DNA binding assays performed on the C493 mutants and Ku70/80&#x00394;C under oxidized conditions revealed a near complete loss of DNA binding activity. If C493 and 638 were responsible for the redox regulation, no reduction in DNA binding activity would have been observed. Demonstration of the loss of binding in two independent assays provides strong evidence that upon oxidation, the protein structure is altered such that it cannot support DNA binding. When the proteins were re -reduced, the DNA binding ability was largely recovered, again consistent with a modification or alteration in structure being reversible. Also, in that the wild type Ku and Ku 70/80&#x00394;C behaved similarly in their recovery suggest that the Ku80CTD does not protect any cysteine residues from the redox conditions that affect Ku's ability to bind DNA. While we observed some discrepancies between the wild type Ku and Ku70/80&#x00394;C anisotropy data and EMSA data, this could be explained in the nature of these assays. The anisotropy assay is more representative of a true steady state equilibrium binding assay, where as the EMSA is a stopped assay with post -binding separation that can influence the detection of the bound species. This is apparent from the fits of the binding curves for each assay where the EMSA quantification yields a clear sigmoidal binding curve as we have previously demonstrated for Ku binding short DNA duplexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The data obtained from fluorescence anisotropy fits better to a hyperbolic binding curve than the EMSA data, consistent with a true equilibrium binding reaction (data not shown). Despite these differences, the results of the redox effects between the wild type and variant proteins are very consistent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion we observed that under oxidized conditions Ku, independent of the mutations, binds DNA with a significantly lower affinity than under reduced conditions. We also determined the C493 does not play a role in Ku-DNA interaction nor does it have a role in the affect of redox on the Ku heterodimer. Analysis of the Ku70/80&#x00394;C revealed slight differences in activity leading us to believe that this truncation has a modest effect on Ku binding DNA and potentially a similar effect on Ku structure and activity in response to redox conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SMB prepared and performed EMSA analysis of the Ku truncation mutant and prepared the first draft of the manuscript.
