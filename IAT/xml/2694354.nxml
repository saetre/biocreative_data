The main findings of our study are that biliverdin treatment protects the HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse from RV injury and an exaggerated increase in RV weight after seven weeks of chronic hypoxia without diminishing pulmonary hypertension. In contrast, HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice treated with inhaled CO are protected from pulmonary vascular remodeling, however, they still develop RV failure and thrombus with significant mortality, despite normal right ventricular pressures. The divergent effects of two enzymatic products of HO-1 in the same disease model highlight the complexity of HO-1's protective actions in the cardiovascular system. Moreover, the finding that CO protected from pulmonary hypertension but failed to protect from RV injury indicates that hypoxia has a direct effect on the right ventricle that is not mediated by pulmonary vascular constriction or remodeling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animal Model and Hypoxia Exposure</title><p>HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005978-Yet2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although it prevented hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, inhaled CO had no effect on the development of RV fibrotic injury in the HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exposed to hypoxia for seven weeks. In contrast, biliverdin treatment reversed the exaggerated RV weight response in HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and completely prevented RV injury at 7 weeks. Given that both molecules have been reported to protect cardiomyocytes and be anti-proliferative for vascular smooth muscle cells in a variety of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> injury models, this finding of their differing roles in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of pulmonary hypertension is intriguing.</p><p>Our study is the first to investigate the roles of HO-1 enzymatic products in protection from cardiac injury secondary to chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling that leads to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. Pressure-overload elevates RV wall stress, causing the RV to hypertrophy and ultimately to begin a progression down the end-stage pathway to dilation, fibrosis, apoptosis and failure. Death in patients with pulmonary hypertension is most often a result of right ventricular failure, but mechanisms for progression from RV hypertrophy to failure are poorly understood. The relatively rapid progression to RV dilation, fibrosis, and failure seen in the HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> exposed to chronic hypoxia makes it an unique tool to understand the roles of HO-1 and its enzymatic products in this injury.</p><p>The most striking finding of our experiments is that biliverdin administration completely prevented the characteristic RV injury and failure pattern in the HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals exposed to chronic hypoxia. Biliverdin-treated animals had no areas of full-thickness RV wall fibrosis and correspondingly no significant TUNEL-positive areas of increased RV wall apoptosis. Biliverdin itself is a potent antioxidant because of its ability to be reduced by biliverdin reductase to bilirubin in most tissues. Bilirubin can then be oxidized back to biliverdin, which can re-enter this antioxidant cycle and continue the protection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005978-Baranano1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. We have found that injections of 50 &#x000b5;mol/kg of biliverdin in mice increase serum bilirubin levels from a baseline of 0.25 mg/dL to 6.8 mg/dL within 15 minutes of injection, providing evidence for the rapidity of biliverdin reductase activity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In addition to causing the RV wall fibrotic injury, chronic hypoxia and pressure-overload lead to a heavier, more dilated RV in the HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse as compared with the hemizygous control animals. This increased weight cannot be explained by a more pronounced hypertrophic response to pulmonary hypertension as the ventricles are dilated, fibrotic, and have mural thrombi. Given the premature death in the untreated and CO-treated HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we surmise that cardiac function was significantly impaired as well. Similarly, Hartsfield, et al. reported that although inhibition of HO-1 activity with tin protoprorphyrin did not worsen pulmonary hypertension in rats exposed to hypoxia for 5 weeks, the RV did not hypertrophy appropriately but was dilated and had worsened function as compared with untreated hypoxic controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005978-Hartsfield1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study, biliverdin treatment prevented the exaggerated RV weight gain seen in untreated HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, restoring RV weight to HO-1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> control levels but not preventing the hypertrophic response to hypoxia for either genotype. In sum, biliverdin treatment prevented RV fibrosis and exaggerated weight gain and improved survival in the HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exposed to chronic hypoxia.</p><p>In order to better understand the mechanism behind the myocardial protective actions of biliverdin injection, we used neonatal rat cardiomyocytes to examine the effects of HO-1 products on cell survival after A-R injury. Cardiomyoctes in culture are quite resilient to the effects of chronic hypoxia, but profound hypoxia or anoxia followed by reoxygenation is known to cause cell death. We therefore chose this model to investigate the potential direct effects of CO and bilirubin on cardiomyocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. We found that cardiomyocytes exposed to A-R had significantly improved survival when treated with low doses of bilirubin (1 and 5 &#x000b5;M). Foresti et al. also found that bilirubin protects cardiomyocytes from A-R <italic>in vitro</italic>, with lower doses of bilirubin (0.5 &#x000b5;M) being protective while higher doses were not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005978-Foresti1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. We also investigated whether bilirubin protected from apoptotic cell death and found that 5 &#x000b5;M bilirubin was anti-apoptotic when assessed by flow cytometry for Annexin V. Biliverdin and bilirubin likely protect cardiomyocytes via their antioxidant actions, and given that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are proposed to be mediators of cardiac injury (apoptosis and fibrosis) by pressure-overload, hypoxia, and ischemia-reperfusion, it follows that these molecules could protect the heart simply by their antioxidant properties. Redout and others recently reported that progression from RV hypertrophy to failure in a rat monocrotaline pulmonary hypertension model is associated with increased ROS production by mitochondria and NADPH oxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005978-Redout1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. These failing RVs showed evidence of reduced antioxidant capacity and increased oxidative stress. That the antioxidant property of bilirubin is important for cardioprotection is supported by recent data that HO-1 overexpression protected cardiomyocytes from A-R-induced oxidative injury and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005978-Pachori1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data support an anti-apoptotic role for bilirubin but do not rule out that other protective mechanisms are occurring as well, and these may be occurring via anti-oxidant or other pathways.</p><p>Continuous inhaled CO concurrent with exposure to chronic hypoxia completely prevented hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling and elevated RVSP. Similar to our finding in mice, others have reported that continuous CO reverses elevations in RVSP in rats exposed to chronic hypoxia for 21 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005978-Gautier1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005978-Dubuis1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

While we have reported the inhibitory effect of CO on VSMC proliferation in the past, to our knowledge this is the first report of the profound anti-migratory action of CO in hypoxic vascular smooth muscle cells.

Other authors who have used CO to treat hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats have had conflicting results pertaining to RV hypertrophy. Otterbein, et.al. treated rats with 250 ppm CO once daily during the last three weeks of a six week hypoxic exposure and found improvement in Fulton's Index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005978-Zuckerbraun1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Gautier, et.al. treated rats with 50 ppm CO continuously during the last week of a three week hypoxic exposure and found that although RVSP was significantly improved, Fulton's Index was not affected and RV function was significantly worsened in the CO-treated group. In addition, RV infarction developed in some of these animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005978-Gautier1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. For the HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse that cannot respond to hypoxia by increasing CO production, it appears that neither reducing pulmonary vascular resistance (which occurs as a consequence of CO therapy) nor replacement of CO at the cardiomyocyte level is sufficient to prevent RV injury. Interestingly, for the HO-1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> control animals treated with CO, elevation of RVSP was prevented but the RV hypertrophied to the same extent as untreated hypoxic HO-1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> controls. One possible explanation for this effect is CO toxicity, but we monitored COHb levels weekly throughout the hypoxic exposure and found levels less than 9&#x00025; regardless of CO dose within the range of 20&#x02013;60 ppm. Others have reported similar COHb levels in rats exposed to chronic hypoxia and continuous inhaled CO at 50 ppm for 3 weeks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005978-Gautier1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. These levels are lower than those of chronic smokers and are not thought to be toxic. Another possible explanation is that in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, CO may be preventing the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell proliferative and pro-migratory effects of hypoxia but not protecting from the direct effects of hypoxia on the right ventricle. In support of this, we found that <italic>in vitro</italic>, neither pre-treatment with CO gas nor CORM-1 treatment improved cardiomyocyte cell survival in a model of anoxia-reoxygenation. A previous study by Clark, et.al. showed that CO was protective when delivered using CORM-3 in H9C2 cells exposed to A-R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005978-Clark2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. The use of a different CO-releasing molecule in a transformed cell line (H9C2) in the Clark study may account for the observed difference between their results and ours.</p><p>The fact that CO reduced RVSP and pulmonary arteriolar remodeling but did not prevent RV fibrotic injury in the HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice points to a possible direct effect of hypoxia on the RV. When chronic hypoxia is the cause of pulmonary hypertension, the RV is subjected not only to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance from vascular remodeling, but also to systemic hypoxia.

As patients with PAH secondary to hypoxia (e.g. secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) make up a large percentage of patients with PAH, it is important that we investigate this independent effect of systemic hypoxia on myocardial performance and progression to failure.</p><p>In summary, biliverdin exerted a direct cardioprotective effect in HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exposed to chronic hypoxia, but did not ameliorate pulmonary vascular pathology. In the same model, inhalation of low dose continuous CO ameliorated hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in both HO-1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> and HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals, but did not protect from RV dilation, fibrosis, and mural thrombus. Given that HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals appear to have an accelerated progression to apoptosis, fibrosis, and heart failure, we propose that biliverdin administration slows this progression to resemble the wild-type phenotype while CO either has no effect or accelerates the progression. At the same time, CO dramatically inhibits hypoxia-induced proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells and prevents hypoxic pulmonary vascular remodeling and RV pressure overload, but has no protective effects on the RV. The distinctly different roles of these two protective enzymatic products of HO-1 in our model of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension are intriguing and may demonstrate how HO-1 can have a variety of protective effects that are dependent on the type of stress and the type of cell involved in injury. As therapeutic strategies that involve upregulation of HO-1 or delivery of its enzymatic products are developed, there will need to be thorough investigation of the possible effects of these strategies in each organ system. In general, our results support the emerging concept that treatments for pulmonary hypertension targeted solely at reducing pulmonary arterial pressure may not necessarily be cardioprotective and may not ultimately improve outcome for these patients. Potential treatments must be evaluated for their protective actions in both organ systems.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Dimitrios Poutias for his assistance with
