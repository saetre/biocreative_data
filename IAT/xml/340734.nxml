The full length human HRS cDNA was expressed after transfection into Cos 1 cells and a CHO ts mutant defective in the gene for HRS. The complete nucleotide sequence of the hamster and human gene were obtained and extensive homologies were observed in three regions on comparing these sequences between themselves and with the sequence of HRS derived from yeast. These results provide unequivocal evidence that we have indeed cloned the hamster and human gene for HRS. Three overlapping phage recombinants containing the complete hamster chromosomal gene for HRS have also been isolated. The genomic HRS is divided into 13 exons. The precise locations of each of the 5' and 3' exon-intron boundaries were defined by sequencing the appropriate regions of the cloned genomic DNA and aligning them with the sequence of HRS cDNAs. These studies provide the basis for future structural and functional analysis of the gene for HRS. In particular, it will be of interest to examine if different exons of HRS correlate to different domains of the HRS polypeptide.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0164-a" xlink:role="3354"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0165-a" xlink:role="3355"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0159.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3349"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0160.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3350"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0161.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3351"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0162.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3352"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0163.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3353"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0164.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3354"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0165.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3355"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3356"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3357"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3358"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3359"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0170.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3360"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0171.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3361"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0172.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3362"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0173.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3363"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0174.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3364"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0175.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3365"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0176.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3366"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0177.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3367"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
