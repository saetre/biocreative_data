Although MAP2 is widely used as a marker of neuronal differentiation, regulation of its transcription has not been investigated.

Comparative analysis of the mouse, rat and human MAP2 promoter sequences showed the presence of a conserved bHLH factor binding sites. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, promoter mutagenesis and co-transfection experiments showed that NeuroD, a pro-neuronal differentiation factor, and Hairy and Enhancer of Split (HES1), a transcription repressor, are involved in the regulation of MAP2 promoter activity. Melanoma cells express both NeuroD and HES1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that in metastatic melanoma cells N-box region of the MAP2 promoter is occupied by endogenous HES1. We show that the inhibition of Notch signaling, a regulator of HES1 gene expression, and/or shRNA knockdown of HES1 results in the upregulation of MAP2 promoter activity. Thus, our data suggest that Notch signaling, which is implicated in melanoma progression, and HES1 play a role in MAP2 gene regulation during melanoma progression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Microtubule dynamics is regulated by a family of proteins known as microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). MAP family includes several isoforms of MAP1, MAP2 and tau, which are expressed primarily in neurons. Among neuronal MAPs, MAP2 expression is considered a hallmark of neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). MAP2 is found primarily in the dendritic extensions of post-mitotic, terminally differentiated neurons. MAP2 plays a critical role in neurite outgrowth and dendrite development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Change in the expression of MAP2 is a helpful diagnostic and prognostic feature in various neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Despite its extensive use as a marker of neuronal differentiation, and its role in morphological and functional differentiation of neurons, little is known about the regulation of MAP2 gene expression.</p><p>Interestingly, MAP2 gene is activated in certain human non-neuronal cancers that exhibit characteristics of neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). We showed that cutaneous primary melanoma, a cancer that arises from neural crest-derived melanocytes, often express abundant MAP2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Since the only function of MAP2, known to date, is to stabilize microtubules, we investigated whether MAP2 expression in rapidly proliferating cancer cells could interfere with microtubule dynamics, inhibit mitosis and, therefore, delay or inhibit tumor progression. We showed, in a five-year clinical follow-up study, that patients whose primary tumors express abundant MAP2 had longer disease-free survival rate than those patients with weak or no MAP2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Moreover, we showed that reactivation of endogenous MAP2 gene transcription by treatment with pharmacological compounds or expression of exogenous MAP2 by adenovirus in metastatic melanoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic> leads to cell cycle arrest, growth inhibition and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). These observations suggested that reactivation of MAP2 gene transcription is potentially a useful strategy for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.</p><p>In this study, we show that a 3.3 kb 5&#x02032; genomic region of human MAP2 gene that contains several E- and N-boxes, which are binding sites for basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix (bHLH) transcription factors, is sufficient for neuronal-specific expression of a reporter gene both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also show that MAP2 promoter is activated by neurogenic bHLH factor NeuroD/BETA2, preferentially, in melanoma cells and repressed by the bHLH repressor Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 (HES1), a regulator of neuronal differentiation. Although both NeuroD and HES1 are expressed in metastatic melanoma cells, results of co-transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that MAP2 gene is regulated by the relative levels of these factors, and predominantly by the level of HES1 protein. Using HES1shRNA knockdown and a pharmacological inhibitor of HES1 activator Notch1, we show that MAP2 promoter activity is regulated by Notch1. We also show that Notch1 signaling, which is implicated in melanoma progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), differentially regulates MAP2 promoter activity in primary and metastatic melanoma cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Mouse neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro2a, and human embryonal carcinoma cell line NT2-D1 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

PC12 cells treated with NGF are known to differentiate into neuron-like cells with neurite outgrowths and express MAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, inset) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). NT2/D1 is an inducible model system for neuronal differentiation. Continuous culture of NT2/D1 cells in complete serum containing retinoids or the addition of retinoic acid to the steroid free culture medium is known to induce neuronal differentiation and MAP2 expression (as shown by RT&#x02013;PCR, inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>).</p><p>In NGF-treated PC12 cells, phMAP2-1 and phMAP2-2 promoter constructs showed 6- to 7-fold higher luciferase activity compared with untreated cells. Although promoter construct lacking sequences between &#x02212;1854/&#x02212;263 (phMAP2-3) showed &#x0223c;2-fold higher basal activity compared with phMAP2-1 and phMAP2-2 in untreated PC12 cells, NGF treatment did not produce a significant increase in the luciferase activity. In non-neuronal HeLa cells, all three promoter constructs produced only weak luciferase activity and treatment with NGF produced a 2-fold increase only in cells transfected with the 3.3 kb phMAP2-1 promoter construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that luciferase activity driven by the 3.3 kb MAP2-1 promoter was always lower than that of the shorter 2.2 kb MAP2-2 promoter fragment in every cell line tested, indicating the presence of negative regulatory sequences between nt &#x02212;2965 and &#x02212;1854. There are four putative E boxes (E1&#x02013;E4) within this region of MAP2 DNA. To test whether these E boxes play a role in attenuating MAP2 promoter activity, we mutated E1, E2, E3 and E4 boxes individually or in various combinations including mutation of all four E boxes and tested the activity of the mutant promoters. Mutation of neither individual E boxes nor any combination of E boxes (including all four E boxes) altered the basal activity of the 3.3 kb phMAP2-1 promoter (data not shown). These data suggested that the distal E boxes do not contribute significantly to the basal activity of human MAP2 promoter and showed that the 2.2 kb genomic fragment &#x02212;1854/+369 (phMAP2-2) was sufficient for maximal NGF-inducible, neuronal-selective MAP2 promoter activity.</p><p>In NT2 cells cultured in complete medium, phMAP2-2 produced 150- to 200-fold higher luciferase activity compared with the promoter-less pGL3-luc plasmid. Luciferase activity in transfected NT2 cells was 15- to 20-fold higher than that found in HeLa cells transfected with the same MAP2 promoter construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) confirming the neuronal-specificity of the 2.2 kb MAP2 promoter. We then tested the activity of this MAP2 promoter in a representative panel of primary and metastatic melanoma cells lines, and human glioblastoma cell lines U138, U251 and a breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. In phMAP2-2 transfected melanoma cells, there was 20- to 30-fold higher luciferase activity compared to cells transfected with promoter-less pGL3-Luc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Surprisingly, both primary and metastatic melanoma cells showed significant MAP2 promoter activity. Although MAP2 promoter activity in melanoma cells was lower than that found in NT2 cells, it was 4- to 6-fold higher than that observed in HeLa cells or MCF-7 cells (data not shown). MAP2 promoter activity was comparable to the activity in glioblastoma cell lines (data not shown). These data show that the neuronal-specific MAP2 gene promoter is active in melanoma cells and are consistent with the well-documented molecular plasticity and neural differentiation of cutaneous melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>MAP2 promoter activity <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To verify that the cloned MAP2 genomic DNA fragments show neuronal-specific expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, we tested their activity by transient expression in transgenic mouse embryos.

Two independent sets of transgenic embryos were created for each construct. Staining of 11.5-day-old embryos with X-gal showed &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in 6 of 11 and 8 of 25 embryos produced by microinjection of hMAP2-1 and hMAP2-2, respectively. The X-gal staining was restricted to developing central nervous system including a weak staining of telencephalic vesicle and strong staining of ventral mesencephalon, midbrain and hindbrain junction (isthmus), rhombic lip and along the length of the neural tube, developing eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Both hMAP2-1 and hMAP2-2 transgenic embryos showed similar pattern of staining. Staining of sections of paraffin embedded, 11.5-day-old littermate control embryos with anti-MAP2ab-specific mAb M13 showed expression of endogenous MAP2 protein in the same regions corresponding to those where human MAP2 promoter driven &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

NeuroD/BETA2 is a critical bHLH neurogenic factor that binds to a core 6 bp E box element (CANNTG) as a heterodimer with a ubiquitous partner E47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). HES1 is an important negative regulator of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). HES1 represses neuronal genes actively by binding to N-box (CACNTG) as a homodimer or in a dominant-negative fashion by forming heterodimers with other bHLH factors that bind to E boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>).</p><p>A role of NeuroD in the regulation of MAP2 gene promoter is indicated by the following observations: (i) in neuroepithelial cells, induction of cell cycle arrest and neuronal differentiation is associated with the activation of NeuroD and MAP2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). (ii) MAP2 promoter contains a consensus NeuroD-binding E-box (CAGATG) found in other NeuroD target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>).</p><p>To test whether NeuroD activates MAP2 promoter, we transfected HeLa cells and melanoma cells with MAP2 promoter plasmids phMAP2-1 or phMAP2-2 and increasing amounts of NeuroD expression plasmid pNeuroD. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, co-transfection with pNeuroD produced a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity in both phMAP2-1 and phMAP2-2 promoter transfected melanoma cells. In HeLa cells, co-transfection of pNeuroD appears to suppress the MAP2 promoter activity at lower dose but stimulates it slightly at a higher dose. However, NeuroD-stimulated MAP2 promoter activity in HeLa cells was significantly lower than its basal activity seen in melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>Since the consensus NeuroD-binding E-box, E9 is conserved between human and rodent MAP2, we first tested binding of NeuroD to E9 box sequences by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay. Incubation of nuclear extracts of pNeuroD transfected (to enhance the sensitivity of the assay) melanoma cells with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled oligonucleotides (22mers with a core E-box sequence CANNTG) showed that the oligomer containing the E9 box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 1), but not E10 or E11 box (data not shown), produce two DNA&#x02013;protein complexes. Appearance of these complexes, especially the slower migrating complex, was inhibited in the presence of molar excess of wild-type cold E9 oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). Addition of molar excess of mutant E9 oligonucleotide with a core sequence ACGAGT (lanes 4 and 5) or wild-type E10 oligonucleotide (lanes 6 and 7) produced only a slight inhibition in the formation of slow migrating E9&#x02013;protein complex. Addition of anti-NeuroD antibody (lane 9) to the reaction mixture completely prevented the formation of these complexes, similar to the reported effect of this antibody on binding of NeuroD to E boxes of other target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). These data show that NeuroD binds to E9 box (&#x02212;366/&#x02212;345) of MAP2 promoter.</p><p>We observed that a MAP2 promoter deletion construct of pMAP2-3 (&#x02212;263/+369) that lacks all proximal E boxes, including E9, still produced significant luciferase activity that was less than the maximal activity seen in cells transfected with the 2.2 kb phMAP2-2 promoter plasmid. To test whether this promoter constructs lacking the proximal E boxes could still be activated by NeuroD, we transfected HeLa cells and melanoma cells with phMAP2-3 plasmid and with increasing amounts of pNeuroD. Surprisingly, co-transfection with pNeuroD resulted in a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity of this MAP2 promoter in melanoma cells but not in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These data suggest that although NeuroD can activate <italic>MAP2</italic> gene transcription by binding to E9 box, other factors that are constitutively expressed in melanoma cells and those that may be activated by NeuroD contribute to the transactivation of MAP2 promoter. To test this, we generated 2.2 kb phMAP2-2 promoter with mutations in the core sequence of E9 box (CAGATG&#x02192;<underline>GC</underline>GA<underline>G</underline>G), and compared its basal activity with that of the wild-type promoter. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, mutation of E9 box resulted in nearly 50% decrease in the basal luciferase activity. Additionally, this E9 mutant phMAP2-2 promoter continued to exhibit a dose-dependent activation by NeuroD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, NeuroD appears to upregulate MAP2 promoter activity by both direct (by binding to E9 box) and indirect mechanisms (presumably by activation or induction of other trans-activators).</p></sec><sec><title>MAP2 promoter is inhibited by HES1</title><p>As mentioned earlier, HES1 is an important regulator of neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, Hes1 null mice express both early and late neuronal markers including MAP2 prematurely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). To test whether MAP2 promoter is regulated by HES1, we co-transfected NT2 cells and melanoma cells (SK-MEL-19) with the 2.2 kb phMAP2-2 promoter and increasing amounts of mouse Hes1 expression plasmid pCI-Hes1. In both NT2 cells (data not shown) and melanoma cells, co-transfection with Hes1 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of luciferase activity with a maximal (84%) inhibition at the highest dose of pCI-Hes1 plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These data suggest a role for HES1 in the regulation of MAP2 promoter activity.</p></sec><sec><title>The proximal N-box is necessary for HES1-mediated repression</title><p>In phMAP2-2 promoter sequence, there are two putative HES-binding motifs: N1 at &#x02212;961/&#x02212;956 (CACAAG) and N2 at &#x02212;63/&#x02212;58 (CACGAG). To investigate the role of these N-boxes in repression of MAP2 promoter activity by HES1, we tested whether mutation of either one or both N-boxes increases basal activity of the promoter and/or makes it less sensitive or refractory to repression by HES1. In melanoma cells transfected with the mutant phMAP2-2 promoter plasmids, there was a modest but significant increase (26% over wild type) in the luciferase activity driven by the mutN2 (CACGAG&#x02192;GCCGCC) and mutN1N2 promoters (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), and a smaller increase (10% over wild type) in the activity driven by the mutN1 (CACAAG&#x02192;ACCAGA) MAP2 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In addition, co-transfection with pCI-Hes1, which resulted in 60% inhibition of luciferase activity driven by the wild-type and mutN1 promoters, produced significantly less inhibition of mutN2 and mutN1N2 promoter activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01, respectively). These data suggest that N2 box is involved in HES1-mediated repression of MAP2 promoter. In addition to its action by direct binding to N2 box, HES1 is also known to act indirectly by making non-functional heterodimers with transcription activators that bind to E boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Whereas the 2.2 kb MAP2 minimal promoter contains two potential HES-binding N-boxes, the 293 bp phMAP2-4 promoter deletion construct that we generated contains only the proximal N2 box. Transfection of melanoma cells with phMAP2-4 promoter-luciferase plasmid and Hes1 expression plasmid showed that Hes1 was able to repress the activity of phMAP2-4 promoter containing only the proximal N-box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), confirming that the regulation of MAP2 promoter by HES1 is mediated primarily by this proximal N2 box at &#x02212;63/&#x02212;58.</p><p>To test whether HES1 binds to N2 sequence, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, Hes1 transfected melanoma nuclear extracts retarded the mobility of N2 box oligonucleotides. Addition of a molar excess of cold wild-type N2 box DNA resulted in a complete inhibition of the mobility shift of the labeled N2 box oligonucleotide. In some experiments, we also observed a second, faster migrating and non-specific complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, asterisk on the left), which could not be competed out by molar excess of cold N2 box DNA. The presence of molar excess wild-type N1 box or mutant N2 box oligonucleotides in the reaction resulted in only a slight decrease in the formation of this N2 DNA&#x02013;protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The addition of anti-Hes1 antibody, but not control rabbit IgG, to the reaction caused further retardation of the N2 box&#x02013;protein complex. However, addition of these antibodies to N2 DNA&#x02013;protein complex showed two additional non-specific complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, asterisks on the right). These data showed that HES1 represses MAP2 promoter activity by binding preferentially to the proximal N2 box sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>HES1 is a dominant regulator of MAP2 promoter activity</title><p>Neuronal differentiation is known to be regulated by the relative levels of pro-neuronal transcription factors and repressors neuronal-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). To investigate the relative contribution of NeuroD and HES1 in the regulation of MAP2 promoter activity, we co-transfected melanoma cells with phMAP2-2 and (i) constant amount of NeuroD expression plasmid and increasing amounts of pCI-Hes1 plasmid or (ii) a constant amount of pCI-Hes1 plasmid and increasing amounts of pNeuroD plasmid. In melanoma cells, co-transfection with pNeuroD alone resulted in &#x0223c;50% increase in luciferase activity driven by phMAP2-2 promoter, and transfection of the promoter with pCI-Hes1 resulted in 60% inhibition in promoter activity. Transfection with increasing amounts of pCI-Hes1 along with constant amount of pNeuroD that produces 50% increase in promoter activity, not only prevented the pNeuroD-dependent increase but also produced a dose-dependent decrease in the promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In contrast, co-transfection of increasing amounts of pNeuroD, which upregulated MAP2 promoter activity when present alone, was unable to relieve the inhibition of the promoter activity caused by HES1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These data suggest that HES1 is a dominant regulator of MAP2 promoter activity in human melanoma cells.</p><p>To test whether melanoma cells express these neuronal transcription factors and whether variable MAP2 promoter activity in different melanoma cell lines might be related to relative levels of these factors, we performed western blot analysis with anti-NeuroD and anti-Hes1 antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, whereas variable amounts of NeuroD expression could be detected in both melanocytes and melanoma cells, HES1 expression is detectable only in melanoma cells. These observations support the RT&#x02013;PCR data reported by Balint <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>), who showed that HES family mRNAs (specifically HES1) are expressed in melanoma cell lines but not in melanocytes. There was no clear relationship between the levels of NeuroD and HES1 among different melanoma cell lines.</p><p>To test whether endogenous NeuroD and HES1 proteins in melanoma cells bind to MAP2 promoter sequence, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-NeuroD and anti-Hes1 antibodies or with control IgG, followed by PCR amplification of the corresponding regions of DNA using specific primers. Analysis of amplified DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) showed that immunoprecipitation with anti-Hes1 antibody enriched (compared to control IgG precipitation) sequences that are amplified preferentially by primers flanking N2 box compared to primers flanking N1 box. Amplification of anti-NeuroD immunoprecipitated chromatin did not show any marked enrichment of sequences amplified by primers flanking E9&#x02013;E11 region. These data show that endogenous HES1 protein in melanoma cells binds to MAP2 promoter region, and suggest that HES1 acts as a dominant factor in regulating MAP2 promoter activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of Notch in the regulation of MAP2 promoter activity in melanoma cells</title><p>To test the effect of Notch1 signaling, a regulator of HES1 expression, on MAP2 promoter activity in melanoma cells, we treated primary and metastatic melanoma cells with &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor, DAPT (which inhibits the cleavage of intracellular domain of Notch1 and hence Notch1 signaling) and/or transfected with HES1shRNA. In primary melanoma cell line WM35, a dose-dependent increase in MAP2 promoter activity was observed with increasing dose of &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Transfection with HES1shRNA or transfection followed by treatment with &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor also caused similar activation of MAP2 promoter. In contrast, treatment with &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor alone was not sufficient to activate MAP2 promoter in metastatic melanoma cell line 451Lu. Transfection with HES1shRNA alone or transfection with HES1 shRNA followed by treatment with &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor was able to upregulate MAP2 promoter activity in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Treatment with DMSO or transfection with control shRNA did not significantly affect MAP2 promoter activity and were used as controls. Western blot analysis showed that transfection with HES1shRNA alone or treatment of shRNA transfected cells with DAPT decreased the level of HES1 more effectively in primary melanoma cells than in metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Although we did not observe a marked reduction in HES1 levels in shRNA transfected 451Lu cells, there was &#x0223c;2-fold increase in MAP2 promoter activity indicating that MAP2 promoter may be sensitive to small changes in HES1 levels. These data suggest that primary melanoma cells are more sensitive to Notch1 inhibition and MAP2 promoter upregulation than metastatic melanoma cells and are consistent with earlier published observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Human cutaneous melanoma is known to exhibit molecular plasticity and often express genes characteristic of neural cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).

Interestingly, promoter sequence of <italic>MAP2</italic> gene does not share any common features with other MAP genes. Our data show that MAP2 promoter that supports tissue-specific activity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> contains multiple bHLH binding sites. We also show that MAP2 promoter is regulated by the neuronal bHLH transcription factors consistent with the wide use of MAP2 expression as marker for neuronal differentiation. Neuron-specific activity of promoters of other MAP genes is less well defined. For example, a 2.4 kb 5&#x02032; region of mouse MAP1A, which contains two TATA-less promoters and one Sp1 site that regulate the expression of two alternative transcripts, was shown to be active in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Rat and human MAP1B promoter sequences, however, contain a consensus element known as &#x02018;neuronal motif&#x02019; (common to several neuronal genes such as GAP43, perinephrin and neurofilament), a Sp1 site, a TCC repeat and a cAMP response element. However, none of these elements appears to be necessary for neuron-specific MAP1B promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Similarly, although promoters for mouse, rat and human tau genes have been isolated, no consensus elements for neuron-specific expression were defined.</p><p>A distinguishing feature of MAP2 promoter is the presence of multiple E boxes, which are known to be recognized by bHLH factors including those that participate in the regulation of cell and tissue-specific gene expression. Presence of E boxes is consistent with neuronal differentiation-specific expression of MAP2. Among the E boxes in the MAP2 promoter, a cluster of three proximal E boxes (E9&#x02013;E11) are of particular interest because (i) they are strictly conserved among mouse, rat and human, including their relative distance from the transcription start site and spacing between the boxes and (ii) the distal E-box (E9) within this composite element contains a NeuroD-binding sequence CAGATG, identical to that found in well-characterized NeuroD target gene rat glucagon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Other known NeuroD target genes that also contain a cluster of three or four E boxes in their proximal promoter regions are insulin and insulinoma-associated antigen 1, Pax6 and sulfonylurea receptor I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). A comparison of NeuroD-binding E boxes of these genes (including MAP2) showed that NeuroD preferentially binds to the sequence CAN(A/G/T)NTG. Other E-box-like elements (CACNTG) found within this cluster do not appear to be functional with respect to NeuroD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Mutational analysis of E9, E10 and E11 boxes of MAP2 promoter and gel-shift data presented in this study also support these earlier published observations.</p><p>Neuronal differentiation is known to be regulated not only by transcriptional activators but also by HES and Id family of repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). Among these repressors, the role of HES1 has been extensively investigated. For example, neuronal precursor cells infected with HES1-transducing retrovirus do not differentiate into neurons and fail to activate expression of neuronal markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>), and Hes1 null mice express both early and late neuronal markers, including MAP2, prematurely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). HES family repressors can inhibit gene expression either directly by binding (as homodimers) to their cognate-binding elements known as N-boxes (CACNAG) or indirectly by dominant-negative regulation (by forming non-functional heterodimers with transcriptional activators). To our knowledge, rat and human achaete-scute homolog-1 (MASH1), HES1 and E2F1 are the only genes shown to be directly repressed by binding of HES1 to the respective promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). In HES1 proximal promoter there are three N-boxes and all three have been shown to bind HES1 and contribute in the autoregulation of HES1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). E2F1 promoter has a single N-box and binding of HES1 to this element appears to inhibit estrogen and heregulin-mediated upregulation of E2F1 in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). On the other hand, hASH1 promoter contains a single HES1-binding class C site with a core sequence CACGCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). In human MAP2 promoter, we identified two putative N-boxes, a distal CACAAG (N1) and a proximal CACGAG (N2) box. We showed, by mutational and gel-shift analysis, that the proximal N2 box is involved in HES1-mediated regulation of the promoter activity. Interestingly, these N-boxes are not present in the mouse and rat MAP2 promoters, although a N-box-like CAGGAG element, conserved between the mouse and the rat MAP2, is found at a position similar to that of human MAP2 promoter. However, the role of this N-box-like sequence in the regulation of MAP2 expression in these species remains to be investigated.</p><p>Our data show that <italic>MAP2</italic> gene contains both positive (E boxes) and negative (N-boxes) regulatory elements and suggest that MAP2 expression might be regulated by a balance between positive and negative bHLH factors NeuroD and HES1. This is consistent with the proposal that transition of neuronal precursor cells from proliferation to neurogenesis involves coordinate increase in the pro-neural bHLH factors and a decrease in the activity of HES and Id factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that <italic>in vivo MAP2</italic> gene might be regulated by a balance between NeuroD and HES1. For example, in rat insulinoma InR1G9 cell line, insulin gene (a NeuroD target) has been shown to be regulated by the ratio of NeuroD and the transcription repressor Id1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). It is therefore possible that variable levels of MAP2 promoter activity in melanoma cell lines may be due to variable ratio of NeuroD and HES1, as both factors are expressed in all melanoma cell lines tested. In this context, it is of interest to note that whereas transfection with increasing amounts of Hes1 plasmid produced a dose-dependent decrease of NeuroD activation of MAP2 promoter, transfection with increasing amount of NeuroD was unable to relieve the repression of the promoter by Hes1. Thus, MAP2 promoter activity seems to be regulated predominantly by HES1 levels. This possibility is also supported by the results of the ChIP assay, which showed that in melanoma cells N-box region of <italic>MAP2</italic> gene promoter is occupied by endogenous HES1 protein. Further, reducing endogenous HES1 protein level in melanoma cells using HES1shRNA was also able to increase the basal activity of MAP2 promoter.</p><p>It is also relevant to note that Notch1 signaling, which activates HES1 gene expression, has been shown to be elevated in melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). It has also been shown that the activation of Notch1 signaling is required for &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated human primary melanoma progression and that primary melanoma cells are more sensitive to Notch1 inhibition than metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Our data, using Notch1 inhibitor, indicate an involvement of Notch1 signaling via HES1 in the regulation of MAP2 gene expression. In agreement with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), we found that primary melanoma cells are more responsive than metastatic cells to inhibition of Notch1 signaling and MAP2 promoter upregulation. These data are also consistent with our earlier findings that MAP2 is expressed more frequently in primary lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Thus, blocking of Notch1 signaling and/or HES1 may be considered as useful therapeutic strategy for melanoma treatment. However, our preliminary findings on induction of endogenous <italic>MAP2</italic> gene expression suggest that in addition to regulation by Notch signaling, <italic>MAP2</italic> gene is also regulated by epigenetic mechanisms (Nityanand Maddodi, Kumar M. R. Bhat and Vijayasaradhi Setaluri, unpublished data), indicating a tight regulation of this gene during melanoma progression.</p><p>In summary, our findings on the regulation of neuronal MAP2 promoter gene in melanoma cells are relevant to understanding molecular mechanisms of melanoma progression. A more detailed understanding of the regulation of <italic>MAP2</italic> gene transcription in melanoma cells might allow us to design and develop strategies that can activate this gene as a novel therapeutic approach for malignant melanoma.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Kageyama for providing pCI-Hes1 construct and anti-Hes1 antibody, Dr Jan for providing pcDNA-NeuroD1-FLAG construct, and Dr Suh-Kim for providing NeuroD antibody.
