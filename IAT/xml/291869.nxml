STAT1 is the primary mediator of IFN&#x003b3; action. ZBP-89 is a transcription factor that binds to the G&#x0002f;C-rich elements and mediates p53-independent apoptosis. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis revealed that a G-rich element from &#x0002b;171 to &#x0002b;179 within the first intron of the STAT1 gene is critical for optimal STAT1 promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and promoter analysis revealed that ZBP-89 binds directly to this STAT1 G-rich element along with Sp1 and Sp3. Reduction of ZBP-89 with siRNA attenuated both basal and IFN&#x003b3;-induced STAT1 expression and subsequently diminished the activation of apoptotic markers, e.g. caspase-3 and PARP. Taken together, we conclude that ZBP-89 is required for constitutive STAT1 expression and in this way contributes to the ability of cells to be activated by IFN&#x003b3;.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>ZBP-89 (ZNF148, Zfp148) is a Kr&#x000fc;ppel-type zinc finger protein that is ubiquitously expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c1">1</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that ZBP-89 possesses multiple functions, including transcriptional regulation of a variety of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c2">2</xref>), cell growth arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c4">4</xref>) and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c3">3</xref>). Recently a haploinsufficient mouse model of ZBP-89 has underscored the importance of the protein in cell growth. Zfp148&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x02013; embryonic stem (ES) cells are resistant to the growth-inhibitory effects of serum starvation and continue to proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c5">5</xref>). In contrast, wild-type ES cells that are serum starved arrest their cell growth. Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 is reduced in haploinsufficient (Zfp148&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x02013;) ES cells. Thus reduced ZBP-89 protein levels render ES cells susceptible to unregulated cell growth through a p53-dependent mechanism. Moreover, this mouse study confirms the prior biochemical observation that ZBP-89 inhibition of cell growth requires p53 stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c3">3</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its role in cell growth, elevated levels of ZBP-89 initiate programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c3">3</xref>). Using a p53 null cell line, we showed that p53 is not required for ZBP-89-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c3">3</xref>). This result raised the possibility that ZBP-89 might be a key mediator of pro-apoptotic signals that do not require p53. The molecular mechanisms of p53-independent apoptosis are poorly defined. Extracellular signals that trigger p53-independent apoptotic pathways generally include withdrawal of growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. For example, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN&#x003b3; induces apoptosis through mechanisms independent of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c6">6</xref>). In addition to induction of apoptosis, IFN&#x003b3; also sensitizes cancer cells to death signals, e.g. Fas ligand and TRAIL, that also function independently of p53 status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c8">8</xref>). In some cells, the synergistic actions of IFN&#x003b3; and death-inducing agents has been attributed to STAT1 activation by IFN&#x003b3; and subsequent increased expression of caspase-8, &#x02013;9 and &#x02013;3 and inhibition of Bcl-2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c9">9</xref>). This may have relevance in breast cancer treatment since BRCA-1 confers IFN&#x003b3;-, but not IFN-&#x003b1;- or IFN-&#x003b2;-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c10">10</xref>). Interestingly, a recent microarray analysis of MCF-7 cells revealed that overexpression of BRCA-1 increases ZBP-89 expression 2-fold, suggesting that ZBP-89 lies downstream of this tumor suppressor gene product.</p><p>Among the various STAT proteins, STAT1 is a key mediator of IFN&#x003b3; action. STAT1 mediates IFN&#x003b3; action by directly regulating the expression of a variety of genes involved in cell growth arrest and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c11">11</xref>). STAT1 expression in tumors has been shown to be important for the elimination of malignant cells by immune surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c12">12</xref>). Change in its phosphorylation status is generally the accepted mechanism for STAT1 activation and translocation to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c11">11</xref>). However, the regulation of STAT1 transcription remains undefined. Recently, an enhancer region conferring IFN&#x003b3; activation to the STAT1 gene was characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c9">9</xref>). The enhancer is located in the first intron at &#x0002b;1 to &#x0002b;495 and is G&#x0002f;C-rich. Here we show that ZBP-89 binds to a G-rich element within the first intron of the human STAT1 gene and is required for constitutive expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibodies and chemicals</title><p>Rabbit ZBP-89 antibody has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c1">1</xref>).

STAT1 is the key mediator of IFN&#x003b3; action and the IFN&#x003b3;-regulatory element in the STAT1 gene fragment is G&#x0002f;C rich. Since ZBP-89 binds to G&#x0002f;C-rich elements and promotes p53-independent apoptosis, we tested whether ZBP-89 regulates STAT1 expression and contributes to IFN&#x003b3;-induced apoptosis. To test whether ZBP-89 regulates STAT1 expression, Flag-tagged ZBP-89 was overexpressed in HCT116 cells using an adenoviral vector. We found that elevated levels of ZBP-89 had no significant effect on STAT1 protein levels in the cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f1">1</xref>A). Protein levels of the stress-regulated kinase JNK were used as the loading control. Since elevated levels of ZBP-89 did not increase STAT1 protein, we examined whether reduced levels of ZBP-89 affected both STAT1 protein levels and phosphorylation status. A ZBP-89-specific siRNA targeting the ZBP-89 cDNA from &#x0002b;144 to &#x0002b;164 was tested in the cell. A point mutation within the ZBP-89 siRNA abolished the ability of siRNA to reduce protein levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f1">1</xref>B). We found that reduced levels of ZBP-89 reduced the basal levels of STAT1 protein but not STAT2, 3, 5 and 6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f1">1</xref>B). IFN&#x003b3; had a minimal effect on the endogenous levels of ZBP-89 and STAT2, 3, 5 and 6, but significantly induced the protein levels and phosphorylation state of STAT1. Consistent with its ability to reduce STAT1 protein levels, lower levels of ZBP-89 also attenuated IFN&#x003b3;-induced STAT1 phosphorylation. The reduction of STAT1 expression and phosphorylation was independent of p53 status (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f1">1</xref>B and C). Therefore we concluded that there is a threshold level of ZBP-89 that is required for basal STAT1 expression.</p><p>To examine the effect of ZBP-89 siRNA on basal and IFN&#x003b3; induction of STAT1 as well as expression of other STATs, three additional cell lines were used. We found that IFN&#x003b3; induction of ZBP-89 was modest in the U2OS osteosarcoma cell line and coincided with the strong induction of STAT1 protein. Despite no significant induction of ZBP-89 by IFN&#x003b3; in the MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines, reduced levels of ZBP-89 diminished basal and inducible STAT1 protein. In U2OS and MCF-7 cells, there was also a significant reduction in the basal levels of STAT6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f2">2</xref>A). To further examine whether ZBP-89 siRNA affects STAT1 expression at the transcriptional level, an RNase protection assay was performed. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f2">2</xref>B, ZBP-89 siRNA significantly and specifically reduced STAT1 and STAT6 mRNA levels in MCF-7 cells. Therefore reduction of ZBP-89 selectively affects the levels of STAT1 and sometimes STAT6 in cells, but not STAT2, 3 and 5. This result indicates that ZBP-89 regulation is most specific for STAT1 in a number of cell types.</p></sec><sec><title>ZBP-89 is required for STAT1 constitutive expression</title><p>To understand how ZBP-89 regulates STAT1 expression, three different segments of the human STAT1 gene were subcloned into the pGL3&#x02013;basic luciferase reporter vector. Two of the contructs contained either 972 or 4 bp of 5&#x02032; flanking sequence upstream from the start site of transcripiton, and included up to 884 bp of downstream sequence that contained the first and second exons separated by the first intron (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f3">3</xref>). The IFN&#x003b3;-responsive element reported previously is contained within the DNA segment from &#x0002b;1 to &#x0002b;498 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c15">15</xref>). The basal promoter activity of these three STAT1 constructs was tested by transfecting them into HCT116 cells. Deletion of the region from &#x02013;972 to &#x02013;5 slightly reduced the promoter activity, while the most dramatic reduction in the promoter activity occurred by eliminating the region from &#x02013;4 to &#x0002b;583. Removal of this segment and loss of the basal promoter activity overlapped the region from &#x0002b;1 to &#x0002b;498 that directs IFN&#x003b3; induction of STAT1. Within the region from &#x0002b;1 to &#x0002b;498, the IFN&#x003b3; response element has been reported to be specifically at &#x0002b;466 to &#x0002b;495 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c15">15</xref>). Reduction of ZBP-89 protein levels with siRNA decreased the activity of phSTAT1-1856 and phSTAT1-888 reporter constructs by &#x0223c;50&#x00025; in HCT116 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f3">3</xref>C). These two STAT1 reporter constructs contained the intact G-rich element. In contrast, the effect of ZBP-89 siRNA was minimal on phSTAT1-300 element in which the G-rich element was deleted. Moreover the effect on an unrelated reporter, e.g. pCMV-&#x003b2;-gal, was also minimal. These data indicated that the ZBP-89-responsive element resides within the region from &#x02013;4 to &#x0002b;584 and is essential for basal STAT1 transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>The G-rich element is essential for basal STAT1 transcription</title><p>Transcription factor binding analysis revealed that there are two putative ZBP-89 binding sites within the region from &#x02013;4 to &#x0002b;888: a G-rich element from &#x0002b;171 to &#x0002b;179 and a C-rich element from &#x0002b;766 to &#x0002b;776 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f4">4</xref>A). Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to disrupt the G- or C-rich elements. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f4">4</xref>B, disruption of the G-rich element attenuated STAT1 promoter activity by &#x0223c;50&#x02013;80&#x00025; in the different cell lines examined, while mutation of the C-rich element had no significant effect on STAT1 promoter activity. To further examine whether ZBP-89 was required for the residual promoter activity of phSTAT1-1856&#x0002f;M2 construct containing the mutated G-rich element, HCT116 cells were first transfected with ZBP-89 siRNA followed by transfection of the phSTAT1-1856WT and mutant reporters. siRNA treatment of cells transfected with phSTAT1-1856WT or M1 constructs exhibited &#x0223c;35&#x02013;44&#x00025; lower promoter activity. In contrast, siRNA treatment had no significant effect on expression of the phSTAT1-1856M2 construct that contained the mutated putative ZBP-89 G-rich site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f4">4</xref>C). Thus ZBP-89 regulates STAT1 basal promoter activity via the G-rich element at &#x0002b;171 to &#x0002b;179.</p></sec><sec><title>ZBP-89 binds to the G-rich element on STAT1 promoter</title><p>To further test whether ZBP-89 binds to this G-rich element, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f5">5</xref>A, five major DNA&#x02013;protein complexes were observed with a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled double-stranded G-rich element. One hundred times the molar excess of unlabeled G-rich element abolished all five of the DNA&#x02013;protein complexes. The rabbit IgG slightly reduced the intensities of all the DNA&#x02013;protein complexes but did not disrupt or shift any of the DNA&#x02013;protein complexes. In the presence of ZBP-89 specific antibody, the third DNA&#x02013;protein complex was supershifted into the Sp1 complex (note increased intensity) and also generated a very slowly migrating complex. To further explore the relationship between ZBP-89&#x02013;DNA and Sp1&#x0002f;Sp3&#x02013;DNA binding, ZBP-89 siRNA was used to silence ZBP-89 expression in HCT116 cells and the nuclear protein was used for gel shift assays. Reduction of ZBP-89 increased the binding of Sp1 but had a minimal effect on Sp1 protein levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f5">5</xref>B and C). Taken together, these results demonstrated that ZBP-89 binds to a STAT1 regulatory sequence and is a critical transcription factor that mediates constitutive STAT1 transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced ZBP-89 levels attenuate IFN&#x003b3;-induced apoptosis</title><p>IFN&#x003b3; induces apoptosis or sensitizes cancer cells to apoptotic stimuli by increasing STAT1-mediated caspase-9, &#x02013;8 and&#x0002f;or &#x02013;3 expression in a variety of cancer cells. Since ZBP-89 is required for STAT1 constitutive expression, we examined whether ZBP-89 is required for IFN&#x003b3;-mediated apoptosis. siRNA was used to reduce cellular ZBP-89 expression prior to IFN&#x003b3; treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f6">6</xref>). We found that reduced ZBP-89 levels attenuated IFN&#x003b3;-induced caspase-8 and &#x02013;3 activation and downstream PARP cleavage. Thus physiological levels of ZBP-89 also contribute to IFN&#x003b3;-mediated apoptotic action.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we identified a G-rich element in the STAT1 promoter that confers ZBP-89 regulation. ZBP-89 was found to regulate basal rather than inducible expression of the STAT1 gene. The results indicate that reduced levels of ZBP-89 correlated with reduced levels of STAT1 expression. These lower levels also diminished induction of STAT1 expression by IFN&#x003b3;. Only one of two candidate G&#x0002f;C-rich ZBP-89 elements resides within the IFN&#x003b3;-inducible fragment of the STAT1 gene. Site-directed mutagenesis of the gene and EMSAs revealed that regulation by ZBP-89 occurred at the G-rich element in the first intron. As observed in other promoters, the element recognized by ZBP-89 in the STAT1 gene was also bound by Sp1 and Sp3. Sp1, Sp3 and ZBP-89 have similar G&#x0002f;C-rich target regulatory elements. For example, the ZBP-89 consensus binding site is CCT&#x0002f;ACCCCC, while the core binding site for Sp1&#x0002f;Sp3 is GGGCGGG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c17">17</xref>). Sp1, Sp3 and other Sp-like transcription factors are important components of the eukaryotic transcriptional machinery and regulate the expression of a number of genes with G&#x0002f;C-rich promoters. Generally, Sp1 functions as a transcriptional activator while Sp3 functions as either an activator or repressor, depending on the promoter. Our result does not exclude the role of Sp1 and Sp3 in the basal transcription of STAT1, but would need further analysis.</p><p>Reducing ZBP-89 levels or mutation of the G-rich element decreased STAT1 promoter activity by 40&#x02013;80&#x00025; (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f4">4</xref>), which suggests that other transcription factors, e.g. Sp1 and Sp3, are also required for STAT1 basal transcription. Although few studies have investigated the combined role of STAT1 and Sp1 in the regulation of gene expression, there is a precedent for the involvement of binding sites for these two transcription factors in the IFN&#x003b3; induction of the interleukin 6 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c18">18</xref>). Moreover, there is also evidence that Sp1 and STAT1 form protein&#x02013;protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c19">19</xref>). Likewise, ZBP-89 may either cooperate or compete with Sp1-dependent promoter activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c20">20</xref>). Interestingly, the ability of ZBP-89 to form a complex with Sp1 may explain the presence of the slowest migrating DNA&#x02013;protein&#x02013; antibody complex supershifted with ZBP-89 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f5">5</xref>A, lane 5). Moreover, reduced ZBP-89 expression increased Sp1 binding to the G-rich element (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f5">5</xref>B), suggesting possible competition between ZBP-89 and Sp1 for the same element.</p><p>Multiple extracellular signals initiate apoptosis in the absence of functional p53. Moreover, these mechanisms have been the focus of intense investigation owing to the frequent occurrence of mutated p53 in cancers rendering the cell essentially null for p53 and resistant to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c21">21</xref>). Inflammation appears to produce prime candidates in the form of cytokines, which trigger apoptosis independent of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c5">5</xref>). This may explain why they are effective adjuncts to anticancer therapy despite non-functional p53. IFN&#x003b3; treatment stimulates STAT1 activation and subsequently downstream promoters, e.g. caspase-8, &#x02013;9 and &#x02013;3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c15">15</xref>). Although IFN&#x003b3; increases ZBP-89 levels in some cell lines, e.g. U2OS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f2">2</xref>A), the predominant effect of ZBP-89 on IFN&#x003b3; induction is on sustaining basal levels of STAT1 gene expression available for inducible phosphorylation. In this way, ZBP-89 contributes to effective IFN&#x003b3;-mediated apoptosis. Similar to our findings here, BRCA1, a tumor suppressor gene implicated in transcriptional regulation, also regulates IFN&#x003b3;-mediated apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c21">21</xref>). In our study using a BRCA1 mutant cell line MCF-7, silencing ZBP-89 expression with siRNA reduced both STAT1 promoter activity and protein levels (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg929f3">3</xref>B). In fact, microarray analysis of the MCF-7 cell line has revealed that ZBP-89 increases 2-fold when wild-type BRCA-1 is overexpressed in this cell line. This result suggests that ZBP-89 lies downstream of this tumor suppressor gene product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c22">22</xref>). Thus there may be synergy between BRCA1 and ZBP-89 proteins to mediate IFN&#x003b3;-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines.</p><p>Besides STAT1, silencing ZBP-89 also reduced STAT6 protein levels in both MCF-7 and U2OS cells. Whether the effect of ZBP-89 is due to direct binding to this promoter has not been determined. STAT6 mediates multiple cytokine actions. STAT6 null mice show reduced IL-4-mediated Th2 differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c23">23</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies performed in MCF-7 cells show that STAT6 not only inhibits cellular proliferation and induces apoptosis but also mediates IL-4-induced growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg929c24">24</xref>). Whether ZBP-89 plays a role in IL-4 cytokine activation is not yet known, but certainly warrants further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg929f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Silencing ZBP-89 gene expression reduces STAT1 expression.
