In search of proteins closely related to LZIP, we have identified a liver-enriched transcription factor CREB-H. LZIP and CREB-H represent a new subfamily of bZIP factors. CREB-H activates transcription by binding to cAMP responsive element, box B, and ATF6-binding element. Interestingly, CREB-H has a putative transmembrane (TM) domain and it localizes ambiently to the endoplasmic reticulum. Proteolytic cleavage that removes the TM domain leads to nuclear translocation and activation of CREB-H. CREB-H activates the promoter of hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. This activation can be further stimulated by cAMP and protein kinase A. CREB-H transcript is exclusively abundant in adult liver. In contrast, the expression of CREB-H mRNA is aberrantly reduced in hepatoma tissues and cells. The enforced expression of CREB-H suppresses the proliferation of cultured hepatoma cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that the liver-enriched bZIP transcription factor CREB-H is a growth suppressor that plays a role in hepatic physiology and pathology.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The establishment and maintenance of a differentiated phenotype in a given tissue requires specific gene expression program. In liver, this is accomplished by the coordinated action of a group of liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs). Well-characterized LETFs include hepatocyte nuclear factors-1 (HNF1), HNF3, HNF4, HNF6, CAATT enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) and D-box binding protein. These factors are activated in a precise temporal and spatial order during liver development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), and they form a regulatory network that controls the expression of a repertoire of liver-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Thus, HNF3 is required for inducing the endoderm to adopt a hepatic fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Once the pre-hepatic cells are committed, HNF4&#x003b1; is essential for complete differentiation of hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) and C/EBP&#x003b1; regulates a number of genes required for energy metabolism in adult liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>).</p><p>Dysregulation of liver-specific transcription is a hallmark of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Indeed, most of the dysregulated genes identified in an HCC expression profiling study are known to be regulated by LETFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). In addition, among the LETFs, HNF1, HNF3&#x003b2;, HNF4&#x003b1; and HNF4&#x003b3; have been shown to be up-regulated in HCC samples whereas the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). In this regard, C/EBP&#x003b1; may serve as a growth suppressor through stabilization of p21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), and repression of E2F-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>bZIP transcription factors are a large family of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins characterized by a basic domain, which interacts with DNA, and a leucine zipper or coiled coil region critical for dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). C/EBP&#x003b1; and CREB are two prototypic bZIP proteins that have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). In the CREB family of bZIP transcription factors, box B-binding factor 2 (BBF2)/dCREB-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) has been identified in a screen for proteins that specifically bind to the box B element in the fat-body-specific enhancer of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> alcohol dehydrogenase gene. The fat body, a functional counterpart of the mammalian liver, is a major organ for energy metabolism in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. It is noteworthy that BBF2 also binds to and activates CRE and box B-like element located in the promoter of human alcohol dehydrogenase as well as rat tyrosine aminotransferase genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Thus, box B-like elements and their binding proteins likely represent an important and evolutionarily conserved component in the liver-specific regulatory circuit. Interestingly, a human liver-specific bZIP protein called CREB-H has also been described. CREB-H specifically binds to box B and activates box B-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), suggesting that it may be functionally equivalent to BBF2.</p><p>A mammalian homolog of BBF2 termed LZIP/CREB3 has previously been identified and characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). LZIP interacts with host cell factor-1 and host cell factor-like protein 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The ubiquitously expressed LZIP protein binds to canonical CRE and regulates cell proliferation. It is also a binding partner and transformation cofactor of hepatitis C virus core protein. Loss of LZIP function in NIH3T3 cells induces morphological transformation and anchorage-independent growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). In searching for additional factors closely related to LZIP, we identified a mouse bZIP protein orthologous to human CREB-H. LZIP and CREB-H represent a new subfamily of bZIP proteins with a unique putative transmembrane (TM) domain lined to the bZIP region. Removal of TM domain and the remaining C-terminal sequences translocates CREB-H from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the nucleus and renders it a potent transactivator. CREB-H activates transcription by binding not only to CRE and box B but also to ATF6 element. CREB-H transcript is exclusively abundant in adult liver. In contrast, the expression of CREB-H mRNA is aberrantly reduced in hepatoma tissues and cells. Overexpression of the full-length CREB-H and its active form suppress proliferation of HepG2 hepatoma cells. Our findings indicate that CREB-H is a liver-enriched bZIP transcription factor critically involved in hepatic physiology and hepatocarcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The mouse CREB-H cDNA clone (IMAGE 1887290) was obtained from Invitrogen.

Subsequently, a highly homologous human protein was identified in a search for liver-specific transcription factor through random sequencing of cDNAs in libraries derived from human liver. This protein designated CREB-H is specifically expressed in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). In light of the high homology between the two proteins (67% identity and 73% similarity), the LZIP-related protein we identified likely represents the mouse ortholog of human CREB-H. Notably, the official name for CREB-H as approved by Mouse Genome Informatics is cAMP responsive element binding protein 3-like 3 protein (CREB3L3; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org"/>). For simplicity and consistency, hereafter we will call it mouse CREB-H. The mouse CREB-H locus was found to locate in chromosome 10. The gene is 8.5 kb in length and contains 12 exons.</p><p>Interestingly, several additional mammalian bZIP proteins significantly homologous to LZIP and CREB-H have been identified more recently. These include AIBZIP/Atce1/CREB4/CREB3L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>) and human BBF2H7/CREB3L2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). These proteins contain a short stretch of hydrophobic amino acids, which was predicted to be a TM domain by two programs HMMTOP (Hungarian Academy of Sciences; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.enzim.hu/hmmtop"/>) and PredictProtein (Columbia University; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein"/>). The C-terminal TM domain immediately adjacent to the bZIP region is highly conserved in this unique group of bZIP proteins. Indeed, phylogenetic analysis based on protein sequences segregates these bZIP proteins into a new subfamily distinct from CREB and ATF6.</p></sec><sec><title>CREB-H preferentially recognizes CRE, ATF6 and box B elements</title><p>Human CREB-H binds to CRE and box B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). However, mouse Atce1 closely related to CREB-H has been shown to recognize &#x003ba;B motif instead of CRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). To clarify this issue, recombinant polyhistidine-tagged mouse CREB-HZ protein, which contains the bZIP region (amino acids 206&#x02013;318), was expressed and purified from <italic>E.coli</italic>. This protein was then tested for its ability to bind various <sup>32</sup>P-labeled DNA elements using the EMSA assay. In addition to CRE, box B and &#x003ba;B site, canonical ATF6-binding element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) was also examined because ATF6 has a TM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>) and shares some similarity to CREB-H subfamily proteins. ERSE-I and ERSE-II are two different ATF6-responsive elements found in the promoter of GRP78 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) and Herp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) genes, respectively. CREB-H was found to bind strongly to canonical CRE, ATF6 and box B elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 1, 5 and 6), but not to AP-1 or &#x003ba;B motif (lanes 2 and 4). CREB-H also bound less potently to CRE in the rat PEPCK gene, ERSE-I and ERSE-II (lanes 8&#x02013;10), but it hardly recognized Sp1 and C/EBP&#x003b1; motifs (lanes 3 and 7). Results from the competition EMSA assay using 10- and 50-fold cold oligonucleotides verified the specific interaction of CREB-H with CRE, ATF6 and box B elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Proteolytic processing of CREB-H in cultured cells</title><p>We raised two polyclonal antisera (&#x003b1;-CH8 and &#x003b1;-CH9) in rabbits against the N-terminal 84 amino acids of CREB-H. We then performed western blotting with these antibodies to probe CREB-H protein in Hepa1-6 hepatoma cells that were either mock-transfected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 1 and 5), transfected with an untagged CREB-H-expressing plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;4) or transfected with a FLAG-tagged CREB-H expressing plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;8). Consistent with our results from northern blot analysis (see below in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the amount of endogenous CREB-H protein in Hepa1-6 cells was very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 1 and 5). In contrast, several additional &#x003b1;-CH8/9-reactive protein bands were observed in CREB-H-overexpressing Hepa1-6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 2 and 6).</p><p>To verify the identity of these reactive bands, we tested the pre-immune sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 4 and 8) and performed protein blocking assay by pre-incubating &#x003b1;-CH8/9 with an excess amount of recombinant CREB-H protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 3 and 7). Because neither pre-immune nor depleted &#x003b1;-CH8/9 recognized the bands of &#x0223c;80 and 50 kDa in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 3, 4, 7 and 9), these bands should represent specific CREB-H-derived species. While the &#x0223c;80 kDa proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 2 and 6, bands with an arrow) plausibly represent the full-length CREB-H and FLAG-CREB-H, the 50 kDa species (bands with an arrowhead) might be a cleaved product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, compare lane 2 to 3, and lane 6 to 7). Both forms of CREB-H might have extensive post-translational modifications because their sizes are larger than predicted.</p><p>Since &#x003b1;-CH8/9 recognizes the N-terminus of CREB-H, the appearance of 50 kDa &#x003b1;-CH-reactive species suggests site-specific proteolysis of CREB-H at the C-terminus. To verify the specificity of &#x003b1;-CH8/9 and to further characterize the proteolytic processing of CREB-H, we expressed two versions of CREB-H proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, full-length CREB-H and truncated CREB-H&#x00394;TC) fused to GFP. In CREB-H&#x00394;TC, a C-terminal part including the TM domain was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Comparison of this artificially truncated protein with the proteolytic fragments of CREB-H might shed light on the cleavage site in CREB-H. To this end, Hepa1-6 cells were transfected with GFP-CREB-H and GFP-CREB-H&#x00394;TC plasmids and the cell extracts were examined by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>With increasing amounts of protein loaded, &#x003b1;-CH9 was able to detect a band of &#x0223c;110 kDa in size that corresponds to GFP-CREB-H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, upper panel, lanes 2&#x02013;4). The blot was re-probed with a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (&#x003b1;-GFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lower panel, lanes 3 and 4). The reaction of the 110 kDa band with both &#x003b1;-CH9 and &#x003b1;-GFP verified the identity of GFP-CREB-H and it also lent further support to the specificity of &#x003b1;-CH9.</p><p>Likewise, both &#x003b1;-CH9 and &#x003b1;-GFP recognized the GFP-CREB-H&#x00394;TC protein of 75 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 5). Interestingly, in cells that had been transfected with a GFP-CREB-H plasmid but not a GFP-CREB-H&#x00394;TC construct, an &#x003b1;-CH9- and &#x003b1;-GFP-reactive band of about the same size was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, compare lane 4 with lane 5, bands with arrows). This species plausibly represents a processed form of CREB-H that had been cleaved at a specific site. Because the size of this cleavage product is almost identical to that of GFP-CREB-H&#x00394;TC, the actual cleavage site was predicted to be very close to the junction between bZIP and TM regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). It is noteworthy that this cleaved species of 77 kDa shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> corresponds to the 50 kDa band in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. The difference in molecular mass (&#x0223c;27 kDa) was accounted for by GFP. In addition, when we performed immunoprecipitation with &#x003b1;-CH8 and extracts of cells transfected with either FLAG-CREB-H or GFP-CREB-H plasmid, two major protein species corresponding to the full-length and cleaved forms of CREB-H, respectively, were found in the precipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked whether proteolysis also occurs in HepG2 cells stably transduced with a lentivirus expressing CREB-H. In keeping with results obtained from transfected cells, a strong &#x0223c;80 kDa band and a weaker &#x0223c;50 kDa species reactive to &#x003b1;-CH9 were observed in extracts of lentivirus-transduced cells (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, lane 2 with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 5). These two protein bands were not seen when &#x003b1;-CH9 was depleted with recombinant CREB-H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, lane 4). As a size reference for the &#x0223c;50 kDa band observed in lentivirus-transduced cells, protein extract of HepG2 cells expressing CREB-H&#x00394;TC, which did not react to depleted &#x003b1;-CH9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, lane 5), was also examined (cf. lane 3 with lane 2).</p></sec><sec><title>CREB-H activates CRE- and ATF6 element-dependent transcription</title><p>Human CREB-H has been shown to activate box B-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Box B is a fat-body-specific enhancer in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and box B-like sequences in mammalian cells have not been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). In light of the strong binding of CREB-H to CRE and ATF6 element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we next asked whether CREB-H was able to drive transcription from CRE or ATF6 element. To address this, we co-transfected a CREB-H expressing plasmid and either pCRE-Luc or pATF6-Luc reporter plasmid into HepG2 hepatoma cells and assayed for luciferase activity. For comparison, we also tested the activities of ATF4, ATF6, CREB and C/EBP&#x003b1; on CRE and ATF6 enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). While the full-length CREB-H weakly activated CRE-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, 1.6-fold activation), it was capable of stimulating the ATF6 enhancer to 4.9-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This potency is comparable with that of ATF4, CREB and C/EBP&#x003b1; (11.3-, 3.9- and 6.9-fold activation, respectively).</p><p>It is generally accepted that removal of the TM domain from ATF6 and LZIP leads to the activation of these transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). The proteolytic cleavage of ATF6 can be induced <italic>in vivo</italic> in response to ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>), but the physiological stimuli for the activation of LZIP remain elusive. CREB-H also contains a TM domain, which is probably removed through site-specific proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) as exemplified in the cases of ATF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) and SREBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). To test the hypothesis that CREB-H could also be activated through regulated proteolysis, we asked whether the truncated CREB-H&#x00394;TC devoid of the TM and C-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) might have a higher transcriptional activity. Indeed, CREB-H&#x00394;TC acted as a transcriptional activator on both CRE and ATF6 element, resulting in &#x0223c;100- and 30-fold increase of luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). In this setting, CREB-H&#x00394;TC is more potent than CREB, ATF4, ATF6 and C/EBP&#x003b1;. This raised the possibility that the truncated CREB-H&#x00394;TC might be functionally equivalent to the physiologically active form of CREB-H generated through site-specific proteolysis <italic>in vivo</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>CREB-H is activated in response to cAMP stimulation</title><p>cAMP is a ubiquitous second messenger and regulator of gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). In one well-characterized pathway, cAMP activates PKA, which phosphorylates and activates CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). In addition, C/EBPs are also responsive to cAMP stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). This prompted us to investigate the regulation of CREB-H by cAMP. We measured the activities of CREB-H and CREB-H&#x00394;TC on the pCRE-Luc and pATF6-Luc reporters with or without the addition of Fsk, which stimulates adenylate cyclase leading to increased cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Fsk did not activate ATF6 element-dependent transcription significantly with the exception of CREB-H, which was stimulated mildly by Fsk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, &#x0223c;80% increase in luciferase activity). As to CRE-dependent transcription, both CREB-H and CREB-H&#x00394;TC were modestly responsive to Fsk stimulation, resulting in up to 100% increase in reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, 3.7- and 227.8-fold activation, respectively). However, in the control experiment in which the empty vector alone was co-transfected, Fsk also stimulated CRE-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, 3.7-fold activation). Thus, while it remains unclear as to whether Fsk specifically stimulates CREB-H, Fsk activation of endogenous transcription factors alone unlikely accounted for the increase of CRE-dependent luciferase activity observed in the presence of CREB-H&#x00394;TC and Fsk. Thus, cAMP might be directly or indirectly involved in regulating CREB-H and CREB-H&#x00394;TC.</p></sec><sec><title>CREB-H activates PEPCK promoter</title><p>While the DNA-binding and gene-activating abilities of LZIP, CREB-H and other transcription factors in the same subfamily have been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>), their physiological targets remain to be identified. As a first step toward identifying the gene targets of CREB-H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), we asked whether it might bind and activate CRE-dependent transcription in liver. In this regard, the gene encoding gluconeogenic enzyme PEKCK has been extensively used as a model for studying the regulation of CREB- and C/EBP-dependent transcription in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). Based on this reasoning, we have demonstrated that CREB-H binds modestly to the CRE in rat PEPCK promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure1A</xref>, lane 8). Because CREB-H binds moderately to the rat PEPCK CRE, here we set out to investigate whether it might activate the PEPCK promoter. Indeed, CREB-H&#x00394;TC but not the full-length CREB-H stimulated the PEPCK promoter activity when overexpressed in hepatoma cell line Hep3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lane 3). PEPCK is abundantly expressed in liver and is an important metabolic enzyme that controls gluconeogenesis in both liver and adipose tissues. It is well known that cAMP/PKA can activate the PEPCK gene transcription through the cAMP response unit in the PEPCK promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). As such, when the cAMP pathway is stimulated by either treatment of Fsk or the expression of PKA catalytic subunit in Hep3B cells, the PEPCK promoter is stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 4 and 7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). Consistent with our finding that Fsk was able to further enhance CREB-H&#x00394;TC activation of CRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we observed that the expression of CREB-H&#x00394;TC cooperated with either PKA or Fsk in the activation of PEPCK promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 6 and 8).</p><p>Because the reporter assays were performed in cells transfected with PEPCK-Luc plasmid, we next investigated the binding of CREB-H to genomic PEPCK promoter in CREB-H-expressing cells using ChIP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We observed that &#x003b1;-CH8 but not pre-immune IgG precipitated a CREB-H&#x02013;DNA complex containing endogenous PEPCK promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, panels 1 and 2, lane 3 compared with lane 2). In a control experiment, &#x003b1;-CH8 did not pull down an irrelevant genomic sequence in human MAD1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, panel 3, lane 3). In further support of the specificity of the interaction between CREB-H and the PEPCK promoter, ChIP assays performed in non-CREB-H-expressing Hepa1-6 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) yielded no CREB-H&#x02013;DNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, panel 4), whereas the PEPCK promoter was amplified from the CREB-H-containing immunoprecipitate prepared from CREB-H-expressing Hepa1-6 cells. Thus, our results consistently revealed that CREB-H specifically associates with PEPCK promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular localization of CREB-H</title><p>We expressed CREB-H and CREB-H&#x00394;TC proteins in MCF-7 cells and determined their subcellular localization. CREB-H localized predominantly in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, panel 1), whereas CREB-H&#x00394;TC was exclusively in the nucleus (panel 5). Because ATF6 with a TM domain localizes to ER membrane and is activated by intramembrane proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>), we investigated the association of CREB-H with ER by co-staining cells for CREB-H and calnexin, an ER marker. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, full-length CREB-H co-localized with calnexin (panels 3 and 4 compared with panel 7). These results suggest that CREB-H, similar to ATF6, localizes to the ER.</p><p>Next, we examined the localization of CREB-H protein in HepG2 cells homogenously expressing V5-tagged CREB-H from a lentiviral vector. Again, a typical cytoplasmic localization pattern was observed when we stained the lentivirus-transduced cells with anti-V5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, panels 1 and 5). We noticed a significant co-localization of CREB-H and calnexin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, panels 1&#x02013;4). While the staining patterns of CREB-H and the Golgi marker GM130 were distinct, a fraction of CREB-H was also found in the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, panels 5&#x02013;7). Thus, the full-length but inactive CREB-H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is retained predominantly in the ER. On the contrary, CREB-H&#x00394;TC acts as a potent transactivator plausibly owing to constitutive nuclear localization.</p></sec><sec><title>CREB-H expression is abundant in adult liver but reduced in hepatoma cells</title><p>We performed northern blot analysis of CREB-H mRNA in mouse tissues and cells.

On the other hand, the CREB-H signal was not observed in a mouse hepatoma cell line Hepa1-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lane 7). In addition, we also found that human CREB-H transcript is underexpressed in most hepatoma cell lines tested (data not shown). It is, however, noteworthy that mouse CREB-H transcript is highly expressed in 3T3 fibroblasts immortalized by mammary sarcoma virus (M-MSV-BALB/3T3), cancerous subcutaneous adipocytes (L-M) and NB41A3 cancer cells derived from neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lanes 4, 5 and 12).</p><p>Consistent with results from northern blot analysis, CREB-H protein was detected in mouse liver, but not in brain or heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3).

A more than 2-fold reduction in steady-state amounts of CREB-H mRNA was observed in 11 of the 26 HCC tissues (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> for representative RT&#x02013;PCR results and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> for a scatterplot).</p></sec><sec><title>Growth suppressive activity of CREB-H in hepatoma cells</title><p>The underexpression of CREB-H in HCC cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) suggests that it might play a role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Considered together with the tumor suppressive activities of other bZIP proteins, such as C/EBP&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), C/EBP&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) and LZIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), we queried whether CREB-H might also serve a growth suppressive function in the liver. We carried out a growth assay in HepG2 cells using transient co-transfection of pSV-&#x003b2;gal, a &#x003b2;-gal expression vector driven by SV40 promoter, plus excess amount (10&#x000d7;) of CREB-H expressing plasmids. This ensures that the blue cells are the CREB-H transfected cells when staining with X-gal. This method has previously been used to study the growth suppressive activity of various proteins, including C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>).</p><p>On day 1 after co-transfection, slight differences were seen in the number of blue cell clusters among the groups that had received vector alone, full-length CREB-H and CREB-H&#x00394;TC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, panels 1&#x02013;3). On average, four cell clusters (of &#x02265;4 cells) were seen in vector-transfected cells, whereas two and one clusters were evident in CREB-H- and CREB-H&#x00394;TC-overexpressing cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, columns 1&#x02013;3). However, on day 5 after transfection, significant differences were observed among vectors, CREB-H and CREB-H&#x00394;TC groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, panels 4&#x02013;9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, columns 4&#x02013;6).

Western blot analysis confirmed that the protein expression levels of CREB-H and CREB-H&#x00394;TC in HepG2 cells on day 1 and day 5 post-transfection were similar (data not shown). Thus, CREB-H and CREB-H&#x00394;TC inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells.</p><p>To further characterize the growth inhibitory activity of CREB-H, we measured 5-bromo-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in CREB-H- and CREB-H&#x00394;TC-expressing HepG2 cells using confocal microscopy. BrdU incorporation indicates the cellular activity of DNA synthesis that dictates competency of cell proliferation. This method has been widely used to study cell growth and cell cycle progression. In particular, it has been adopted to demonstrate the growth suppressive role of transiently expressed C/EBP&#x003b1; in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). In our control experiment, the expression of &#x003b2;-gal did not affect BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, panels 1&#x02013;3). In stark contrast, BrdU staining was undetectable in either CREB-H- or CREB-H&#x00394;TC-expressing HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, panels 4&#x02013;9; compare transfected cells with arrowheads to surrounding untransfected cells with arrows). Quantitative analysis by cell counting indicates that none of the CREB-H- or CREB-H-positive cells was incorporating BrdU, whereas &#x0223c;50% (47.6 &#x000b1; 5.0%) of control cells expressing &#x003b2;-gal were positive for BrdU. In another word, BrdU incorporation was significantly reduced in CREB-H- or CREB-H&#x00394;TC-expressing cells compared with control cells (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 by <italic>t</italic>-test). Thus, the activation of CREB-H can inhibit S-phase entry and cell proliferation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we characterized a newly identified liver-enriched transcription factor called CREB-H. CREB-H contains a TM domain and represents a new subfamily of bZIP proteins that have not been extensively studied. CREB-H binds to CRE, box B and ATF6 enhancer elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and activates transcription from CRE, ATF6 site and PEPCK promoter in response to cAMP/PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). CREB-H associated with the ER in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) is proteolytically processed in hepatoma cells to generate an active form devoid of the repressive TM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This active form of CREB-H constitutively localizes to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). CREB-H is exclusively expressed in adult liver and is significantly underexpressed in HCC tissues and cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Finally, CREB-H functions as a growth suppressor in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Thus, CREB-H serves regulatory roles in liver-specific transcription and the growth of hepatocytes.</p><p>Collectively, our data derive mechanistic insight into the proteolytic processing, nuclear translocation and regulated activation of CREB-H. In addition, we also provide the first evidence for the growth suppressive activity of CREB-H. Our findings have implications in liver physiology and carcinogenesis.</p><sec><title>A new subfamily of bZIP proteins</title><p>Compared with prototypic bZIP proteins, such as CREB and C/EBP&#x003b1;, CREB-H is unique in bearing a hydrophobic TM domain immediately adjacent to the dimerization and DNA-binding domains situated in the middle of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Additional bZIP proteins that share a domain architecture and high homologies with CREB-H can be classified into a new subfamily structurally and functionally different from CREB and ATF6.</p><p>In this expanding subfamily, LZIP/CREB3, OASIS and BBF2H7 exhibit broad expression profiles, while CREB-H and AIBZIP are specifically expressed in liver and prostate/testis, respectively. LZIP/CREB3 has been implicated in the suppression of herpes simplex virus replication and in the establishment of viral latency in trigeminal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>) through association with HCF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). OASIS has initially been isolated from astrocytes in long-term culture, which serve as an <italic>in vitro</italic> gliosis model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), implicating a role in inflammation and stress responses. Detailed developmental expression profiling has revealed that OASIS is involved in the late phase of osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>). BBF2H7 has recently been retrieved from database as a novel human protein whose C-terminal part was fused to the FUS genes in low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma as a result of chromosomal translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Human AIBZIP has been found to be expressed abundantly and specifically in prostate tissues and tumors under the control of androgens, suggesting a role in prostate development and carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Interestingly, the mouse ortholog of AIBZIP termed Atce1 has also been found in reproductive tissues exhibiting a restricted post-meiotic expression pattern in spermatids in mouse testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Apparently, bZIP proteins in this emerging subfamily serve both general and tissue-specific regulatory functions in various biological processes.</p><p>bZIP proteins form homo- and heterodimers through their leucine zipper domains. Selective dimerization is an additional determinant for the functional diversity and specificity of bZIP factors. In this regard, one recent study based on protein arrays has raised the possibility of heterodimerization between bZIP proteins within the emerging LZIP subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). Hence, it would be of great interest to investigate whether and how CREB-H might interact with other members of this subfamily, such as LZIP and OASIS.</p></sec><sec><title>TM domain and activation of CREB-H</title><p>Although CREB-H and ATF6 are in phylogenetically separate groups, both proteins have a TM domain immediately downstream of the bZIP region. ATF6 ambiently localizes to the ER and functions as a proximal sensor of ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). In response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, ATF6 is activated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis to release its active N-terminal fragment, which translocates into the nucleus to activate the transcription of ER-resident chaperones and folding enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). This active form of ATF6 binds to the consensus ER stress elements (ERSEs) constitutively pre-occupied by NF-Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). CREB-H binds modestly to ERSEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); however, it neither activates the genes coding for ER chaperones, such as GRP78 and GRP94, nor responds to the ER stress-inducing agents, such as tunicamycin (K.-T. Chin and D.-Y.Jin, unpublished data). Thus, it remains to be understood whether CREB-H might regulate gene transcription through the ERSEs.</p><p>The ATF6 site (5&#x02032;-TGACGTGG-3&#x02032;) is another ER stress responsive element identified through binding site screening experiments using the bZIP domain of ATF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). While it remains to be seen that ATF6 can directly bind to the ATF6 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), XBP1, another bZIP protein which is the downstream target of ATF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>), has been demonstrated to recognize the ATF6 element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>). Noteworthily, both OASIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>) and CREB-H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) interacted strongly with the ATF6 element. Taken together with the fact that both CREB-H and ATF6 have similar domain structure (data not shown) and localize to ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), CREB-H and ATF6 are likely regulated through distinct but related mechanisms. In this scenario, CREB-H might activate unidentified genes that contain recognition sites similar to the ATF6 element but distinct to the ERSEs. Because ATF6 and XBP1 have been shown to affect only a subset of ER stress targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>), CREB-H might target a different subset of genes. Meanwhile, it might also cooperate with ATF6 and XBP1 to regulate some common targets.</p><p>ATF6 is an archetype of TM domain-containing bZIP factors and it is cleaved by site-1 and site-2 proteases in response to ER stress to release an active N-terminal fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>). Interestingly, LZIP is also cleaved by the same proteases that act on ATF6 and the activated N-terminal form of LZIP likely translocates into the nucleus to activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). However, the physiological stimuli that trigger LZIP cleavage and activation are not understood. In particular, unlike ATF6 or OASIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>) but similar to CREB-H, LZIP does not respond to tunicamycin stimulation (K.-T. Chin and D.-Y. Jin, unpublished data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Currently, we have no evidence of CREB-H involvement in ER stress response.</p><p>In this study, we obtained several lines of data that strongly support the regulated activation of CREB-H. First, we detected a proteolytic fragment of CREB-H in hepatoma cells, which is almost identical to CREB-H&#x00394;TC in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Second, we demonstrated the ER and nuclear localizations of CREB-H and CREB-H&#x00394;TC, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, we documented that CREB-H&#x00394;TC activates transcription more potently than CREB-H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These findings strongly support the notion that CREB-H could be activated through intramembrane cleavage and subsequent nuclear translocation of an active form equivalent to CREB-H&#x00394;TC. In this regard, it will be of interest to elucidate the upstream signals and molecular events that trigger the cleavage of CREB-H.</p></sec><sec><title>CREB-H activation of PEPCK promoter</title><p>We showed that the promoter of hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme PEPCK is activated by overexpression of CREB-H&#x00394;TC, but not the full-length CREB-H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The cAMP response unit, which mediates the activation of PEPCK promoter by the cAMP/PKA pathway, has been shown to bind a number of bZIP transcription factors, including CREB, CREM, C/EBP&#x003b1;, C/EBP&#x003b2;, ATF2, ATF3 and AP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>). As CREB-H binds to PEPCK-CRE <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and to endogenous PEPCK promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), CREB-H likely activates PEPCK transcription through direct binding to the CRE element (&#x02212;91 to &#x02212;84) in its promoter. Plausibly, the regulation of PEPCK by the liver-specific transcription factor CREB-H would be physiologically relevant.</p><p>Our results indicate that CREB-H&#x00394;TC and cAMP/PKA synergistically activate the PEPCK promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This raises the possibility that post-cleavage activation of CREB-H by cAMP/PKA-dependent phosphorylation might be responsible for regulating PEPCK expression and hence glucose homeostasis in the liver. However, we could not identify potential PKA phosphorylation sites in CREB-H&#x00394;TC (data not shown). It remains to be elucidated as to whether CREB-H is phosphorylated by PKA on a non-consensus site. Alternatively, CREB-H might cooperate with other cAMP-responsive CRE-binding factors or transcriptional co-regulators to activate PEPCK expression. In this regard, CREB has been shown to synergize with other transcription factors and co-activators to mediate cAMP responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>). Nevertheless, it is of interest to see whether cAMP and PKA are required for CREB-H activation of PEPCK promoter. PKA inhibitors, such as H89, could be used to address whether the kinase is dispensable for the activity of CREB-H&#x00394;TC on the PEPCK promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Growth suppressive function of CREB-H in liver</title><p>LETFs are known to be required for liver development and for maintaining its differentiated functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). In this study, we characterized CREB-H, a novel LETF whose expression is exclusively abundant in adult liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Notably, CREB-H is underexpressed in HCC tissues and cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Our findings suggest that CREB-H might play a pivotal role in hepatocyte growth and differentiation. In this context, the loss of CREB-H function in HCC might contribute to the initiation and/or progression of cancer. In support of this model, overexpression of CREB-H sufficiently induced growth suppression in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>With respect to the liver-specific and growth suppressor functions, we noticed a strong resemblance of CREB-H to C/EBP&#x003b1;, another LETF of the bZIP family. C/EBP&#x003b1; is involved in regulating hepatic growth and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>). C/EBP&#x003b1; is also a multifaceted growth suppressor that interferes with various growth regulatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>). The mechanisms through which CREB-H induces growth arrest in liver remain to be elucidated. In this regard, we noted that forced overexpression of CREB-H in hepatoma cells might trigger apoptosis because the number of CREB-H transfected cell clusters (blue cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) decreased during prolonged culture. In addition, CREB-H&#x00394;TC could not be stably expressed in HepG2 or Hepa1-6 cells transduced with a lentivirus carrying a CREB-H&#x00394;TC expression cassette. In fact, the cells were all dead within the first day of lentiviral transduction (K.-T. Chin and D.-Y. Jin, unpublished data).</p><p>Since hepatitis C virus core protein targets LZIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) which is structurally related to the liver-specific CREB-H, we reasoned that CREB-H might be a more physiologically relevant target of hepatitis C virus core protein. Our preliminary work suggests that CREB-H does not interact directly with hepatitis C virus core protein (data not shown). However, CREB-H could also be targeted indirectly through an interaction with LZIP. Additionally, LZIP is a binding partner of transcriptional co-activator HCF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>) as well as its related protein HCLP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), both of which are implicated in cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>). It remains to be seen whether CREB-H might interact with HCF-1 and/or HCLP-1. The relationship of CREB-H with LZIP and partners of LZIP merits further study.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Y.P. Ching for helpful discussions; M. Montminy, K. Mori, K.V.

Empty vector (mock; lanes 1 and 5), pFLAG-CREB-H (lanes 2&#x02013;4) and pcDNA-CREB-H (lanes 6&#x02013;8) were transfected separately into mouse hepatoma cell line Hepa1-6 for 24 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed. The whole cell extracts thus obtained were analyzed by 10% SDS&#x02013;PAGE followed by western blotting using &#x003b1;-CH8 (lanes 1 and 2), &#x003b1;-CH9 (lanes 5 and 6) and their respective pre-immune sera (preI8 and preI9; lanes 4 and 8). Antibody depletion was performed (lanes 3 and 7) by pre-incubating &#x003b1;-CH8/9 with Sepharose beads coupled to GST-CREB-H (1&#x02013;84) fusion protein (10 &#x003bc;g) containing the N-terminal 84 amino acids of CREB-H. The full-length CREB-H protein and the 50 kDa cleaved product of CREB-H are indicated with arrow and arrowhead, respectively. The 110- and 72 kDa cross-reactive bands are highlighted with asterisk. Trace amount of a 45 kDa band (marked with &#x02018;#&#x02019;) was seen in mock- and pFLAG-CREB-H-transfected Hepa1-6 cells (lanes 5 and 6), but it could not be detected with depleted &#x003b1;-CH9 serum (lane 7). This species recognized by &#x003b1;-CH9 but not by &#x003b1;-CH8 likely represents an endogenous cross-reactive protein (<bold>C</bold>) Western blot analysis was performed as in B, except that GFP-CREB-H (GFP-CH) and GFP-CREB-H&#x00394;TC (GFP-&#x00394;TC) constructs were used. Lanes 2&#x02013;4 received increasing amounts of protein (protein amt.). The blot in the upper panel was probed with &#x003b1;-CH9 (lanes 5&#x02013;6) or &#x003b1;-CH9 depleted with an excess (10 &#x003bc;g) of GST-CREB-H (1&#x02013;84) (lanes 6 and 7). The same blot was stripped and re-probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody to GFP (lower panel). The GFP-CREB-H and GFP-CREB-H&#x00394;TC bands are indicated. White arrows highlight the GFP-CREB-H&#x00394;TC band (lane 5) and the cleavage product of GFP-CREB-H of the same size (lane 4). A 72 kDa cross-reactive band is indicated with an asterisk. (<bold>D</bold> and <bold>E</bold>) Hepa1-6 cells were transfected with pFLAG-CREB-H and the pGFP-CREB-H. CREB-H protein was immunoprecipitated (IP) with &#x003b1;-CH8 antibody and the precipitates were immunoblotted (IB) with &#x003b1;-FLAG and &#x003b1;-GFP antibodies, respectively. (<bold>F</bold>) Western blot analysis was performed with extracts of HepG2 cells transduced with a lentivirus expressing CREB-H (LV-CH). Protein extract of HepG2 cells transfected with CREB-H&#x00394;TC (CH&#x00394;TC) plasmid (lanes 3 and 5) was used as a size reference for the proteolytic fragment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gki332f2"/></fig><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Transcriptional activity of CREB-H and potentiation by cAMP.

An SV40 promoter-driven <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase plasmid was also transfected into the cells. The cell lysates were measured for <italic>Firefly</italic> luciferase luminescence and the readings were normalized by the luminescence of <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase. (<bold>D</bold>) ChIP assay was performed with &#x003b1;-CH8 and extracts of HepG2 cells transfected with pcDNA-CREB-H. One control group received 10% of input chromatin (group 1). The other control group was given pre-immune IgG (group 2). Primer sets 1 and 2 were used to amplify sequences in the proximal promoter of human PEPCK gene (panels 1 and 2). Experiments were also carried out with primers for amplifying human MAD1 promoter (panel 3). Similar ChIP assays were performed in mock-transfected (panel 4) and CREB-H-expressing (panel 5) Hepa1-6 cells carrying a rat PEPCK promoter. Enforced expression of CREB-H was achieved by co-transfection with pcDNA-CREB-H.
