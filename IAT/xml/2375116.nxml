In part, this is mediated by targeting local covalent modifications of histone tails. Transcriptional regulation has also been associated with the positioning of genes within the nucleus. We have now examined the role of a transcriptional activator in regulating the positioning of target genes. This was carried out with primary &#x003b2;-cells and hepatocytes freshly isolated from mice lacking Hnf1&#x003b1;, an activator encoded by the most frequently mutated gene in human monogenic diabetes (MODY3). We show that in <italic>Hnf1a<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells inactive endogenous Hnf1&#x003b1;-target genes exhibit increased trimethylated histone H3-Lys27 and reduced methylated H3-Lys4. Inactive Hnf1&#x003b1;-targets in <italic>Hnf1a<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells are also preferentially located in peripheral subnuclear domains enriched in trimethylated H3-Lys27, whereas active targets in wild-type cells are positioned in more central domains enriched in methylated H3-Lys4 and RNA polymerase II. We demonstrate that this differential positioning involves the decondensation of target chromatin, and show that it is spatially restricted rather than a reflection of non-specific changes in the nuclear organization of <italic>Hnf1a</italic>-deficient cells. This study, therefore, provides genetic evidence that a single transcriptional activator can influence the subnuclear location of its endogenous genomic targets in primary cells, and links activator-dependent changes in local chromatin structure to the spatial organization of the genome. We have also revealed a defect in subnuclear gene positioning in a model of a human transcription factor disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>All cells in an organism share a common genome, yet distinct subsets of genes are transcribed in different cells. Selectivity of gene transcription is largely determined by transcription factors that bind to target genes and promote local changes in chromatin. Such changes are thought to be instrumental for transcription. Emerging evidence indicates that the position of genes in the 3-dimensional structure of the nucleus may also be important in transcriptional regulation. However, the role of transcription factors in gene positioning, and its possible relationship with chromatin modifications, is poorly understood. To examine this, we employed a genetic approach. We used mice lacking Hnf1&#x003b1;, a transcription factor gene that is mutated in an inherited form of diabetes. We studied genes that are directly bound by Hnf1&#x003b1;, as well as various control genomic regions, and determined their position in nuclear space in liver and insulin-producing &#x003b2;-cells. The results showed that the absence of Hnf1&#x003b1; causes local changes in the chromatin of target genes. At the same time, it modifies the position of target genes in nuclear space. The findings of this study lead us to propose a model whereby transcription factor dependent local chromatin modifications are linked to subnuclear gene positioning. They also revealed abnormal subnuclear positioning in a model of a human transcription factor disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The recognition of nucleotide sequences in the vicinity of genes by DNA binding factors is central to the regulation of gene-specific transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000079-Kadonaga1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In such examples, repressor-mediated repositioning of silenced loci to pericentromeric compartments was observed during developmentally regulated gene-silencing processes. This clearly represents a different situation compared to the current analysis where gene inactivity results from the sheer lack of an activator and gives rise to a different pattern of subnuclear positioning that does not involve association with chromocenters.</p><p>Previous evidence supporting the role of transactivators in gene positioning comes from studies of transgenes. Some of these studies took advantage of a lac repressor-VP16 acidic activation domain fusion protein, which was shown to cause repositioning of targeted multicopy loci away from the nuclear periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000079-Chuang1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000079-Tumbar1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

The role of transactivators in the positioning of endogenous loci, however, has not been directly assessed. One study showed that the deletion of a 24 Kb endogenous genomic region containing the &#x003b2;-globin locus control region results in gene silencing and increased perinuclear localization of the endogenous locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000079-Ragoczy1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. These effects were probably due to activator functions because the deleted region contained multiple binding sites for essential transcription factors. Nevertheless, it could not be excluded that structural changes due to deletion of an extended genomic segment also affected nuclear positioning by transactivator independent mechanisms. Our results provide genetic evidence in primary cells that positioning of endogenous genes can be dependent on a single transactivator. Together with previous studies, this suggests that the regulation of the subnuclear location of target gene loci might be a general function of sequence-specific DNA binding transcriptional regulators.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Gene Positioning Relative to Subnuclear Domains</title><p>Earlier studies describing correlations between gene silencing and perinuclear positioning were based on the comparisons of different cell types or developmental stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000079-Kosak2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000079-Zink1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000079-Gasser1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000079-Williams1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our findings confirm that gene activity is associated with localization to phosphoserine-5 RNA polymerase II domains in primary cells, and furthermore demonstrate that association with such domains is linked to the function of a transcriptional activator. Importantly, the new results extend our understanding of this phenomenon by showing that relocation does not only occur with respect to domains enriched in RNA polymerase II, but also involves repositioning amongst compartments that differ in the composition of histone modifications known to be critically involved in transcriptional regulation, and that such domains display distinct radial distributions. Our integrated analysis of a transactivator-deficient model thus suggests that transcription-related gene positioning with respect to RNA polymerase II foci, distinct radial nuclear zones, and domains enriched in specific histone modifications might reflect different experimental measurements of a single biological phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Relationships between Hnf1&#x003b1;-Dependent Locus Specific Chromatin Changes and Subnuclear Positioning</title><p>Together with previous findings, our data shows that binding of Hnf1&#x003b1; to target loci promotes local histone tail hyperacetylation, methylation of H3-Lys4, and chromatin decondensation, while preventing methylation at H3-Lys27 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000079-Pontoglio2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000079-Parrizas1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000079-Soutoglou1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

Focal Check Fluorescent microspheres (Molecular Probes) were used before image capture to align laser lines. Non-saturated, unprocessed images were further analyzed with ImageJ. Contrast-stretch and gamma adjustments were made using Photoshop (Adobe) only for display.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Colocalization Analysis</title><p>This analysis was carried out to determine colocalization between the most intense nuclear signals of each epitope. Ten to twenty nuclei were assessed in each double immunofluorescence experiment, and pixels with values exceeding the 75th percentile in each channel were selected for further analysis. The rationale for this threshold is that nuclear RNA polymerase II and H3-Lys27me3 signal intensities do not adhere to a normal distribution, and the 75th percentile enabled separation of visually evident RNA polymerase II and H3-Lys27me3-enriched domains from most remaining nuclear signals. Signals filtered in this manner were used to calculate Manders' coefficient of colocalization using the appropriate ImageJ plug-in (Wayne Rasband and Tony Collins, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uhnresearch.ca/wcif">www.uhnresearch.ca/wcif</ext-link>). Manders' coefficient calculates, for each channel, the proportion of colocalizing pixels respect to the summed up intensities of all pixels in the nucleus. Comparable results were obtained by subtracting pixels lower than the 50th percentile in each channel, and then applying a modified Mander's coefficient using the Colocalization threshold ImageJ plug-in, that first calculates an automated threshold (&#x00025; colocalized pixels above threshold: RNA polymerase II vs. H3-Lys9me3: 4&#x00025;. RNA polymerase II vs. H3-Lys27me3: 19&#x00025;. RNA polymerase II vs. H3-Lys4me2: 73&#x00025;. H3-Lys27me3 vs. H3-Lys4me2: 22.5&#x00025;. H3-Lys27me3 vs. H3-Lys9me3: 31&#x00025;).</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Erosion Analysis</title><p>Erosion analyses were performed with single light optical sections and mid-nuclear planes were analyzed. Radial positioning of FISH signals was analyzed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000079-Zink1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. With respect to immunostaining data erosion analyses were performed as follows. Based on the DNA counterstaining signal, the nuclear plane was subdivided into five concentric zones, each having a thickness of 20&#x00025; of the nuclear radius. The numbers of pixels in each zone were counted and the grey value of each pixel was determined separately for each channel. Each grey value (I) was multiplied by its frequency N (I&#x000d7;N) and the sum of all values obtained for a given zone was determined (&#x003a3; I&#x000d7;N). The result obtained for each zone was divided by the sum of results obtained for all nuclear zones in order to determine the percentage of total nuclear fluorescence intensity in each nuclear zone. The values obtained were normalized to the relative nuclear areas occupied by the different zones. Thus a value of 1 was obtained if the percentage of the total nuclear fluorescence intensity corresponded to the percentage of the total nuclear area occupied by a given zone. It should be noted that this procedure did not involve any thresholding.</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Immuno-FISH Image Analysis</title><p>For each condition, typically 100 alleles (range 70&#x02013;200) from at least two independent experiments were analyzed blindly in unprocessed images to quantify signal intensities of histone marks and RNA polymerase II. In H3-Lys27me3 experiments Barr bodies were avoided. The 9-pixel area containing the brightest and most central pixels of each FISH signal was selected by inspection of single color images, and the average signal for each channel in this area was obtained using RGB Measure (ImageJ). Each non-thresholded immunofluorescence signal at a FISH-detected locus was divided by the median value of the entire nucleus in the same cell to correct for cell to cell and inter-assay technical variability. The mean intensity for each channel was also calculated from a broad cytoplasmic area in every stack and used to subtract non-specific background from both FISH and nuclear signals. This background value was similar to the non-specific nuclear signal elicited in control Immuno-FISH experiments in which primary antibodies were omitted. The resulting value was referred to as <italic>normalized signal</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000079-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000079.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p><p>To classify alleles according to the presence or absence of enrichment in either RNA polymerase II or a histone mark, we used the 75th percentile of nuclear pixel intensities in each channel as the threshold, as described above.
