These malformations include endocardial cushion (EC) defects, persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA) and ventricular septal defects (VSD) which appear to result from aberrant cardiac neural crest development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Several studies have used animal models to examine the diabetes-induced congenital malformations during development of brain, heart and blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the teratogenicity of maternal diabetes causes congenital heart defects in embryos remain undefined.</p><p>During development, cells from the neural crest over the occipital somites (cardiac neural crest cells; CNCC) migrate to the heart to give rise to parasympathetic postganglionic neurons (cardiac ganglia) as well as ectomesenchymal elements contributing to conotruncal septation in the chick embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Ablation of the CNCC in chick embryos results in PTA accompanied by a decrease (30%) in the parasympathetic postganglionic innervation of the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In mammalian embryos, a similar population of CNCC exists and is perturbed in a number of genetic and teratogenic contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Maternal diabetes induced congenital heart defects appear to be similar to the neural crest ablation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] since it has been shown that high glucose concentration inhibits migration of neural crest-derived cells from the neural tube in rat embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The migration and differentiation of the CNCC into cardiac ganglia are influenced by various developmental control genes. Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) plays a critical role during the development of the avian EC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. NCAM expressed early in neural crest formation disappears as migration is initiated and it reappears when CNCC are induced to form cardiac ganglia at the end of their migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) appears to be one of the earliest neuron specific genes to be expressed in the developing nervous system. The expression pattern of PGP9.5 closely matches that of the late phase expression of the NCAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our recent study in embryonic rat hearts hypothesized that a teratogen such as retinoic acid has an effect on the CNCC resulting in disruption of the differentiation of the cardiac ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the present study, we speculate that expression of genes controlling normal cardiac ganglia development is altered by maternal diabetes, thereby leading to disruption of the differentiation of the cardiac ganglia.</p><p>Maternal diabetes has been shown to induce generalized defects in CNCC development in some, presumably genetically predisposed, individuals among the offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Mutations in some genes that control the cardiogenesis result in the congenital heart defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These genes, however have not been linked to congenital heart defects in diabetic offspring. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (<italic>Bmp4</italic>) has been implicated as regulator of CNCC induction, maintenance, migration, differentiation and survival. It is also required in CNCC for development of the outflow tract (OFT) and ventricular myocardium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It has been shown to be involved in many developmental processes including epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT), controls proliferation index in the atrioventricular (AV) cushion during heart development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Mutation of <italic>Bmp4 </italic>reduces proliferation index in the AV cushion, leading to AV canal defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Mouse <italic>Msx1</italic>, which shares homology with the Drosophila muscle segment homeobox (msh) gene, is expressed in a number of non-myocardial cell populations, including cells undergoing an EMT in the AV septum and the OFT region. <italic>Msx1 </italic>has been shown to play an integral role in heart septation and valve formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Mutation in <italic>Msx1/2 </italic>causes profound deficiencies in the development of structures derived from the cranial and cardiac neural crest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The cardiac neural crest-derive aortico-pulmonary septum that divides the distal portion of the OFT into ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. <italic>Pax3</italic>, a paired-box gene, is required for the migration of CNCC to the developing great vessels. It has been reported that <italic>Pax3 </italic>mutant mice, the naturally occurring splotch mutation, suffer from a PTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Based on the above facts, it is hypothesized that expression pattern of genes that are involved in the development of cardiac neural crest is altered, leading to congenital heart defects in embryos of diabetic pregnancy. Therefore, the present study was carried out by analyzing the expression pattern of those genes and morphological changes to understand the possible mechanisms causing congenital heart defects in the embryos of diabetic pregnancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental Animals</title><p>The Swiss Albino mice used in the present study were obtained from the Laboratory Animals Centre, Singapore. Diabetes mellitus was induced in 8 week-old female mice by an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 75 mg/kg body weight, Sigma, USA) dissolved in citrate buffer (0.01 M, pH 4.5) on three successive days. Blood glucose levels were examined one week after STZ injection using a Glucometer Elite (Bayer, USA). Only mice with non-fasting blood glucose level exceeding 16 mmol/l were used as experimental diabetic mice. In contrast, control mice maintained the normal blood glucose levels (4&#x02013;6 mmol/l) before and during pregnancy. Timed mating was carried out by placing four female mice with one normal male mouse in a cage overnight. Noon on the day on which a copulation plug was observed was counted as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). On E13.5 (about 60 pairs of somites), pregnant mice were anaesthetized with pentobarbital (150 mg/kg body wt, intraperitoneally) and embryos were collected after Caesarean section. A total of 180 embryos (E13.5) were used for this study. Of these, 120 and 60 embryos were obtained from diabetic (n = 15) and control (n = 6) mothers respectively. The developmental stage, E13.5 was chosen for this study, as it corresponds to ~6 weeks of human gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], when all 4 chambers of the heart were clearly distinguishable, and the outflow tract was evident [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, the heart phenotype was apparent in embryos from diabetic mice. Embryos with malformations from diabetic mice and normal embryos from non-diabetic mice were used as the experimental and control groups, respectively. All procedures involving animals handling were in accordance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH publication no. 85-23, revised 1985) and guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), National University of Singapore.</p></sec><sec><title>Histology and Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Embryonic tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PF) in phosphate buffer (PB) at 4&#x000b0;C overnight, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin.

The diabetic female mice were mated with normal male mice and examined daily for the presence of copulation plugs. Only those mice with non-fasting blood glucose level exceeding 16 mmol/l were used as experimental mice. Control animals maintained the normal blood glucose levels (4&#x02013;6 mmol/l) before and during pregnancy. A total of 180 embryos (E13.5) were used for this study. Of these, 120 and 60 embryos were obtained from diabetic (n = 15) and control (n = 6) mothers respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The number of embryos per litter was significantly reduced (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) in diabetic mothers (8 &#x000b1; 1.2) when compared to controls (10 &#x000b1; 0.6; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In addition, the frequency of empty deciduas was found to be 15% in diabetic pregnancies (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). About 10% of embryos from diabetic mice showed a range of cardiac malformations (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).

Embryos from diabetic mice also displayed the extra-cardiac malformation (12.5%), such as neural tube defects, including exencephaly, anaencephaly and spina bifida (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Although embryos of diabetic pregnancies appeared smaller than embryos from non-diabetic pregnancies (as determined by crown-rump length), they were not developmentally delayed (as determined by somite number).

This study attempts to reveal the molecular and morphological changes contributing to congenital heart defects in embryos of diabetic pregnancy. The reduction in number of embryos observed in diabetic pregnancies could be due to either reduced fecundity or early embryonic lethality resulting from a higher malformation rate in the embryos of diabetic mothers compared with those of non-diabetic mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Recently, an infant born to a type 1 diabetic mother has been shown to exhibit axial mesodermal dysplasia spectrum (AMDS) with AV septal defects. However, molecular mechanisms remain to be undefined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The morphological phenotype observed in maternal diabetes in the present study appear similar to the features of cardiac and extra-cardiac malformations seen in the offspring of diabetic mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The wide variety of cardiac defects observed in the present study suggest a complex pathogenesis, although several of these abnormalities may result from perturbed endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation or abnormal development and/or migration of CNCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Maternal diabetes has been shown to induce aberrant CNCC development in diabetic offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A recent study also reported that the exposure of CNCC to elevated glucose leads to congenital heart defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. CNCC play multiple roles during heart development and are particularly essential for OFT development. They are also required for regulation of myocardial cell proliferation, as well as differentiation and function of the myocardium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In the present study, maternal diabetes appeared to impair the development of cardiac neural crest-derived cardiac ganglia as revealed by the expression of PGP 9.5 and NCAM. Similar changes have been reported in various neural crest derived tissues in high glucose environment <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. It seems that the impaired development of cardiac ganglia is due to enhanced maternal diabetes-induced apoptosis and altered expression of genes involved in the differentiation of cardiac ganglia.</p><p>Transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) superfamily has been implicated in promoting NCC induction, maintenance, migration and differentiation in several model organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. <italic>Bmp4 </italic>belonging to the TGF&#x003b2; superfamily, is a key myocardial signaling molecule which activates EMT during cardiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. <italic>Bmp4 </italic>is also essential for OFT development and regulates a crucial proliferation signal for the ventricular myocardium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Down-regulation of <italic>Bmp4 </italic>expression in cardiomyocytes overlying the EC appears to have contributed to decreased mitotic index in the EC, leading to cardiac defects in the diabetic offspring, since mutation of <italic>Bmp4 </italic>has been shown to reduce proliferation index in AV cushion resulting in AV canal defects in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Further, <italic>Bmp4 </italic>expression has been shown to be down-regulated by the <italic>Msx1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], a homeobox gene expressed in AV canal endocardial cells during EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The timing of expression and embryonic distribution of <italic>Msx1 </italic>parallels the timing and distribution of <italic>Bmp4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. A recent study has shown that <italic>Msx1/2 </italic>mutant embryos exhibit defects in the cranial and cardiac neural crest derivatives, including hypoplastic and mispatterned cranial ganglia, dysmorphogenesis of pharyngeal arch derivatives and abnormal organization of conotruncal structures in the developing heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In this connection, the down-regulation of <italic>Msx1 </italic>expression and the reduced number of Msx1-positive cells in the AV canal and the EC in the developing heart of embryos from diabetic mice observed in the present study may be associated with AV canal and OFT defects. Pax3, which serves as a marker of CNCC, is also essential for the formation of the heart and the OFT in the mouse embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Mutation of <italic>Pax3 </italic>in <italic>Splotch </italic>mice perturbs the neural crest affecting development of various structures including the outflow septum of the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The OFT anomaly in <italic>Splotch </italic>mice results from a deficiency in the migration of CNCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In the present study, the mRNA expression of <italic>Pax3 </italic>was significantly down-regulated and the number of Pax3 positive cells were notably reduced in the OFT as well as in the EC in embryos of diabetic mice. This explains the impaired development of CNCC derived tissues (i.e., cardiac ganglia) observed in diabetic offspring. Moreover, the increased number of apoptotic cells in the OFT endocardial cushions in embryos from diabetic pregnancy could be due to the reduced expression of <italic>Pax3 </italic>as down-regulation of <italic>Pax3 </italic>has been shown to cause apoptosis in the developing neural tube of embryos from diabetic mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>The present report provides the first evidence that ultrastructural changes in cardiomyocytes of the ventricular wall may be associated with the cardiac defects observed in embryos of diabetic pregnancy. The ultrastructural changes in cardiomyocytes of embryos from diabetic mice were characterized by the presence of swollen mitochondria and disorganized myofilaments with poorly developed adherence junctions and have been consistent with previous observation in mutant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In addition, the abnormal adherence junctions with detachment of myofilaments are as reported previously in some transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. This suggests that aberrant myofibrillogenesis could lead to histological derangements in the developing heart of diabetic pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrates that maternal diabetes alters the expression of some genes that are involved in the development of the cardiac neural crest, leading to congenital heart defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>A: atrium; Ao: aorta; AV: atrioventricular; AVC: AV canal; AMDS: axial mesodermal dysplasia spectrum; CNCC: cardiac neural crest cells; E: embryonic day; EC: endocardial cushion; EMT: epithelial mesenchymal transformation; LA: left atrium; LV: left ventricle; M: mitochondria; OFT: outflow tract; PT: pulmonary trunk; PTA: persistent truncus arteriosus; RA: right atrium; RV: right ventricle; STZ: streptozotocin; T: single outflow vessel; V: ventricle; VS: ventricular septum; VSD: ventricular septal defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>The study was designed by SDK, STD and SSWT.
