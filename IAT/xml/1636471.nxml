Thus, the <italic>SIR2</italic> gene product is an important constituent of the yeast cell. <italic>SIR2</italic> orthologues and paralogues have been discovered in organisms ranging from bacteria to man, underscoring the pivotal role of this protein. Here we report that a plasmid introduced into <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; cells accumulates more negative supercoils compared to the same plasmid introduced into wild-type (WT) cells. This effect appears to be directly related to <italic>SIR2</italic> expression as shown by the reduction of negative supercoiling when <italic>SIR2</italic> is overexpressed, and does not depend on the number or positioning of nucleosomes on plasmids. Our results indicate that this new phenotype is due to the lack of Sir2p histone deacetylase activity in the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; strain, because only the H4-K16 residue of the histone octamer undergoes an alteration of its acetylation state. A model proposing interference with the replication machinery is discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the dosage and expression level of the <italic>SIR2</italic> gene has been implicated in the regulation of important processes, such as transcriptional silencing, genome stability, DNA repair, chromatin structure and cellular aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Sir2p is a NAD-dependent histone deacetylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), suggesting that its role in transcriptional silencing might be enzymatic. In addition, Sir2p can perform a weak ADP-ribosylation reaction using NAD as the donor of an ADP-ribose moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Further evidence for the importance of this protein comes from the discovery of the &#x02018;sirtuin&#x02019; protein family, which is conserved from bacteria to humans. Sirtuins are also involved in cell cycle progression, chromosome stability and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Four proteins, designated homologues of sir two (HST), have also been found in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>To carry out its role in transcriptional silencing, Sir2p acts together with three additional silent information proteins, Sir1p, Sir3p and Sir4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Depending on the specific region where silencing occurs, Sir2p cooperates with different partners. In association with Sir1p, Sir3p and Sir4p, Sir2p mediates the silencing at the mating type loci (HML and HMR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), while in association with Sir3p and Sir4p it is involved in telomeric silencing. The rDNA is a third genetic locus where transcriptional silencing occurs in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. Here, Sir2p is the only Sir protein necessary for maintenance of the silenced state. At this locus, however, it requires the presence of Net1p (part of the RENT complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), which is believed to be crucial for nucleolar localization.</p><p>In a <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; yeast strain, loss of transcriptional silencing is observed at the rDNA locus; this mutant is also characterized by hyper-accessible chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), hyper-recombination of ribosomal repeat units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), and decreased life span associated with the accumulation of extrachromosomal circles (ERCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>In addition, several lines of evidences link <italic>SIR2</italic> to DNA replication. At the rDNA locus of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, it has been reported that Sir2p is preferentially associated with non-replicating chromatin, exerting a form of negative control over origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>); more recently, an additional report has shown that Sir2p negatively controls pre-replication complex (RC) formation by interfering with loading of the MCM complex on the replication origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>Some of the phenotypes associated with the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; mutation are potentially related to DNA supercoiling, an aspect of DNA organization. In particular, similar phenotypes have been reported for <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>top1</italic>&#x00394;, such as hyper-recombination of rDNA repeat units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), loss of transcriptional silencing at the rDNA locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) and alteration of histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Since DNA topoisomerase I controls DNA superhelicity, we decided to investigate whether Sir2p may also interfere with the process of supercoiling.</p><p>In eukaryotic cells, DNA superhelicity arises mainly from the wrapping of DNA around nucleosome particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), resulting in approximately one negative superhelical turn per nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). It has been reported that supercoiling of DNA elements (plasmids or excised DNA circles) containing silencer sequences is altered in mutants that affect transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Moreover, changing the histone acetylation level has been reported to affect DNA supercoiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). By analogy, the reported alteration of chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) could lead to modification of DNA topology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains, plasmids and culture media</title><p>Strains: W303-1a (Mata, ade 2-1, ura 3-1, his 3-11,15, trp1-1, leu 2-3112, can1-100); Y1422 (sir2&#x00394;) (Mata, leu2-3112, ura3-52, ade8, trp1 &#x00394;901 SIR2:: TRP1) kindly provided by J.

Two volumes of 0.2 N NaOH, 1% SDS were added to spheroplasts and the mixture was kept on ice for 10 min; 1.5 vol of 3 M Potassium Acetate (pH 4.8) were then added and the mixture kept on ice for 45 min.

The plasmid DNA prepared as above, was loaded on 1% agarose gel.

The gel was run at room temperature (22&#x000b0;C), with recirculating buffer. Finally, the gel was blotted and hybridized with the specified probe (see text).</p><p>To demonstrate that the method employed for plasmids purification does not introduce any artifactual consequences of DNA isolation, we performed the following control. During the DNA purification procedure two samples from WT strain were processed with solutions containing or not 0.1 &#x000b5;g/ml of EtBr. If any nicking closing activity occurs during the purification procedures, the final distribution of topoisomers must be different between the DNA samples prepared in the presence of the intercalator or not. In fact, according to the Fuller equation L = T + W, the T-value in a solution containing the EtBr is different from that without EtBr; as a consequence the equilibrium between L and T will be different and the final topoisomer distribution will not be the same between the two samples. No difference is observed between the distribution of DNA samples purified with or without EtBr, demonstrating the absence of DNA topoisomerase activity (or any linking number variation) during the purification procedures (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative evaluation of topoisomer distribution</title><p>The digitized images of the films derived from the autoradiography of 2D electrophoresis, were treated as follows: the collective signal of each arc distribution of topoisomers was measured and divided into two parts: one consisting of the negative topoisomers and the other of the positive ones. The same treatment was employed for all the samples analyzed by the 2D gel electrophoresis. The two values of the arch representing negative and positive topoisomers were reported as percentage of the total signal in the arch. Percentage distribution of negative topoisomers was then normalized to that of WT. The resulting value was considered as the increase of negative distribution (ind) being &#x0003e;1 for increased negative distribution and &#x0003c;1 for increased positive supercoiling.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)</title><p>A total of 100 ml of culture were grown to exponential phase (0.4 OD/ml), formaldehyde-fixed and processed for ChIP as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>).

These topological alterations are dependent on the <italic>SIR2-4</italic> genes.</p><p>We evaluated whether a segment of rDNA inserted into a yeast shuttle vector could behave like the silencer elements reported previously. In addition, to determine whether rDNA could attract Sir2p (as do silencers) and affect DNA topology, we studied a yeast plasmid derived from pRS316, in which a portion of the NTS sequence of the rDNA locus was cloned, yielding the ypGM1 plasmid described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>); in fact, it has been reported that Sir2p interacts with the NTS region of rDNA in its chromosomal context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>), although no specific silencer has been detected in this region. We compared WT and <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; strains (lacking the only gene involved in all known types of transcriptional silencing in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>) transformed with ypGM1.</p><p>Cells transformed with ypGM1 or with the original vector plasmid (see below) were grown in minimal media to exponential phase (0.4 OD/ml). Plasmids were then purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) and DNA topoisomers were resolved by 2D agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of different amounts of the intercalator cloroquine in orthogonal directions. This procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>) allows high resolution of different topological DNA forms, resulting in a scattered distribution along an arc of positive (more rightward) and negative (more leftward) topoisomers. The distributed DNA topoisomers were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter and hybridized to a labeled probe (the linearized plasmid itself).</p><p>When ypGM1 was analyzed by 2D electrophoresis, we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that the distribution of topoisomers from the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; strain was more negatively supercoiled compared to the one from the WT strain (note the leftward shift of the arc in <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; compared to WT). When the topoisomer distribution was analyzed by densitometric scanning, we observed that in the sir2&#x00394; strain, the <underline>i</underline>ncrease of negative distribution (ind) was 1.8 times greater than in WT (each distribution is compared with the WT, assigned the standard value of 1); this value was calculated as described in the Materials and Methods section. In order to determine whether this effect was due to the presence of the NTS sequence in the plasmid, we extended our analysis to the vector alone (pRS316 without a specific insertion). In this case also, the distribution of DNA topoisomers from <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; cells was more biased towards negative supercoiling than in WT cells, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. As both ypGM1 and pRS316 contain a CEN6 and an ARSH4 replication origin, it is perhaps not surprising that the ind values in particular are very similar. In order to assess the influence of the centromere and replication origin sequences, we used a non-centromeric plasmid containing the 2 &#x000b5; replication origin, pADH426 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). In this case we also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) results similar to those reported for the plasmids just described with an ind value of 1.5. A more negatively supercoiled distribution of topoisomers in <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; versus WT was also observed both with the yCP50 plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) carrying a different replication origin (ARS1) and a different centromeric sequence (CEN4 instead of CEN6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and with the p414GAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), Figure 5 (compare WT and <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; samples) differing in the selectable marker (<italic>TRP1</italic> instead of <italic>URA3</italic> present in all the previous plasmids). Further evaluation of the selectable marker influence on plasmid topology has been performed on a <italic>LEU2</italic> based plasmid (p415Gal) and a coherent result was obtained (data not shown). In all the plasmids so far studied, the alteration of DNA topology depends on the <italic>SIR2</italic> gene but is independent of the presence of specific elements, such as ribosomal sequences, selectable markers, centromeres or replication origins. The increase in negative superhelical distribution for different plasmids ranged from 1.9- to 1.3-fold relative to WT.</p><p>To ascertain whether ongoing transcription of the selectable marker (present on all the plasmids analyzed) was important for the topological shift observed [according to the twin domain model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>)], we analyzed the distribution of topoisomers for pRS316 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>) bearing <italic>URA3</italic> as selectable marker, from cells grown in synthetic media containing or lacking uracil. In fact, the <italic>URA3</italic> gene can be down-regulated several-fold by the presence of uracil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). As reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; dependent effect is still observed in cells grown in the presence of uracil, where the URA3 gene is transcribed at a very low level as evaluated by RT&#x02013;PCR analysis (data not shown). The alteration seems to be very similar to that observed in medium lacking uracil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). From these data, we can conclude that transcriptional events occurring on the plasmid analyzed do not cause the topological shift observed (more negative distribution of topoisomers), which is thus due solely to the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; mutation. In addition, we observe that the shift in supercoiling distribution decreases with increasing plasmid size, being lower (ind 1.3&#x02013;1.2) for plasmids larger that 7 kb.</p></sec><sec><title>The amount of Sir2p directly correlates with topological alterations</title><p>The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> demonstrate that in the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; mutant, plasmid DNAs are always more negatively supercoiled than those extracted from WT strains.

This observation suggests that the alteration of plasmid supercoiling is indeed mostly due to the lack of Sir2p (by a direct or indirect mechanism) and not to the global genetic background.</p><p>In order to verify the hypothesis that Sir2p directly affects the topology of the plasmids, we studied the topological state of the plasmids previously analyzed in strains with <italic>SIR2</italic> placed under heterologous control to allow a different rate of transcription. We transformed WT cells (W303-1A) with the plasmid pAR44 containing the <italic>SIR2</italic> gene under the GAL10 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>); these cells were then transformed with pRS316, grown in minimal medium containing 2% glucose to exponential phase, collected, washed, split in two equal parts and shifted for 2 h to minimal medium with 2% galactose or 2% glucose, in order to either induce or repress <italic>SIR2</italic> gene transcription from the pAR44 plasmid. It is important to emphasize that the pRS316 plasmid on which the topological analysis is performed does not contain any sequence responsive to the presence of galactose. DNA enriched in circular forms was prepared as described above and run on a 2D agarose gel. DNA samples from WT cells transformed with pAR44 (un-induced and induced with galactose) were loaded on the same gel; DNA from <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; cells was also loaded as a reference. The DNAs were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter and hybridized to a pRS316 probe (detailed in Materials and Methods). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the comparison of topoisomer distributions among <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394;, WT and <italic>SIR2</italic><sup>++</sup> (over-expression) strains. The average distribution shifts from more negative (<italic>sir2&#x00394;)</italic> to more positive topological forms (<italic>SIR2</italic><sup>++</sup>), correlating with the increase in the level of Sir2p in the cells. Note the arc shape: shifted toward the left in <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; cells, centered in WT cells not induced with galactose, and shifted toward the right for DNA from cells induced with galactose to overproduce Sir2p. In this experiment, the ind value ranges from 1.3 (relative to WT) to 0.5. Taken together, these results demonstrate that supercoiling of DNA topoisomers depends on the amount of Sir2p present inside the cells, and that increasing Sir2p moves the distribution toward positive topoisomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, sample <italic>SIR2</italic><sup>++</sup>); the absence of Sir2p produces the opposite result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, sample <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394;) inducing more negative supercoiling.</p></sec><sec><title>Sir4p contributes to the topological influence of Sir2p on plasmid DNA</title><p>In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Sir2p is present in two major protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>).

For this reason, we investigated whether nucleosome spacing on a plasmid was altered in the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; mutant. WT or <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; cells transformed with pRS316, grown to exponential phase, were processed for spheroplast formation and permeabilized with nystatin as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). The permeabilized spheroplasts were subjected to micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). DNA was then purified and loaded on an agarose gel. After electrophoresis, samples were transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter and hybridized to different probes in order to detect the presence of nucleosomes in two major regions of the plasmid. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, when the filter was hybridized to the AMP probe, described previously (for details see Materials and Methods), organization into regularly spaced nucleosomes (closed ellipses in the schematic drawing shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) involving at least four particles was evident. Since the spacing analysis is not oriented, we can conclude that this organization occurs both at the left and at the right sides of the probe. In addition, no differences are detected between the WT and the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; profiles. When the AMP probe was stripped from the filter followed by re-hybridization to the LINK probe (annealing from 1878 to 2001 of the pRS316 sequence) we observed a slightly different profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In this case, only 2&#x02013;3 nucleosomal particles with defined spacing are visible, most likely reflecting a less organized chromatin structure (dotted ellipses in the schematic drawing reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, in this region also we observe no significant differences between the WT and <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; profiles. Considering that with this analysis we are able to scan &#x0223c;2000 nt for each probe and that pRS316 is &#x0223c;4 kb long, we conclude that there is no dramatic difference in the nucleosome arrangement between WT and <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; strains.</p><p>Additional experiments, performed by the end-labeling technique (exploring the ARS sequence), did not show either positioned nucleosomes nor differences between the WT and <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; strains (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>The topological alteration of plasmid DNA in <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; mutants correlates with specific deacetylation of histone H4 at the K16 residue in the ARS region</title><p>Most of the phenotypes shown by <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; mutants arise from the lack of histone deacetylase function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).

In order to determine whether the topological alterations we observe are also due to hyperacetylation of plasmid chromatin, we set up ChIP experiments to measure the acetylation level of the histone residues modified by Sir2p on the plasmids studied; we considered two regions in the plasmid analyzed (ARSH4 and polylinker) and also two chromosomal regions as reference (ACT1 and TEL IV). WT and <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; cells were grown in minimal medium to exponential phase. After cross-linking with formaldehyde, whole cell extracts were prepared and the DNA&#x02013;protein samples were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies [anti-Acetyl-K9(H3), anti-Acetyl-K14(H3) and anti-Acetyl-K16(H4)]; the cross-linking was reversed and the DNA purified. A multiplex PCR was set up, coamplifying with four pairs of primers corresponding to the following sites: (i) the ARSH4 region of the p415GAL plasmid (ARSH4), (ii) the linker region of the p415GAL plasmid (LINK), (iii) the promoter region of ACT1 gene (ACT1) and (iv) the Tel IV subtelomeric region (TEL IV). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, no enrichment was observed for the polylinker and ACT1 regions in the two strains (negative controls) compared to the respective input values (lanes 1&#x02013;3, INPUT); in the telomeric region (Tel IV), where Sir2p is known to act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>), the acetylated form of all the histone residues studied is strongly enriched (lanes 4&#x02013;12 in sir2&#x00394;). As far as the ARSH4 region is concerned, we observed that in the sir2&#x00394; strain, the only hyperacetylated residue relative to WT was H4-K16 (lanes 10&#x02013;12, in sir2&#x00394;). A quantitative representation of the data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, where the ratios of sir2/WT values for each residue studied (normalized to their INPUT) is reported.

In order to demonstrate that acetylation of the H4 residue K16 is directly involved in the SIR2-dependent shift of yeast plasmid supercoiling, we compared three different mutant strains and their isogenic WT counterparts with respect to a shift in the p414Gal topology.

This result provides strong evidence that the K16 residue of histone H4 is involved in the <italic>SIR2</italic>-dependent shift in plasmid supercoiling and that the K16Q is dominant over the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; mutation.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>mcm7</italic>-td mutant cells show increased positive supercoiling of plasmid DNA</title><p>Recently, Pappas and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) demonstrated that Sir2p interferes with loading of the MCM complex on several ARS sequences, and further showed that the deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> increases Mcm2p binding to the ARS315 and ARS501 chromosomal origins. We hypothesized that the different efficiency of MCM loading on ARS plasmids could lead to an altered DNA topology. In order to test whether the lack of MCM yields positive supercoiling of plasmid DNA, we studied the <italic>mcm7</italic>-td (temperature-inducible degron) mutant in induced and un-induced conditions. In a <italic>mcm7</italic>-td mutant, the Mcm7-td protein is present when cells are grown at 24&#x000b0;C in the presence of galactose to induce high levels of GAL-UBR1 expression, but is very rapidly degraded upon shifting the cells to 37&#x000b0;C and disappears in &#x0223c;30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>).</p><p><italic>mcm7</italic>-td cells were transformed with p415GAL and grown to exponential phase at 24&#x000b0;C in minimal medium plus 2% glucose.

A shift of the distribution of topoisomers is observed between the different samples. The uninduced <italic>mcm7</italic>-td strain is centrally distributed while in the induced <italic>mcm7</italic>-td strain, more positively supercoiled topoisomers are present.

However all the shifts of plasmid topology observed in this study should be interpreted as an <italic>in vivo</italic> shifts in topoisomer frequency toward higher or lower relative linking number values. In fact the analyses of topological shifts should be interpreted as relative and not absolute. Previous reports described increased positive supercoiling of circular DNA (plasmids or excised rings) containing silencer or telomeric sequences in <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). We thus hypothesized that the topological shift we observed could be due to a different cause. When different plasmids were assayed for topoisomer distribution, we consistently found an increase in negative supercoils in <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; cells compared to WT. The plasmids analyzed were yeast vectors without specific insertions, sharing only the ARS consensus sequence (ACS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>) for DNA replication. Our data indicate that neither the replication origin (ARS1, ARSH4 or 2 &#x000b5;), the CEN sequence (CEN4 and CEN6), the selectable marker (URA, TRP or LEU) nor active transcription seem to be required for this increase in negative supercoils in <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> WT versus <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394;). The only noticeable change in the magnitude of the increase occurred when plasmids of different size were compared. This suggests that a limiting factor that acts on plasmid DNA to exert topological modification becomes less effective when the size of the DNA increases.</p><p>We then asked whether the level of SIR2 expression could affect the DNA topology. We observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) that the degree to which Sir2p is overexpressed correlated with the distribution of positive supercoiled topoisomers, suggesting that increasing the amount of Sir2p promotes this phenomenon.</p><p>It has been described in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> that Sir2p is present in two major particles: the SIR2/4 and the RENT complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). Thus, we also evaluated the topoisomer distribution in <italic>sir4</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>net1</italic>&#x00394; mutants, since the products of these genes are considered crucial for association of Sir2p within the Sir2p&#x02013;Sir4p complex and the RENT complex, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>).

Conversely the <italic>net1</italic>&#x00394; mutant shows the same distribution as WT cells; these observations suggest that the shift of DNA topology was due to Sir2p acting in the context of the Sir2p&#x02013;Sir4p complex.</p><p>As far as the <italic>sir3</italic>&#x00394; mutation is concerned, our findings suggest that Sir3p does not affect topoisomer distribution (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that the observed alteration of plasmid topology depends on the concerted action of the Sir2 and Sir4 proteins only.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid chromatin organization does not correlate with topological alterations</title><p>The wrapping of DNA around histone octamers introduces superhelical turns into plasmid DNA in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).

This assay reveals the presence of nucleosomes by producing the &#x02018;nucleosomal ladder&#x02019;, with multiple bands typically spaced at &#x0223c;200 bp.

Further approaches utilizing the end-labeling method to detect nucleosomes also failed to show differences between the two strains, suggesting that a change in chromatin organization did not account for the topological alterations observed.</p></sec><sec><title>The histone deacetylase activity of Sir2p is involved in the alteration of topology</title><p>The topological shifts that we observed are not in agreement with previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) from two points of view: (i) the alteration of supercoiling also occurs in plasmids that do not contain any silencer or telomeric sequences and (ii) the plasmid topology shifts toward negative topoisomers.</p><p>In order to explore these differences, we hypothesized that the phenomenon observed is not due directly to the known histone-deacetylase activity of Sir2p in terms of distortion of histone&#x02013;DNA interactions. Thus, we asked the following question: is the acetylation level of plasmid chromatin altered in a <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; mutant? In fact, lack of Sir2p activity would result in hyperacetylated chromatin and it has been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> that hyperacetylated nucleosomal particles yield positive superhelical turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). To answer this question, we evaluated the acetylation level of plasmid nucleosomes. We observed an increase of acetylation of only histone H4, specifically the K16 residue, using plasmid by ChIP in the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Considering the increased negative supercoiling in <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; mutants, and the absence of shift in supercoiling in the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394;K16Q double mutant, we conclude that the histone deacetylase activity of Sir2p, particularly on H4-K16, is involved in altering plasmid DNA topology, probably without affecting DNA&#x02013;histone interactions enough to shift the topological distribution towards positive topoisomers.</p><p>In fact, when all the H4 histones of the cells were modified by the mutation of K16 to Q16, mimicking the acetylated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), or K16 to R16 mimicking the deacetylated state (data not shown), a consistent shift toward respectively positive or negative topoisomers is observed; this is in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) where hyperacetylation or hypoacetylation of histones correlates with more positive or more negative topoisomer distribution, respectively. This does not occur when the H4 residue is modified in the only ARS region in the plasmids. We propose that the modified K16 residue in H4 bound in the ARS region could represent a signal required for pre-RC assembly (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Loading of the MCM complex affects DNA topology</title><p>An interesting link between <italic>SIR2</italic> and DNA replication has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). The authors showed that the MCM complex is more efficiently loaded onto several ARS elements when the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; mutation is present. The MCM complex contains a helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). We hypothesized that unwinding of DNA coupled with a DNA topoisomerase activity would yield more negative supercoiling in <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; cells where more efficient loading of MCM complex occurs. In fact, the absence of Sir2p could induce an increase of helicase activity, with a consequent accumulation of torsional stress on DNA, due to the two strands unwinding. Thus, the DNA topoisomerase I would act to relax this torsional stress, yielding a more negatively supercoiled DNA. Likewise, less efficient loading of the MCM complex on plasmids could be the cause of positive supercoiling. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the <italic>mcm7-td</italic> mutant for topoisomer distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Actually, under inducing conditions (galactose), a more positively supercoiled distribution of topoisomers than expected is evident.</p><p>Thus, the overall conclusion is that Sir2p limits MCM complex loading onto ARSs: in the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; mutant, overloading of the complex increases the unwinding of DNA, leading to negative supercoiling of plasmids (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Based on our demonstration that the only amino acid hyperacetylated in plasmid chromatin is H4-K16, we hypothesize that a specific histone deacetylase activity is involved in the reported phenotypes, and more specifically that H4-K16 hyperacetylation represents a signal for the recruitment of additional factor(s), such as the MCM complex. This is in agreement with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) showing that loss of Sir2p catalytic activity increases MCM loading on ARS sequences. We cannot eliminate the possibility that our results were due not only to the Sir2p histone-deacetylase activity on H4-K16, but also to its putative ability to deacetylate different proteins. In fact, Sir2p homologues in other species, including mammals, have been demonstrated to deacetylate non-histone proteins as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). A further interpretation of our data are that it might reflect direct deacetylation activity of Sir2p on the MCM complex, with the consequent alteration of its function in the assembly of the Pre-RC complex. In support of this hypothesis, it has been demonstrated that Mcm3p is acetylated in mammalian cells (61).</p><p>Our demonstration that the topology of plasmids is altered in <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; mutants reveals a new phenotype for this gene; whether the effect is directly mediated by the MCM complex or follows indirect pathways will be the subject of future investigations.</p></sec><sec><title>Note</title><p>During the reviewing process one of the anonymous reviewers suggested the following interpretation in order to explain our observation that larger plasmids were less responsive in our assays than the smaller ones.</p><p>The explanation suggested is that the positive superhelicity induced by a given amount of MCM-mediated strand separation would be distributed over a greater number of bp in the larger plasmids, resulting in lower topological strain (1100RT/bp)(L&#x02212;L<sub>0</sub>). Lower strain would result in less distortion in twist along the molecule, which is the actual target of topisomerase (particularly type I) activity, and thus a smaller <italic>in vivo</italic> change in linking number. The authors are thankful to the reviewer and agree with this interpretation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was partially supported by the &#x0226a;Istituto Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti&#x0226b; Universita&#x02019; di Roma &#x0226a;La Sapienza&#x0226b;.

Thick-lined ellipses indicate nucleosomes with a clear spacing profile; dotted-line ellipses indicate nucleosomes with less defined spacing profiles.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl678f3"/></fig><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The histone deacetylase activity of Sir2p alters acetylation of the H4-K16 residue in the plasmid ARS.

In WT cells, a defined amount of the MCM complex is bound to DNA, producing the observed level of supercoiling (equilibrium level). When Sir2p is absent, plasmid DNA is overloaded with the MCM complex, leading to increased negative supercoiling. In a strain overexpressing Sir2p, the excess protein limits loading of the MCM complex, leading to positive supercoiling.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl678f7"/></fig></sec></back></article>
