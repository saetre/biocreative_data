However, recently we identified two polycistronic tRNA transcripts whose endonucleolytic processing was solely dependent on RNase P. Here we show that the processing of the <italic>secG leuU</italic> and <italic>metT leuW glnU glnW metU glnV glnX</italic> polycistronic transcripts takes place through a different type of maturation pathway. Specifically, RNase P separates the tRNA units within each operon following the endonucleolytic removal of the distal Rho-independent transcription terminator, primarily by RNase E. Failure to remove the Rho-independent transcription terminator inhibits RNase P processing of both transcripts leading to a decrease in mature tRNA levels and dramatically increased levels of full-length transcripts in an RNase E deletion strain. Furthermore, we show for the first time that RNase G also removes the Rho-independent transcription terminator associated with the <italic>secG leuU</italic> operon. Our data also demonstrate that the Rne-1 protein retains significant activity on tRNA substrates at the non-permissive temperature. Taken together it is clear that there are multiple pathways involved in the maturation of tRNAs in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The processing of tRNA genes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> has been studied extensively over the past 15 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9">1&#x02013;9</xref>). Based on these experiments, a general model for the maturation of tRNAs, particularly those contained within polycistronic operons, has emerged in which the primary transcripts are presumed to be cleaved by RNase E to yield pre-tRNAs that are subsequently matured by RNase P at their 5&#x02032; ends and by a combination of RNase T, RNase PH, RNase BN, RNase II and RNase D at their 3&#x02032; ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>However, the observed differential efficiency of RNase E cleavages among a large number of tRNA precursors as well as the absence of consensus RNase E cleavage sites in some of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) raised the possibility that alternative processing pathways existed. In fact, the recent analysis of the <italic>valV valW</italic> and <italic>leuQ leuP leuV</italic> operons has demonstrated a new processing pathway in which RNase P is the only endonuclease involved in the separation of tRNAs within these polycistronic transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>In the experiments described here, we sought to determine if additional endoribonucleases, other than RNase E and RNase P, are involved in tRNA maturation. These include RNase G (encoded by <italic>rng</italic>), which is homologous to the catalytic domain of RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and has been shown to be involved in the maturation of the 5&#x02032; end of the 16S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and to serve as a less efficient alternative to RNase E for initiating the decay of some mRNAs in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). RNase Z (encoded by <italic>rnz</italic>) is known to be essential for the maturation of tRNA precursors that do not contain a chromosomally encoded CCA determinant in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and certain prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, since all of the tRNA genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> contain chromosomally encoded CCA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), it seemed likely that its RNase Z ortholog functioned in a different pathway. In fact, it has now been implicated in the decay of mRNAs, suggesting that it also functions as an alternative enzyme for RNase E in certain aspects of RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Similarly, RNase LS (encoded by <italic>rnlA</italic>), which is involved in the degradation of T4 late-gene mRNAs, has been suggested to play a role in <italic>E. coli</italic> RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>We now show that the processing of <italic>secG leuU</italic> and <italic>metT</italic> (<italic>metT leuW glnU glnW metU glnV glnX</italic>) polycistronic transcripts is accomplished through a distinct tRNA processing pathway involving multiple endonucleases. In this pathway, RNase E and/or RNase G-dependent removal of the Rho-independent transcription terminator significantly improves the efficiency of RNase P-mediated processing of the polycistronic transcripts. However, unlike with <italic>leuT</italic> and <italic>leuZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), the RNase E cleavages are not absolutely essential for processing to take place, in part because of the ability of RNase G to remove the transcription terminator and/or RNase P to process the full-length transcripts, including the terminator, inefficiently.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids</title><p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> strains used in this study were all derived from MG1693 (<italic>thyA715 rph-1</italic>), which was provided by the <italic>E. coli</italic> Genetic Stock Center (Yale University), and are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

The product of the <italic>leuU</italic> gene (tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup>) recognizes the CUC and CUU leucine codons and is essential for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcript is terminated with a Rho-independent transcription terminator and the two genes are separated by a 14 nt spacer region that has been predicted to contain RNase P cleavage site based on <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Initially, we examined the processing of this transcript in wild-type, <italic>rne-1</italic>, <italic>rnpA49</italic> and <italic>rne-1 rnpA49</italic> strains by northern analysis using a series of oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A-a, b, c and d). For the sake of simplicity, only the results with the <italic>leuU</italic>-specific probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A-c) are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>An expected band of 87 nt, corresponding to the mature tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> (M) was observed in all the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lanes 1 and 4), with its level primarily a function of RNase P activity. Thus the loss of RNase P activity led to reductions of &#x0223c;50% in the relative quantity (RQ) and &#x0223c;70% in the processed fraction (PF) of mature tRNA compared to the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lanes 1 and 3). The reduction in the level of mature tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> in the <italic>rnpA49</italic> mutant was consistent with the accumulation of significant amounts of a high-molecular weight processing intermediate (GU2) and a mixture of pre-tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> species (pre-<italic>leuU</italic>) that were 6&#x02013;11 nt longer than the mature tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 3).</p><p>In contrast, inactivation of RNase E had only a minor effect on either the RQ or PF of tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> compared to the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lanes 1 and 2). However, a different high-molecular weight intermediate (GU1) that was &#x0223c;40 nt longer than GU2 appeared in the <italic>rne-1</italic> strain, but was only present in very low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 2). When both RNase E and RNase P were inactivated there was a further reduction of the RQ and PF of the mature tRNA to &#x0223c;0.35 and &#x0223c;0.19, respectively, compared to the wild-type control along with a concomitant increase in both the GU1 and GU2 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 4). In addition, the pre-<italic>leuU</italic> species that were present in the <italic>rnpA49</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 3) disappeared, suggesting that they were generated by RNase E cleavages in the intergenic region between <italic>secG</italic> and <italic>leuU</italic>.

We hypothesized that the smaller transcript (GU2) was derived from larger GU1 species by endonucleolytic cleavage(s) either at the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; end. Accordingly, we analyzed the 5&#x02032; ends of the <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcripts employing primer extension analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). A strong primer extension product (I) terminating at 81 nt (G) and a second weaker primer extension product (II) (&#x0223c;10% of I) terminating at 84 nt (C) upstream of the putative <italic>secG</italic> translation start codon were detected in the wild-type strain. Since no other longer primer extension products were observed, I and II represented the major and minor transcription initiation sites, respectively, for the <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcript.

The additional minor primer extension products visible in the <italic>rnpA49</italic> strain (arrows and asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) presumably arise from endonucleolytic cleavages downstream of the two transcription initiation sites.</p></sec><sec><title>The full-length <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcript that includes the Rho-independent transcription terminator only accumulates in the absence of RNase E</title><p>Since both larger processing intermediates (GU1 and GU2) still retained the 5&#x02032; transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), we surmised that the difference in their electrophoretic mobility arose from a processing event at the 3&#x02032; end.

We employed an RT-PCR technique using 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; end-ligated transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) to clone and sequence both the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; termini of the transcripts simultaneously. Since both the <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcripts appeared to retain the 5&#x02032; end of the primary transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), the triphosphate was converted to monophosphate employing TAP treatment to facilitate the self-ligation of 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of transcripts in presence of T4 RNA ligase.</p><p>Consistent with the primer extension experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), the majority of the 5&#x02032; ends of the transcripts were located at either 81 nt (11/15 in the wild-type strain, 8/14 in the <italic>rne-1</italic> and 7/16 in the <italic>rnpA49</italic> mutant) or in a limited number of cases at 82&#x02013;84 nt upstream of the putative translation start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;D). Three of the clones (1/14 in the <italic>rne-1</italic> and 2/16 in the <italic>rnpA49</italic> mutants) had 5&#x02032; ends at 66 and 59 nt upstream of the translation start (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C and D), which corresponded to primer extension products seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> (marked with asterisk). These particular termini were also identified in clones generated from self-ligated transcripts independent of prior TAP treatment, suggesting that these ends most likely arose from endonucleolytic cleavages (data not shown). In contrast, none of the 5&#x02032; ends at &#x02212;81 to &#x02212;84 nt were detected in self-ligated transcripts in the absence of treatment with TAP (data not shown), indicating that the majority of these ends had retained a 5&#x02032; triphosphate. In fact, the presence of only a very limited number of primary transcripts with 5&#x02032;-phosphomonoesters were indicated, since there was a &#x0003e;100-fold reduction in the level of PCR amplification products from the self-ligated transcripts in the absence of TAP treatment (data not shown).</p><p>Sixty percent (9/15) of the 3&#x02032; ends of the <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcripts in the wild-type strain occurred after the Rho-independent transcription terminator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). However, transcripts from 6/15 (40%) wild-type clones ended at or after 1&#x02013;2 residues downstream of the mature CCA terminus within the AAUU sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, 430&#x02013;432 nt). When RNase E was inactivated, the number of the 3&#x02032; ends of the <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcripts terminating after the Rho-independent transcription terminators increased to 93% (13/14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). The lone transcript in the <italic>rne-1</italic> mutant that had a terminus 2 nt downstream from the CCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C) may have arisen from a cleavage by RNase G, as suggested from the data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, the <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcripts from all of the 16 clones derived from the <italic>rnpA49</italic> mutant were missing the terminator and ended at 430&#x02014;432 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D), indicating that the RNase E and/or RNase G cleavages occurred within the AAUU sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Finally, it should be noted that the number of <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcripts, with and without a transcription terminator, obtained in this experiment reflect the distribution of particular species in each genetic background, in agreement with the northern analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.

To provide further support for this conclusion, we mapped the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> in various genetic backgrounds by cloning and sequencing of 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; end-ligated junctions. As controls, we also identified the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of tRNA<sup>His</sup> (<italic>hisR</italic>) and tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> (<italic>cysT</italic>) using identical techniques, since both of these tRNAs are present in single copy, are part of polycistronic transcripts, and have been shown to be dependent on RNase E for their initial processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>In the case of tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup>, we expected that all of the clones would have mature 5&#x02032; ends in a wild-type strain because the RNase P cleavage would generate them directly. In contrast, with tRNA<sup>His</sup> and tRNA<sup>Cys</sup>, we hypothesized that some of them would have 5&#x02032; extensions resulting from initial upstream cleavages by RNase E. As predicted, all the tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> clones (23/23) in the wild-type strain had the mature 5&#x02032; end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Three of these clones (3/23, 13%) had immature 3&#x02032; ends occurring 1&#x02013;2 nt downstream of the CCA terminus in the AAUU sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Similarly, 3&#x02032; termini were also obtained with the <italic>secG leuU</italic>-specific transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, 431&#x02013;432 nt).</p><p>In contrast, 6/24 (25%) of the tRNA<sup>His</sup> and 8/36 (22%) of the tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> clones had immature 5&#x02032; ends in the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B). These immature termini were 8 and 4 nt upstream of the tRNA<sup>His</sup> and tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> mature 5&#x02032; termini, respectively, in what appeared to be RNase E consensus cleavage sites (A/U-rich regions). Furthermore, &#x0223c;63% (15/24) of the tRNA<sup>His</sup> and &#x0223c;67% (24/36) of the tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> clones had immature 3&#x02032; ends that were up to 2 nt (U or UU for tRNA<sup>His</sup> and C or CU for tRNA<sup>Cys</sup>) downstream of the mature CCA terminus. The sites of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; immature termini of tRNA<sup>His</sup> and tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> were consistent with the previous reports of RNase E-processing sites to release these pre-tRNAs from their respective polycistronic transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The presence of a higher percentage of unprocessed 3&#x02032; ends of tRNA<sup>His</sup> (&#x0223c;63%) and tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> (&#x0223c;67%) compared to tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> (&#x0223c;13%) in the wild-type strain suggests the possibility of differential rates of 3&#x02032; end maturation by RNase T, RNase D and RNase BN in this genetic background (MG1693 contains the <italic>rph-1</italic> allele, which inactivates RNase PH). Interestingly, &#x0223c;9% of the tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> clones and &#x0223c;20&#x02013;25% of both the tRNA<sup>His</sup> and tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> clones contained 1&#x02013;3 nt of untemplated A residues downstream of the immature terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A&#x02013;C).</p><p>Since we observed some pre-<italic>leuU</italic> species in the <italic>rnpA49</italic> single mutant, but not in the <italic>rne-1 rnpA49</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4), we also mapped the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> in an <italic>rnpA49</italic> single mutant. Under these circumstances, 18/24 (75%) of the tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> clones contained immature 5&#x02032; ends with 6&#x02013;11 unprocessed nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). There were four different termini within a 6-nt region (GUAGUA) of the 14 nt <italic>secG leuU</italic> intercistronic spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C), indicative of inefficient, non-specific cleavages by RNase E upstream of tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> under conditions in which the <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcript accumulated in the absence of RNase P. Furthermore, almost all of the tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> clones (23/24) had mature 3&#x02032; ends even if their 5&#x02032; ends were not processed by RNase P in the <italic>rnpA49</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C).</p><p>To obtain further evidence that RNase P cleavage of the <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcript directly generated the mature 5&#x02032; terminus of the tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup>, we examined the 3&#x02032; termini of <italic>secG</italic> transcripts. We hypothesized that a single RNase P cleavage of <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcript to release the mature 5&#x02032; end of tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> would yield <italic>secG</italic> transcripts containing the intact 14 nt spacer present between <italic>secG</italic> and <italic>leuU</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). In fact, when we mapped the 3&#x02032; termini of <italic>secG</italic> mRNAs, &#x0223c;20% (8/40) of the clones contained the entire 14 nt spacer in both the wild-type and <italic>rne-1</italic> strains (data not shown).

The genotypes of the strains used are noted above each lane. The deduced structures and the names for the processing intermediates are shown. The weak band marked with a asterisk (*) is due to either a non-specific or weak cleavage by an unidentified ribonuclease in the middle of the <italic>metU</italic>-coding sequence, since it hybridized to the probes a&#x02013;f (A and B, lanes 1&#x02013;15, data not shown) but not to the probes g&#x02013;i (B, lanes 16&#x02013;19, data not shown).

As expected a band corresponding to the mature tRNA<sup>Leu3</sup> (M1) was observed in all the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;5). While both the RQ and PF of the mature tRNA<sup>Leu3</sup> were reduced only marginally in the <italic>rne-1</italic> mutant compared to the wild-type control, the decreases were much more significant in both the <italic>rnpA49</italic> and <italic>rne-1 rnpA49</italic> mutants. Besides the mature tRNA band (M1), five other processing intermediates (I, II, IV, V and VII, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 2&#x02013;4) were observed in various genetic backgrounds.</p><p>In order to determine the composition of these intermediates, we hybridized the blot with two additional oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A-a and b) that were complementary to the 5&#x02032; non-coding and tRNA<sup>Met</sup> (<italic>metT</italic> and <italic>metU</italic>)-coding regions, respectively. Both of these probes hybridized to bands I, II, IV and V but not to band VII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 8&#x02013;9 and 13&#x02013;14), which was thus identified as <italic>leuW</italic> with an unprocessed 5&#x02032; end that occurred in the absence of RNase P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 3). However, both the probes a and b hybridized to a new processing intermediate (VI) of &#x0223c;125 nt that was present in <italic>rnpA49</italic> mutants (lanes 8&#x02013;9 and 13&#x02013;14) and was absent in the c-probed blot. Thus species VI represented <italic>metT</italic> containing an unprocessed 5&#x02032; end.</p><p>Furthermore, probe b hybridized to an additional high-molecular weight processing intermediate (III) in the <italic>rne-1</italic> mutant (lane 12), and, as expected, also hybridized to the mature tRNA<sup>Met</sup> in all genetic backgrounds (M2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 11&#x02013;15). Similar to what was observed with tRNA<sup>Leu3</sup> (M1), inactivation of RNase E led to only a small reduction in the relative level of the mature tRNA<sup>Met</sup> (lane 12). In contrast, the loss of RNase P activity had a much greater effect on the amount of mature tRNA<sup>Met</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 13 and 14).</p><p>Probing the blot with oligonucleotide i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), which was complementary to the terminator sequences of the operon, identified bands I and III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B) in all strains defective in RNase E (data not shown). Since these bands were missing in the <italic>rnpA49</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, data not shown), RNase E appeared to be primarily responsible for removal of the terminator. However, the level of band I increased significantly in the <italic>rne-1 rnpA49</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 2, 4, 7, 9, 12 and 14), suggesting roles for both RNase E and RNase P in initiating the processing of this transcript. As was seen with the <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), the level of the full-length transcript that retained the downstream Rho-independent transcription terminator sequences of the <italic>metT</italic> operon increased &#x0223c;5-fold along with a concomitant reduction in the PF of mature tRNA<sup>Met</sup> and tRNA<sup>Leu3</sup> in an <italic>rne</italic> deletion mutant compared to the temperature-sensitive <italic>rne-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 2, 5, 7, 10, 12 and 15, data not shown).</p><p>The composition of all the processing intermediates shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B was further confirmed using the additional oligonucleotide probes d, e, f, g and h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). For example, oligonucleotides g and h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), which were specific for the intergenic regions between <italic>metU</italic>, <italic>glnV</italic> and <italic>glnX</italic>, hybridized to bands I and III in the <italic>rne-1</italic> single mutant but only to band I in <italic>rne-1 rnpA49</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 17 and 19, data not shown). In the <italic>rnpA49</italic> mutant, the only intermediate observed was <italic>glnX</italic> containing extra nucleotides at its 5&#x02032; terminus with probe h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 18). Similarly, while probe d hybridized to bands I, II and IV, probe e hybridized to bands I and II only (data not shown). Furthermore, probe f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A) did not hybridize to band III containing <italic>metU</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, data not shown) suggesting that it was missing the 5&#x02032; upstream sequences.</p><p>Taken together, we conclude that the band I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B) represents the full-length transcript containing all seven tRNAs. Bands II, IV, V and VI are processing intermediates that retain the 5&#x02032; non-coding region along with one or more tRNA species. Thus band II has the first five tRNAs (<italic>metT leuW glnU glnW metU</italic>), band IV has the first three tRNAs (<italic>metT leuW glnU</italic>), band V had two tRNAs (<italic>metT leuW</italic>) and band VI has only <italic>metT</italic> tRNA. On the other hand, band III is derived from the 3&#x02032; end of the transcript by an RNase P cleavage at 5&#x02032; end of <italic>metU</italic> and contains <italic>metU glnV glnX</italic> as well as the intact Rho-independent transcription terminator.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Previous studies have identified two distinct tRNA processing pathways in <italic>E. coli</italic> involving either RNase E or RNase P as the primary endoribonuclease responsible for generating pre-tRNAs from polycistronic transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In the RNase E-dependent pathway, polycistronic tRNA transcripts are separated into pre-tRNAs solely by RNase E with the pre-tRNAs being subsequently matured at their 5&#x02032; termini by RNase P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In contrast, in the RNase P-dependent pathway, polycistronic tRNA transcripts are separated into pre-tRNAs by RNase P, generating the mature 5&#x02032; ends in a single step independent of RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In this report, we describe for the first time an alternative tRNA processing pathway for the <italic>secG leuU</italic> and <italic>metT</italic> (<italic>metT leuW glnU glnW metU glnV glnX</italic>) polycistronic transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A and B) that involves certain aspects of both the RNase E- and RNase P-dependent pathways. What makes this pathway distinct in wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> is that the removal of the Rho-independent transcription terminator associated with each polycistronic transcript, primarily by RNase E, significantly stimulates their rapid processing by RNase P into pre-tRNAs containing mature 5&#x02032; termini. However, RNase E is not absolutely required for this step, in part because RNase G can also remove the terminator sequences and RNase P can inefficiently process a full-length transcript that retains the terminator. The role of RNase G in the removal of the terminator is partially masked by the fact that there is &#x0223c;10 times more RNase E in the cell than RNase G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Processing pathways for the <italic>secG leuU</italic> and <italic>metT</italic> polycistronic transcripts in <italic>E. coli</italic>. (<bold>A</bold>) Processing of the <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcript. The Rho-independent transcription terminator is removed, primarily by RNase E, but can also be cleaved by RNase G. Subsequently, RNase P separates the <italic>leuU</italic> sequence from <italic>secG</italic> generating the mature 5&#x02032; end of tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> and leaving 14 nt downstream of the translation stop codon of <italic>secG</italic>. Final maturation of the 3&#x02032; terminus of <italic>leuU</italic> is carried out by a combination of RNase T, RNase PH and RNase D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) to generate a mature tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup>. The <italic>secG</italic> mRNA is rapidly degraded exonucleolytically in a process that is dependent primarily on polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) and poly(A) polymerase (PAP I). However, we cannot rule out a role for either RNase II or RNase R at this time. In the absence of RNase P, RNase E can inefficiently cleave at multiple locations with the 14 nt spacer region between <italic>secG</italic> and <italic>leuU</italic>. However, as noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, only a very small fraction of the full-length <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcript is susceptible to this reaction.

Furthermore, the identification of <italic>secG</italic> mRNA fragments with the intact 14 nt <italic>secG leuU</italic> intergenic sequence along with no unprocessed 5&#x02032; nucleotides in the pre-tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, data not shown) confirmed that a single-RNase P cleavage generated the mature 5&#x02032; terminus of tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup> and separated it from the upstream <italic>secG</italic> mRNA.</p><p>Similarly, inactivation of RNase P led to the dramatic accumulation of several large precursor species of the <italic>metT</italic> operon (bands II and IV) that contained either the first five (<italic>metT leuV glnU glnW metU</italic>) or first three (<italic>metT leuW glnU</italic>) tRNAs, respectively, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that these tRNAs were also endonucleolytically processed primarily by RNase P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). The significant drop in the RQ and PF of the mature tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup>, tRNA<sup>Leu3</sup> and tRNA<sup>Met</sup> species in <italic>rnpA49</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B, data not shown) was consistent with this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the presence of a Rho-independent transcription terminator appears to significantly inhibit the ability of RNase P to process both transcripts. This was evidenced by the accumulation of full-length transcripts with intact terminators only in RNase E-deficient strains as opposed to either no accumulation in the wild-type strain or only accumulation of transcripts with the terminator removed in the RNase P-deficient strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Thus, the role of RNase E and/or RNase G for the processing of the <italic>secG leuU</italic> and <italic>metT</italic> polycistronic transcripts is primarily to remove the Rho-independent transcription terminator, thereby facilitating the RNase P-dependent cleavages that generate pre-tRNAs with mature 5&#x02032; termini. This is in marked contrast to the requirement for initial RNase E cleavages to generate pre-tRNAs with immature 5&#x02032; ends in the processing of the <italic>glyW</italic> and <italic>argX</italic> polycistronic transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Although it is not clear at this time why the presence of the Rho-independent transcription terminator inhibits RNase P activity, it appears from the data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> that under normal physiological conditions, the terminator sequences are endonucleolytically removed by RNase E and/or RNase G prior to RNase P action to generate the pre-tRNAs. In addition, the last three tRNAs in the complex <italic>metT</italic> operon are also separated by RNase E as suggested by the accumulation of band III (<italic>metU glnV glnX</italic>) in the <italic>rne-1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). This species was generated by an RNase P cleavage at the mature 5&#x02032; terminus of <italic>metU</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, data not shown). The disappearance of this band in the <italic>rnpA49</italic> single mutant and <italic>rnpA49 rne-1</italic> double mutants supports this interpretation.</p><p>An unexpected observation was the involvement of RNase G in the removal of the Rho-independent transcription terminator associated with the <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). This is the first demonstration that RNase G plays any role in the processing of <italic>E. coli</italic> transcripts containing tRNAs. While the removal of the Rho-independent transcription terminator associated with the <italic>metT</italic> polycistronic transcript appeared independent of RNase G activity (data not shown), it seems likely that other polycistronic tRNA transcripts terminated in a Rho-independent fashion may also be partially processed by RNase G.</p><p>Even though the presence of the Rho-independent transcription terminator inhibited processing by RNase P, the relatively low steady-state level of full-length transcripts of both operons in the <italic>rne-1</italic> strain indicates that RNase P can process the full-length transcript, although more slowly than in the presence of functional RNase E. This was consistent with a significant increase in the half-life of full-length <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) and the level of both the <italic>secG leuU</italic> and <italic>metT</italic> operon full-length transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) in the <italic>rne-1 rnpA49</italic> double mutant compared to either of the single mutants. These results indicate that either RNase E or RNase P can independently initiate the processing of these transcripts, although removal of the Rho-independent transcription terminator is normally the preferred first step in a wild-type strain.</p><p>Our data also clearly show that the temperature-sensitive Rne-1 protein, which is the most widely used allele to characterize which substrates are degraded in an RNase E-dependent fashion, clearly retains significant activity on tRNA substrates at the non-permissive temperature. Thus, there was a 5&#x02013;6-fold increase in the transcript level in the <italic>rne&#x00394;1018</italic> strain compared to the <italic>rne-1</italic> strain (2 h after shift to 44&#x000b0;C) for both the <italic>secG leuU</italic> and <italic>metT</italic> operons as well as concomitant reductions in the PF levels of tRNA<sup>Leu2</sup>, tRNA<sup>Leu3</sup> and tRNA<sup>Met</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). An independent study from this laboratory has shown identical results for the <italic>argX</italic> (<italic>argX hisR leuT proM</italic>) and <italic>glW</italic> (<italic>glyW cysT leuZ</italic>) operons when comparing the <italic>rne-1</italic> and <italic>rne&#x00394;1018</italic> strains (D. Chung, Z. Min, B.-C. Wang and S. R. Kushner, manuscript in preparation).</p><p>Previous microarray analysis of the <italic>E. coli</italic> transcriptome in an <italic>rnpA49</italic> mutant led to the hypothesis that inactivation of RNase P specifically destabilized transcripts downstream of its cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). However, the dramatic destabilization of the <italic>secG</italic> mRNA after RNase P processing of the <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) clearly demonstrates that this idea is not entirely correct. In addition, the failure to stabilize the <italic>secG</italic> mRNA in any of the endonuclease mutants tested suggests that once the RNase P cleavage occurs, the upstream <italic>secG</italic> mRNA is rapidly degraded exonucleolytically.</p><p>Interestingly, a very low level of RNase E cleavages within the intergenic regions of both operons was observed in the absence of RNase P. Thus, the pre-<italic>leuU</italic> species were the result of RNase E cleavages upstream of <italic>leuU</italic> in the <italic>secG leuU</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>B, lane 3 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A). These cleavages were inefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 3), occurred at multiple sites, and probably did not take place in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A). Similarly for <italic>metT</italic> operon, the presence of precursors (bands II, IV, V and VI) in the <italic>rnpA49</italic> single mutant and the reduction in their intensity in the <italic>rne-1 rnpA49</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B) suggest that RNase E can also cleave in the intercistronic regions among the first five tRNAs with varying efficiencies. For example, the presence of a large amount of band IV indicates efficient cleavage between <italic>glnU</italic> and <italic>glnW</italic>, while the absence of an intermediate containing the first four tRNAs (<italic>metT leuW glnU glnW</italic>) suggests that RNase E is unable to cleave in the intercistronic region between <italic>glnW</italic> and <italic>metU</italic>. Similar inefficient cleavages of RNase P-dependent tRNA transcripts by RNase E have also been observed in the <italic>valV valW</italic> and <italic>leuQ leuP leuV</italic> operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>With the work presented here, RNase E cleavage sites and relative efficiencies of cleavage are now available for 19/86 tRNA species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). This data is of particular interest because previous work has suggested the importance of an A/U-rich region in the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) and the presence of a G residue at the &#x02212;2 position and either C or U at the +2 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Of the 12 high-efficiency RNase E cleavage sites only one has a G at the &#x02212;2 position. In contrast, 9/12 sites have a C or U at the +2 position (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 3</xref>). In addition, it does not appear that RNase E can cleave closer than 1 nt downstream of the CCA determinant, even if the next nucleotide is a U. <table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table

operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), it is now clear that a significant number of tRNA precursors are dependent on RNase P for their initial separation from polycistronic transcripts rather than RNase E. In fact, a preliminary analysis indicates that the <italic>metZ</italic> operon (<italic>metZ metW metV</italic>) is also highly dependent on RNase P for processing (data not shown) as predicted from the microarray data of Li <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). These observations provide further support for our hypothesis that the essential function of RNase P may be related to its requirement for the processing of polycistronic tRNA transcripts rather than the processing of the 5&#x02032; ends of pre-tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Finally, it would not be surprising if there were, in fact still yet, unidentified additional pathways for the maturation of specific tRNAs. Thus the mechanisms of tRNA maturation in <italic>E. coli</italic> are far more diverse than has previously been envisioned.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are indebted to V.
