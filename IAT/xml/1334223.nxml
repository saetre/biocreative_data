ACTG studies were approved by local institutional review boards at each institution where participants were recruited and all participants gave written informed consent. These specific ACTG studies were selected because appropriate data, including fasting plasma lipids and DNA samples, were available and all participants were on ART at time of sampling. Study A5005s was the metabolic sub-study of ACTG 384, a six-arm comparison of three- or four-drug ARTs with zidovudine and lamivudine, or stavudine and didanosine, combined with efavirenz (EFV), nelfinavir (NFV), or both, in ART-na&#x000ef;ve individuals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030052-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. ACTG 5068 compared two strategies, treatment interruption and vaccination with ALVAC vCP1452, to augment HIV-specific immune responses in individuals on stable ART. Protocol A5087 enrolled ART-treated participants with dyslipidemia who were randomized to one of two lipid-lowering interventions<bold>.</bold> ACTG 372 was a rollover study for ACTG 320 to compare individuals receiving abacavir or a placebo in combination with zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir. Finally, A5116 was a class-sparing and regimen-simplification study for patients with advanced HIV disease. A more detailed description of the above mentioned studies can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>. In our analysis, fasting lipids were recorded in all patients in A5087 prior to starting lipid-lowering therapy. Fasting lipids were recorded for patients in A5005 at least 32 wk after start of ART, and for all other studies at entry. Because lipid levels prior to HIV therapy were not consistently available, our study represents an analysis of treatment lipids across these ACTG studies.</p><p>Among study participants, <italic>n</italic> = 440 were on stable PI ART (<italic>n</italic> = 398 on a non-RTV regimen) (and <italic>n</italic> = 42 on a RTV regimen; median exposure 976 d; interquartile ranges &#x0005b;IQR&#x0005d; = 244, 1245) or non-PI ART (<italic>n</italic> = 131; 78&#x00025; EFV and 13&#x00025; NFV-containing regimens).

Demographic and clinical information was provided to the NWCS224 team in a blinded, de-linked manner from the Statistical and Data Analysis Center of the Center for Biostatistics and AIDS Research at the Harvard School of Public Health. Race/ethnicity data were self-reported in these ACTG studies with race categorized as Black, Caucasian, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, other Pacific Islander, or Asian; and ethnicity as Hispanic or non-Hispanic. For the purpose of our analysis, a single three-level race/ethnicity variable was defined, which represented 97.6&#x00025; of the full sample: White/non-Hispanic (White), Black/non-Hispanic (Black), or Hispanic. Clinical information collected included medical histories, concomitant medications, ART history, CD4 counts, viral loads, height, weight, fasting plasma lipoproteins (TG, HDL-c, total cholesterol), and glucose. Fasting plasma lipids were measured according to the specific parent ACTG protocols. Non-HDL-c was calculated by subtracting HDL-c from total cholesterol.

Demographic and clinical characteristics are given overall and by specific ACTG study. Data are reported as medians and IQR for continuous variables, and as proportions for categorical variables. Raw lipoprotein data are presented by race/ethnicity, gender, and drug exposures. Log transformations were employed to normalize lipoprotein data for the purpose of modeling.</p><p>As a first step, we assessed the main effects of race/ethnicity and PI exposure on plasma lipids, using multiple linear regression modeling. As a primary analysis, models were fitted treating PI exposure as a three-level factor (no current PI exposure, currently exposed to a non-RTV&#x02013;containing PI regimen, and currently exposed to a RTV-containing regimen). An analysis of PI exposure as an indicator for any current PI use was also performed. Fully adjusted multivariable models included race/ethnicity, ART exposures (current use of PI, stavudine, EFV, and NFV), age, gender, study, CD4 count, and use of lipid-lowering therapy. Maximum likelihood coefficient estimates (reported as estimated fold increases in each lipid outcome on the un-logged scale), 95&#x00025; confidence intervals (CI) for the true effects, and F-test statistics are reported. In addition, separate multivariable models were fitted for each SNP to assess their independent main effects on lipid outcomes. SNPs were coded as binary indicators for the presence of at least one variant allele (i.e., heterozygous or homozygous rare.) Although useful for comparison with published studies, a notable limitation of this first step is that it does not account for potential interaction between race/ethnicity, PI exposure, and genotypes.</p><p>We performed all subsequent analyses stratified by race/ethnicity in order to address our primary hypothesis of an interaction between genotype and PI exposure on TGs within racial/ethnic stratum. Maximum likelihood estimates and 95&#x00025; CIs for main effects of PI exposure and interaction effects between PI exposure and apoC-III/apoA-I SNPs were estimated within race/ethnicity stratum, based on fully adjusted multivariable linear regression models. In these models, PI exposure was treated as a two-level indicator for any current exposure because there is no mechanistic data to support differential interaction effects of apoC-III genotypes with distinct PIs. Estimated fold increases in TGs and corresponding 95&#x00025; CIs on the un-logged scale are again reported and significance is based on a two-sided Wald test at the 0.05 level. Predicted TG levels and 95&#x00025; CIs, based on these fully adjusted multivariable models, are provided for non-PI and PI groups within racial/ethnic stratum, with and without further stratification by genotype.</p><p>Due to the high degree of concordance among the observed apoC-III SNPs, an additional composite genotype analysis is presented. As a primary analysis, the three apoC-III SNPs described by Tarr et al.

Our findings caution against generalizing results of genetic studies in White samples when considering metabolic traits in HIV-1 populations, particularly for genes with known complex LD structures reported to vary by race/ethnicity.</p><p>In summary, this study provides novel information regarding HIV-1 subgroups that may be at differential risk of developing metabolic and CV complications of ART. Approaches that account for racial/ethnic heterogeneity are mandated in pharamcogenetic studies of such complications given the multi-ethnic distribution of HIV-1 infection, concerns regarding future atherosclerotic CV disease in these populations, and the potential to use alternative strategies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030052-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030052-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d; to reverse or avoid metabolic effects of ART.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="st001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Demographic and Clinical Characteristics by Study</title><p>(134 KB DOC).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0030052.st001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="st002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><title>Individual SNP Effects on Lipids in Multivariable Adjusted Models with Racial/Ethnic Groups Combined</title><p>(37 KB DOC).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0030052.st002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="st003"><label>Table S3</label><caption><title>Genotype Frequencies by Race/Ethnicity</title><p>(46 KB DOC).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0030052.st003.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><sec id="s5a"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The EntrezGene (prior LocusLink) accession numbers for genes/proteins referred to in this paper are apoA-I (335), apoA-IV (337), apoA-V (116519), apoC-III (345), and apoE (348).</p><boxed-text id="pmed-0030052-box001" position="float"><sec id="sb1"><title>Patient Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title>Background</title><p>One of the unfortunate side effects of protease inhibitors&#x02014;one of the types of drugs used in treating HIV&#x02014;is that they affect lipids in the body; for example, they cause the level of triglycerides to increase in such a way as to make it more likely that patients will develop diseases associated with abnormal lipids such as heart disease and stroke. As these drugs are taken for very long periods of time, there are concerns that there may be a future epidemic of cardiovascular disease in patients with HIV-1 who have taken such lifelong treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>The authors wanted to see if they could identify individuals with HIV who are at increased risk of getting the lipid abnormalities caused by these drugs; in particular, they wanted to see if there were differences across different racial/ethnic groups and according to common variation in some lipid genes. Knowing about such differences might help in deciding between the various different drug treatments available.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>They looked at 626 people who had taken part in previous studies of HIV drugs, and who had agreed to have their blood stored for further studies such as these. They found that race/ethnicity could help predict levels of plasma lipids, and that the effect of taking protease inhibitors also appeared to differ across race/ethnicity groups. Overall, Black patients taking these drugs were less likely to have the lipid profiles that lead to cardiovascular disease, compared to Whites and Hispanics. However, individuals in all racial/ethnic groups had increases in triglyceride levels when they were given these drugs. Furthermore, Hispanics, but not Whites or Blacks, with variation in the apoC-III gene, appeared to be protected from the triglyceride-raising effect of protease inhibitors</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>Given that HIV is a disease that affects all racial/ethnic groups, it will be important in the future to study carefully and in large numbers the patients of all racial/ethnic groups in studies of metabolic and cardiovascular complications of drugs used to treat HIV. It may also be necessary to look at the effect of certain genes on these lipids. In the future it may be possible to use this information to decide which patients should receive which drugs.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Where Can I Get More Information Online?</title><p>AIDSinfo is a site run by the National Institutes of Health in the US that has many pages of information on HIV.
