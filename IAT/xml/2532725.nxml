To improve the characteristics of useful microorganisms, several approaches have been explored to expedite the screening for new phenotypes of interest. Because of its simplicity and convenience, random mutagenesis has been widely used for the selection of desired phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). However, mutagenesis approaches rely on labor-intensive work and luck. Therefore, more rational approaches have been employed for the manipulation of genes relevant to a specific function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). Most rational approaches involve either the deletion or overexpression of a single gene or sequential multigenic modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However, the engineering of desired phenotypes in organisms often requires the complete reprogramming of innate gene expression circuits, a process that necessitates multigenic transcriptional coordination. Even with the most sophisticated computational methods for physiological pathway analysis, complete identification of the precise genes involved in achieving a desired phenotype is almost impossible. Therefore, to permit multiple simultaneous gene expression changes, researchers recently developed methods for engineering of the global transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Although this methodology permits changes in the expression of many genes that allow organisms to access novel cellular phenotypes, its use has been restricted either to a specific genotype or to housekeeping genes that are generally expressed and thought to be involved in routine cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Here, we have developed novel artificial transcription factors (ATFs) to completely reprogram innate gene expression circuits in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and thus to elicit broad perturbations in the <italic>E. coli</italic> transcriptome.</p><p>Zinc fingers (ZFs) are well-characterized and highly specific DNA-binding domains found in a wide variety of transcriptional regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Because of their diversity and modular structure, ZF domains have provided an attractive framework with which to construct diverse, novel ATFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17">10&#x02013;17</xref>).</p><p>The cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) is a global transcription factor that regulates gene expression at &#x0003e;200 different promoters in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21">18&#x02013;21</xref>). CRP activates transcription by interacting with RNA polymerase through CRP's functionally independent transcriptional activation domains. Because of the existence of these various domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), CRP could be engineered and used as a transcriptional effector domain to construct novel ATFs.</p><p>In this study, we selected 40 human ZFs with diverse DNA-binding specificities and combinatorially assembled them to construct a library of DNA-binding domains that consisted of 3 ZFs each. These DNA-binding domains were then fused to a CRP effector domain to create a fusion protein that either activated or repressed transcription regardless of the presence of endogenous transcription factors. Introduction of these novel ATFs into <italic>E. coli</italic> induced various phenotypic changes such as resistance to heat shock, osmotic pressure and cold shock. The bacterial strains were selected that displayed the newly acquired industrially important traits and the genes associated with the selected phenotypes were identified and characterized.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> XL1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 were used for this experiment.

For complementation assays, the genes related to the thermotolerance phenotype, <italic>cpxP</italic>, <italic>ompW</italic> and the <italic>marRAB</italic> operon were deleted from the MG1655 <italic>E. coli</italic> genome by the above method, producing MG1655<italic>&#x00394;cpxP</italic>, MG1655<italic>&#x00394;ompW</italic> and MG1655<italic>&#x00394;marRAB</italic>, respectively. The T7<italic>lac</italic> promoter of the pETDuet-1 vector (Novagen, San Diego, CA) was replaced by either a <italic>tac</italic> promoter or an <italic>arabinose</italic>-inducible promoter, generating pETtac and pETara, respectively. The pBR322 origin of the high-copy plasmid pETtac was replaced by P15A origin, generating low-copy plasmid pACYCtac. pETtac was used for the expression of the ATF libraries. pACYCtac was used for the expression of the T2 ATF to assess effects of T2 ATF copy number on the thermotolerance phenotype. In addition, for the complementary assays, the genes related to the thermotolerance phenotype, <italic>cpxP</italic> and <italic>ompW</italic>, were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the MG1655 genomic DNA, and the amplified <italic>cpxP</italic> and <italic>ompW</italic> genes were cloned into pETtac individually or together, producing pETtac-<italic>cpxP</italic>, pETtac-<italic>ompW</italic> and pETtac-<italic>cpxP/ompW</italic>, respectively. pETara was used for the expression of the 3-ZF-CRP fusion proteins, which consisted of 3 ZFs fused to various CRP derivatives, to find the most effective CRP effector domain for this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn449/DC1">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Engineering a CRP-based effector domain for novel ATFs.

To construct a DNA fragment that encodes a ZF, two 66-nt oligonucleotides (oligos), where 19-nt sequences at each 3&#x02032; end are complementary to each other, are synthesized. These oligos are hybridized and filled in by T4 DNA polymerase, producing a 113-bp duplex DNA segment. The resulting 113-bp DNA segment has a sequence encoding a ZF in the middle, preceded by an 18-bp linker sequence containing an XmaI site (bold) at the 5&#x02032; end (5&#x02032;-<bold>CCCGGG</bold>GAAAAACCGTAC-3&#x02032;), which is frequently found at the junction between ZF-encoding DNA segments (at their 5&#x02032; ends) in naturally occurring ZF proteins. An AgeI site, an in-frame stop codon (TAA), and an EcoRI site (5&#x02032;-<bold>ACCGGT</bold>TAA<bold>GAATTC</bold>-3&#x02032;) were also incorporated into the 3&#x02032; region of the 113-bp ZF-encoding DNA segment. The 113-bp products of this fill-in reaction were then digested with XmaI and EcoRI, and subsequently cloned into pUC19 (New England Biolabs) digested with the same enzymes.</p><p>To construct an ATF library, a DNA segment that encoded CRP D1 was PCR-amplified from MG1655 genomic DNA using the following forward (CRP-F) and reverse (CRP-R) primers, respectively: CRP-F, 5&#x02032;-CATG<bold>CCATGG</bold>TGCTTGGCAAACCGCAAACA-3&#x02032; [which contained an NcoI site (bold)]; and CRP-R, 5&#x02032;-CCG<bold>GAATTCACCGGT</bold>AGAACAGCCGACAATCTGAC-3&#x02032; [which contained an AgeI site and an EcoRI site (bold)]. The PCR-amplified CRP D1 DNA, after digestion with NcoI and EcoRI, was cloned into pETtac that had been digested with the same enzymes, producing pETtac-CRP D1. Equal amounts of each single-finger plasmid were mixed together to form a pool. The single-finger plasmid pool was digested with XmaI and EcoRI and then ligated into the AgeI/EcoRI-digested pETtac-CRP D1 to generate a series of pETtac-CRP D1-1ZF library vectors, each encoding CRP D1 and one ZF.

Of 10<sup>6</sup> ATF transformants screened, 150 ATF transformants survived on a minimal A medium containing 0.6 M NaCl. The surviving cells were then subjected to further screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The selected ATF transformants showed an improvement in osmotolerance at the concentration of 0.6 M NaCl. In the absence of osmotic pressure (as encountered in 0.6 M NaCl), both wild-type and the selected osmotolerant cells exhibited similar growth patterns.</p><p>Finally, we screened for ATFs that induced a cold-tolerance phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28">26&#x02013;28</xref>) in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). To screen for cold-tolerant cells, the pool of 10<sup>6</sup> ATF transformants was grown at 15&#x000b0;C in LB medium, wherein most wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> cells stop their growth. Thirteen of 10<sup>6</sup> ATF transformants survived at 15&#x000b0;C. Only the selected cold-tolerant cells grew well at 15&#x000b0;C, even though both the selected cold-tolerant and wild-type cells showed similar growth patterns when grown at the optimal growth temperature, 37&#x000b0;C.</p><p>To confirm that the various phenotypic improvements were indeed caused by the ATFs, the plasmids that encoded the ATFs were rescued from the selected cells and then retransformed into wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic>. Of 10<sup>6</sup> wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> cells retransformed with each rescued ATF plasmid, 50 transformants were randomly selected and analyzed for their respective phenotypic changes (thermotolerance, osmotolerance and cold-tolerance). The phenotypic changes in all the selected retransformants were the same as those in the primary transformants. The selected ATFs induced only their respective phenotypes and random ATFs did not confer the above phenotypes upon <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. The identities of the selected ATFs along with their respective phenotypic changes are presented in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn449/DC1">Supplementary Table 3</ext-link>.</p><p>Of all the best-growing thermotolerant mutant cells, the T2 thermotolerant cell expressing an ATF on high-copy plasmid (HT2) exhibited the most improved cellular viability under the stressful condition (heat treatment at 55&#x000b0;C for 2 h). Therefore, the remainder of this study focuses on this particular mutant cell, which expressed the T2 ATF. The T2 ATF was composed of CRP D1 and 3 ZFs (Z13, Z2 and Z25, ordered in the N- to C- terminal direction) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn449/DC1">Supplementary Table 3</ext-link>). The putative binding site for the T2 ATF was inferred to be 5&#x02032;-NGA TTC (G/A)CT-3&#x02032; from the published literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the T2 ATF generated the different degree of thermotolerance, when it was expressed at various levels with different expression vectors. The T2 transformants expressing T2 ATF on low-copy plasmid (LT2) were also more heat resistant than wild-type cells. However their heat resistance was less than that of T2 ATF on high-copy plasmid (HT2) under the given heat-stress condition (at 55&#x000b0;C for 2 h). This observation suggests that various levels of phenotypic changes can be obtained by controlling the level of ATF expression using different copy number plasmids.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of genes associated with thermotolerance</title><p>Using cDNA prepared from RNA isolated from the <italic>E. coli</italic> transformant containing the T2 ATF on low- and high-copy plasmids, we performed genome-scale gene expression profiling analyses of the T2 transformant with <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA microarrays. Transcription profiling of the T2 thermotolerant cells revealed that the T2 ATF caused differential expression of hundreds of genes relative to the wild-type cells containing a control plasmid without the ATF. Specifically, a total of 202 genes in the transformant with HT2 were differentially expressed by more than 4-fold compared to the control (133 up-regulated and 69 down-regulated) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn449/DC1">Supplementary Tables 4</ext-link> and 5). Similarly, 107 genes were altered in the transformant with LT2 (61 up-regulated and 46 down-regulated) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn449/DC1">Supplementary Tables 6</ext-link> and 7). Among these genes, 45 genes were altered in a similar fashion in both HT2 and LT2 (25 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated). These results suggest that the T2 ATF is affecting a subset of important genes responsible for thermotolerance, implying that thermotolerance is a phenotype controlled by those genes.</p><p>Although the transcriptional reprogramming that occurred in the T2 thermotolerant cells was quite broad, there was some clustering of genes that encoded chaperons and proteins involved in membrane functions and protection against environmental stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn449/DC1">Supplementary Tables 4&#x02013;7</ext-link>). Genes with no known function were also found to be differentially expressed in T2 thermotolerant cells relative to the control.</p><p>We noticed that the genes that showed the largest change in gene expression in T2 thermotolerant cells (both HT2 and LT2), relative to the control, were those involved in the protection of bacteria against various forms of environmental stresses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). To determine whether these genes are direct targets of the T2 ATF, we analyzed the regulatory sequences to search for sequence elements that matched the putative binding site for the T2 ATF. Indeed, many of the genes affected by the T2 ATF housed binding sites for this transcription factor in their regulatory regions. Among those genes, <italic>cpxP</italic>, <italic>ompW</italic> and <italic>marRAB</italic> exhibited the greatest change in their expression. The T2 ATF was found to bind to the putative T2 ATF-binding sites present in the regulatory regions of <italic>cpxP</italic>, <italic>ompW</italic> and <italic>marRAB</italic> by a DNA band-shift assay (data not shown), implying that they are direct targets of the T2 ATF.

The largest decrease in gene expression was seen for the <italic>marRAB</italic> operon that is known to encode proteins that have a role in multiple antibiotic resistance. The MarRAB protein, for example, is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of several <italic>E. coli</italic> genes involved in responses to multiple antibiotics and oxidative stress. Transcription profiling revealed that genes regulated by the <italic>marRAB</italic> operon exhibited the great change in expression levels in the T2 thermotolerant mutant cell, relative to the control. For example, the <italic>hdeA</italic> and <italic>slp</italic> genes, which are known to be repressed by MarRAB in wild-type cells, were strongly activated 4- to 16-fold in the T2 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn449/DC1">Supplementary Table 4</ext-link>). These results imply that the T2 ATF inhibits the expression of MarRAB, which subsequently results in either the activation or repression of genes that are differentially regulated by this versatile transcriptional regulatory protein.</p><p>To examine the functional relevance of these target genes to the thermotolerance phenotype in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we either overexpressed or knocked out the <italic>cpxP</italic> and <italic>ompW</italic> genes. We also knocked out the <italic>marRAB</italic> operon and examined the response of the mutant strain to heat treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). When the <italic>cpxP</italic> or <italic>ompW</italic> gene was individually overexpressed in wild-type cells, the resulting cells were more resistant to the lethal effects of heat shock than wild-type cells. But they were less heat resistant than the T2 thermotolerant cells (HT2 and LT2) under heat-stress conditions. In addition, co-expression of <italic>cpxP</italic> and <italic>ompW</italic> in wild-type cells led to more heat tolerance than the wild-type cells overexpressing <italic>cpxP</italic> or <italic>ompW</italic> individually. The <italic>cpxP</italic> and <italic>ompW</italic> co-overexpressing cells were nearly as resistant as the LT2 thermotolerant cell, but much less resistant than the HT2 thermotolerant cell. Despite the increase in heat tolerance of the <italic>cpxP</italic>- or/and <italic>ompW</italic>-overexpressing cells, the basal growth rate of these strains in the absence of heat stress was similar to that of wild-type cells.

Detailed mechanism of these genes involved in the thermotolerance should be further studied.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The intricate interaction of multiple genes throughout the entire gene expression network controls the phenotypic variations in cells and organisms. Herein, we have demonstrated the applicability of ATF libraries to induce genetic perturbations (through transcriptional activation or repression) and thus to induce phenotypic variations in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Transcription factors have modular structures that consist of a DNA-binding domain and an effector (activation or repression) domain. Libraries of proteins that contain only a DNA-binding domain have been used to repress transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, DNA-binding domains that do not contain an effector domain cannot activate the expression of genes, because activation of transcription depends upon the activity of an effector domain. Using CRP as an effector domain, our ATFs can activate the expression of genes. Furthermore, prokaryotic transcription factors can have dual activity as either an activator or a repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Activation or repression mediated by transcription factors is linked to the distance of the regulator-binding sites relative to promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The preferred sites for activators are located between nucleotide positions &#x02212;80 and &#x02212;30. Repressor-binding sites are generally located downstream from nucleotide position &#x02212;30. We have also shown that our ATFs can function as both an activator and a repressor as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and C).</p><p>We induced various phenotypic changes in <italic>E. coli</italic> with our ATFs and the genes associated with the heat-resistance phenotype were identified. We found that the expression of over two hundred genes was significantly affected by the T2 ATF that induces a thermotolerance phenotype. RNA for the transcriptomic analysis was isolated from exponential-phase cultures to see the biggest difference in gene expression between the wild-type and the thermotolerant cells. Therefore, the result of the transcriptomic analysis presented does not address the difference in the general expression profile, but the gene expression difference under a specific condition (4 h after inoculation at 50&#x000b0;C) because the wild-type and the thermotolerant cells have very different growth rates at 50&#x000b0;C. The genes that show the largest increase in gene expression under our experimental condition, including <italic>cpxP</italic> and <italic>ompW</italic>, are highly involved in the protection of bacteria against various forms of environmental stresses. CpxP is a chaperone involved in resistance to extracytoplasmic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). This result is consistent with the previous report that many chaperones are heat shock proteins, which are expressed in response to elevated temperatures or other cellular stresses. It is well known that proper protein folding is disrupted when cells are subjected to heat treatment, and our findings suggest that CpxP may be involved in protein folding under heat shock conditions. OmpW is an outer membrane protein that forms an eight-stranded beta-barrel with a hydrophobic channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The function of OmpW is unknown, but recent data suggest that it may be involved in the protection of bacteria against various forms of environmental stresses, such as temperature extremes, salinity and availability of nutrients or oxygen. We also reason that the overexpression of OmpW might provide structural stability to the cell. It is known that high temperatures lead to an increase in the fluidity of the cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Excessive membrane fluidity gives rise to leaky membranes, and, thus a corresponding loss of function of membrane proteins. Therefore, the changes in the <italic>E. coli'</italic>s plasma membrane through the overexpression of OmpW may be associated with the mutated cell's ability to withstand elevated temperatures.</p><p>Overexpression of a single or double gene(s) among the top-candidate genes identified in the microarray analysis (e.g. <italic>cpxP</italic> and/or <italic>ompW</italic>) did not produce a thermotolerance phenotype as robust as the phenotype induced by the T2 ATF. It seems that the ability of the ATF to elicit simultaneous modification to the expression levels of many genes is critically important for obtaining highly improved thermotolerance phenotypes. For instance, transcriptional profiling revealed that T2 ATF represses the <italic>marRAB</italic> operon, which in turn leads to increased expression of genes such as <italic>hdeA</italic> and <italic>slp</italic> that are repressed by products of <italic>marRAB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). HdeA is a chaperon and Slp is an outer membrane lipoprotein and both are involved in resistance to stress conditions (i.e. at low pH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) and so are likely to be among the many proteins contributing to the thermotolerance phenotype.</p><p>The ATF approach that we describe can cause nuanced changes in gene expression. In cases where the expression level of a particular gene is critical to obtaining the desired phenotypes, subtle changes in the gene expression might be necessary to allow cells to achieve them. For instance, the knockout of the <italic>marRAB</italic> operon failed to impart an improved thermotolerance phenotype, which indicates that the altered level of <italic>marRAB</italic> expression induced by T2 ATF rather than the complete elimination of these genes is necessary to achieve this phenotype. Additional levels of control over cellular phenotype are also possible by regulating the expression of the ATF. We have observed that our ATF can generate various levels of phenotypic improvements, such as the different degree of thermotolerance, when they were expressed at various levels with different expression vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). In addition, a conditional induction of a desired phenotype is possible with ATFs under an inducible promoter. We have observed that ATF expressed under an inducible promoter (a <italic>tac</italic> promoter) can conditionally generate desired phenotypes (data not shown). Moreover, a phenotypic transfer from one strain to another strain of the same species is straightforward with our approach. The same phenotypic changes were observed when the selected ATFs were expressed in other strains such as <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 and XL1-Blue (data not shown). Finally, we have observed that our ATF can generate desired phenotypes more efficiently than random mutation. Random mutagenesis approach could generate osmotolerant and cold-tolerant cells, but not to the extent that we have obtained with our ATFs. Indeed, 50/10<sup>6</sup> thermotolerant cells were obtained under the heat treatment condition (at 55&#x000b0;C for 2 h), but cells that are tolerant to heat at 55&#x000b0;C could not be obtained by random mutation under our experimental condition. Also, ATFs could generate osmotolerance and cold-tolerance phenotypes (150/10<sup>6</sup> and 13/10<sup>6</sup> cells, respectively) more efficiently than random mutation (approximately 1/10<sup>7</sup> cells for each phenotype) under our experimental conditions.</p><p>Our results and the general applicability of this platform demonstrate that ATFs can be used as a powerful tool for phenotypic engineering and functional genomic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn449/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkn449_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkn449_nar-02477-met-g-2007-File005.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="gkn449_nar-02477-met-g-2007-File006.xls"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="gkn449_nar-02477-met-g-2007-File007.xls"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="gkn449_nar-02477-met-g-2007-File008.xls"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="gkn449_nar-02477-met-g-2007-File009.xls"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported in part by grants from 21C Frontier Program of Microbial Genomics and Applications (MG05-0204-1-0), the Molecular &#x00026; Cellular BioDiscovery Research Program (M1-0106-00-0200) from the Ministry of Science and Technology of Korea, the Korea Science &#x00026; Engineering Foundation Grant (R01-2005-000-11010-0), and the Basic Research Program of the Korea Research Foundation Grant (KRF-2004-042-D00072).
