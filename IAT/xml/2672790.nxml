The 36 patients were lost to follow up as they either had withdrawn their consent or had not returned for their visit within the one-year timeframe. COPD was diagnosed according to current Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-copd-4-149">1</xref> based on a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years with typical symptoms (one or more of productive cough, breathlessness, and wheeze) and evidence of airflow obstruction. Patients with a clinical history of asthma, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, an exacerbation or any change in their COPD therapy within four weeks of the study at the baseline and the one-year visit, or a history of lung cancer were excluded. Written informed consent was obtained and the local ethics committee approved the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>Spirometry, sputum induction, and peripheral blood sampling were performed at the baseline visit and then repeated one year later. Sputum differential cell counts were performed and IL-8 was measured in the sputum supernatant to characterize airway inflammatory biomarkers. Serum IL-6, plasma CRP, and plasma TNF-&#x003b1; were measured at both visits as biomarkers of systemic inflammation. Height was measured to the nearest cm and weight to the nearest 100 gm. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kg divided by squared height in meters.</p></sec><sec><title>Spirometry</title><p>Maximum expiratory flow volume measurements were performed using the spirometry system on the MasterScreen (Jaeger GmbH, W&#x000fc;rzburg, Germany). Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and forced vital capacity (FVC) readings were performed in triplicate. Spirometry during sputum induction was performed with a Vitalograph spirometer (Vitalograph, Buckinghamshire, UK). The equipment was calibrated daily according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasma and serum assays</title><p>Plasma and serum were obtained from peripheral blood samples by centrifugation for 15 minutes, at 1500 g and at 4 &#x000b0;C or ambient temperature, respectively. Plasma and serum samples were stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C until analysis. Plasma TNF-&#x003b1; and serum IL-6 was measured by high sensitivity ELISA (Quantikine, R&#x00026;D Systems Europe, Oxon, UK) with a lower limit of detection of 0.5 pg/ml and 0.156 pg/ml respectively. Serum was used for the IL-6 assay as there was insufficient plasma available from all patients. Plasma CRP was measured by high sensitivity particle-enhanced immunonephelometry (Cardiophase; BN systems, Dade Behring, Newark, NJ, USA) with a lower limit of detection of 0.175 mg/L.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The Kolmogorov &#x02013; Smirnov test determined normality of the data and nonparametric data were natural log transformed.

Second, using ICC, which is a recognized method for assessing the repeatability of measurements, we observed moderate levels of agreement for systemic inflammatory markers, as the R<sub>i</sub> values were &#x02265;0.5. Third, we also present Bland &#x02013; Altman plots to view the repeatability of data from individual subjects. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the long term reproducibility of IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; in COPD patients, and we demonstrate moderate repeatability for these systemic biomarkers over a 12 month period.</p><p>It has previously been shown that CRP did not change over a 17 month interval,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-copd-4-149">17</xref> but we are not aware of any similar information concerning IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;. The assessments of repeatability in our study can be used in the following ways; the within-subject SDs can be used to aid the statistical powering of clinical trials with pharmacological interventions and the Bland&#x02013;Altman plots show the variation that could be expected for individual measurements in clinical practice.</p><p>The systemic biomarkers that we investigated all appear to be related to pathophysiological processes in COPD; CRP is related to cardiovascular risk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-copd-4-149">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-copd-4-149">16</xref> and has been shown to be associated with many other important clinical outcomes of COPD.

The moderate association (r = 0.51&#x02013;0.55) on two occasions adds confidence to our interpretation that IL-6 promotes CRP production in COPD patients.</p><p>The finding that neither IL-6 nor CRP was related to the TNF-&#x003b1; is in contrast to two previous studies that showed a relationship, albeit a weak correlation, between TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-copd-4-149">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-copd-4-149">19</xref> and TNF-&#x003b1; and CRP existed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-copd-4-149">3</xref> in COPD patients. One methodological explanation for the lack of correlation in the current study could be due to the short half life of TNF-&#x003b1; compared to IL-6 or CRP. TNF-&#x003b1; has a short half-life of a few minutes and is also difficult to detect because it forms complexes with soluble TNF-&#x003b1; receptors (sTNF-R) and has high renal clearance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-copd-4-149">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-copd-4-149">34</xref> Circulating sTNF-R may be a more sensitive marker of TNF-&#x003b1; activation as they have slower renal clearance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-copd-4-149">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-copd-4-149">34</xref> Increased levels of these soluble receptors have been detected in COPD patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-copd-4-149">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-copd-4-149">21</xref> In addition the current study population consisted mainly of moderate COPD patients and a different relationship to TNF-&#x003b1; may have been observed in a population consisting of a range of disease severities.</p><p>BMI is recognized as an important tool in defining phenotypes of COPD patients and a reduced BMI has been shown to be an independent risk factor for mortality in COPD and to be associated with disease severity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-copd-4-149">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-copd-4-149">36</xref> Increased skeletal muscle apoptosis have also been shown to be associated with a lower BMI and reduced exercise tolerance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-copd-4-149">5</xref> In our study BMI was not related to circulating levels of IL-6, CRP, and TNF-&#x003b1;. This suggests that body mass loss may not be caused through systemic inflammation. However, there are studies that have shown CRP and BMI to be associated to each other.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-copd-4-149">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-copd-4-149">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-copd-4-149">17</xref> These findings were found in severe COPD patients with FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x0003c; 40% in comparison to the current study population comprised mainly of moderate disease. Although, in one recent study by Karadag and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-copd-4-149">37</xref> moderate patients were grouped into low BMI and normal-to-high BMI and they showed that the low BMI patients had higher levels of CRP and TNF-&#x003b1;. Conversely, in our population of patients we did not observe significant weight loss in individual patients over one-year, with our mean values of BMI being &#x0003e;25 kg/m<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-copd-4-149">2</xref> at both visits. This perhaps could also account for the lack of correlation observed between change in BMI and inflammatory biomarkers.</p><p>TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 levels have been shown to be increased in weight losing COPD patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-copd-4-149">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-copd-4-149">9</xref> However the present study does not support this finding. In the study by Eid and colleagues,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-copd-4-149">4</xref> weight loss characterized by reduced fat free mass (FFM) and skeletal muscle mass was associated with increased systemic inflammatory response. They showed that TNF-&#x003b1;, sTNF-R, and IL-6 were inversely related to FFM in patients with normal BMI. Another study also showed that CRP was inversely related to FFM in hypermetabolic patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-copd-4-149">8</xref> FFM appears to be a better marker of weight loss compared to BMI, particularly since FFM has been shown to be a predictor of mortality in the presence of normal BMI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-copd-4-149">38</xref> BMI has the advantage of being easy to measure but is a limited value as it does not represent changes in body composition or reflect skeletal muscle depletion.</p><p>The limitations of our study are: (a) we did not measure many other systemic biomarkers that may be of interest in COPD due to limited resources and therefore we decided to measure IL-6, CRP, and TNF-&#x003b1; because of their potential role in the pathopyhysiology of COPD; (b) we measured our samples only once at enrollment and at 12 months. It would have been of interest to have performed &#x0201c;serial sampling&#x0201d;; a recent study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-copd-4-149">39</xref> using 11 visits performed over a one-month interval to assess inflammatory biomarkers suggests that intra-patient variability is reduced with the use of a &#x0201c;rolling mean&#x0201d; of serial samples; (c) our population was composed of mainly moderate-to-severe disease, and the inclusion of more very severe patients would have been of interest especially to examine the repeatability by different GOLD severities; (d) we did not capture any clinical changes such as exacerbation within in the one-year interval excluding the four-week interval leading up to their study visit which may have influenced our results; (e) we were unable to perform analysis related to changes in therapeutic regime as we were limited by numbers of patients that had actually had a change in their medications such as stopping/starting inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) by the one-year visit. Although, it has recently been confirmed by Sin and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-copd-4-149">40</xref> and Kuniaski and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-copd-4-149">20</xref> that ICS use does not affect IL-6 and CRP levels measured; and (f) we did not relate our findings to other clinical parameters of COPD such as partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, exercise tolerance, and health status over an one-year interval.</p><p>In conclusion, the systemic inflammatory biomarkers IL-6, CRP, and TNF-&#x003b1; were moderately repeatable over a 12 month period in COPD patients. We have also shown that a robust and repeatable association between IL-6 and CRP exists. However, there was a lack of correlation of TNF-&#x003b1; to IL-6 or CRP, possibly due to the instability of TNF-&#x003b1;, or perhaps because TNF-&#x003b1; genuinely plays a different role to IL-6 and CRP in the pathophysiology of COPD.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-copd-4-149"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="web"><collab>Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)</collab><year>2007</year><date-in-citation>Accessed March 28, 2007</date-in-citation><comment>Available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.goldcopd.com">http://www.goldcopd.com</ext-link></comment></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b2-copd-4-149"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Broekhuizen</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Wouters</surname><given-names>EF</given-names></name><name><surname>Creutzberg</surname><given-names>EC</given-names></name><name><surname>Schols</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Raised CRP levels mark metabolic and functional impairment in advanced COPD</article-title><source>Thorax</source><year>2006</year><volume>61</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>17</fpage><lpage>22</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16055618</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b3-copd-4-149"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yende</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Waterer</surname><given-names>GW</given-names></name><name><surname>Tolley</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Inflammatory markers are associated with ventilatory limitation and muscle dysfunction in obstructive lung disease in well functioning elderly subjects</article-title><source>Thorax</source><year>2006</year><volume>61</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>10</fpage><lpage>16</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16284220</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b4-copd-4-149"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Eid</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><name><surname>Ionescu</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><name><surname>Nixon</surname><given-names>LS</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Inflammatory response and body composition in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</article-title><source>Am J Respir Crit Care Med</source><year>2001</year><volume>164</volume><issue>8 Pt 1</issue><fpage>1414</fpage><lpage>1418</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11704588</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b5-copd-4-149"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Agusti</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name><name><surname>Sauleda</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Miralles</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Skeletal muscle apoptosis and weight loss in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</article-title><source>Am J Respir Crit Care Med</source><year>2002</year><volume>166</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>485</fpage><lpage>489</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12186825</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b6-copd-4-149"><label>6</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sin</surname><given-names>DD</given-names></name><name><surname>Man</surname><given-names>SF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Why are patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases?
