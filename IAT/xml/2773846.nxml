Although the High Osmolarity Glycerol pathway is thought to have a function in at least basal control of Fps1 activity, its mode of regulation is not understood. We describe the identification of a pair of positive regulators of the Fps1 glycerol channel, Rgc1 (Ypr115w) and Rgc2 (Ask10). An <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutant experiences cell wall stress that results from osmotic pressure associated with hyper-accumulation of glycerol. Accumulation of glycerol in the <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutant results from a defect in Fps1 activity as evidenced by suppression of the defect through Fps1 overexpression, failure to release glycerol upon hypo-osmotic shock, and resistance to arsenite, a toxic metalloid that enters the cell through Fps1. Regulation of Fps1 by Rgc1/2 appears to be indirect; however, evidence is presented supporting the view that Rgc1/2 regulate Fps1 channel activity, rather than its expression, folding, or localization. Rgc2 was phosphorylated in response to stresses that lead to regulation of Fps1. This stress-induced phosphorylation was partially dependent on the Hog1 MAPK. Hog1 was also required for basal phosphorylation of Rgc2, suggesting a mechanism by which Hog1 may regulate Fps1 indirectly.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>When challenged by changes in extracellular osmolarity, many fungal species regulate their intracellular glycerol concentration to modulate their internal osmotic pressure. Maintenance of osmotic homeostasis prevents either cellular collapse under hyper-osmotic stress or cell rupture under hypo-osmotic stress. In baker's yeast, the Fps1 glycerol channel functions as the main vent for glycerol. Proper regulation of Fps1 is critical to the maintenance of osmotic homeostasis. In this study, we identify a pair of proteins (Rgc1 and Rgc2) that function as positive regulators of Fps1 activity. Their absence results in hyper-accumulation of glycerol and consequent cell lysis due to impaired Fps1 channel activity. Additionally, we found that these glycerol channel regulators function between the Hog1 (High Osmolarity Glycerol response) signaling kinase and Fps1, defining a signaling pathway for control of glycerol efflux. Because members of the Rgc1/2 family are found among pathogenic fungal species, but not in humans, they represent potentially attractive targets for antifungal drug development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Under conditions of high osmolarity stress, many fungal species, including <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, maintain osmotic equilibrium by producing and retaining high concentrations of glycerol as a compatible solute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000738-Nevoigt1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000738-Kayingo1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

To test this, we measured the rate of cell lysis of the <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutant by digestion of the cell wall with zymolyase, a wall degrading enzyme. Surprisingly, this mutant did not lyse more rapidly than the wild-type strain, but displayed slower than normal lysis kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000738-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that it produces a fortified cell wall. The single <italic>rgc1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rgc2</italic>&#x00394; mutants were slightly more resistant to zymolyase than was wild-type. A mutant that produces a fortified cell wall, but is nevertheless susceptible to cell lysis upon imposition of a cell wall stress may be interpreted to be under constitutive cell wall stress. We tested this by measuring the transcriptional output of the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway. The <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutant was strongly activated for transcription of a <italic>PRM5-lacZ</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000738-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), which is under the control of the Mpk1 MAP kinase and the Rlm1 transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000738-Jung1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This mutant also displayed constitutively active Mpk1, as judged by the phosphorylation state of this MAP kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000738-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). These results confirm that the <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutant experiences severe cell wall stress, to which it responds by fortifying the cell wall, and also explains its lysis defect in response to additional cell wall stress at high temperature.

These hypotheses generate different predictions for the impact of the <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutations on the phenotype of an <italic>fps1</italic>&#x00394; mutant. If the <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutant produces excess glycerol, this should exacerbate the lysis defect of an <italic>fps1</italic>&#x00394; mutant, which is blocked for glycerol efflux. By contrast, if the <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutant is blocked for glycerol efflux through Fps1, loss of the glycerol channel should not result in an additive defect. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000738-g003">Figure 3D</xref> shows that an <italic>fps1</italic>&#x00394; mutant displays a temperature-sensitive growth defect that is slightly more severe than that of the <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutant, with a semi-permissive growth temperature of 34.5&#x000b0;C. The <italic>fps1</italic>&#x00394; mutant growth defect at elevated temperature is also the result of cell lysis (data not shown). Significantly, the <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>fps1</italic>&#x00394; triple mutant behaves identically to the <italic>fps1</italic>&#x00394; mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000738-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that the <italic>rgc1/</italic>2&#x00394; mutant is impaired for glycerol efflux through Fps1. To test this directly, we measured export of glycerol from cells exposed to a hypo-osmotic shock, a condition that would induce glycerol efflux through Fps1. We found that glycerol was released from wild-type cells, but not from the <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutant or the <italic>fps1</italic>&#x00394; mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000738-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), supporting the conclusion that Rgc1 and Rgc2 regulate glycerol efflux through Fps1. The varied initial content of <sup>14</sup>C-labeled glycerol among these mutants is a consequence of differential glycerol loading, reflecting the importance of Fps1 for glycerol influx as well as efflux. Finally, strong overexpression of <italic>RGC2</italic> failed to suppress the temperature-sensitivity of the <italic>fps1</italic>&#x00394; mutant (data not shown), thus establishing an epistatic relationship that places <italic>RGC1</italic> and <italic>RGC2</italic> above <italic>FPS1</italic> in a common pathway for glycerol efflux.</p><p>To explore the mechanism by which Rgc1/2 regulate Fps1, we first examined the Fps1 protein level in an <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutant. Despite the observed defect in glycerol efflux of the <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutant, this mutant maintains strongly elevated Fps1 protein levels as compared to wild-type (increased approximately 10-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000738-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that it attempts to compensate for impaired Fps1 function by increasing the number of channel proteins. The increase in Fps1 protein is a consequence of elevated glycerol concentration resulting from the <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutation, because the Fps1 level was reduced in an <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>gpd1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000738-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), which is blocked for glycerol production. The increased steady-state level of Fps1 in the <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutant is not the result of transcriptional induction, because <italic>FPS1</italic> was expressed under the control of a heterologous promoter (<italic>MET25</italic>). This conclusion was supported by the finding that expression from an <italic>FPS1-lacZ</italic> reporter was not altered in the <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000738-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). An even greater increase in Fps1 protein level in the <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; compared to wild-type (approximately 20-fold) was observed when <italic>FPS1</italic> was expressed from its native promoter on a multi-copy plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000738-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Evidently, ectopic overexpression of <italic>FPS1</italic> suppresses the <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; lysis defect by assisting the cell in its efforts to enhance glycerol efflux through an impaired channel. Under these conditions the cells retain more than 20-fold higher levels of Fps1 protein than wild-type cells (the comparison in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000738-g004">Figure 4C</xref> was to wild-type cells also expressing <italic>FPS1</italic> from a multi-copy plasmid).

If these proteins function as activators of the Fps1 glycerol channel, they might be expected to interact with Fps1 at the plasma membrane. We examined the intracellular localization of Rgc2-GFP<sub>2</sub> in response to hypo-osmotic shock, conditions in which the Fps1 channel must be opened to allow glycerol efflux. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000738-g005">Figure 5A</xref> shows that under unstressed conditions, Rgc2-GFP<sub>2</sub> displays diffuse cytoplasmic localization, but very rapidly aggregates into punctate spots that appear near the cell surface in response to hypo-osmotic shock. These spots dissipate over a period of approximately 45 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000738-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Fps1 has been reported to reside in punctate spots at the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000738-Tamas1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

Other efforts to detect physical interaction between Rgc2 and Fps1 (e.g. co-precipitation and two-hybrid analyses; data not shown) failed to provide such evidence.

This last result is difficult to understand considering that the mutant retains much more Fps1. It is possible that the fluorescent protein is preferentially cleaved from the stabilized Fps1 and digested in the vacuole. Nevertheless, the Fps1 we can detect in the <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutant appears to reside in the same location as in wild-type cells. These results, taken in the aggregate, suggest that regulation of Fps1 by Rgc1/2 is at the level of channel activity, rather than channel expression or localization.</p><fig id="pgen-1000738-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000738.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Localization of Rgc2.</title><p>(A) Rgc2-GFP<sub>2</sub> re-localizes from uniform cytoplasmic distribution to punctate spots near the cell periphery in response to hypo-osmotic shock.

The increase in glycerol is the consequence of impaired Fps1 function.

Nevertheless, imposing additional cell wall stress on this mutant induced cell lysis, a defect that was suppressed by blocking glycerol synthesis. In this regard, it is interesting to note that blocking the function of the glycerol channel activators also sensitized cells to caspofungin, an antifungal agent that acts by inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000738-Kurtz1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Evidently, preventing the cells from responding to their internally imposed cell wall stress is lethal. Therefore, Rgc1/2 might be suitable antifungal targets for combination therapy with caspofungin.</p><p>The mechanism by which Rgc1/2 regulate Fps1 remains unclear. Although there is some evidence that Rgc2 (Ask10) can act as a transcriptional regulator (see below), we did not find that Rgc1/2 control Fps1 transcription. We were not able to detect direct interaction between Rgc2 and the Fps1 channel. However, the findings that Fps1 localizes to the plasma membrane in the presence or absence of Rgc1/2 and that constitutive mutants of Fps1 retain their open channel character independently of Rgc1/2 suggests that these proteins regulate Fps1 through its activity, rather than at an earlier step, such as protein folding, or proper localization. Rgc1/2 control of Fps1 folding or localization would be expected to impact the function of open channel mutants as well as the wild-type.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>The role of Hog1 in the regulation of Fps1</title><p>Fps1 is unusual in its possession of extensions at both its cytoplasmic N-terminus and C-terminus that play a role in regulating Fps1 channel activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000738-Tamas2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000738-Hedfalk1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

In any case, it is clear that other protein kinases contribute to the regulation of Rgc2 (and probably Rgc1), and consequently Fps1, in response to various stresses. These results establish a regulatory pathway from Hog1 to Rgc1/2 to Fps1, in which Rgc1 and Rgc2 are positive regulators of Fps1 channel activity and Hog1 inhibits Fps1 through inhibition of Rgc1/2.

First, the tdTomato coding sequence was subcloned from pRSET-B &#x0005b;<italic>tdTomato</italic>&#x0005d; (gift of R. Tsien) into pRS316 at the BamHI and EcoRI sites, yielding p2487. Next, the <italic>FPS1</italic> gene was amplified (omitting the endogenous stop codon) from genomic DNA (EG123) and inserted into p2487 using NotI and SpeI sites designed into the primers. This fused the <italic>FPS1</italic> reading frame with tdTomato, yielding pRS316-<italic>FPS1-tdTomato</italic> (p2489).</p><p>The <italic>RGC2</italic> gene was tagged at its C-terminus with 6xHis and expressed under the control of the <italic>MET25</italic> promoter. The <italic>RGC2</italic> coding sequence was amplified by PCR from genomic yeast DNA using primers that included XbaI and XhoI sites and cloned behind the <italic>MET25</italic> promoter in pUT36 (p2415) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000738-Millson1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> to yield pUT36-<italic>MET25<sup>P</sup></italic>-<italic>RGC2-HIS<sub>6</sub></italic> (p2501). His-tagged C-terminal truncations of Rgc2 were also expressed under the control the <italic>MET25</italic> promoter. The first 1260 base pairs (amino acids 1&#x02013;420) or 2160 base pairs (amino acids 1&#x02013;720) of <italic>RGC2</italic> were amplified from genomic DNA (wild-type strain EG123) by PCR using a forward primer that contained an XbaI site immediately 5&#x02032; to the start codon and reverse primers that introduced a 6xHis tag followed by a stop codon and an XhoI site. The two regions were inserted into pUT36, resulting in pUT36-<italic>MET25<sup>P</sup>-rgc2(1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>420)-His<sub>6</sub></italic> (p2808) and pUT36-<italic>MET25<sup>P</sup>-rgc2(1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>720)-His<sub>6</sub></italic> (p2809).</p><p>The <italic>RGC2</italic> coding sequence was tagged at its C-terminus with two tandem copies of GFP and expressed under the control of the <italic>MET25</italic> promoter in three steps. In the first step, the <italic>RGC2</italic> promoter and coding sequence (omitting the endogenous stop codon) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the Not1 and Sma1 sites of pRS315&#x0005b;<italic>GPF</italic>&#x0005d; (p1164) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000738-Rajavel1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> to yield pRS315-<italic>RGC2-GFP</italic> (p2478). In the second step, <italic>RGC2-GFP</italic> was amplified by PCR from p2478 and inserted in the same way into pRS315&#x0005b;<italic>GFP</italic>&#x0005d;, to yield <italic>RGC2-GFP<sub>2</sub></italic> (p2479). In the final step, the <italic>RGC2-GFP<sub>2</sub></italic> coding sequence only was amplified by PCR and inserted into pRS414-<italic>MET25<sup>P</sup></italic> (p976) using Spe1 and EcoRV sites designed into the primers. This yielded pRS414<italic>-MET25<sup>P</sup>-RGC2-GFP<sub>2</sub></italic> (p2481).</p><p>The <italic>RGC1</italic> gene with 800 bp of upstream sequence was amplified by PCR from genomic EG123 DNA and using a forward primer that introduced a NotI site and a reverse primer that introduced a SalI site and cloned into centromeric vector pRS313 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000738-Sikorski1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, yielding pRS313-<italic>RGC1</italic> (p2627). <italic>FPS1</italic> and <italic>RGC1/2</italic> constructs were validated by DNA sequence analysis and all were tested for functionality of these proteins by complementation of the cell lysis defects associated with an <italic>fps1</italic>&#x00394; mutant or an <italic>rgc1/2</italic>&#x00394; mutant, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Measurements of Zymolyase sensitivity, cell wall stress reporter assays, intracellular glycerol concentrations, and glycerol efflux</title><p>Zymolyase sensitivity was carried out as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000738-Newman1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.
