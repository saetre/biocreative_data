Laser treatment has been proven to reduce the risk of further loss of vision in patients with clinically significant macular edema but is less effective in restoring vision once it already has deteriorated. Moreover, laser treatment is an intrinsically destructive procedure that itself can lead to loss of vision through progressive enlargement of laser scars with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is an early event in the pathogenesis of DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). When local compensatory mechanisms are overcome, frank vasogenic macular edema develops. The anatomical correlate responsible for the BRB is the tight junction-associated proteins between retinal vascular endothelial cells (inner BRB) and retinal pigment epithelial cells (outer BRB). It is strongly suggested that the inner BRB (rather than the outer BRB) is the primary site of the vascular leak that results in diabetic macular edema in both human and animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In the retinas of rodents, the inner BRB has been shown to become permeable to high&#x02013;molecular weight molecules in as little as 2 weeks after induction of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A/vascular permeability factor is believed to mediate increased vascular permeability and colocalize with extravasated albumin in major retinal diseases such as DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). VEGF-A activates two tyrosine-kinase receptors, fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (FLT-1, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1), and fetal liver kinase-1 (FLK-1, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), which autophosphorylate to initiate a signaling cascade that results in increased microvascular permeability and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Inhibition of the VEGF-A overexpression is thus a potential treatment for DR and AMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) is an intermediate acting corticosteroid suspension. Intravitreal injections of TA (IVTA) have shown remarkable efficacy for the treatment of advanced DR, in particular diabetic macular edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). IVTA has been shown to inhibit VEGF-induced breakdown of the BRB in rabbit and leukostasis in rat models of DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In a 2-year, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, eyes with recalcitrant diabetic macular edema involving the fovea that were treated with IVTA had twice the chance of improving vision and half the risk of further loss. However, a high incidence of cataract and elevated intraocular pressure was found in IVTA-treated eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). If the unique beneficial effect of intravitreal steroid therapy on macular edema is to be distinguished from its high risk of local adverse events (glaucoma and cataract), the precise mechanism of action of TA needs to be elucidated. In this study, we determined the effect of IVTA on the expression of VEGF-A and its receptors in a rodent model of early DR.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals.</title><p>Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (aged 8&#x02013;10 weeks, ARC Laboratories, Perth, Australia), weighing 240&#x02013;250 g, were used in this study. The animals were cared for in accordance with The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research. All animals were housed with environmental enrichment with free access to food and water. Experimental procedures were conducted under aseptic conditions and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Sydney.</p></sec><sec><title>Induction of diabetes.</title><p>Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (STZ) (Sigma) in SD rats according to the published protocol with slight modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Rats were given a single dose of 65 mg/kg STZ i.p. in 100 mmol/l citrate buffer (pH 4.5); weight- and age-matched nondiabetic control rats received vehicle only. Eight animals were used per group for each set of experiments. After STZ injection, body weights were recorded daily, and diabetic status was confirmed by tail vein blood glucose estimation using an automated Accu-Chek glucometer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) after 48 h. Rats with nonfasting blood glucose levels &#x0003e;13.8 mmol/ml were deemed diabetic; those with lower values were excluded from this study.

For additional topical anesthesia, 0.4% benoxinate-HCl of eye drop was applied followed by 0.5% of levofloxacin ophthalmic solution to prevent infection. A single dose of 56 &#x003bc;g TA (Kenacort-A 40, Victoria, Australia) in a volume of 5.6 &#x003bc;l (10 mg/ml) was injected into the vitreous of the right eye with a 32-gauge microinjector (Hamilton, Reno, NV) under a dissecting microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The contralateral eye, which received an equal volume of saline, served as a sham-treated control.

By contrast, <italic>Flt-1</italic> expression was decreased in early diabetic retinas but was upregulated following IVTA treatment. A strong correlation of albumin leakage and retinal thickness with the expression of <italic>Vegf-a</italic> and its receptors was observed. These findings indicate that one likely mechanism of action of IVTA on diabetic macular edema is through the differential regulation of VEGF-A and its receptors.</p><p>VEGF-A is a major regulator of angiogenesis and vascular permeability in development and injury. The involvement of one of its receptors, FLK-1, in angiogenesis has been widely demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), but few studies have addressed its role as a mediator of the BRB permeability. Ojima et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) demonstrated that VEGF-induced FLK-1 phosphorylation and its downstream signaling cascade correlated with BRB breakdown and was inhibited by EphA2/ephrinA1 both in vitro and in vivo. In our study, the direct relationship between the expression of FLK-1 and the vascular permeability/breakdown of the BRB was further investigated in the diabetic retina. The overexpression of VEGF-A and FLK-1 that was found in the diabetic retina in this study, in association with increased albumin leakage, supports the hypothesis that FLK-1 is another important permeability factor and regulator of BRB dysfunction in diabetes. These data are consistent with a report that FLK-1 plays a critical role in breakdown of the brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>The expression of another VEGF receptor, FLT-1, was unexpectedly decreased in diabetic retinas and increased following IVTA treatment. This may be a result of competition between FLK-1 and FLT-1. FLT-1 on endothelial cells may function as a negative regulator of FLK-1, acting as a so-called &#x0201c;decoy&#x0201d; receptor that regulates the activity of VEGFs on vascular endothelium by sequestering VEGF-A and thus rendering it less available to bind to FLK-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). It is speculated that triggering of FLT-1 induces weak or undetectable ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in porcine aortic endothelial cells, whereas FLK-1 binding induces a strong response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Furthermore, VEGF-A mutants that bind selectively to FLK-1 are able to induce mitogenesis and chemotaxis in endothelial cells, and vascular permeability and angiogenesis in vivo, whereas VEGF-A mutants that selectively bind to FLT-1 do not have the activities stated above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In contrast to our finding, increased expression of <italic>Flt-1</italic> in the 6-month STZ-induced diabetic rat retinas was reported by Hammes et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). In their study, increased <italic>Flt-1</italic> mRNA levels detected by in situ hybridization were found in the ganglion cell and both nuclear layers of diabetic samples only. This apparent discrepancy may be explained by the different durations of diabetes studied.</p><p>Diabetic macular edema is consistently reduced after IVTA in human clinical trials, as is sensitively demonstrated by Optical Coherence Tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In this study, the reduction of VEGF-A levels by IVTA treatment that we observed is consistent with a reduction in levels of extravasated albumin from the retinal vessels. This provides strong evidence that anti-VEGF therapy is an effective strategy for diabetic BRB dysfunction. Indeed, a recent phase II study suggested that the VEGF-A inhibitor, pegaptanib sodium, may also be efficacious in the treatment of diabetic macular edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the clinically established beneficial effect of corticosteroids on diabetic macular edema and the restoration of the BRB. Firstly, corticosteroids may inhibit VEGF-A signaling by blocking cytokine production, inducing leukocyte apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), and, secondly, corticosteroids can directly induce the barrier properties of interendothelial tight junction complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). A recent study suggests that corticosteroids may have relatively rapid effects, such as a decrease in paracellular flux and an increase in transepithelial resistance, which correlates with an increase in tight junction immunoreactivity at the cell border. A concomitant decrease in occludin phosphorylation, potentially countering the effects of VEGF-A, has also been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Steroid treatment also appears to increase the expression of at least some tight junction-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p><p>By providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of action of intravitreal steroids on retinal disease, the results of this study may be used to refine their clinical use. In a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, IVTA treatment doubled the chance of vision improvement and halved the risk of further loss in eyes with advanced diabetic macular edema. However, there was a significant risk of local adverse events, with 55% of eyes requiring surgery to remove cataract over 2 years and 44% requiring eye drops to control elevated intraocular pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Anti-VEGF antibodies are another potential treatment for diabetic retinopathy. Ranibizumab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and pegaptanib sodium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) have already been approved in the U.S. for treatment of subretinal neovascularization; they are currently in advanced clinical development for diabetic retinopathy, and more specific VEGF inhibitors are in the pipeline. Presently, one of the disadvantages of these drugs is that they need to be injected every 4&#x02013;6 weeks, as compared with every 6 months for triamcinolone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, it is likely that longer-acting preparations will appear in due course. While VEGF inhibitors do not cause corticosteroid-associated side effects, they may confer an increased risk of systematic vascular adverse events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). There is also a suspicion that VEGF inhibitors may eventually cause retinal atrophy by blocking the cytokine's recently discovered neuroprotective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). On the other hand, an increase in systemic adverse events has not been detected in patients receiving intravitreal steroid therapy, and there is some evidence to suggest that steroids may have a protective effect on photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), which could potentially offset any neurotoxic effect it might have through inhibiting VEGF-A. How the known adverse events of steroids will balance against the as yet largely unknown safety profile of specific VEGF inhibitors is a subject that warrants careful clinical research in future, as does the issue as to whether a long-acting steroid combined with a specific VEGF inhibitor in low doses might deliver the safest and most efficacious clinical response.</p><p>The integrity of the BRB can be assessed by various techniques, each of which has advantages and limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Extravasated albumin has been demonstrated to be a precise indicator of the permeability of the blood-retinal and blood-brain barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). IPP is a sensitive image analysis system that has been used to quantify subtle changes in a number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). In this study, immunolocalization of extravasated albumin was identified at the light microscopic level and quantified using IPP, providing a useful technique with which to study the effect of IVTA on DR.</p><p>Rodent models do not mimic all aspects of human diabetes, but such models are essential for the development of new therapeutic approaches. While the short duration of diabetic injury in this model (3.5 weeks) imposes some limitations on the interpretation of the data, similar findings relating to the function of VEGF-A and its receptors on the BRB breakdown have also been observed in humans with diabetes, providing justification for our studies in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>).</p><p>This study adduces data that support the hypothesis that intravitreal corticosteroid treatment improves diabetic retinal edema by regulating the pathological expression of VEGF-A and its receptors. We also show that IVTA does not alter physiological VEGF-A, FLK-1, and FLT-1 levels in the normal retina. This raises the possibility that combination therapy of low-dose anti-VEGF drugs and steroids may offer advantages over anti-VEGF drugs alone for the treatment of DR that is resistant to conventional management.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>M.C.G. is included as an inventor on patents relating to the formulation of triamcinolone for ocular use and its use for the treatment of retinal neovascularization, but not macular edema.
