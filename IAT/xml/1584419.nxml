This property depends on nuclear import of the intracellular reverse transcription and pre-integration complexes (RTCs/PICs). To identify cellular factors involved in nuclear import of HIV-1 RTCs, cytosolic extracts were fractionated by chromatography and import activity examined by the nuclear import assay. A near-homogeneous fraction was obtained, which was active in inducing nuclear import of purified and labeled RTCs. The active fraction contained tRNAs, mostly with defective 3&#x02032; CCA ends.

Biochemical studies have indicated that infection of non-dividing cells depends on active nuclear import of the intracellular viral complex mediating reverse transcription and integration of the viral genome (hereafter called reverse transcription complex or RTC) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Several components of the HIV-1 RTC are implicated in its nuclear import, but little is known of the cellular pathways involved (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;). Although the identification of nuclear localizing signals (NLS) within the RTC seemed the most obvious step to understand HIV-1 nuclear import, several limitations of this approach have now become apparent. First, mutations of viral proteins may have pleiotropic effects or compromise virus viability, which confound phenotypic analysis. Second, multiple pathways may exist for nuclear import of HIV-1 RTCs, and deletion or mutation of one or more viral components may not result in a detectable phenotype. Third, cellular factors present in the RTC may also be involved &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Lastly, rapid virus uncoating may be critical to let the RTC become engaged with the cellular nuclear import machinery, since murine leukaemia virus (MLV) capsid protein, and presumably the presence of an intact core, has been shown to have a negative impact on infection of non-dividing cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We have developed a different experimental approach that primarily aims to identify the components of the cellular machinery responsible for nuclear import of HIV-1 RTCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. This approach is based on the use of purified RTCs as substrate in the nuclear import assay, which is well established in the nuclear import field and has been applied to study nuclear import of several viruses (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;). Briefly, cells are treated with digitonin to permeabilize selectively the plasma membrane, leaving intact the nuclear envelope. Cytosolic contents are washed out, and nuclear import is reconstituted by the addition of fluorescent-labelled purified RTCs, cytosolic extracts or purified transport receptors, the components of the Ran system, and an energy-regenerating system. Nuclear accumulation of the substrate is then analyzed by fluorescence microscopy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. This approach circumvents several of the problems listed above. First, it does not depend on mutations of viral proteins, and second, putative nuclear import components can be tested individually, thus multiple and potentially redundant import pathways can be identified and dissected.</p><p>Using this approach we have recently found that importin 7 (imp7) is implicated in nuclear import of HIV-1 RTCs and that siRNA-mediated depletion of imp7 inhibits HIV-1 infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. However, knock down of imp7 reduces HIV-1 infection by only a few fold, and it has been suggested that imp7 alone may not be sufficient for HIV-1 infection in primary macrophages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, which has led to the hypothesis that additional factors might be involved. To identify additional pathways for HIV-1 nuclear import, we have fractionated cytosolic extracts by ammonium sulphate (AS) precipitation and chromatography and followed RTC import activity using the nuclear import assay. The active fraction was purified to near-homogeneity, and surprisingly, it turned out to contain tRNAs. Such tRNAs induced HIV RTC nuclear import, were incorporated into virus particles, and accumulated into the nucleus on their own in an energy- and temperature-dependent way.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate whether there are other cellular factors, which in addition to imp7 and Ran can induce nuclear import of HIV-1 RTCs, we have fractionated high-speed cytosolic extracts (HSE) from HeLa cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d; by AS precipitation. Preliminary experiments showed that imp7 and other importins precipitated in 45&#x00025; AS and Ran precipitated in 60&#x00025; AS (unpublished data). We therefore subjected HSE to a 60&#x00025; AS precipitation step and tested the resulting pellet and supernatant in the nuclear import assay. Although imp7 and Ran were found in the 60&#x00025; AS pellet fraction only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), both pellet (60P) and supernatant (60S) from this precipitation step supported RTC nuclear import equally well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Incubating the 60P fraction with a low-substitution Phenyl-Sepharose column, a procedure that depletes all importins from HSE &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; resulted in the loss of imp7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) and RTC nuclear import activity from the 60P fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). These results showed that additional RTC nuclear import factors were present in HSE, which were not precipitated in 60&#x00025; AS and had properties distinct from imp7 and other importins.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Characterization of the 60S Fraction</title><p>The 60S fraction was further fractionated by chromatography. 60S was bound to a hydrophobic interaction column (HIC), eluted by a 60&#x00025; to 0&#x00025; AS gradient, dialysed extensively, and tested in the nuclear import assay. The fraction with RTC import ability eluted from the column at approximately 50&#x00025; AS (unpublished data). The active fraction from HIC was then loaded onto an ion exchange column and eluted with a 0 to 1M NaCl gradient. Six main fractions were obtained and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver stain, and by the nuclear import assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g002">2</xref>B). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, fraction E, which eluted from the column with 0.5 M NaCl, was the most active in inducing RTC nuclear import in permeabilized HeLa cells. Fraction D also had activity, but lower than fraction E. After silver stain of the protein gel, it became apparent that fraction E contained two main bands migrating at approximately 20 and 12 KDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Surprisingly, the two bands had an unusual brownish colour instead of the black typical of proteins visualized by silver stain. The brownish colour is seen with glycoproteins or lipoproteins, but all our attempts to detect glycans or lipid residues were unsuccessful. Upon closer inspection of the gel, we observed that fraction F contained a smear of the same colour, highly suggestive of nucleic acids, hence fraction E was digested with proteinase K or nuclease S7, and then analyzed by SDS or native PAGE. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, proteinase K digested a control protein (RNAseB), but had no effect at all on fraction E. On the other hand, nuclease S7 digested almost completely fraction E as well as the total RNA control. Thus fraction E contained nucleic acids.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>RNA Is the Active Component in the 60S</title><p>To find out if nucleic acids were DNA or RNA, the active fraction (this time obtained by 60&#x00025; AS precipitation and HIC chromatography) was digested by proteinase K and extracted by phenol/chloroform. The resulting sample (hereafter called 60S nucleic acids, 60S NA) was first treated with nuclease S7 or with DNAse-free RNAse, and the nucleic acids re-purified by treatment with proteinase K followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver stain. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, the 60S NA fraction contained a main band migrating with an apparent size of approximately 80 nt, in addition to smaller bands migrating around 40 to less than 20 nt. Both nuclease S7 and DNAse-free RNAse digested the 60S NA, suggesting that RNA was its component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The 60S fraction and the 60S NA treated with nucleases and re-purified as described earlier were also tested in the nuclear import assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, 60S induced strong RTC nuclear import in permeabilized primary human macrophages, the 60S NA fraction was also clearly active, albeit at reduced levels, whereas the nuclease-treated 60S NA fraction was inactive, similar to a control 21mer siRNA or total RNA. Moreover, the 60S NA prepared from Jurkat and SupT1 lymphocytic cells was also active in inducing RTC nuclear import, indicating that this activity was not limited to HeLa extracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040332-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). We further confirmed that the 60S NA contained small RNA molecules by 3&#x02032;-end radiolabelling of the samples with T4 RNA ligase and analysis by denaturing PAGE. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g003">Figure 3</xref>C shows the resulting radiolabelled bands ranging in size from approximately 100 to less than 20 nt.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The 60S NA Fraction Contains tRNA-Like Molecules</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g003">Figure 3</xref>C shows that the 60S NA contained several small RNAs, and we therefore attempted to isolate and clone the active species. The 60S NA fraction was size-fractionated by denaturing PAGE and visualized by SYBR gold staining. Each band was then cut, eluted from the gel and re-examined by denaturing PAGE to confirm its size and by the nuclear import assay to confirm its activity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, the nine main bands present in the 60S NA were correctly fractionated and eluted from the gel. The concentration of all samples was equalized prior to the nuclear import assay. Importantly, fraction 2, migrating with an approximate size of 80 nt, showed the highest RTC nuclear import activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Having isolated the most active fraction, we adapted a method described by Elbashir et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; to clone it. Briefly, an adaptor was ligated to the 3&#x02032; end of fraction 2, and the sample was gel purified. All our attempts to ligate a 5&#x02032;-end adaptor were unsuccessful, so the sample with the 3&#x02032;-end adaptor was used as a template for first strand cDNA synthesis, and this was followed by addition of a polyC tail to its 3&#x02032; end by terminal transferase. The template was then amplified by PCR (using proof-reading <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase), cloned, and sequenced.</p><p>Of more than 100 sequences examined, 31 distinct clones were obtained, and several of them were severely or partially truncated, presumably due to RT pausing at hypermodified nucleotides (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040332-t001">Table 1</xref>). A sequence alignment of the 31 clones indicated that they all belonged to the same family of small RNAs, and a BLAST search of the human genome database indicated that they were up to 97&#x00025; homologous to some human tRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040332-t001">Table 1</xref>). In particular, of 31 clones, 11 were highly homologous to tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>, six to tRNA<sup>Lys1,2</sup>, four to tRNA<sup>Glu</sup>, three to tRNA<sup>Val</sup>, and two to tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, and tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>. We could not find perfectly matching sequences in the human genome database, suggesting that these small RNAs did not represent a new class of tRNAs genes, and that small differences were most likely due to artefacts during reverse transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Remarkably, all clones except two (E1 and H1) lacked the complete 3&#x02032; CCA end typical of mature tRNAs. Moreover, compared to typical tRNAs, most clones had the 5&#x02032; end shortened by one or more nucleotides, with the exception of clone B3 that had a longer than normal 5&#x02032; end (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040332-t001">Table 1</xref>). Presumably this is due to RT pausing during first strand cDNA synthesis. The tRNAscan-SE search server (Washington University) predicted all our clones to fold into the typical tRNA cloverleaf secondary structure, with the exception of the truncated ones (unpublished data) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>To investigate which of these RNA molecules were able to support nuclear import of HIV-1 RTCs, we have selected 14 sequences from &#x0201c;full length&#x0201d; clones belonging to the three most abundant species, i.e., with homology to tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>, tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> and tRNA<sup>Lys1,2</sup> and transcribed them in vitro from a T7 promoter (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040332-t001">Table 1</xref>). Since T7 polymerase can add extra non-template nucleotides to the 3&#x02032; ends of transcripts, all T7 products were carefully purified in long denaturing gels using standards of known size, eluted, ethanol-precipitated, and used in the nuclear import assay to test their ability to induce RTC nuclear import. Of 14 RNAs analyzed, seven showed good import activity (A2, A3, B4, and G1&#x02013;G4), four had intermediate activity, and three had weak activity (A9, B1, and B2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). To better quantify import activity of the various RNA molecules, confocal images from six independent nuclear import experiments were analyzed by MetaMorph to calculate the mean fluorescent value per cell nucleus, an indirect measure of the efficiency of RTC nuclear import (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040332-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, all the RNA molecules with homology to tRNA<sup>Lys1,2</sup> were very active in inducing RTC nuclear import. However, only two RNAs with homology to tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> and one with homology to tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> showed a similar degree of activity. The RTC nuclear import activity of the G3 RNA was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with a probe spanning the HIV-1 vector genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040332-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). The G3 RNA was active in inducing HIV-1 RTC, but not MLV RTC nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040332-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Interestingly, wild-type tRNA<sup>Lys1,2</sup> had low nuclear import activity (the high standard deviation for tRNA<sup>Lys1,2</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g005">Figure 5</xref>B is due to nuclear import activity above background in one out of six experiments). This could also be due to rapid nuclear import and re-export of such tRNAs resulting in a &#x0201c;neutral&#x0201d; phenotype in our experimental conditions. The Ran mix was not required for tRNA-mediated nuclear import of RTCs (unpublished data).</p><p>To examine the specific activity of the RNA molecules transcribed in vitro, we estimated the amount of G2/G3 RNAs in the 60S NA fraction and in the HSE nucleic acids (NA) preparation by Northern blot and Phosphoimager analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g005">Figure 5</xref>C) (sequence similarity prevented us from distinguishing between G2 and G3 RNAs). A9 tRNA (tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>) was used as control for specific hybridization. The G2/G3 RNAs represented approximately 10&#x00025; of total small RNA loaded on the gel or 10 ng per 100 ng of 60S NA and HSE NA (these fractions contained different RNA species so no accurate value of their molarity could be obtained). Quantitative analysis of RTC nuclear import indicated that 10ng of G3 RNA (corresponding to 14nM) had a similar or higher activity than 100ng of 60S NA and HSE NA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Moreover, the amount of HSE sufficient to support RTC nuclear accumulation in permeabilized cells contained 80&#x02013;100 ng small RNA (unpublished data). Thus it appeared that synthetic and endogenous tRNAs were similarly active. Synthetic tRNAs lacked hypermodification, hence these results suggested that tRNA post-transcriptional modification may not be critical for nuclear import activity.</p><p>To investigate the specificity of tRNA-mediated RTC nuclear import, the M9 peptide fused to the maltose binding protein (MBP) was chosen as an alternative substrate. M9 is a nuclear import signal for hnRNP A1 recognised by transportin, and it was chosen because its mechanism of nuclear import is mainly Ran-independent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b025">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. MBP-M9 nuclear import was supported by transportin, but not by 60S NA, Fraction 2, and G3 and B2 RNAs added at a concentration sufficient for maximal activity with RTC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040332-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). Thus, these RNA molecules were specifically inducing RTC nuclear import.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>The T- and Anticodon Arms Are Required for Nuclear Import Activity</title><p>It was surprising to find that wild-type tRNA<sup>Lys1,2</sup> appeared to have little RTC nuclear import activity compared to our very homologous RNA molecules, and we wondered if the CCA end had any effect on this phenotype. A variant of the G2 clone was generated by PCR to make it identical to the wild-type tRNA<sup>Lys1,2</sup> except for the 3&#x02032; CCA end, then a CCA tail was specifically added to its 3&#x02032; end.

Taken together these results indicated that the bulk of the gel-purified RNAs contained the correct nucleotide additions.

Mutant clones were generated by PCR, confirmed by sequencing, transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase, purified as before, and examined in nuclear import assay experiments.

A deletion mutant lacking the D-arm (G3 AnC-T) lost some activity, a deletion mutant containing the D-arm only (G3 D) was almost completely inactive, and another deletion mutant containing the T-arm only (G3 T) (minus CCA end) had a dominant negative activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, panels G3 AnC-T, G3 D, and G3 T &#x0005b;bottom row&#x0005d;, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). The dose-dependent dominant negative effect of the G3 T mutant was confirmed in competition assays where more than 70&#x00025; inhibition of RTC import was achieved at a 1:1.3 ratio of G3 and mutant G3 T RNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040332-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). Addition of the full 3&#x02032; CCA end to the G3 T mutant resulted in partial loss of the dominant negative phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040332-sg006">Figure S6</xref>).

Furthermore, disruption of the T-stem secondary structure by point mutations (G3 C62G&#x0002b;A64C) reduced RTC nuclear import activity and disruption of the correct T-loop/D-loop pairing (G3 C56U) had a more severe inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g006">Figure 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040332-g006">6</xref>D).

Overall these results suggested that correct tRNA folding is important for RTC nuclear import activity together with the anticodon loop and the T-arm. The acceptor stem appeared not to be required, and the 3&#x02032; CCA end appeared to be inhibitory in the conditions tested.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Defective tRNAs Accumulate into the Nucleus on Their Own in an Energy- and Temperature-Dependent Way</title><p>We then investigated if these tRNAs species might induce RTC nuclear import by functioning like adaptors. In vitro synthesized tRNA molecules were directly labelled with the nucleic acids dye YOYO-1 after gel purification, dialysed, and tested in the nuclear import assay in the absence of RTCs.

These results further suggested that the T-arm plays an important role in nuclear accumulation of the tRNAs and that it is likely to be required for interaction with one or more cellular factors, which may be part of a nuclear import pathway. They also showed that nuclear accumulation of these tRNA species is strictly energy dependent. Moreover, G3 RNA efficiently accumulated into the nuclei only if nuclear import assays were carried out at 37 &#x000b0;C. If assays were carried out at 20 &#x000b0;C, a lower nuclear signal was observed, and G3 RNA mainly accumulated at the nuclear periphery.

Thus we investigated if the tRNAs with RTC nuclear import activity were also incorporated into HIV-1 particles. Large amounts of high-titer virus stocks were generated by transfecting 293T cells and were purified by two rounds of density sedimentation in sucrose gradients (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040332-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>).

Importantly, viral samples contained three distinct bands migrating at the level of cellular tRNAs.

Several lines of evidence support these conclusions. First, small RNAs isolated by chromatography from cytosolic extracts induced nuclear import of RTCs, and RNAse treatment of the samples eliminated import activity. Second, only one species of small RNAs had nuclear import activity following size fractionation of the active sample in denaturing gels, thus excluding a non-specific effect due to the presence of small RNA molecules in the import assay. Third, the same RNA molecules synthesized in vitro were active, and import activity could be mapped to the anticodon and T-arm regions. Importantly, the structural requirements were the same for nuclear import of RTCs and nuclear accumulation of the tRNAs on their own, making it unlikely that tRNAs were simply titrating out an inhibitor of RTC nuclear import. Lastly, tRNA species with HIV-1 RTC nuclear import activity were incorporated into and recovered from HIV-1 viral particles.</p><p>It is not completely clear at present how these tRNAs species may promote nuclear import of HIV-1 RTCs; nonetheless, some insight may be gained from the available data. The in vitro synthesized tRNAs efficiently accumulated into the nuclei of permeabilized cells in a strictly energy- and temperature-dependent way. A very similar temperature dependence was observed for tRNA nuclear export and is consistent with a carrier-mediated translocation mechanism &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, these tRNA species promoted nuclear import of the RTC, a complex too large to diffuse through nuclear pore complexes. Hence it is unlikely that tRNA accumulate in the nuclei by passive diffusion and selective nuclear retention. Overall, our results support the surprising possibility that at least some tRNA species may be actively uptaken into the nucleus of human cells. We note that both normal and CCA-less tRNAs have recently been reported to actively shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm in yeast cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. In our experimental conditions, RTC and tRNA nuclear accumulation was also reliant on structural features because point mutant tRNA molecules, in which the correct T-stem folding was disrupted, were found in the nuclei at reduced levels and had low RTC import activity. Furthermore, a minihelix made of the T-arm only had dominant negative activity. It is conceivable that the properly folded T-arm interacts with putative cellular factors important for nuclear import of the tRNAs whereas the anticodon arm may be more important for interaction with the RTC. This is supported by the fact that the highly homologous B1, B2, and B3 tRNAs were inactive in inducing RTC nuclear import, but B2 tRNA could still be efficiently imported into the nucleus on its own, suggesting a defect in RTC binding. On the other hand, B4 tRNA was clearly active in stimulating RTC nuclear import and differed from B1, B2, and B3 tRNAs in the anticodon loop. However, the anticodon itself is not sufficient to confer specific RTC binding since at least some tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>, tRNA<sup>Glu</sup>, and tRNA<sup>Lys1,2</sup> had RTC nuclear import ability. The very low nuclear import of MLV RTCs induced by G3 tRNA also suggests that specific interactions are required between some tRNAs and their RTC substrate.</p><p>In light of these observations, the simplest model to explain tRNA-mediated nuclear import of RTCs is based on multiple interactions between the anticodon arm and the viral complex on one hand and the T-arm and putative cellular factors promoting nuclear import on the other hand. Interestingly, the T-arm is also important in tRNA nuclear export since the same mutations in the T-stem-loop that we have tested also abolish interaction with exportin-t &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, the fact that the T-stem secondary structure requirements for RTC and tRNAs nuclear accumulation were the same argue against the possibility that these defective tRNAs titrate out an inhibitor of import.</p><p>tRNA maturation is a multistep process that, in vertebrates, takes place in the nucleus, and mature tRNAs are then exported into the cytoplasm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Export of tRNA by exportin-t, for example, requires the tRNA to be fully processed, providing a means to proofread tRNAs before they leave the nucleus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore it is not obvious why some tRNA species should be actively re-uptaken into the nucleus in human cells. One possibility could be that, given their relatively long half-life, some mature tRNAs are damaged in the cytoplasm by nucleases that remove one or more nucleotides from the 3&#x02032; CCA end. The resulting tRNAs cannot be aminoacylated, but may interfere with protein translation. This would then require the rapid removal of the defective tRNAs either by repairing the 3&#x02032; CCA end in the cytoplasm or by sequestering them into the nucleus where they might be repaired or degraded. There is evidence in yeast cells that tRNAs lacking the 3&#x02032; CCA end do accumulate and cause a growth defect if repairing enzymes are depleted from the cytosol &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, nuclear re-uptake of tRNAs with a defective CCA end would provide a quality control system in addition to nuclear export. An alternative way to explain preferential accumulation into the nucleus of tRNAs lacking the full 3&#x02032; CCA end might be that mature tRNAs are quickly imported and then re-exported in the cytoplasm in our assay. Moreover, in permeabilized cells, mature tRNAs may bind to cellular factors, which may retain them in the cytoplasm, making them unsuitable substrates for nuclear import. Interestingly, the G3 T mutant with a 3&#x02032; CCA end lost most of its dominant negative phenotype, suggesting that it might be sequestered by cellular factors different from those involved in nuclear import. Thus, on the basis of the present data, we cannot exclude that mature tRNAs are also actively imported into the nucleus of human cells. Future work will address this important aspect.</p><p>It is long recognized that cellular tRNAs are packaged into retroviral particles with a stoichiometry of 20 or more molecules per virion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d; and that some of them have defective 3&#x02032; ends &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. About 10&#x00025; of these tRNAs bind tightly to the viral genome and serve as primers for reverse transcription, but the role of the other, less tightly bound tRNAs is unknown. Remarkably, in several cases, virus incorporation of tRNAs is selective. For example, avian retroviruses preferentially package tRNA<sup>Trp</sup>, and MLV packages tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> and all lentiviruses in addition to mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV), Foamy viruses (FV) and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus preferentially package tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b043">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. tRNA incorporation into viral particles is mainly mediated by <italic>gag</italic> and reverse transcriptase, which is important for specific tRNA selection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b050">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040332-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;.

The threshold signal of the starting image is adjusted to select all objects of interest (overlaid red cells) in both control and test samples (thresholding). Next, the image is &#x0201c;segmented&#x0201d; so that areas in which the pixel intensities are above the threshold range (red nucleoli and nuclear envelope) will be marked in the image (segmenting). Finally, the software integrates the signal from the areas shown in the segmentation images only (now shown in bright green and present mainly in the nucleoli) and gives the total grey value. This value is divided by the total number of nuclei in the field to give the final reading.
