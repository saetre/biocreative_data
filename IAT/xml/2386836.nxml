Recombinant human VEGF<sub>165</sub> did not completely inhibit this apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of VEGF<sub>165</sub> increased resistance to anti-cancer drug-induced apoptosis, while an anti-VEGF<sub>165</sub>-neutralizing antibody did not completely block the resistance. We prepared plasmids encoding full-length <italic>vegf</italic> mRNA with mutation of signal sequence, <italic>vegf</italic> mRNAs lacking untranslated regions (UTRs), or mutated 5&#x02032;UTRs. Using these plasmids, we revealed that the 5&#x02032;UTR of <italic>vegf</italic> mRNA possessed anti-apoptotic activity. The 5&#x02032;UTR-mediated activity was not affected by a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. We established HCT116 clones stably expressing either the <italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032;UTR or the mutated 5&#x02032;UTR. The clones expressing the 5&#x02032;UTR, but not the mutated one, showed increased anchorage-independent growth in vitro and formed progressive tumors when implanted in athymic nude mice. Microarray and quantitative real-time PCR analyses indicated that the <italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032;UTR-expressing tumors had up-regulated anti-apoptotic genes, multidrug-resistant genes, and growth-promoting genes, while pro-apoptotic genes were down-regulated. Notably, expression of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) was markedly repressed in the 5&#x02032;UTR-expressing tumors, resulting in down-regulation of a STAT1-responsive cluster of genes (43 genes). As a result, the tumors did not respond to interferon (IFN)&#x003b1; therapy at all.

But sometimes cells acquire changes (mutations) in their genetic material that allow them to divide uncontrollably to form cancers&#x02014;disorganized masses of cells. When a cancer is small, it uses the body's existing blood supply to get the oxygen and nutrients it needs for its growth and survival. But, when it gets bigger, it has to develop its own blood supply. This process is called angiogenesis. It involves the release by the cancer cells of proteins called growth factors that bind to other proteins (receptors) on the surface of endothelial cells (the cells lining blood vessels). The receptors then send signals into the endothelial cells that tell them to make new blood vessels. One important angiogenic growth factor is &#x0201c;vascular endothelial growth factor&#x0201d; (VEGF). Tumors that make large amounts of VEGF tend to be more abnormal and more aggressive than those that make less VEGF. In addition, high levels of VEGF in the blood are often associated with poor responses to chemotherapy, drug regimens designed to kill cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Because VEGF is a key regulator of tumor development, several anti-VEGF therapies&#x02014;drugs that target VEGF and its receptors&#x02014;have been developed. These therapies strongly suppress the growth of tumor cells in the laboratory and in animals but, when used alone, are no better at increasing the survival times of patients with cancer than standard chemotherapy. Scientists are now looking for an explanation for this disappointing result. Like all proteins, cells make VEGF by &#x0201c;transcribing&#x0201d; its DNA blueprint into an mRNA copy (<italic>vegf</italic> mRNA), the coding region of which is &#x0201c;translated&#x0201d; into the VEGF protein. Other, &#x0201c;noncoding&#x0201d; regions of <italic>vegf</italic> mRNA control when and where VEGF is made. Scientists have recently discovered that the noncoding regions of some mRNAs suppress tumor development. In this study, therefore, the researchers investigate whether <italic>vegf</italic> mRNA has an unrecognized function in tumor cells that could explain the disappointing clinical results of anti-VEGF therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers first used a technique called small interfering (si) RNA knockdown to stop VEGF expression in human colon cancer cells growing in dishes. siRNAs are short RNAs that bind to and destroy specific mRNAs in cells, thereby preventing the translation of those mRNAs into proteins. The treatment of human colon cancer cells with <italic>vegf</italic>-targeting siRNAs made the cells more sensitive to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (a type of cell death). This sensitivity was only partly reversed by adding VEGF to the cells. By contrast, cancer cells engineered to make more <italic>vegf</italic> mRNA had increased resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Treatment of these cells with an antibody that inhibited VEGF function did not completely block this resistance. Together, these results suggest that both <italic>vegf</italic> mRNA and VEGF protein have anti-apoptotic effects. The researchers show that the anti-apoptotic activity of <italic>vegf</italic> mRNA requires a noncoding part of the mRNA called the 5&#x02032; UTR, and that whereas human colon cancer cells expressing this 5&#x02032; UTR form tumors in mice, cells expressing a mutated 5&#x02032; UTR do not. Finally, they report that the expression of several pro-apoptotic genes and of an anti-tumor pathway known as the interferon/STAT1 tumor suppression pathway is down-regulated in tumors that express the <italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032; UTR.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings suggest that some cancer cells have a survival system that is regulated by <italic>vegf</italic> mRNA and are the first to show that a 5&#x02032;UTR of mRNA can promote tumor growth. They indicate that VEGF and its mRNA work together to promote their development and to increase their resistance to chemotherapy drugs. They suggest that combining therapies that prevent the production of <italic>vegf</italic> mRNA (for example, siRNA-based gene silencing) with therapies that block the function of VEGF might improve survival times for patients whose tumors overexpress VEGF.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050094">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050094</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study is discussed further in a <italic>PLoS Medicine</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050110">Perspective by Hughes and Jones</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The US National Cancer Institute provides information about all aspects of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/understandingcancer">cancer</ext-link>, including information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/understandingcancer/angiogenesis">angiogenesis</ext-link>, and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/AvastinFactSheet">bevacizumab</ext-link>, an anti-VEGF therapeutic (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerquest.org">CancerQuest</ext-link>, from Emory University, provides information on all aspects of cancer, including <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerquest.org/index.cfm?page=189">angiogenesis</ext-link> (in several languages)</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=85">Cancer Research UK</ext-link> also provides basic information about what causes cancers and how they develop, grow, and spread, including information about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=99">angiogenesis</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia has pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor">VEGF</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA">siRNA</ext-link> (note that Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit; available in several languages)</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Masuda K, Teshima-Kondo S, Mukaijo M, Yamagishi N, Nishikawa Y, et al.

To eliminate the possibility that the L-VEGF proteins might induce the chemoresistance, we designed a mutated 5&#x02032;UTR construct that produced L-VEGF protein, but modified the RNA structure by substituting the nucleic acid sequence between nt 591 and nt 746 (construct X in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050094-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).

The mutation changed the secondary structure of several parts and ablated a stem-loop structure that is located in the functional region of the <italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032;UTR (nt 699 to nt 738) as described above. The mutated construct X produced L-VEGF protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050094-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B), but did not induce the resistance to 5-FU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050094-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). We also used a simply mutated 5&#x02032;UTR, in which the first CUG codon was substituted into a noninitiating UUU codon (construct XI in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050094-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050094-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;.

We further examined the effect of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX). To determine the inhibitory effect of CHX, HCT116 cells were transfected with plasmid encoding luciferase in the absence or presence of CHX, and luciferase activity was measured. Protein synthesis was blocked by 86 &#x000b1; 5&#x00025; (mean &#x000b1; SD, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3) and 94 &#x000b1; 3&#x00025; (mean &#x000b1; SD, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3) with 1 and 10 &#x003bc;g/ml CHX, respectively.

Both treatment of <italic>vegf</italic>-knockdown HCT116 cells with rhVEGF<sub>165</sub> and treatment of VEGF<sub>165</sub>-overexpressing HCT 116 cells with a neutralizing anti-VEGF<sub>165</sub> Ab suggest the presence of <italic>vegf</italic> mRNA-mediated anti-apoptotic action against anti-cancer drugs (5-FU, etoposide, and doxorubicin). We determined that the anti-apoptotic action resided in a 270-nt-long element between positions nt 475 and nt 745 of the 5&#x02032; UTR of <italic>vegf</italic> mRNA. The 5&#x02032; UTR could exert the anti-apoptotic action even in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor. These results suggest that the 5&#x02032;UTR may function as a regulatory RNA.</p><p>To further clarify the potential role of <italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032;UTR RNA, we established HCT116/<italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032; and HCT116/<italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032;mut clones. HCT116/<italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032; cells, but not HCT116/<italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032;mut cells, showed anchorage-independent growth in vitro and rapidly grew when implanted in athymic nude mice, indicating that <italic>vegf</italic> mRNA 5&#x02032;UTR facilitates tumor progression. The rapid growth observed in the <italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032;-tumors might be due to the acquisition of resistance to apoptosis (the process that eliminates defective cells), which contributes to tumor development and resistance to drug therapy. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that expression of pro-apoptotic genes (<italic>fas</italic>, <italic>pdcd1</italic>, <italic>nrg1</italic>, and <italic>bax</italic>) and an anti-apoptotic gene (<italic>mia</italic>) was up-regulated and markedly down-regulated, respectively, in the rapidly growing <italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032;-tumors. In addition, microarray analysis also showed that the expression of cell growth-promoting genes (<italic>cxcl1</italic>, <italic>cxcl2</italic>, <italic>cxcr4</italic>, <italic>mia1</italic>, and <italic>fgf-19</italic>) was up-regulated in the rapidly growing <italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032;-tumors.</p><p>The combination of both dysregulated cell proliferation and suppressed cell death are required for neoplastic progression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050094-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, survival and growth under anchorage-independent conditions are required for the progression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050094-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. This anchorage-independent property of tumor cells correlates with their in vivo oncogenic potential. Thus, we consider that the <italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032;UTR may increase the ability not only to suppress apoptosis but also to survive and grow in an anchorage-independent manner, resulting in the acceleration of tumor formation.</p><p>The precise sequence and structure of the 5&#x02032;UTR of <italic>vegf</italic> mRNA as well as the molecular target(s) that interact with the RNA remain to be elucidated. However, it seems likely that such a profound change in cell function induced by RNA would require a global change of gene expression in cells. Our results support this notion by showing that the <italic>vegf</italic> mRNA 5&#x02032;UTR modulated expression of numerous genes. One of the striking findings is that many of the down-regulated genes belong to a set of IFN-inducible genes, including <italic>stat1</italic>.</p><p>Since it is reported that IFN down-regulates IRES-dependent translation of distinct mRNAs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050094-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;, overexpression of the IRES-containing 5&#x02032;UTR might attenuate the IFN signal, leading to the down-regulation of IFN-inducible genes. We therefore tested whether IFN&#x003b1; affected IRES activity of <italic>c-myc</italic>, <italic>fgf-2</italic>, or <italic>bip</italic> using a bicistronic luciferase assay system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050094-sg007">Figure S7</xref>A) in our experimental conditions, and found that IFN&#x003b1; did not modify at least these IRES activities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050094-sg007">Figure S7</xref>C). At the same time, we also confirmed that IFN&#x003b1; signaling, estimated using the ISRE-dependent transcription reporter assay, was not inhibited in the cells overexpressing <italic>bip</italic>, <italic>c-myc</italic>, or <italic>fgf-2</italic> 5&#x02032;UTR, nor was it inhibited in the cells overexpressing the <italic>pdgf-b</italic> 5&#x02032;UTR that have no IRES activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050094-sg007">Figure S7</xref>D). Although these results suggest that the suppression of IFN signaling may be specific for the <italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032;UTR, further studies are needed to clarify the molecular mechanism for the suppression.</p><p>The IFNs/STAT1 signal is one of the key pathways for tumor suppression. Mice with a targeted deletion of the STAT1 or IFN&#x003b3; receptor develop chemically induced or spontaneous tumors more rapidly than wild-type mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050094-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.

In contrast, the reconstitution of STAT1 suppressed the tumorigenicity of STAT1-deficient tumor cells in vivo, demonstrating that STAT1 acts as an important tumor suppressor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050094-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Indeed, the majority of cancer cell lines and primary tumors are resistant to IFNs, often through inhibition of STAT1 expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050094-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050094-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. We propose here that the <italic>vegf</italic> mRNA 5&#x02032;UTR negatively regulates expression of STAT1, leading to suppression of STAT1-dependent transcriptional activities. It has been suggested that STAT1 directly regulates DNA damage-induced apoptosis by transcriptional activation of apoptosis modulating genes, such as TRAIL, Fas, and XAF-1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050094-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, all of which were down-regulated in the <italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032;-tumors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0050094-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the suppression of STAT1 may be crucial for malignant transformation of HCT116/<italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032; cells. In fact, the <italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032;-tumors did not response to IFN&#x003b1; therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050094-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Tumor cell growth and survival may require both expression of VEGF and down-regulation of the IFN pathway.

Our preliminary data suggest that the <italic>vegf</italic> 5&#x02032;UTR might interact with PKR and lead to suppression of PKR-mediated apoptotic pathway. However, this is still an unproven hypothesis, and further experiments are being carried out in our laboratory.</p><p>Recent studies have revealed that a large number of non-coding RNAs play a critical role in tumorigenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050094-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.
