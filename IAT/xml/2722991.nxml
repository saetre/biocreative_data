In mammalian cells, mTOR is part of two different kinase complexes: mTORC1 composed of mTOR, raptor and mLST8, and mTORC2 containing mTOR, rictor, sin1 and mLST8. Whereas, mTORC1 is known to be a pivotal regulator of cell size and cell cycle control, the question whether the recently discovered mTORC2 complex is involved in these processes remains elusive. We report here that the mTORC1-mediated consequences on cell cycle and cell size are separable and do not involve effects on mTORC2 activity. However, we show that mTORC2 itself is a potent regulator of mammalian cell size and cell cycle via a mechanism involving the Akt/TSC2/Rheb cascade. Our data are of relevance for the understanding of the molecular development of the many human diseases caused by deregulation of upstream and downstream effectors of mTOR.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) is the central player within a signalling cascade regulating a wide variety of different cellular functions. In mammalian cells two structurally and functionally distinct mTOR-containing complexes have been identified. mTORC1 (also known as the mTOR/raptor complex) contains raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR) and mLST8 (also known as G&#x003b2;L). Whereas the function of mLST8 is not really clarified, raptor regulates mTORC1 functioning as a scaffold for recruiting mTORC1 substrates. The major substrates of mTORC1 known so far are 4EBP1 (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein-1) and p70S6K (ribosomal p70S6 kinase), both regulators of mRNA translation. mTORC1 phosphorylates and activates p70S6K at T389 to activate the ribosomal protein S6 via phosphorylation at S240/244 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C2">2</xref>).</p><p>The only recently discovered kinase complex mTORC2 (mTOR/rictor complex) also contains the mLST8 protein, but is marked by the rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), sin1 (stress-activated protein kinase-interacting protein) and protor subunits in place of raptor. Rictor and sin1 appear to stabilize each other through binding, building the structural foundation for mTORC2. mTORC2 phosphorylates the oncogenic kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B) at S473. Downstream of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1) phosphorylates Akt at T308, what in conjunction with the mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of Akt drives full activation of this kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C4">4</xref>). Over 100 putative Akt substrates have been reported, although only a few of them meet the criteria suggested for the definition of a bonafide Akt substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C5">5</xref>).</p><p>Akt phosphorylates and blocks the inhibitory effects of the complex of the two tuberous sclerosis gene products TSC1/TSC2 towards Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain), which is a potent regulator of mTORC1. In addition, PRAS40 (proline-rich Akt substrate 40 kDa) is phosphorylated by Akt at T246 releasing its inhibitory effects on mTORC1. In summary, Akt stimulates mTORC1 signalling by inhibiting the function of tuberin and PRAS40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C6">6</xref>).</p><p>The growth of an organ or a whole organism is regulated by a coordinated increase in cell number and in cell size. To remain constant during proliferative conditions, both DNA content and cell mass must double in the course of each cell division cycle. Accordingly, although separable, cell cycle progression and cell growth (increase in cell size and cell mass) are coordinated. In 2002 and 2004, Fingar <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C8">8</xref>) published their pioneering work showing that mTOR controls mammalian cell size and cell cycle progression via its downstream targets p70S6K and 4EBP1. Since these studies were performed before the discovery of two mTOR-containing kinase complexes with different functions and using the inhibitor rapamycin to block mTORC1 activity, two major questions must be answered to clarify mTOR's role in cell cycle and cell size control: (i) Is the regulation of mTORC2 an essential component for mTORC1-mediated cell cycle and/or cell size control? (ii) Is mTORC2 itself capable of regulating mammalian cell cycle and/or cell size?</p><p>Making use of non-transformed, non-immortalized primary human fibroblasts we found that (i) the mTORC1-mediated consequences on cell cycle and cell size are separable and do not involve effects on mTORC2 activity; (ii) In addition, we report here for the first time that mTORC2 is a potent regulator of mammalian cell size and cell cycle via a mechanism involving Akt/TSC2/Rheb.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Rapamycin-mediated effects on mTORC1 on cell cycle and cell size are separable and do not involve effects on mTORC2 activity</title><p>Many of the signalling components of the mTOR cascade are frequently deregulated in a wide variety of cancers and other human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C9">9</xref>). Accordingly, it is not surprising that the regulation of mTOR was reported to be different depending on the transformation status of the used cell system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C10">10</xref>). Another problem of many mTOR studies is that they have been performed with ectopically overexpressed components of the mTOR cascade or using <italic>in vitro</italic> assay systems. All experiments presented in this report have been performed using primary, non-transformed, non-immortalized, diploid human IMR-90 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C11">11</xref>) studying endogenous proteins. Modulation of endogenous activities has exclusively been obtained either via the widely used mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin or via specific short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Endogenous mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities have been studied by analysing their endogenous functional readouts phospho-T389 p70S6K and phospho-S473 Akt, respectively.</p><p>First, we determined the optimal concentration of rapamycin to block mTORC1 in our cell system. Titration experiments revealed that low rapamycin concentrations blocked mTORC1 but also induced endogenous Akt S473 phosphorylation. The latter phenomenon, which we observed in several experiments in the study performed here (see below), is very likely owing to the well known earlier described mTORC1-induced feedback mechanism involving the inhibiting phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 via p70S6K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C4">4</xref>). For the experiments in this study we decided to use 100 n<sc>m</sc>, because at this concentration mTORC1 is efficiently blocked and rapamycin mediates its well-known cell cycle effects with only minor effects on Akt phosphorylation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F1">1</xref>A&#x02013;C).</p><fig id="DDP271F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>mTORC1-mediated consequences on cell cycle and cell size are separable and do not involve effects on mTORC2 activity.

Cells treated with non-targeting siRNAs (control) or cells which were left entirely untreated were analysed in parallel. About 72 h after initial transfection, lysates were prepared and analysed for indicated proteins via immunoblotting. (<bold>N</bold>) Experiments were basically performed as described in (M) with the exception that cells were treated with 100 n<sc>m</sc> rapamycin or DMSO for the final 24 h of incubation. So treated cells were lysed and examined for the expression level of rictor, S473 phosphorylated Akt, total Akt, T389 phosphorylated p70S6K and total p70S6K.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ddp27101"/></fig><p>At this concentration rapamycin triggered a very efficient block of mTORC1 activity (detected by downregulation of phospho-T389 p70S6K and by faster migration of p70S6K protein) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F1">1</xref>A and F), but was without such effects on mTORC2 activity (compare phospho-S473 Akt levels and Akt protein migration) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F1">1</xref>A, C and F), strongly decreased the amount of S-phase cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F1">1</xref>B and G; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and reduced cell size demonstrated by a shift detected on Forward scatter (FSC) histograms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F1">1</xref>D and H; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Here, it is important to note that whenever such a cell size phenotype is detected, two questions must be answered. (i) Does the cell size reduction occur in all cell cycle phases? (ii) Is the observed cell size reduction really a result of altered cell growth or just of an altered rate of cell cycle progression? To allow investigation of the first question DNA was stained and two-dimensional contour blot analyses of FSC versus DNA content were performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C12">12</xref>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F1">1</xref>E and I). Furthermore, from the cell populations analysed in the two-dimensional contour blots, G0/G1 cells (2 N) and G2/M cells (4 N) have been selectively gated and analysed via FSC histograms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F1">1</xref>E, upper right panel), FSC mean values (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F1">1</xref>E, lower right panel) and the % of the gated cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F1">1</xref>E, under the lower right panel) are presented. These data demonstrate that rapamycin's effects on cell size regulation are independent of the cell cycle. In addition, it is proven that the two-dimensional contour blot analyses used in this study provide a suitable approach to study cell size effects over the cell cycle. With regard to the second question one has to consider that FSC analyses of cells cultivated under low proliferation conditions also suggest decreased cell size. However, in these cases the decreased FSC is because of an increased amount of G0/G1 cells within the cell population rather than to real cell size reduction. To clarify this issue we cultivated IMR-90 cells under low proliferation conditions without refreshing the growth medium for 48 h. Two-dimensional contour blot cell size analyses revealed that low proliferation conditions only increased the amount of G0/G1 cells without any effects on cell size, whereas rapamycin triggers a real size reduction of cells in all cell cycle phases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F1">1</xref>I).</p><p>To further investigate the kinetics of rapamycin's effects on cell size and cell cycle progression, we performed a time-course experiment. Whereas diminished mTORC1 activity (phospho-T389 p70S6K) occurred already after half an hour and the effects on cell size (FSC) started already early being good visible after 8 h, the effects on cell cycle regulation (detected by decreasing cyclin A and cyclin D1 protein levels and by % S-phase cells) were hardly detectable before 24 h. Interestingly, in this experiment no negative effects on the phosphorylation of Akt S473 were detected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F1">1</xref>J&#x02013;L).</p><p>In this study, we performed the widely used analyses of endogenous phosphorylated Akt S473 as functional readout for mTORC2 activity. Especially for the here presented study, important reasons for the usage of this approach instead of <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays exist. (i) We wanted to really study the endogenous activites in primary non-immortalized non-transformed cells. (ii) Since it is known that the intracellular localization of both, p70S6K and Akt, is regulated, one cannot expect the <italic>in vitro</italic> usage of ectopic p70S6K and Akt as substrates to really reflect the <italic>in vivo</italic> endogenous availability of these substrates. (iii) Since it could be that the availability of both, p70S6K and Akt, is regulated throughout the cell cycle, one cannot expect the <italic>in vitro</italic> usage of constitutive ectopic p70S6K and Akt as substrates to really reflect the <italic>in vivo</italic> endogenous availability of these substrates in all the cell cycle experiments. We performed additional experiments to prove that analysing endogenous phosphorylated Akt really reflects endogenous mTORC2 activity under our experimental conditions in the cell system used here. Compared with both non-treated cells and cells transfected with non-targeting siRNAs, siRNAs specific for the mTORC2 component rictor trigger downregulation of endogenous Akt S473 phosphorylation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F1">1</xref>M). This is even true in cells, in which mTORC1 activity has been blocked via rapamycin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F1">1</xref>N). These findings demonstrate that analysing endogenous levels of Akt S473 phosphorylation reflects a reliable and specific approach to study endogenous mTORC2 activity in our cells.</p><p>Taken together, these data demonstrate that blocking mTORC1 mediates cell size reduction in the cells of all cell cycle phases and affects cell cycle regulation separable from its cell size effects. Most importantly, all that occurs without downregulation of mTORC2-mediated Akt S473 phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Blocking mTORC1 activity delays S-phase induction with smaller G1 cells entering S but without effects on mTORC2 activity</title><p>Cell growth in size is a requirement for cell proliferation, as cells must double in size before dividing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C14">14</xref>). From the data obtained so far three questions arose: (i) Does blocking of mTORC1 delay S-phase induction in primary non-transformed, non-immortalized human cells? (ii) Is mTORC2 activity affected at any time point during the transition of rapamycin-treated G1 cells into S phase? (iii) Do such cells with blocked mTORC1 activity pass the G1&#x02013;S phase transition to start replication at smaller size?</p><p>To investigate these issues, IMR-90 cells were serum arrested and restimulated with and without rapamycin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F2">2</xref>A). The discovery that mTOR exists in two structurally and functionally distinct kinase complexes and the observation that under certain circumstances a rapamycin-mediated block of mTORC1 is accompanied by effects on mTORC2-mediated Akt phosphorylation (depending on the transformation status of the analysed cell) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C11">11</xref>) made it essential to also investigate the role of mTORC2. Western blot analyses studying the restimulated cells described above revealed that the rapamycin-triggered block of mTORC1-mediated p70S6K T389 phosphorylation leads to delayed S-phase induction without any effects on mTORC2-mediated Akt S473 phosphorylation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F2">2</xref>B and C).</p><fig id="DDP271F2" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2.</label><caption><p>Blocking mTORC1 activity delays S-phase induction without effects on mTORC2 activity.

The major function of mTORC2 is to phosphorylate and thereby activate Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C4">4</xref>). So far, although many putative Akt substrates have been reported, only very few of them meet all the criteria, which have been defined to be necessary to characterize a bonafide Akt substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C5">5</xref>). Since mTORC1 is very well known to be a pivotal regulator of both, cell cycle and cell size control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C1">1</xref>), Akt substrates, which are involved in mTORC1 regulation were of special interest.</p><p>One Akt substrate playing a major role in mTORC1 regulation is TSC2 (tuberin). TSC2 (in a complex with TSC1) is phosphorylated by Akt on S939 and T1462 and this phosphorylation inhibits its ability to act as a GTPase-activating protein against Rheb, which in turn regulates mTORC1's potential to activate p70S6K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C20">20</xref>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F5">5</xref>A). Accordingly, one could speculate that blocking mTORC2 activity could trigger downregulation of mTORC1 via activation of TSC2. In agreement with this model we found that modulation of mTORC2 via rictor-specific siRNAs really, as a consequence, triggers downregulation of mTORC1 activity in primary human cells (Figs&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F1">1</xref>M, N, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F4">4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F5">5</xref>B). To clarify the role of this pathway for mTORC2-mediated cell size and cell cycle regulation, we first wanted to investigate the effects of rictor-specific siRNA treatment in cells with knockdown of TSC2. Knockdown of TSC2 indeed reactivated mTORC1 activity (represented by endogenous phospho-T389 p70S6K levels), but not mTORC2 activity (endogenous phospho-S473 Akt levels), in cells treated with rictor-specific siRNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F5">5</xref>B). These results prove that the effects of downregulated mTORC2 activity on mTORC1 are indeed mediated via the TSC2-involving cascade. And strikingly, both mTORC2-mediated effects on cell cycle (DNA analyses and investigation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27) and cell size were significantly diminished upon TSC2 knockdown (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F5">5</xref>C&#x02013;F; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence that in mammalian cells mTORC2 controls both, cell cycle progression and cell size, via its potential to regulate TSC2.</p><fig id="DDP271F5" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;5.</label><caption><p>mTORC2 regulates cell size and cell cycle via a mechanism involving TSC2.

Both, PI3K and mTORC2 (mTOR/rictor) are necessary to drive full activation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt, which in turn negatively regulates PRAS40 and the TSC1/2 complex to activate mTORC1 (mTOR/raptor) known to exert positive effects on cell size regulation via its effector S6K. (B&#x02013;F) Logarithmically growing IMR-90 fibroblasts were either transfected with rictor siRNA alone or were co-transfected with siRNAs targeting rictor and PRAS40 or rictor and TSC2. Non-targeting siRNA (control) was analysed in parallel. Sixty hours post transfection, cells were replated into fresh growth medium and incubated for additional 20 h.

PRAS40 is another Akt substrate being involved in mTORC1 regulation. PRAS40 was identified as a raptor-binding protein, which does not interact with mTORC2. It is also phosphorylated directly by mTORC1, but not mTORC2, predominantly at S183. Akt-mediated phosphorylation of PRAS40 at T246 prevents its inhibition of mTORC1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F5">5</xref>A). Importantly, PRAS40 regulates mTORC1 via a totally different mechanism compared with TSC2. PRAS40 functions as a direct inhibitor of mTORC1 substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C26">26</xref>). Accordingly, in a cell in which mTORC1 kinase activity is downregulated via the mTORC2/Akt/TSC2/Rheb cascade (presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F5">5</xref>A), one would not expect knockdown of PRAS40 to reactivate mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389. Knockdown of PRAS40 might increase mTORC1's potential to bind to its substrates but would not reactivate mTORC1-mediated p70S6K phosphorylation in a cell, in which rictor-specific siRNA treatment triggers downregulation of mTORC2-mediated Akt activity and activation of TSC2 to block mTORC1's kinase activity. In agreement with this notion, we found knockdown of PRAS40 not be able to reactivate mTORC1-induced T389 p70S6K phosphorylation in cells treated with rictor-specific siRNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F5">5</xref>B). Our findings that modulating PRAS40 was without consequences for mTORC2-dependent effects on cell cycle and cell size regulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F5">5</xref>C, E and F), additionally support the here suggested model of mTORC2 controlling both, cell cycle progression and cell size, by regulating TSC2.</p><p>Our data presented so far provide strong evidence that mTORC2 affects cell cycle and cell size regulation via modulating the potential of TSC2 to regulate mTORC1. This potential of TSC2 is mediated via Rheb (compare also Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F5">5</xref><italic>A</italic>). Our findings suggest that knockdown of endogenous mTORC2 activity via rictor siRNAs allows TSC2 to efficiently block Rheb's activity to control mTORC1. In line with this assumption, TSC2 should not be able to revert the effects of rictor siRNA treatment on cell size in a Rheb-negative (-diminished) background. First, transfection experiments proved that the activating effects of TSC2-specific siRNAs on p70S6K activity depend on functional Rheb (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F6">6</xref><italic>A</italic>). Furthermore, we observed again that TSC2 siRNA treatment counteracts the negative effects of rictor-specific knockdown on cell size regulation.

Accordingly, studies have been performed before the discovery that mTOR is also part of a second kinase complex named mTORC2. In addition, in many of the underlying experiments mTOR activity has been modulated via rapamycin (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C8">8</xref>). Although originally believed to exclusively block mTORC1, rapamycin has been shown to also affect mTORC2 activity at least under specific experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C11">11</xref>). Accordingly, with regard to mTOR's role in cell size and cell cycle control in mammalian cells, two major question remained elusive: (i) Is the regulation of mTORC2 essentially involved in mTORC1-mediated cell cycle and/or cell size control? (ii) Is mTORC2 itself capable of regulating mammalian cell cycle and/or cell size?</p><p>To answer these questions we felt it to be essential to use an optimal biological cell system. In the past, many data on mTOR regulation were obtained from ectopic overexpression experiments in transformed cells or using <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays. Varying results on mTOR regulation have been reported in many different immortalized or transformed cell lines, what is mainly because of the fact that a wide variety of upstream regulators of mTOR are deregulated in many different types of diseases and tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C27">27</xref>). All experiments presented in this study have been performed using non-transformed, non-immortalized primary human diploid IMR-90 fibroblasts harboring a finite lifetime and a normal karyotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C11">11</xref>). In addition, with the exception of ectopic expression of myristoylated Akt no overexpression experiment is included, but we exclusively modulated endogenous activities.</p><p>It was already reported earlier that mTORC1's effects on cell cycle and cell size are separable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C8">8</xref>). We have confirmed and expanded this knowledge: (i) The approach of two-dimensional contour blot analyses of FSC versus DNA content allowed the demonstration that blocking endogenous mTORC1 via rapamycin reduces the size of cells in all cell cycle phases. (ii) Identical results were obtained in cells, in which endogenous mTORC1 was diminished via raptor-specific siRNAs. (iii) Rapamycin time-course experiments revealed that the effects of downregulated mTORC1 on cell size occur far before the cell cycle deregulation. (iv) Re-stimulation experiments with and without rapamycin showed that blocking mTORC1 activity delays S-phase induction with smaller G1 cells starting to replicate.</p><p>Four independent experimental data support our conclusion that mTORC1-mediated cell cycle regulation does not need to involve effects on mTORC2 activity. (i) Rapamycin treatment of logarithmically growing cells triggers accumulation of G0/G1 cells accompanied by a downregulation of the amount of S-phase cells without effects on endogenous mTORC2 activity. (ii) A rapamycin time-course experiment revealed that after 24 h blocking mTORC1 activity cyclin A levels, cyclin D1 levels and % S-phase cells decreased, but no effects could be detected on mTORC2 activity. (iii) Serum re-stimulation approaches revealed that a rapamycin-mediated block of mTORC1 significantly delays S-phase entry without any effects on mTORC2 activity. (iv) Downregulation of endogenous mTORC1 activity via raptor-specific siRNAs in logarithmically growing cells also triggered accumulation of G0/G1 without negatively affecting mTORC2. That mTORC2 deregulation is also not playing an essential role for mTORC1-triggered cell size control was demonstrated (i) by showing that rapamycin triggers size reduction in all cell cycle phases of cycling cells without affecting mTORC2; (ii) by obtaining the same results upon blocking of mTORC1 via raptor-specific siRNAs; (iii) by detecting deregulated cell size control in a rapamycin time-course experiment without effects on endogenous mTORC2 activity; (iv) by demonstrating that rapamycin-treated cells enter the replicative phase at smaller size but do not exhibit any modulation of endogenous mTORC2 activity. In summary, these findings allow the conclusion that in mammalian cells mTORC1 can regulate cell cycle progression and cell size control independent of any effects on endogenous mTORC2 activity.</p><p>Next, we found that downregulating endogenous mTORC2 activity via rictor-specific siRNAs causes an accumulation of G0/G1 cells accompanied by a decrease of S-phase cells. Our here obtained data using primary non-transformed, non-immortalized human fibroblasts are in perfect agreement with a recent study reporting the same cell cycle phenotype upon knockdown of rictor in the MCF7 breast cancer and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C28">28</xref>), suggesting that this potential of mTORC2 might be independent of the transformation status of the cell. Still, that mTORC2 itself is involved in tumor development is suggested by the recent finding that many gliomas overexpress rictor accompanied with elevated mTORC2 activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C29">29</xref>).</p><p>Drosophila mutants removing the critical TORC2 components, rictor and sin1, showed minor growth impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C30">30</xref>). The aspect whether mTORC2 is involved in mammalian cell size regulation remained elusive so far. We report here that siRNA-induced knockdown of endogenous mTORC2 activity triggers strong effects on cell size regulation of non-transformed primary human cells. Several independent experiments revealed that rictor-siRNA-mediated size reduction to be comparable to the effects of a raptor-specific knockdown. Two-dimensional contour blot analyses of FSC versus DNA content demonstrated that mTORC2-mediated cell size regulation is not a consequence of its effects on cell cycle progression described above. We found that knockdown of rictor to trigger a size reduction in all cell cycle phases very comparable to the effects of raptor-specific siRNAs. Accordingly, we conclude mTORC2 to be a potent cell size regulator and to be able to control cell size of cells in all phases of the mammalian cell cycle.</p><p>mTORC2 is a major regulator of Akt kinase activity. One Akt substrate that has been reported to be a pivotal regulator of mammalian cell cycle and cell size is the tuberous sclerosis gene product TSC2. Akt is known to regulate growth by directly phosphorylating TSC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C20">20</xref>). To investigate whether TSC2 is essentially involved in the mTORC2-mediated cell cycle and/or cell size regulation, we analysed the effects of TSC2-specific siRNA treatment on the rictor-siRNA-induced deregulations described above. Several independent experiments revealed that the rictor-siRNA-triggered accumulation of G0/G1 cells heavily depends on the endogenous levels of TSC2. The same was found to be true for the effects of rictor knockdown on the size of cells in all different cell cycle phases.</p><p>In the past, different observations were reported regarding the question whether mTORC2 affects the mTORC1-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K. Very likely, owing to the usage of different approaches to modulate mTORC2 and of different transformed immortalized cells, modulating mTORC2 was described to be either without any effects on p70S6K phosphorylation, or to trigger its up- or downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C33">33</xref>). However, whenever we downregulated endogenous mTORC2 activity via rictor-specific siRNAs in non-transformed, non-immortalized primary human cells, we observed a very pronounced downregulation of endogenous mTORC1-mediated p70S6K phosphorylation on T389. This is one observation that provides evidence for the mTORC1/p70S6K cascade to be involved mTORC2-induced cell size and cell cycle regulation. As discussed above, we proved TSC2 to be of essential relevance for these mTORC2-dependent regulations and TSC2 is very well known to exert its cell size effects via regulation of mTORC1/p70S6K. Knockdown of TSC2 reverted the cell cycle and cell size effects of rictor-specific siRNAs accompanied with a reactivation of endogenous T389 p70S6K phosphorylation. In addition, this finding shows that the effects of downregulated mTORC2 activity on mTORC1 are indeed mediated via the TSC2-involving cascade. Knockdown of PRAS40 could not reactivate p70S6K phosphorylation and also did not have any influence on the mTORC2-triggered cell size and cell cycle effects.</p><p>All these findings provide strong evidence that mTORC2 affects cell size regulation via modulating the potential of TSC2 to regulate mTORC1. This potential of TSC2 is known to be mediated via Rheb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C4">4</xref>). We found that TSC2's potential to counteract mTORC2-mediated cell size control indeed depends on functional Rheb. Taken together with our here reported observation that downregulation of mTORC2 via rictor siRNAs cannot control mammalian cell size in cells harboring constitutive Akt kinase activity, these findings allow the conclusion that mTORC2 is a potent regulator of mammalian cell size via a mechanism involving the Akt/TSC2/Rheb cascade.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>IMR-90 (ATCC no.

A total of 1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> to 3&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells per sample (in case of DNA transfections 1&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> to 1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> GFP-spectrin-positive cells per sample) were collected in linear amplification mode and analysed on a Beckton Dickinson FACScan using CELLQUEST and MODFIT software. Cell size analyses via FSC were basically performed in two different ways as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C12">12</xref>): overall cell size distribution, regardless of the different cell cycle phases, was investigated via one-dimensional FSC histograms. To enable direct comparison of different samples, overlays of FSC histograms were performed. In addition, mean FSC values, representing the average FSC distribution of the analysed cell pool, were obtained using CELLQUEST histogram statistical tools. Cell size distribution according to the different cell cycle phases was analysed via two-dimensional, so called contour blots of FSC versus DNA content. Contour blots, representing a particular, density-related presentation of two parameters in relation to cell numbers, were generated in probability density mode at 20%, means the outermost contour line represents 10% of the total number of events, the next contour represents 30%, then 50%, 70% and 90%. Except contour blots shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP271F2">2</xref>E, left panel, which are presented in linear density mode and served as the template to gate G0/G1 and S + G2/M cells, all blots have been generated in the same way. To visualize FSC shifts between blots of different samples, a bar, or alternatively a crosshair, was set into the center of the G0/G1 (2 N) population of control cells. Alternatively, FSC overlays of G0/G1, S and/or G2/M gated populations are presented.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Protein extraction and immunoblotting</title><p>Extracts of cellular total protein were prepared by physical disruption of cell membranes by repeated freeze-and-thaw cycles.

Supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 15 000 rpm for 20 min at 4&#x000b0;C and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Proteins were resolved using 10% SDS&#x02013;PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were stained with Ponceau-S to visualize the amount of loaded protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP271C11">11</xref>). For immunodetection antibodies specific for the following proteins were used: tuberin C-20 (Santa Cruz, no. sc-893), raptor clone 24C12 (Cell Signaling, no. 2280), rictor clone 53A2 (Cell Signaling, no. 2114), PRAS40 (Cell Signaling, no. 2610), cyclin D1 M-20 (Santa Cruz, no. sc-718), cyclin A H-432 (Santa Cruz, no. sc-751), phospho-p70S6 kinase T389 clone 108D2 (Cell Signaling, no. 9234), p70S6 kinase clone 49D7 (Cell Signaling, no. 2708), phospho-Akt S473 clone D9E (Cell Signaling, no. 4060), Akt (pan) clone C67E7 (Cell Signaling, no. 4691), Kip1/p27 clone 57 (Transduction Laboratories, no. K25020), c-myc clone 9E10 (BD Pharmingen, no. 554205) and &#x003b1;-tubulin (DM1A, Calbiochem, no. CP06). Rabbit polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were detected using anti-rabbit IgG, a HRP-linked heavy and light chain antibody from goat (no. A120-101P, Bethyl Laboratories); mouse monoclonal antibodies were detected using anti-mouse IgG, a HRP-linked heavy and light chain antibody from goat (no. A90-116P, Bethyl Laboratories). Signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Pierce). Some of the presented western blots were densitometrically analysed using LabWorks image acquisition and analysis software. The results are given in relation to the according control value set as 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Brdu incorporation assay and immunofluorescence</title><p>The DNA Replication Assay Kit (Millipore) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were grown on coverslips, starved and restimulated as described above, pulse-labeled for 60 min with 10 &#x000b5;<sc>m</sc> BrdU and fixed in 95% ethanol/5% glacial acetic acid. BrdU-positive cells were detected using a monoclonal antibody against BrdU and an Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (no. A11029, Molecular Probes). For immunodetection of cyclin A, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min and blocked for non-specific binding in PBS containing 3% BSA for another 30 min. After 1 h incubation with anti-cyclin A antibody (H-432, Santa Cruz, no. sc-751) cyclin A-positive cells were visualized by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (no. A11034, Molecular Probes). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Fluorescence was analysed on a conventional microscope equipped with a video camera and a fluorescence attachment (model Axioplan 2 imaging with FluoArc, Zeiss) using a Plan-Neofluor 40x oil immersion (NA 1.3) objective. MetaSystems software was used for image acquisition and Adobe Photoshop 7.0 was used for further processing.
