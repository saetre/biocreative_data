The rapid decrease of oxygen and glucose in the ischemic region can trigger delayed neuronal death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and reperfusion may further exacerbate the injury. The delayed cell death occurs primarily through an apoptotic mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Evidence has accumulated that a large proportion of the delayed neuronal death is mediated by caspase-independent pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, the signalling mechanisms remain largely unclear. Recent studies have implicated mitochondrial proteins, such as endonuclease G (EndoG) and Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa-interacting protein (BNIP3), as players involved in this pathway in non-neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>EndoG is an endonuclease normally localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, and translocates to the nucleus when cells are exposed to an apoptosis-inducing stimulus. After moving to the nucleus, EndoG cleaves chromatin DNA into nucleosomal fragments independent of caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The compartmentalization of mitochondria plays the major role in EndoG trafficking. The EndoG location site might indicate that this enzyme is not an instrument for immediate response to cell injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>BNIP3 is a member of a unique family of death-inducing mitochondrial proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In neurons, the expression of BNIP3 is undetectable under normal conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] but can be induced by hypoxia/ischemia and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The BNIP3-induced non-neuronal cell death is characterized by mitochondrial damage but is independent of caspase activation and cytochrome c release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

We demonstrate here that EndoG upregulates and translocates from mitochondria to nucleus in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, the translocation of EndoG occurs hours before the observable nuclear pyknosis. Importantly, we investigated the causal relationship between mitochondrial BNIP3 upregulation and EndoG translocation and nuclear pyknosis by over expressing or knocking down of BNIP3.

At different time points after reoxygenation, the intracellular localization of EndoG was detected by immunocytochemistry; the morphologically damaged neurons were identified by condensed and fragmented nuclei using DAPI nuclear staining. The result revealed that EndoG was mainly located in the intracellular space out of the nucleus shown as red fluorescence in normal control group or in EBSS-treated group under normoxic condition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Consistent with the results from the previous western blot analysis, the nuclear translocation of EndoG started at 2 h after reoxygenation and increased progressively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C-E</xref>). Significant numbers of neurons displaying EndoG nuclear staining were observed 6 h after reoxygenation, a time point when no obvious morphological neuronal damage could be observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). Thereafter, although the number of morphologically damaged neurons also increased with time, a great quantity of pyknotic nuclei could not be observed until 12 h after reoxygenation. Furthermore, the proportions of morphologically damaged neurons were less than that of the EndoG translocated neurons at 12 h and 24 h, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>).

Western blot analysis revealed that BNIP3 bands with molecular weights of 30 kD (monomer) and 60 kD (dimer) started to increase at 2 h of reoxygenation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

Because BNIP3 predominantly localizes to the mitochondria and homodimerization appears to be a feature of mitochondrial localization and important for BNIP3's function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], we explored the subcellular localization of OGD-induced BNIP3. Immediately after reoxygenation, upregulation of mitochondrial BNIP3 (dimer) was detected, 2 h earlier than the EndoG translocation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). We next examined whether forced expression of BNIP3 induced EndoG translocation.

Furthermore, we explored whether knockdown of BNIP3 could reduce the OGD-induced nuclear translocation of EndoG. Based on the earlier result that EndoG began to significantly translocate to nucleus at 2 h after reoxygenation, we wanted to observe the effect that BNIP3 inhibition would have on the percentage of neurons with nuclear EndoG at 2 h and 6 h after reoxygenation, respectively.

The present study, for the first time, strongly implies an essential role of EndoG in post-ischemic hippocampal neuronal cell death in vitro. Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry demonstrate that EndoG not only upregulates in hippocampal neurons following reoxygenation but also translocates from mitochondria to nucleus. This finding is consistent with previous results on other ischemic models, including cortical neuronal cultures subjected to hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and cortical neurons of mice subjected to transient or permanent focal cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Using subcellular fractionation with a detailed time course, we confirmed that EndoG translocation markedly precedes the appearance of biochemical markers of cell death. The good temporal and spatial relationship between EndoG translocation and nuclear pyknosis suggests a causal role of EndoG translocation in OGD-induced hippocampal neuronal death.</p><p>The present study also identifies BNIP3 and EndoG translocation as early events in hippocampal neurons subjected to OGD. The increase in mitochondrial BNIP3 expression was observed immediately after reoxygenation. The translocation of EndoG was detectable at 2 h and increased significantly at 6 h after reoxygenation. This is consistent with a previous report in a mouse model of brain ischemia, in which EndoG translocation was observed 4 h after transient focal cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Although in a previous study we found that BNIP3 and EndoG translocation occurred relatively late in cultured cortical neurons subjected to hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the mitochondrial translocation of the BNIP3 was before the nuclear translocation of the EndoG in both studies, which strongly supports that BNIP3 acts as an upstream signal of EndoG. The discrepancy might result from either different neuron types examined or different ischemic models used. Compared with hypoxia, OGD is a more severe stress to neurons and re-supply of oxygen and glucose may further exacerbate the injury. In fact, we detected an upregulation of BNIP3 in mitochondria at 0 h after reoxygenation, which might imply that the mitochondrial translocation of BNIP3 occurred and the signalling cascade triggered by BNIP3 started during OGD. The expression of BNIP3 in mitochondria further increased with prolonged reoxygenation, and knockdown of BNIP3 reduced cell death, supporting a role of BNIP3 in activating the cell death program. We also found that forced expression of BNIP3 increased nuclear translocation of EndoG. On the other hand, knockdown of BNIP3 expression reduced OGD-induced EndoG translocation. Therefore, the present findings argue for the importance of mitochondrial BNIP3 upregulation as an upstream modulator of EndoG translocation in ischemic neuronal injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study we provide the first detailed description of the time-dependent subcellular localization of EndoG and BNIP3 in the cultured hippocampal neurons following OGD. By exploring the temporal relationship between the neuronal nuclear pyknosis and the translocation of the mitochondrial death-related proteins, BNIP3 and EndoG, we have been able to suggest an important role of mitochondrial BNIP3 upregulation and EndoG translocation in neuronal death. Combined with the findings that forced expression of BNIP3 increases EndoG translocation and neuronal death, and knockdown of BNIP3 decreases EndoG translocation and neuronal death, our results support the role of mitochondrial BNIP3 as a signal protein upstream of EndoG leading to the induction of neuronal death.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Neonatal 1 d Sprague-Dawley rats were provided by Southern Medical University and conditions regarding health and hygiene were confirmed.

The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with anti-EndoG antibody (1:500; Abcam), anti-BNIP3 (1:500; Sigma), anti-COX IV (1:5000; Abcam) or anti-Histone H3 (1:5000; BOSTER, Wuhan, China) and then further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000) for 1 h. Immunoblotting was detected by ECL (Key GEN, Nanjing, China) and imaged on a FluorChem 8900 imager (Alpha Innotech). Western blot bands were quantified using the FluorChem&#x02122; SP V.5.0.2.4 software.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>Cultured cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and nonspecific binding was blocked for 60 min in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 3% BSA. Anti-EndoG antibody (1:50) was applied in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, followed by a Rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated AffiniPure Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (Jackson) secondary antibody (1:200) for 60 min. Negative controls, in which the primary antibody was omitted, were similarly treated as described above. Nuclear staining was followed with the fluorescent DNA-binding dye 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (1:1000; Roche) for 15 min. Fluorescence pictures were taken on a Leica TCS SP2 scanning confocal microscope. Neurons with condensed and fragmented nuclei were considered apoptotic. Five randomly chosen visual fields were counted in each sample by an investigator blind to the experimental conditions. About 500 cells from each group were counted.</p></sec><sec><title>BNIP3 gene silencing</title><p>Interfering plasmids targeting BNIP3 (BNIP3-miRNA) were generated using BLOCK-iT Pol II miR RNAi Expression Vector Kits (Invitrogen) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The miRNA sequences were designed using Invitrogen's BLOCT-iT RNAi Designer. Briefly, the oligonucleotides were synthesized, annealed and inserted to the pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR vector. The pcDNA6.2/EmGFP-miR-neg control plasmid (neg-miRNA) was used as a negative control.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell transfection</title><p>Neurons cultured for 7 days in vitro or HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids pEGFP-C3-rBNIP3, pEGFP-C3, BNIP3-miRNA and neg-miRNA as we described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's recommendations.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are given as means &#x000b1; SE if not indicated otherwise. One-way ANOVA was used to test for overall statistical significance. A difference was considered significant at <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TMG, XHZ, JMK and MC designed the study. STZ and SJL cultured the cells and performed OGD. MC generated the miRNA plasmids. STZ carried out cell transfection.
