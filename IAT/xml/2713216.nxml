Creatine is taken into cells via the creatine transporter (CrT), where it plays an essential role in energy homeostasis, particularly for tissues with high and fluctuating energy demands. Very little is known of the fetal requirement for creatine and how this may change with advancing pregnancy and into the early neonatal period. Using the spiny mouse as a model of human perinatal development, the purpose of the present study was to comprehensively examine the development of the creatine synthesis and transport systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The estimated amount of total creatine in the placenta and brain significantly increased in the second half of pregnancy, coinciding with a significant increase in expression of CrT mRNA. In the fetal brain, mRNA expression of AGAT increased steadily across the second half of pregnancy, although GAMT mRNA expression was relatively low until 34 days gestation (term is 38&#x02013;39 days). In the fetal kidney and liver, AGAT and GAMT mRNA and protein expression were also relatively low until 34&#x02013;37 days gestation. Between mid-gestation and term, neither AGAT or GAMT mRNA or protein could be detected in the placenta.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that in the spiny mouse, a species where, like the human, considerable organogenesis occurs before birth, there appears to be a limited capacity for endogenous creatine synthesis until approximately 0.9 of pregnancy. This implies that a maternal source of creatine, transferred across the placenta, may be essential until the creatine synthesis and transport system matures in preparation for birth. If these results also apply to the human, premature birth may increase the risk of creatine deficiency.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The creatine/phosphocreatine (PCr) system plays an essential role in cellular energy homeostasis, serving as a spatial and temporal energy buffer in cells with high and fluctuating energy demands (for detailed reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). In adult humans, about half of the creatine requirement is obtained from the diet, with the remainder synthesized endogenously in a two-step sequence involving AGAT (<sc>L</sc>-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase) and GAMT (guanidinoacetate methyltransferase). The first step involving AGAT occurs mostly in the kidney where arginine and glycine form guanidinoacetate, which later undergoes methylation to form creatine, occurring mostly in the liver via the actions of GAMT.</p><p>From the liver, creatine is carried in the blood to creatine-requiring tissues, where it is transported into cells against a large concentration gradient by a creatine-specific, high affinity, sodium- and chloride-dependent creatine transporter protein (CrT) located at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Once inside the cell, creatine kinase regulates the phosphorylation of creatine.</p><p>The recently discovered congenital defects in humans affecting creatine synthesis (AGAT or GAMT deficiency), or creatine uptake (CrT deficiency), are characterized by a severe depletion of cerebral creatine/PCr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In early infancy, these patients often show neurodevelopmental delay, mental retardation, inability to speak, epileptic seizures, autism, movement disorders, and are prone to developmental myopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. No amount of creatine supplementation can improve clinical outcomes in CrT deficient patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In AGAT-deficient patients, long-term high dose creatine supplementation offers a clear therapeutic benefit, whereas in GAMT-deficient patients, in order to reduce accumulation of toxic guanidinoacetate, creatine supplementation has to be accompanied by arginine restriction and ornithin supplementation to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Two recent case studies suggest pre-symptomatic creatine supplementation may completely prevent the neurological sequelae when treatment is initiated within 1&#x02013;4 months of birth, although long term progress is yet to be monitored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The reported success of this early intervention creatine supplementation suggests that the fetus only becomes depleted of cerebral creatine after birth. It may be that the mother and/or placental unit sustain the fetal creatine requirement for all of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The human placenta is known to express CrT RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and the capacity for maternal-to-fetal transfer of creatine occurs from at least 13 weeks of gestation onwards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the pregnant rat, such creatine transfer occurs from at least 14 days gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and the placenta and fetus show an increasing capacity for creatine accumulation (relative to maternal plasma) with advancing gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These results suggest that the placental creatine content probably increases with gestation, possibly in conjunction with an increase in the expression or activity of the CrT, however this has not been shown in any species.</p><p>Very little is known of the fetal requirement for creatine and how this may change with advancing pregnancy and into the early neonatal period, particularly for tissues known to have a high creatine requirement in the adult (e.g. brain, heart, skeletal muscle) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Braissant and colleagues have shown that in the embryonic rat CrT mRNA is expressed in almost all tissues, including the brain, from as early as embryonic day (E) 12.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The brain shows a marked increase in expression of CrT at E15.5 (term is approximately 21 days). These authors did not measure the content of creatine in the developing fetus, so it remains unknown whether and how the pattern of CrT expression actually relates to brain creatine levels.</p><p>In the adult mouse brain, CrT expression at the blood brain barrier has been shown to be a major pathway for supplying creatine to the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the adult rat brain have been shown to express the creatine synthesizing enzymes, implying that at least some of the brain requirement for creatine is met by <italic>de novo </italic>synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the developing rat brain, AGAT mRNA can be detected in isolated cells of the central nervous system (CNS) from E12.5 onwards, although GAMT mRNA expression is still only barely detectable at E18.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It would appear that at the time of birth the rat pup has only a very limited capacity for creatine synthesis within the CNS. It is necessary to understand how these expression patterns change in the postnatal period, as the newborn rat pup does not reach a comparable stage of development to the newborn human infant until at least postnatal day 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In preparation for birth it is probable that, as for AGAT and GAMT activities in the adult, the fetal kidney and liver must develop an independent capacity for creatine synthesis. In the developing rat, GAMT mRNA expression in the liver shows a steady increase in expression between E12.5&#x02013;18.5, whereas AGAT mRNA in the kidney is not detectable until E18.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These results suggest the altricial rat pup attains the capacity for creatine synthesis only shortly before birth.</p><p>Previous studies in rodents have provided insight into the temporal development of the fetal creatine synthesis and transport system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, these findings have not been related to the creatine content of fetal tissues and the role of the placenta has not been considered. Due to the relative immaturity of the newborn rat, the changes leading up to birth do not appropriately reflect the changes that are likely to occur in the human during the transition from late gestation to early postnatal life.</p><p>The spiny mouse <italic>(Acomys cahirinus) </italic>is a precocial species that can be considered an appropriate animal model for perinatal development in the human. Unlike conventional rats and mice, the spiny mouse has a long gestation (38&#x02013;40 days), small litter size (1&#x02013;5, usually 3), and is developmentally more advanced at birth; the body is covered with fur, eyes and ears are functional, they show active olfaction and are capable of thermoregulation and coordinated locomotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The developmental profiles of the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], small intestine and pancreatic enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and the completion of nephrogenesis in the kidney before term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], indicate that, as in the human, organogenesis is largely complete by the end of gestation.</p><p>Using the spiny mouse as a model of human perinatal development, the purpose of the present study was to comprehensively examine the development of the creatine synthesis and transport systems. We measured the creatine content of fetal and placental tissues, and sought to determine if the fetus had the capacity to meet its creatine requirement independently of a maternal-placental source.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were approved in advance by Monash University School of Biomedical Sciences Animal Ethics Committee, and conducted in accordance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes.

Despite this, very little is known about when creatine synthesis and its transporter system develops during embryonic, fetal and neonatal life. In this study we used a species that, like the human, has a relatively long gestation during which considerable fetal development and maturation occurs. We determined that the amount of TCr in the spiny mouse placenta and fetal brain increased progressively across the second half of gestation. However, expression of the two principal creatine synthesizing enzymes AGAT and GAMT in the fetal kidney, liver and brain was low until very late in gestation (days 34&#x02013;37), and expression of these enzymes in the placenta was not detected at all. These results suggest that in precocial species the developing fetus is almost completely reliant on a maternal source of creatine until as late as 0.9 of pregnancy.</p><p>The fetal brain showed a steady and significant increase in the estimated amount of TCr from mid-gestation until term, and increased further in the postnatal period. The high amount of creatine found in this organ is not surprising, as the adult brain is known to have a high basal creatine concentration, presumably to cope with its large and fluctuating cellular energy requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In the adult rat brain, there is a limited capacity for creatine to cross the blood brain barrier. The widespread expression of creatine synthesizing enzymes has lead to the suggestion that the creatine requirements of the brain can be met, at least in part, independently of extra-CNS sources (i.e. that synthesized via the kidney and liver) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the spiny mouse, although AGAT and GAMT mRNA could be measured in whole brain extracts, protein expression could not be detected with western blot analysis. On the basis of this result, it could be argued that the fetal and neonatal brain does not have the capacity to synthesize creatine in significant amounts on a whole organ level. A more likely explanation is that, as for the rat, AGAT and GAMT protein expression in the fetal spiny mouse brain is region and cell-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Immunoblot with whole brain homogenate is most likely too insensitive to detect such protein expression.</p><p>The temporal difference in the appearance of AGAT and GAMT mRNA in the fetal spiny mouse brain is an interesting phenomenon. A similar result was found for the embryonic rat, where AGAT could be detected from E12.5, yet GAMT was barely detectable even shortly before birth at E18.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These results suggest that the fetal brain relies on extra-CNS or maternal sources of creatine for the whole of pregnancy, and/or the creatine precursor guanidinoacetate is transferred from the CNS to GAMT-expressing cells where it can be converted to creatine. Although our results have not been confirmed at the protein level, the expression patterns of AGAT and GAMT mRNA suggest that the fetal spiny mouse brain does not attain an appreciable capacity for significant creatine synthesis until shortly before birth, at 34&#x02013;37 days gestation (0.9 of pregnancy).</p><p>We showed that CrT mRNA expression in the spiny mouse brain increased approximately 2-fold between mid-pregnancy and term; we were unable to measure CrT protein for lack of an appropriately specific antibody (as detailed in Methods). This prenatal increase is in agreement with that described in the embryonic rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and consistent with its early expression in zebra fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Further increases in CrT expression in the spiny mouse brain were observed at 2 and 10 days after birth. In the neonatal rat brain, the concentration of creatine and creatine kinase has been reported to increase significantly between postnatal weeks 1 and 3, with levels essentially remaining unchanged after that [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. It is likely that the pre- and postnatal developmental increase in brain CrT expression in the spiny mouse coincides with the increasing demand for creatine in the maturing CNS, which cannot be met entirely by creatine synthesis within the CNS.</p><p>AGAT and GAMT expression in the fetal kidney and liver were also relatively low until the very late stages of pregnancy; a 30 to 50-fold increase in mRNA expression was seen at 34&#x02013;37 days of gestation (term is ~39 days). We expected that in preparation for birth these key organs would develop a capacity for creatine synthesis in the latter half of pregnancy, but these results suggest a limited capacity for endogenous creatine synthesis exists until very late (~0.9) in pregnancy. AGAT and GAMT expression levels in the kidney and liver remained unchanged between gestational day 37 and postnatal day 10. It would appear that shortly before birth, the spiny mouse attains the capacity to meet the postnatal requirement for endogenous creatine synthesis. It would be interesting to know how the uptake of creatine from breast milk contributes to the neonatal requirement for creatine in the spiny mouse.</p><p>Similar to the brain, the amount of TCr measured in the placenta of the spiny mouse increased significantly with advancing pregnancy. Being metabolically very active, it is likely that the placenta itself has a requirement for creatine &#x02013; creatine kinase expression, which is tightly coupled with cellular energy requirements, peaks in term human placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. However, as for the human placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], it appears that this organ itself does not synthesize creatine, as we were unable to detect either AGAT or GAMT mRNA or protein in the placenta of the spiny mouse from mid-gestation to term. The increase in placental TCr may reflect an increase in a temporary pool of 'stored creatine' available for transfer to the fetus, which is consistent with our observation that there was an increase of CrT mRNA in the placenta from at least mid-gestation. At the present time we do not know whether this occurs in maternal or fetal tissue in the placenta. The increase coincides with the development of the labyrinth region of the placenta, which is primarily fetal tissue and associated with the rapid expansion of the fetal vascular compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. An increase in placental CrT may allow for more efficient transfer of creatine into the fetal circulation with increasing gestation &#x02013; thus meeting the fetus' growing demand for creatine, particularly that of the fetal brain.</p><p>To our knowledge, the transcriptional pathways controlling the regulation of the CrT, AGAT and GAMT genes have not been identified. In the fetal spiny mouse, circulating thyroid hormone increases steadily between 30 days gestation and term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Analysis of the CrT promoter reveals approximately six nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) consensus sequences, for which thyroid hormone is a known activator of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. It is plausible that the CrT gene is regulated, at least in part, via a thyroid hormone/NRF1 transcriptional program, however this is yet to be established.</p><p>Although the fetal heart, liver and kidney undergo considerable growth from mid-gestation until term in the fetal spiny mouse, the estimated amount of TCr did not increase until after birth. Although heart muscle does not synthesize creatine, as with skeletal muscle it has a large requirement for creatine and therefore a considerable capacity for uptake and storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Our finding that heart TCr did not increase until the postnatal period is in agreement with previous studies in the rat, where creatine levels, as well as creatine kinase levels, increased 5-fold in the 3 weeks after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. As cardiovascular function is of fundamental importance for growth from very early in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], it is not altogether surprising that cardiac creatine levels are relatively high and stable throughout gestation. The quantity of creatine found in the heart from gestational day 30 is obviously sufficient to sustain cardiac function until term. However, at birth the heart undergoes rapid growth and re-modelling associated with transformation of the circulation with the onset of pulmonary ventilation and closure of the major vascular shunts, the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale. Thus, between gestational day 37 and postnatal day 10 the mass of the heart increased almost 3-fold, TCr content increased 2-fold, and CrT mRNA expression increased 2-fold between mid-gestation and postnatal day 10 (although this did not reach significance). It is possible that creatine uptake into the heart is facilitated by an increase in CrT activity rather than CrT protein expression, and further increases in transporter expression may occur later than postnatal day 10. In support of this, is the fact that CrT activity can be regulated by phosphorylation via protein kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Unlike the brain and skeletal muscle, the kidney and liver have less requirement for creatine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The observed rapid increase in TCr in these organs in the postnatal period is likely to reflect their functional maturation. The kidney plays a key role in the re-absorption of creatine from urine, the capacity for which has been shown to increase after birth in both the human and rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Likewise, the methylation of guanidinoacetate to creatine, a process occurring predominantly in the liver, also appears to increase after birth.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results suggest that, for a species where considerable maturation of the fetus occurs before birth, there appears to be a limited capacity for endogenous creatine synthesis until approximately 0.9 of pregnancy. This implies that a maternal source of creatine, transferred to the fetus via the placental unit, may be essential until the creatine/PCr synthesis and transport system matures in preparation for birth. If these results also apply to the human, it may be that infants born prematurely would be at risk of becoming creatine deficient, unless sufficient creatine can be absorbed by the immature gut from the limited amounts of creatine present in breast milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Organs with the highest energy requirements, such as the brain and heart, would be at greatest risk at this time. Also, fetal growth-retardation arising from chronic placental insufficiency may also result in high risk for creatine deficiency, as our results suggest that the placenta has an essential role in the transfer of creatine from mother to fetus. We have previously shown that creatine supplementation of the maternal diet is of benefit to the fetus when exposed to severe hypoxia at birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Creatine supplementation may also benefit the growth-retarded fetus, especially since many of these are also born preterm.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ZI carried out all animal studies, molecular work, participated in design of study and drafted the manuscript.
