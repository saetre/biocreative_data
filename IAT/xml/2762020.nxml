We found that ubiquitination does not affect SopB stability or membrane association, or SopB-dependent events in SCV biogenesis. However, two spatially and temporally distinct events are dependent on ubiquitination, down-regulation of SopB activity at the plasma membrane and prolonged retention of SopB on the SCV. Activation of the mammalian pro-survival kinase Akt/PKB, a downstream target of SopB, was intensified and prolonged after infection with the SopB-K<sup>6</sup>R mutant. At later times, fewer SCV were decorated with SopB-K<sup>6</sup>R compared to SopB. Instead SopB-K<sup>6</sup>R was present as discrete vesicles spread diffusely throughout the cell. Altogether, our data show that ubiquitination of SopB is not related to its intracellular stability but rather regulates its enzymatic activity at the plasma membrane and intracellular localization.</p></abstract><contract-num rid="AI1">Z01 AI000909-06</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="AI1">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Extramural Activities : NIAID</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Post-translational modification by ubiquitin, or the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins, is an important mechanism for regulating a broad range of biological processes. Ubiquitin is a small globular protein that is covalently attached to target proteins, most commonly at lysine residues. Ubiquitin itself contains seven lysine residues, allowing it to serve as a substrate for poly-ubiquitin chain formation. Similar to other post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination is a dynamic, reversible process. The covalent attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins is catalyzed in a three-step enzymatic cascade involving ubiquitin-activating (E1) and ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes and ubiquitin ligases (E3). The removal of ubiquitin occurs in one step, catalyzed by deubiquitinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kerscher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Historically, the post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin has been associated with protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mukhopadhyay <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Polyubiquitin chains of at least four Lys48-linked ubiquitin molecules efficiently target a protein for destruction by the 26S proteasome. More recently, non-proteolytic functions of ubiquitination have been revealed in many cellular pathways including membrane trafficking, DNA repair and replication and gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Welchman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mukhopadhyay <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The Ubl proteins, a family of proteins related to ubiquitin, can also be covalently attached to lysine side chains in target proteins and modify their function. Examples of Ubls include interferon-stimulated gene-15 (ISG15), neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated-8 (NEDD8), small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) and Atg8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Welchman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kerscher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The ability of a pathogen to cause disease results from its being able to successfully compete at the host-pathogen interface. During the course of coevolution, viral and bacterial pathogens have developed many strategies to manipulate host cells to their own advantage. Given the significance of ubiquitin and Ubl proteins to regulating mammalian cell processes, it is perhaps not surprising that many pathogens have targeted ubiquitin and Ubl conjugation pathways. For example, pathogens can regulate the host immune response by interfering with ubiquitin and Ubl protein associated enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Angot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Edelmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Alternatively, some pathogens encode virulence factors that are structural mimics of E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Angot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Edelmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Viruses, protozoan and bacterial pathogens have all developed mechanisms to target these processes but this appears especially prevalent for Gram-negative bacteria that inject their own proteins, known as effectors, into host cells using type III (T3SS) or type IV secretion systems. The functions of virulence proteins can also be modified by ubiquitin or Ubl protein conjugation. For instance, the activity of some bacterial toxins and type III effectors is down-regulated by polyubiquitin conjugation and proteasomal degradation, including listeriolysin O from <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Schnupf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), SopE and SopA from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (<italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kubori <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), YopE from <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Ruckdeschel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and ExoT from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Balachandran <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Another two virulence proteins, SopB from <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Marcus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) and ExoU from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Stirling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), are ubiquitinated, but this modification does not serve as a signal for proteasomal degradation. All of these examples exemplify two points; that the ubiquitin machinery is important to pathogenic virulence and the degree of crosstalk between pathogen and host at the level of ubiquitin and Ubl proteins is extensive.</p><p id="P5">The <italic>Salmonella</italic> type III effector, SopB, is an inositol phosphatase that acts on host cell membrane phospholipids. Its biological activity affects several facets of the interaction between <italic>Salmonella</italic> and mammalian cells. For example, its actions are required for optimal bacterial entry into non-phagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Raffatellu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), activation of the mammalian pro-survival kinase Akt/PKB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Steele-Mortimer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>) and maturation of the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole (SCV), by generating phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-phosphate (PI (3) P) on the SCV and recruiting lysosomal glycoproteins to the SCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hernandez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). It has previously been shown that SopB is membrane-associated and ubiquitinated after translocation into epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Marcus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). One unusual aspect of SopB activity is that it can be detected for several hours post-invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Marcus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Drecktrah <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wasylnka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), in contrast to most other &#x0201c;invasion-associated&#x0201d; <italic>Salmonella</italic> effector proteins that are active for only a short time during, and immediately following, the invasion process. For example, the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of SopE is crucial for the rapid down-regulation of actin-based plasma membrane ruffling following internalization of <italic>Salmonella</italic> into epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kubori <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The longevity of translocated SopB, in comparison, suggests that ubiquitination plays a different role in the regulation of this type III effector.</p><p id="P6">In order to clarify why SopB is post-translationally modified, we first determined which residues of SopB are ubiquitinated by mass spectrometry. We identified six lysine residues of SopB as ubiquitin conjugation sites. Specific mutation of these residues allowed us to test the function of ubiquitination and indicated that this post-translational modification regulates SopB activity without affecting its turnover.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Translocation and ubiquitination of SopB continues for many hours post-infection</title><p id="P7">Post-translational modification of eukaryotic proteins by ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers is an important process by which the stability, localization or activity of intracellular proteins can be controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kerscher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Recently, ubiquitination of several pathogenic proteins, including the <italic>Salmonella</italic> effector protein SopB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Marcus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), has been demonstrated. To investigate this process in more detail, we first asked whether SopB is also a substrate for conjugation by the Ubl modifiers ISG15, NEDD8 or SUMO1. HeLa cells expressing HA-tagged forms of the modifiers were infected with <italic>Salmonella</italic> for 2 h, to allow for maximal translocation of SopB. Then total SopB, incorporating the intra-bacterial pool as well as translocated protein, was immunoprecipitated from lysates and analyzed by immunoblotting. Whole cell lysates were probed with anti-HA antibodies to detect ectopic expression levels. HA-SUMO and HA-ubiquitin were incorporated into multiple high molecular weight proteins, whereas HA-ISG15 and HA-NEDD8 monomers were primarily detected, at 18 kDa and 6 kDa respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and not shown). This is in agreement with the known prevalence of SUMO and ubiquitin substrates compared to ISG15 and NEDD8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kamitani <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Welchman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). When the immunoprecipitates were probed with an anti-SopB antibody, three SopB bands were detected in all of the lysates, migrating at ~60 kDa, ~68 kDa and ~75 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). By contrast, anti-HA antibodies only detected proteins in co-immunoprecipitates from cells expressing HA-ubiquitin, indicating that SopB is not modified by ISG15, NEDD8 or SUMO1. In the HA-ubiquitin sample, two distinct bands at ~68 kDa and ~75 kDa, and a slower migrating smear &#x0003e;85 kDa were clearly resolved. These presumably represent mono-, di- and poly-ubiquitinated species of SopB, respectively. We conclude from these immunoprecipitation experiments that ubiquitin, but not Ubl modifiers, target SopB in infected cells.</p><p id="P8">We next followed a time course of SopB ubiquitination during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection of epithelial cells. In order to differentiate between the two intracellular pools of SopB; (i) translocated and (ii) intra-bacterial, we used a recently described methodology based upon a 13-amino acid tag derived from glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x003b2; (GSK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Garcia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Because this tag is phosphorylated by serine protein kinases in mammalian cells, but not in bacteria, it can be used in conjunction with phospho-specific antibodies as a reporter for translocation. For these experiments bacteria lacking both SopB and its chaperone SigE (&#x00394;<italic>sopB-sigE</italic>) were complemented with a low copy number plasmid encoding SopB-GSK and SigE (pWSKDE-GSK), expressed under the control of the <italic>sopB</italic> transcriptional promoter. Lysates prepared from infected HeLa cells at 0.5 h to 6 h post-infection (p.i.) were subject to immunoblot analysis using phosphospecific anti-GSK antibodies to detect translocated SopB-GSK. Three bands were revealed; one migrating at the predicted molecular mass of unmodified SopB (60 kDa), and two slower migrating species representing mono- and di-ubiquitinated SopB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). While all three bands accumulated with time, indicating that both translocation and ubiquitination of SopB continued for several hours following infection, amounts of unmodified SopB always exceeded the ubiquitinated forms. It is important to note that SopB is translocated to the plasma membrane upon initial contact with host cells and after bacterial internalization to the SCV, therefore this profile represents a mixture of translocated SopB in these two spatially separate locales. Antibodies that recognize total GSK showed a similar increase in SopB-GSK with time, although the proportion of unmodified SopB (60 kDa) was more prominent than for the translocated SopB profile, suggesting that a significant proportion of SopB remains intra-bacterial. To ensure that the GSK-tagged SopB was biologically active, we assessed the levels of phosphorylated Akt (phospho-Ser473 antibodies) in the lysates since SopB induces the phosphorylation of this eukaryotic kinase in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Steele-Mortimer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Knodler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Akt phosphorylation kinetics were similar to that shown previously, with a peak at 0.5 &#x02013; 1 h p.i. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Knodler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), but interestingly this was not coincident with maximal levels of translocated SopB (&#x02265;4 h p.i.).</p><p id="P9">The prolonged accumulation of translocated SopB is unexpected for a type III effector that is part of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) regulon. We used real-time PCR to study the levels of <italic>sopB</italic> transcription after bacterial internalization. HeLa cells were infected with wild type bacteria and samples were processed for quantitative real-time PCR analysis at various times p.i. To prevent bacterial transcription after internalization, rifampicin was added at 10 min p.i. Transcript levels of <italic>sopB</italic> and <italic>ssaH</italic>, a gene encoding a structural component of T3SS2, were compared in the absence and presence of rifampicin over the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similar to phagocytic cells, the expression of <italic>sopB</italic> rapidly decreased after bacterial internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Drecktrah <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, <italic>sopB</italic> transcript levels were higher in untreated cells than for rifampicin-treated cells up to 6 h p.i. By comparison, the T3SS2 apparatus gene <italic>ssaH</italic> was induced intracellularly, in agreement with previous data from phagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cirillo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Drecktrah <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Rifampicin treatment effectively diminished this intracellular induction, confirming that bacterial transcription was effectively prevented. From this data we conclude that, despite a net downregulation of <italic>sopB</italic> after internalization, bacteria continue to transcribe this gene up to 6 h p.i. Next we examined whether the accumulation of translocated SopB with time also requires protein synthesis after internalization. HeLa cells were infected with &#x00394;<italic>sopB-sigE</italic> bacteria complemented with pWSKDE-GSK and treated with tetracycline at 30 min p.i. to block bacterial protein synthesis. Whole cell lysates were then subject to immunoblot analysis for phospho-GSK (translocated SopB) and GSK tag (total SopB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Tetracycline treatment effectively prevented the accumulation of all forms of SopB, demonstrating that <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis is required for the prolonged accumulation of SopB in host cells. We conclude from these experiments that <italic>sopB</italic> continues to be transcribed and translated for many hours after bacterial internalization.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Six lysine residues of SopB serve as ubiquitin acceptor sites</title><p id="P10">To further characterize the ubiquitination of SopB we used mass spectrometry analysis to identify conjugated lysine residues. Since SopB contains fifty lysine residues that are potential ubiquitin conjugation sites, mutational analysis would not be practical. As an alternative, HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding Myc-tagged SopB (pCMV-Myc-SopB) and the protein purified by immunoprecipitation using an anti-Myc antibody, in order to obtain sufficient material for analysis. We have previously shown that, like translocated SopB, ectopically expressed SopB is ubiquitinated in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Marcus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Immunopurified SopB was separated by SDS-PAGE, visualized by GelCode Blue staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) and the regions containing unmodified SopB and ubiquitinated SopB (SopB-Ub) were excised, digested with trypsin and analyzed by capillary LC-MS/MS spectrometry. Trypsin digestion of ubiquitinated proteins produces unique signature peptides which can be identified by their additional mass of 114.043 Da, corresponding to the &#x02013;GG remnant from ubiquitin that remains conjugated to lysine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The Ubl proteins, NEDD8 and ISG15, also produce the same &#x02013;GG signature tag when cleaved by trypsin. Modification by ubiquitin and Ubl proteins also causes a missed trypsin cleavage at the modified lysine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Since we had already shown that SopB is not modified by either NEDD8 or ISG15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), any lysine modification would be due to ubiquitin conjugation only. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed no &#x02013;GG signature peptides in the sample containing unmodified SopB, with peptide coverage of ~80% of the SopB sequence. By contrast, six ubiquitination sites were identified for SopB-Ub; Lys13, Lys19, Lys23, Lys37, Lys41 and Lys541 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), with detected peptides covering ~79% of the SopB sequence. The identification of multiple modification sites, together with a single SopB-Ub band on SDS-PAGE gels, suggests that SopB is monoubiquitinated on any one of six lysine residues at once, but not all six residues simultaneously. Interestingly, five of the identified lysines are clustered at the N-terminus of SopB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, black arrowheads).</p><p id="P11">In order to characterize the requirement for these six lysines in SopB ubiquitination, site-directed mutagenesis was used to create lysine-to-arginine substitutions in the pCMV-Myc-SopB plasmid. Following ectopic expression in transfected HeLa cells, the level of post-translational modification was monitored by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates with anti-SopB antibodies. Ectopically expressed SopB appeared as two bands in immunoblots, representing unmodified and mono-ubiquitinated SopB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Marcus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Single lysine-to-arginine substitutions had no detectable effect on the ubiquitination status of SopB (results not shown), indicating that no single lysine residue is essential or preferred as a conjugation site. However, ubiquitination of a SopB mutant in which all six lysine residues were substituted (SopB-K<sup>6</sup>R) was substantially decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The residual ubiquitination presumably occurs on one or more additional residues that were not identified by mass spectrometry.</p><p id="P12">Having shown that ectopically expressed SopB can be monoubiquitinated on at least six different lysine residues, we next assessed whether this is also true after bacterial translocation of SopB. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to create lysine-to-arginine substitutions at all six residues in plasmid borne SopB. The resultant plasmid, pWSKDE-K<sup>6</sup>R, was then used to complement the &#x00394;<italic>sopB-sigE</italic> mutant. HeLa cells expressing HA-ubiquitin were infected with either &#x00394;<italic>sopB-sigE</italic> pWSKDE or &#x00394;<italic>sopB-sigE</italic> pWSKDE-K<sup>6</sup>R bacteria. At 2 h p.i., monolayers were lysed and subject to immunoprecipitation with anti-SopB antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting for SopB and HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Immunoprecipitated SopB migrated as three distinct bands on SDS-PAGE, representing the unmodified, mono- and di-ubiquitinated forms of SopB. By contrast, SopB-K<sup>6</sup>R migrated as a single species at 60 kDa, the same molecular mass as unmodified SopB. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation of HA-ubiquitin was almost completely eliminated for SopB-K<sup>6</sup>R, compared to wild type SopB. Collectively, these data demonstrate that multiple lysines in SopB can be monoubiquitinated, and mutation of all these lysine residues (K13R K19R K23R K37R K41R K541R) impairs ubiquitination of translocated SopB.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ubiquitination does not affect SopB stability or membrane association</title><p id="P13">We next evaluated the role of SopB ubiquitination on protein stability and localization, two known functions of this post-translational modification. To monitor the stability of translocated SopB, a modified pulse-chase experiment was used. HeLa cells were infected with &#x00394;<italic>sopB-sigE</italic> bacteria complemented with either pWSKDE-GSK or pWSKDE-K<sup>6</sup>R-GSK. At 2 h p.i., tetracycline was added to stop bacterial protein synthesis. Samples were then taken at hourly intervals and whole cell lysates subject to immunoblotting with phospho-GSK antibodies to detect translocated SopB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). After the addition of antibiotic, there was a steady decline in the amount of SopB, ubiquitinated SopB and SopB-K<sup>6</sup>R with time. Densitometric analysis showed that all three species had a half-life of approximately 2 hr after translocation into the host cell. We conclude from these results that ubiquitination does not influence the degradation rate of SopB.</p><p id="P14">We have previously shown that SopB is targeted to host cell membranes after bacterial translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Marcus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). We therefore considered whether ubiquitin affects the intracellular targeting of SopB. Epithelial cells were infected with &#x00394;<italic>sopB-sigE</italic> bacteria complemented with either pWSKDE-GSK or pWSKDE-K<sup>6</sup>R-GSK and at 1.5 h p.i. cells were homogenized and subject to differential centrifugation at 1,000 x<italic>g</italic>, 6,000 x<italic>g</italic> and 100,000 x<italic>g</italic> resulting in four fractions; P1K (nuclei), P6K (bacteria and nuclei), P100K (HeLa cell membranes), S100K (HeLa cell cytosol). The content of these fractions was assessed by immunoblotting with antibodies to the following proteins: lamin A/C, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), Hsp27, DnaK, phospho-GSK (translocated SopB-GSK) and GSK-tag (total SopB-GSK) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The nuclear marker, lamin A/C, was equally detected in P1K and P6K fractions whereas DnaK, a marker for intact bacteria, was enriched in the P6K fraction, with only a small amount detected in P1K. No bacterial contamination (DnaK) was detected in the P100K or S100K fractions, which contained the host cell membrane and cytosolic proteins, LAMP1 and Hsp27, respectively. The three major forms of translocated SopB (60, 68 and 75 kDa), were primarily detected in the P100K fraction. The 60 kDa unmodified SopB and the 68 kDa monoubiquitinated SopB were also detected to a lesser extent in the P1K and P6K fractions. Importantly, all forms of SopB, including SopB-K<sup>6</sup>R, partitioned similarly. From these subcellular fractionation experiments we conclude that translocated SopB is enriched in host cell membrane fractions independent of its ubiquitination status.</p><p id="P15">We next asked whether ubiquitination of SopB could change the nature of its association with host cell membranes. Host cell membrane fractions were prepared from infected HeLa cells at 1.5 h p.i. as described above and then treated with either high salt, sodium carbonate or Triton X-100 (TX-100) on ice for 30 min. Subsequently, the samples were ultracentrifuged and equivalent volumes of soluble and insoluble fractions analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against calnexin, calreticulin and phospho-GSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Confirming this, the peripheral membrane protein, calreticulin, was extracted from membranes with sodium carbonate and TX-100, whereas the integral membrane protein, calnexin, was solubilized by detergent treatment only. Translocated SopB was removed from membranes with sodium carbonate and TX-100 treatments, but not high salt, comparable to what has previously been shown for ectopically expressed SopB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Marcus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). There was no reproducible difference in the degree of solubilization of SopB, ubiquitinated SopB or SopB-K<sup>6</sup>R with the four treatments.

Recently, it has also been shown that Akt can also be activated on a subset of endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Schenck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Since SopB is an inositol phosphatase that affects the concentration of membrane phospholipids, we next used confocal microscopy to assess whether SopB-K<sup>6</sup>R affects the levels of phosphorylated Akt on membranes.

At various times up to 90 min p.i., cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence staining. Before permeabilization, cells were incubated with fluorescently-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) to label the plasma membrane. Subsequently, monolayers were permeabilized and immunostained using anti-phospho-Ser473-Akt antibodies. Plasma membrane ruffles, which are induced by <italic>Salmonella</italic> at the site of invasion and persist after bacterial internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kubori <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), were identified using spinning disc confocal microscopy and single optical sections were acquired in the far-red (WGA, plasma membrane), green (EGFP-Akt) and red (phospho-Akt) channels. Subsequently the ruffle was selected by thresholding on the WGA-Alexa Fluor&#x000ae; 647 channel. The ratio of the average pixel intensity for the phospho-Ser473-Akt signal to EGFP-Akt fluorescence (R<italic><sub>pAkt/Akt</sub></italic>) was subsequently determined for each ruffle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>).

These differences were not attributable to changes in the amount of EGFP-Akt recruited to plasma membrane ruffles (results not shown).

Using a combination of mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis, we have shown that at least six of the fifty lysine residues in SopB are sites of ubiquitination, specifically monoubiquitination. Of the six modified lysine residues, five are clustered at the N-terminus of SopB and one is at the C-terminus. While a three-dimensional structure of SopB is not yet available, we predict that these residues are exposed on the surface of SopB, since ubiquitin is preferentially added to lysines present in surface-exposed loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Catic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Recently, two other groups have also reported ubiquitin conjugation sites of SopB. Rogers <italic>et al.</italic> identified two of the same residues (Lys19 and Lys541), although this was not confirmed by mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Rogers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Patel <italic>et al.</italic> identified two ubiquitinated tryptic peptides of SopB by mass spectrometry and subsequently mutated nine lysines at the amino terminus of SopB to demonstrate that all of these residues can be modified. Individual substitution of the identified lysine residues had little effect on SopB ubiquitination and mutation of all identified residues reduced, but did not eliminate, ubiquitination (this manuscript and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Patel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Such redundancy of ubiquitin attachment sites is well documented for numerous mammalian proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hou <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Marotti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Meray <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).

Some of these serovars are highly host adapted, including Gallinarum, which only infects birds, and Typhi, only higher primates, whereas others such as Typhimurium have a broad host range. Likewise, the repertoire of type III effectors is not the same for all these serovars. For example, effectors encoded by phages or phage remnants, including AvrA, SopE, SspH1 and SseI, are absent from many serovars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Tsolis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Prager <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hansen-Wester <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Rahman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).

The deduced amino acid sequence for full-length SopB is available for the following <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovars in GenBank; serovar Agona (GenBank accession number YP_002145960), serovar Choleraesuis (AAC33723), serovar Dublin (AAC33723), serovar Enteriditis (CAR32537), serovar Gallinarum (CAR36869), serovar Hadar (EDZ33941), serovar Heidelberg (YP_002045092), serovar Javiana (EDZ05526), serovar Kentucky (EDZ19176), serovar Newport (YP_002040347), serovar Saintpaul (EDZ10612), serovar Schwarzengrund (YP_002114089), serovar Typhi (NP_455588), serovar Virchow (ZP_03216329) and serovar Weltevreden (EDZ28428). Interestingly, all six identified ubiquitin conjugation sites (Lys13, Lys9, Lys23, Lys37, Lys41 and Lys541) are conserved in these SopB sequences. Such conservation implies that SopB and its ubiquitination are required for pathogenesis irrespective of host or serovar differences.

Interestingly, ubiquitination is known to regulate the activity of some mammalian inositol phosphatases. For example, the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-1, polyubiquitinates PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10), an inositol 3&#x02032;-phosphatase that is a central negative regulator of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, leading to its proteasomal degradation and thereby limiting its actions on phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). NEDD4-1 also monoubiquitinates PTEN, inducing its translocation to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Trotman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Therefore, ubiquitination of PTEN controls both its cellular localization and stability. Another inositol 3&#x02032;-phosphatase, myotubularin-related protein 4, localizes to endosomes and is also polyubiquitinated by NEDD4, although the role of this post-translational modification is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Plant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). It might prove that ubiquitin-mediated control of inositol phosphatase function is more widespread that currently appreciated.</p><p id="P24">Upon bacterial contact with host cells, SopB is delivered to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane where it participates in plasma membrane ruffling and signaling events, and after bacterial entry it continues to be translocated for many hours, localizing to the SCV. Here we have shown that one role of SopB ubiquitination is to down-regulate its activity at the plasma membrane. This concurs with the recent results of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Patel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). While this might be an indirect effect attributable to mutagenesis-induced changes in SopB enzymatic activity, it seems much more likely that it is directly due to ubiquitin-dependent changes in localization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Patel <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> have shown using an invasion-defective, translocation-competent <italic>Salmonella</italic> strain, that while SopB is internalized from the plasma membrane into endocytic compartments, ubiquitin-defective SopB is retained at the plasma membrane. Ubiquitin, primarily monoubiquitin, is well known to function as an internalization signal for eukaryotic plasma membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mukhopadhyay <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), but this is the first example for a bacterial virulence protein. Ubiquitination of some plasma membrane receptors controls the amplitude and kinetics of signaling resulting from their engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Marmor <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Upon growth factor stimulation, these transmembrane proteins are monoubiquitinated, driving their internalization and sorting them to the endosomal/lysosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Haglund <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Staub <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). While ubiquitin-deficient plasma membrane receptors are internalized normally, their turnover by lysosomal degradation is delayed, but not prevented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). This leads to increased and prolonged PI3K/Akt signaling in the case of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase cbl-b enhances ubiquitination of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), shortening the duration of its signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ettenberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). It is important to note that ubiquitination of plasma membrane receptors does not lead to an all-or-nothing effect, but rather modulates the intensity and duration of signaling events, serving a &#x0201c;fine-tuning&#x0201d; role. Ubiquitin-mediated down-regulation of signaling is not limited to transmembrane receptors at the plasma membrane since we, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Patel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), observe a similar phenotype for SopB-dependent signaling.</p><p id="P25">While SopB is translocated by T3SS1 immediately upon contact with host cells, we did not detect modification of translocated SopB until &#x02265;1 h p.i. The onset of SopB ubiquitination is coincident with the peak of Akt phosphorylation and leads to the efficient down-modulation of Akt activation at the plasma membrane. By contrast, we found no evidence for SopB ubiquitination being involved in SCV biogenesis. Unlike Akt activation, Rab5 and LAMP1 recruitment to the SCV and PI (3) P formation are affected, but not absolutely dependent, on SopB.

However, others have reported that <italic>Salmonella</italic> expressing ubiquitin-deficient SopB are defective for Rab5 recruitment to the SCV at 10&#x02013;20 min p.i.

It is difficult to reconcile how Rab5 recruitment can be affected by SopB ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Patel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), but not PI (3) P production (this study) and further studies are required to resolve this discrepancy.</p><p id="P26">Ubiquitination can alter protein location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Schnell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).
