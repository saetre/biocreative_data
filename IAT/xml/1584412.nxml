More than 150,000 people in the US alone die every year from this disease, which can be split into two basic types&#x02014;small cell lung cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Four out of five lung cancers are NSCLCs, but both types are mainly caused by smoking. Exposure to chemicals in smoke produces changes (or mutations) in the genetic material of the cells lining the lungs that cause the cells to grow uncontrollably and to move around the body. In more than half the people who develop NSCLC, the cancer has spread out of the lungs before it is diagnosed, and therefore can't be removed surgically. Stage IV NSCLC, as this is known, is usually treated with chemotherapy&#x02014;toxic chemicals that kill the fast-growing cancer cells. However, only 2&#x00025; of people with stage IV NSCLC are still alive two years after their diagnosis, mainly because their cancer cells become resistant to chemotherapy. They do this by making proteins that destroy cancer drugs (detoxification enzymes) or that pump them out of cells (efflux pumps) and by making antioxidants, chemicals that protect cells against the oxidative damage caused by many chemotherapy agents.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>To improve the outlook for patients with lung cancer, researchers need to discover exactly how cancer cells become resistant to chemotherapy drugs. Detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, and antioxidants normally protect cells from environmental toxins and from oxidants produced by the chemical processes of life. Their production is regulated by nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (NRF2). The activity of this transcription factor (a protein that controls the expression of other proteins) is controlled by the protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). KEAP1 holds NRF2 in the cytoplasm of the cell (the cytoplasm surrounds the cell's nucleus, where the genetic material is stored) when no oxidants are present and targets it for destruction. When oxidants are present, KEAP1 no longer interacts with NRF2, which moves into the nucleus and induces the expression of the proteins that protect the cell against oxidants and toxins. In this study, the researchers investigated whether changes in KEAP1 might underlie the drug resistance seen in lung cancer.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers looked carefully at the gene encoding KEAP1 in tissue taken from lung tumors and in several lung cancer cell lines&#x02014;tumor cells that have been grown in a laboratory. They found mutations in parts of KEAP1 known to be important for its function in half the cell lines and a fifth of the tumor samples. They also found that about half of the samples had lost part of one copy of the <italic>KEAP1</italic> gene&#x02014;cells usually have two copies of each gene. Five of the six tumors with <italic>KEAP1</italic> mutations had also lost one copy of <italic>KEAP1</italic>&#x02014;geneticists call this biallelic inactivation. This means that these tumors should have no functional KEAP1. When the researchers checked this by staining the tumors for NRF2, they found that the tumor cells had more NRF2 than normal cells and that it accumulated in the nucleus. In addition, the tumor cells made more detoxification enzymes, efflux proteins, and antioxidants than normal cells. Finally, the researchers showed that lung cancer cells with <italic>KEAP1</italic> mutations were more resistant to chemotherapy drugs than normal lung cells were.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These results indicate that biallelic inactivation of <italic>KEAP1</italic> is a frequent genetic alteration in NSCLC and suggest that the loss of KEAP1 activity is one way that lung tumors can increase their NRF2 activity and develop resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. More lung cancer samples need to be examined to confirm this result, and similar studies need to be done in other cancers to see whether loss of KEAP1 activity is a common mechanism by which tumors become resistant to chemotherapy. If such studies confirm that high NRF2 activity (either through mutation or by some other route) is often associated with a poor tumor response to chemotherapy, then the development of NRF2 inhibitors might help to improve treatment outcomes in patients with chemotherapy-resistant tumors.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030420">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030420</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>US National Cancer Institute information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/lung">lung cancer </ext-link>and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/treatment">cancer treatment</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>MedlinePlus entries on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000122.htm">small cell lung cancer</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007194.htm">NSCLC Cancer Research</ext-link> UK information on lung cancer</p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia entries on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer">lung cancer </ext-link>and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy">chemotherapy</ext-link> (note that Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit)</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Singh A, Misra V, Thimmulappa RK, Lee H, Ames S, et al.(2006) Dysfunctional KEAP1-NRF2 interaction in non-small-cell lung cancer.

Total NRF2 level was also higher in cancer cells, suggesting that there was increased stabilization of NRF2 in the absence of functional KEAP1. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of <italic>NRF2</italic> and NRF2-dependent target genes revealed that the majority of the NRF2 target genes were upregulated in the cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030420-g004">Figure 4</xref>D).

Evaluation of LOH at 19p13.2 in lung cancer cell lines from the Cancer Genome Project database at the Sanger Institute revealed allelic losses in 61&#x00025; of the NSCLC cell lines.

Most of the mutations affected highly conserved amino acids located in functionally important domains of KEAP1. We found four different deletions and one single base pair insertion, and all of these alterations (except the 18-bp deletion) introduced a premature stop codon that resulted in a truncated KEAP1 protein. All sequence alterations in this group were heterozygous in tumor DNA and found only in the smokers. Interestingly, the majority (9/10) of these mutations were detected only in adenocarcinomas. No mutations were detected in the paired normal tissue, which confirms that the tumor-derived mutations were somatic in origin. An overall mutation frequency of 19&#x00025; (10/54) for the <italic>KEAP1</italic> gene in NSCLC tissues suggests that <italic>KEAP1</italic> mutation is a frequent genetic alteration in NSCLC. Microsatellite-based genotyping of PT and paired normal tissues (39 pairs) demonstrated LOH for at least one of the markers in 41.0&#x00025; (16/39) of the PTs. Five of the six PTs harboring <italic>KEAP1</italic> mutations showed LOH of <italic>KEAP1;</italic> thus, as defined by the Knudson two-hit model, there was biallelic inactivation of <italic>KEAP1</italic> in these tumors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030420-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, given the intrinsic difficulties of genetic analysis in PTs, which are invariably contaminated with normal cells, we expect this frequency of mutation and LOH to be an underestimate. Detection of KEAP1 alterations in early stages of lung tumor development (stage IB, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0030420-st001">Table S1</xref>) further suggests that loss of KEAP1 function may be an early event in lung cancer pathogenesis. Future studies aimed at systematic evaluation of KEAP1 status in preinvasive preneoplastic lesions such as hyperplasia, dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ, as well as in late-stage invasive carcinoma, will provide insights regarding the role of the KEAP1&#x02013;NRF2 pathway in tumor progression.</p><p><italic>Keap1</italic>-null mutation in mice results in postnatal lethality because of constitutive Nrf2 activation, whereas heterozygous mutation of <italic>Keap1</italic> has no effect on Nrf2 activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030420-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. This finding suggests that loss of both functional <italic>KEAP1</italic> alleles is essential for constitutive activation of NRF2-mediated gene expression. Thus, a heterozygous mutation in <italic>KEAP1,</italic> as reported recently &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030420-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, may not effect NRF2-mediated cytoprotective gene expression. Here, we report&#x02014;to our knowledge for the first time&#x02014;biallelic inactivation of KEAP1 in NSCLC, which we believe would result in constitutive activation of NRF<italic>2</italic>.</p><p>In corroboration with the above findings that suggest loss of functional KEAP1 in lung cancers, immunohistochemical staining of NRF2 in lung adenocarcinoma tissues showed increased staining in tumor tissue compared to paired normal tissue. As anticipated, NQO1 and GST enzyme activities and GSH levels were significantly elevated in the tumors compared with those in the matched normal tissue. In the absence of functional KEAP1 activity, cancer cells demonstrated an increased nuclear accumulation of NRF2 as well as an increase in total NRF2. Predictably, the NQO1 and GSR enzyme activities and GSH levels were significantly higher in cancer cells. Expression analysis of NRF2-dependent genes revealed upregulation of antioxidant genes, detoxification enzymes, and drug efflux pumps in the cancer cells. GSH and related detoxification enzymes, including GSH-conjugating efflux pumps, are involved in the detoxification of anti-neoplastic drugs and by-products of oxidative stress. Upregulation of GSH and related enzymes in tumor tissues probably contributes to the observed high resistance to cytotoxic drugs and cell death &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030420-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The high antioxidant capacity of NSCLC cells increases cell survival and proliferation and protects against oxidants, radiation, and chemotherapies, thus conferring the chemoresistance phenotype &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030420-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030420-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.

Others have speculated that these alterations may account for the differences in drug sensitivity between these tumor types &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030420-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Several studies have documented that GSH concentrations are high in drug-resistant cancer cell lines and that cell viability can be modulated with buthionine sulfoximine, which causes GSH depletion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030420-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030420-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Expression of the wild-type KEAP1 in H838 cells stably expressing an ARE reporter completely abolished ARE reporter activity, whereas overexpression of the KEAP1 mutant construct did not, suggesting that the somatic mutations hamper the association between KEAP1 and NRF2 and consequently activate NRF2. Critically, the enhanced expression of various antioxidants and detoxification genes was verified to be NRF2-dependent, because siRNA targeted against <italic>NRF2</italic> transcript attenuated the expression of these NRF2-dependent genes in A549 cells. However, our understanding of NRF2-regulated genes is based on genomic profiling of Nrf2 wild-type and knock out mice in response to different environmental stress &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030420-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030420-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030420-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Other than the cellular antioxidants and xenobiotic enzymes, the global transcriptional program regulated by constitutive activation of NRF2 in tumor cells remains unknown. Elucidation of NRF2-dependent pathways in tumor cells will provide a better understanding of this novel chemoresistance factor.</p><p>Increased NRF2 staining and NRF2-dependent enzyme activities in tumor samples with wild-type KEAP1 suggests that there are other possible mechanisms operating in tumor cells that contribute to increased stabilization and activation of NRF2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030420-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030420-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. For example, Prothymosin &#x003b1;, an extremely abundant nuclear oncoprotein, has been recently demonstrated to be an intranuclear dissociator of NRF2&#x02013;KEAP1 complex and to upregulate expression of NRF2 target genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030420-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030420-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Another possible mechanism is differential splicing of <italic>KEAP1,</italic> leading to nonfunctional KEAP1 protein product in cancer cells. Alternatively spliced <italic>KEAP1</italic> transcript lacking exon 5 is reported in human large cell lung carcinoma (NCBI human genome database). Also, <italic>KEAP1</italic> downregulation by promoter methylation cannot be ruled out because the <italic>KEAP1</italic> promoter contains CpG-rich regions. It is also possible that chronic oxidative stress, resulting from increased metabolic activity in cancer cells, is contributing to activation of NRF2. Thus, more intensive studies are needed to unravel the mechanisms responsible for exaggerated NRF2 response in cancer cells even in the presence of wild-type <italic>KEAP1</italic>.</p><p>In summary, though activation of the NRF2 pathway in normal cells confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress and carcinogens, unrestrained activation of the same transcriptional program in cancer cells may provide selective growth advantages to tumors over normal somatic cells. The identification of <italic>KEAP1</italic> mutations in a subset of NSCLC samples and the association between loss of functional KEAP1 and increased NRF2 activity extends the emerging paradigm whereby increased expression of antioxidants, detoxification enzymes, and drug transporters favors malignant progression and renders tumors resistant to chemotherapy. While the number of tumors examined in this study is not sufficiently large to lead to a definitive conclusion, this study is the first to our knowledge to show that mutations and LOH in <italic>KEAP1,</italic> as well as possibly other non-mutation-based mechanisms, enable high NRF2 activity in primary lung tumors. It remains to be determined whether such a mechanism operates in cancers arising in other organs such as ovary, pancreas, brain, and breast, where chemoresistance is a major issue, and whether high NRF2 activity in tumors can be a biomarker of poor prognosis. If future experiments verify that enhanced activation of NRF2 is a key cause of chemoresistance and poor prognosis, one could envision development of specific siRNA or small molecule inhibitors of NRF2 for treatment of patients with tumors resistant to chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0030420-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Sequence Analysis Reveals Mutations in <italic>KEAP1</italic> in Lung Cancer Cell Lines and Tumor Tissues</title><p>(A) Representative DNA sequence data from lung cancer cell lines.
