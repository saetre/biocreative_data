Human chondrocytes and <italic>h</italic>PSCs isolated from cartilages and synovium of Osteoarthritis (OA) patients were cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum media or serum free media before treatment with IL-1&#x003b2;, TGF-&#x003b2;1, or Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). The expression of PAR-2 was detected using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting. Collagen zymography was performed to assess the activity of Matrix metalloproteinases-13 (MMP-13). It was demonstrated that IL-1&#x003b2; induces PAR-2 expression via p38 pathway in <italic>h</italic>PSCs. This induction can be repressed by TGF-&#x003b2; and was observed to persist for at least 48 hrs, suggesting that TGF-&#x003b2; inhibits PAR-2 expression through multiple pathways. First of all, TGF-&#x003b2; was able to inhibit PAR-2 activity by inhibiting IL-1&#x003b2;-induced p38 signal transduction and secondly the inhibition was also indirectly due to MMP-13 inactivation. Finally, TGF-&#x003b2; was able to induce CTGF, and in turn CTGF represses PAR-2 expression by inhibiting IL-1&#x003b2;-induced phospho-p38 level. TGF-&#x003b2; could prevent OA from progression with the anabolic ability to induce CTGF production to maintain extracellular matrix (ECM) integrity and to down regulate PAR-2 expression, and the anti-catabolic ability to induce Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) production to inhibit MMPs leading to avoid PAR-2 over-expression. Because IL-1&#x003b2;-induced PAR-2 expressed in <italic>h</italic>PSCs might play a significantly important role in early phase of OA, PAR-2 repression by exogenous TGF-&#x003b2; or other agents might be an ideal therapeutic target to prevent OA from progression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease characterized by depletion of articular cartilage and formation of osteophytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. OA formed under the condition of imbalance between anabolic and catabolic mediators, when catabolism is greater than anabolism, the risk of OA raises. The catabolic mediators include MMPs, ADAMTS, ADAM, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-17, IL-18 and TNF-&#x003b1;, which increase degradation of cartilage and inhibit synthesis of metalloproteinase inhibitors such as TIMPs, tenascin and YKL-40. The anabolic mediators include TGF-&#x003b2;, IGF-1, FGFs and BMPs, which stimulate synthesis and repairing of cartilage. The secreted proinflammatory cytokines and metalloproteinases up-regulate expression of chondrocyte PAR-2, stimulating more secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and metalloproteinases to enhance inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and degradation of ECM components of cartilage tissue, causing progressive loss of cartilage. Furthermore, fragments of protein degradation, like fibronectin fragments and collagen type II fragments, seem to play a role in inducing degradation of cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] as well as stimulating chondrocytes to repair the matrix.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2;, a prominent member of the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily of ligands which include TGF-&#x003b2; s and BMPs, is vital for the homeostasis of numerous cellular functions, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis in a broad spectrum of tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; signals are propagated through direct physical interactions with the extracellular domain of essentially two transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors (T&#x003b2;-RI and T&#x003b2;-RII), which transduce a number of secondary signals, most notably Smads 2 and 3 as well as PI3-kinase and various members of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. CTGF, a member of CCN family, is a cysteine-rich matricellular protein. Expression of this protein is potently induced by TGF-&#x003b2; via Smad pathway. CTGF promotes chondrocytes proliferation through p38 MAPK and differentiation via p42/p44 MAPK. Thus, CTGF is important for cell proliferation and matrix remodeling during chondrogenesis and is a key regulator coupling ECM remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Several studies have proved that CTGF can stimulate the proliferation and expression of the cartilage phenotype by promoting type II collagen and aggrecan production, but did not stimulate the terminal hypertrophy or calcification of articular cartilage cells, suggesting that CTGF might be useful in the repair of damaged articular cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Other report suggested that TGF-&#x003b2; antagonizes IL-1&#x003b2;-mediated inflammation via decreasing its receptor expression on chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and TGF-&#x003b2; and CTGF play a critical role in cartilage matrix repairing; in addition, TGF-&#x003b2; is an anabolic and anti-catabolic factor of articular cartilage.</p><p>PARs are a family of four G-protein-coupled receptors which included four members: PAR-1, PAR-2, PAR-3, and PAR-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Among PARs, PAR-2 is unique in that it is activated by trypsin and mast cell tryptase, but not by thrombin which activates the other three members of the PAR family. This study focuses on PAR-2, which plays an important role in inflammation and pain. Trypsin cleaves PAR-2 at R<sup>34</sup>&#x02193;S<sup>35</sup>LIGKV of the extracellular N-terminus to expose the hexameric tethered peptide that binds to conserved regions in extracellular second loop of the receptor to initiate signaling. During activation, PAR-2 couples to G&#x003b1; q/11, resulting in activation of phospholipase C-&#x003b2;, production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, and then activation of protein kinase C. In addition, PAR-2 can activate ERK1/2 MAPK, mediating cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recently, it was reported that PAR-2 was expressed on chondrocytes and synovial cells and it was overexpressed on osteoarthritic chondrocytes. The expression level of PAR-2 on chondrocytes is up-regulated by IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; but down-regulated by TGF-&#x003b2;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In human chondrocytes, a recent study has reported that TGF-&#x003b2; induced TIMP-3 via PI3K/Akt signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Several models have been proposed to explain how TGF-&#x003b2; may activate the PI3K/Akt pathway. A recent study further suggests that T&#x003b2;-RI associates with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, thus enabling activation of the p110&#x003b1; catalytic subunit of PI3K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In this study, we aim to study the mechanism how TGF-&#x003b2; represses IL-1&#x003b2;-induced PAR-2 expression in human primary synovial cells (<italic>h</italic>PSCs). Our findings emphasize that TGF-&#x003b2; represses IL-1&#x003b2;-induced PAR-2 expression via multiple pathways including TGF-&#x003b2; directly inhibits IL-1&#x003b2; induced p-p38 level; TGF-&#x003b2; represses human synovial PAR-2 via Akt-TIMP3-MMP13 pathway; TGF-&#x003b2; induces CTGF formation, and then CTGF reduces PAR-2 protein level in <italic>h</italic>PSCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Isolation and culture of human primary chondrocytes and synovial cells (<italic>h</italic>PSC)</title><p>Joint tissues were obtained from patients with OA undergoing implant surgery for total knee replacement.

According to available reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], we know that PAR-2 is unique in its distribution property because PAR-2 is the only member of this family expressed in human chondrocytes. In contrast, <italic>h</italic>PSCs express PAR-1, PAR-2, and PAR-3. But in our study, it was observed that PAR-1, PAR-2, and PAR-3 are expressed in both human chondrocytes and <italic>h</italic>PSCs. Nevertheless, we found that the mRNA levels of PAR-1, PAR-2, and PAR-3 were significantly induced by IL-1&#x003b2; in human chondrocytes, but only PAR-2 mRNA was up-regulated by IL-1&#x003b2; in <italic>h</italic>PSCs.

It was proved in this study that TGF-&#x003b2; inhibits PAR-2 expression in <italic>h</italic>PSCs through three pathways: by directly inhibition on p38 phosphorylation, by inducing TIMP-3 which in turn results MMP-13 dysfunction to ease inflammation cascade, and by induction CTGF to block p38 signal pathway leading to inhibit the proliferation of inflammatory cells.</p><p>It was seen that TGF-&#x003b2; inhibited p-p38 pathway, the major signal pathway which mediated PAR-2 expression by <italic>h</italic>PSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), soon after 15 minutes of treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This is the first mechanism of TGF-&#x003b2; suppressed PAR-2 which occurred at the time point of 12 to 24 hrs as observed by Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>.</p><p>It should be noticed that PAR-2 was up-regulated under the exposure to higher MMP-13 concentration for 24 hrs in <italic>h</italic>PSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). This might be due to higher MMP-13 concentration further enhanced inflammatory response of synovial cells to stimulate IL-1&#x003b2; secretion. It was considered that up-regulation of PAR-2 by MMPs might be indirectly. Hence, blocking MMP-13 can also prevent over-expression of PAR-2. Besides direct inhibition of p38 signal pathway, TGF-&#x003b2; might inhibit PAR-2 through TGF-&#x003b2;-TIMP-MMP-PAR2 cascade. According to our studies, TIMP-3 protein was significantly induced by TGF-&#x003b2; after 6 to 24 hrs of treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) to block MMP-13. Once MMP-13 was blocked, PAR-2 level decreased within 24 hrs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). In brief, inhibition of PAR-2 expression by TGF&#x003b2;-TIMP-MMP-PAR2 cascade lies during the time period of 24 to 36 hr.</p><p>It was observed that CTGF activated ERK but inhibited p38 pathway induced by IL-1&#x003b2; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) in <italic>h</italic>PSCs, of which was different for CTGF in human chondrocytes which activated both ERK and p38 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. As reported, CTGF stimulates proliferation via p38 MAPK resulting in chondrocytes growth and differentiation through p42/p44 MAPK pathway resulting in ECM specific marker expression. In contrast, CTGF activated p42/p44 rather than p38 in <italic>h</italic>PSCs, suggesting that CTGF mediates differentiation and ECM specific marker expression (data not shown) via p42/p44 pathway but not via p38 pathway (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). This might be the reason explained that over-expression of CTGF in human chondrocytes results in osteophyte formation but over-expression of CTGF in <italic>h</italic>PSCs does not lead to osteophyte formation.</p><p>It is noticeable that CTGF enhanced TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated p38 inhibition in <italic>h</italic>PSC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).

So, another pathway that TGF-&#x003b2; inhibits p38 is by inducing CTGF to reduce phospho-p38 level. It was observed that TGF-&#x003b2; significantly induced CTGF protein level after 12 to 48 hrs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) and then PAR-2 was repressed by CTGF after 24 hrs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). It was concluded that the inhibition of p38 induced by IL-1&#x003b2; via TGF-&#x003b2;-CTGF-p38 cascade occurs during the time period of 36 to 48 hr.</p><p>In conclusion, this study suggests that TGF-&#x003b2; inhibits IL-1&#x003b2; induced PAR-2 expression level through three pathway at various time points. First, TGF-&#x003b2; directly inhibits IL-1&#x003b2; induced p-p38 level within 24 hrs. Secondary, TGF-&#x003b2; induces TIMP-3 expression resulting in suppression of MMP-13 function, leading that PAR-2 over-expression being eased off by TGF-&#x003b2;-TIMP3-MMP13 cascade occurs during the time period of 24 to 36 hr. Finally, TGF-&#x003b2; induces CTGF formation after 12 hrs, and CTGF reduces PAR-2 protein level in <italic>h</italic>PSCs after 24 hrs, this TGF-&#x003b2;-CTGF-PAR2 cascade occurs during the time period of 36 to 48 hr. Because IL-1&#x003b2;-induced PAR-2 expressed in <italic>h</italic>PSCs might play a significantly important role in early phase of OA, PAR2 repression by exogenous TGF-&#x003b2; or other agents might be an ideal therapeutic target to prevent OA from progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ADAM: a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-like (or, alternatively, adamalysin); ADAMTS: a <underline>d</underline>isintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombo spondin motifs (or, alternatively, adamalysin-thrombospondin); ECM: extracellular matrix; GAG: glycosaminoglycan; IL: interleukin; MMPs: matrix metalloproteinases; TIMP: tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; PAR-2: proteinase-activated receptor-2; TGF-&#x003b2;: Transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;; CTGF: connective tissue growth factor; TNF-&#x003b1;: Tissue necrotic factor-&#x003b1;; BMPs: bone morphogenetic proteins; PI3K/Akt: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt; p42/p44 MAPK: also called Erk2 and Erk1.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SH, YC and SS conceived of the study, and participated in its design and coordination.
