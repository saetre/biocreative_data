In this study, we report that viperin specifically localizes to the cytoplasmic face of the ER and that an amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix at its N terminus is necessary for the ER localization of viperin and sufficient to promote ER localization of a reporter protein, dsRed. Overexpression of intact viperin but not the amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix fused to dsRed induced crystalloid ER. Consistent with other proteins that induce crystalloid ER, viperin self-associates, and it does so independently of the amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix. Viperin expression also affected the transport of soluble but not membrane-associated proteins. Expression of intact viperin or an N-terminal &#x003b1;-helix-dsRed fusion protein significantly reduced secretion of soluble alkaline phosphatase and reduced its rate of ER-to-Golgi trafficking. Similarly, viperin expression inhibited bulk protein secretion and secretion of endogenous &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin and serum albumin from HepG2 cells. Converting hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal &#x003b1;-helix to acidic residues partially or completely restored normal transport of soluble alkaline phosphatase, suggesting that the extended amphipathic nature of the N-terminal &#x003b1;-helical domain is essential for inhibiting protein secretion.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>The work was supported by the <grant-sponsor>Ellison Foundation</grant-sponsor> and the <grant-sponsor>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</grant-sponsor>.

The significance of the interferon pathway is illustrated by the susceptibility of interferon signaling mutants to infection and by viral mechanisms that counteract this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). Although many genes are induced upon interferon stimulation, very few of these genes have been functionally characterized. Viperin is highly induced by both Type I and II interferons and has a broad range of antiviral activity, inhibiting DNA viruses, notably human cytomegalovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>); RNA viruses such as influenza, hepatitis C virus (HCV),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">2</xref> and alphaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>); and retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Upon expression, viperin localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it interacts with farnesyl-diphosphate synthase, an enzyme involved in lipid biosynthesis. This interaction appears to result in the disruption of lipid raft microdomains and prevention of influenza virus from budding from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>).</p><p>Although recent studies have explored the antiviral functions of viperin, the general biochemical properties of this protein remain largely undefined. Viperin is highly conserved across both mammals and lower vertebrates and shares homology with the MoaA family of &#x0201c;radical <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine&#x0201d; enzymes that bind Fe-S clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). In addition to a putative Fe-S cluster-binding domain, viperin has a 42-amino acid residue N-terminal amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix, and similar domains in other proteins have been shown to bind membranes and induce membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examined the role of the viperin N-terminal &#x003b1;-helical domain in both cellular localization and ER membrane morphology and analyzed the biochemical properties of viperin. We discovered that viperin forms dimers and induces a tightly ordered, visually striking array of ER membranes, known as crystalloid ER(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), upon overexpression. In addition, viperin expression impedes the secretion of a variety of soluble proteins. Although the N-terminal amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix is not sufficient to induce crystalloid ER formation, it is both necessary and sufficient to mediate ER localization and to inhibit protein secretion.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Cells, Antibodies, and Constructs</italic>&#x02014;HepG2, HeLa, and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% bovine calf serum.

To determine whether viperin localizes to the cytosolic or lumenal face of the ER, we used streptolysin O to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane, followed by staining with the anti-viperin monoclonal antibody MaP.VIP. An anti-tapasin antibody that recognizes a lumenal ER epitope and an anti-calnexin antibody that recognizes a cytosolic epitope were used as controls. Under these conditions, viperin and calnexin staining was readily observed, whereas the ER lumenal epitope of tapasin was detected only after saponin permeabilization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). This demonstrated that viperin was localized to the cytosolic face of the ER. To identify the domain responsible, we focused on the N-terminal &#x003b1;-helix because it has a wide hydrophobic face that is characteristic of helices that not only bind to the ER but also induce membrane curvature. First, to determine whether the &#x003b1;-helix is necessary for ER localization, we used immunofluorescence to examine cells expressing WT viperin or a deletion mutant lacking this domain (viperin-(&#x00394;1-42)). WT viperin colocalized with ER resident proteins, namely human TAP1 fused to the fluorescent protein tag Cherry and calnexin, but removing the &#x003b1;-helix relocalized viperin to the cytosol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Adding the N-terminal &#x003b1;-helix of viperin to dsRed was also sufficient to relocalize this reporter protein from the cytosol and nucleus to the ER (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p><p><italic>Viperin Overexpression Induces Crystalloid ER</italic>&#x02014;To confirm the ER localization of viperin, we used immunoelectron microscopy to examine 293T cells expressing viperin. We observed that these cells contained membranous structures highly similar to previously described crystalloid ER, characterized by the distortion of smooth ER membranes into a lattice-like pattern (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). However, the amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix-dsRed fusion protein did not induce these morphological changes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>), indicating that the &#x003b1;-helical domain is not sufficient to induce crystalloid ER. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that viperin was highly concentrated in these membranous areas in addition to normal ER (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). Further analysis of viperin-expressing cells by immunofluorescence using Triton X-100 rather than saponin for permeabilization confirmed that expression of WT viperin but not viperin-(&#x00394;1-42) or the &#x003b1;-helix-dsRed fusion protein induced dramatically distorted ER structures, defined by the presence of calnexin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Viperin localizes to the cytosolic face of the ER through its N-terminal amphipathic</bold>&#x003b1;<bold>-helix.</bold><italic>A</italic>, HeLa cells transiently expressing viperin and tapasin were treated with streptolysin O (<italic>SLO</italic>) to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane or completely permeabilized with saponin.

Using Myc- and HA-tagged viperin expression vectors, we overexpressed these proteins in 293T cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation studies on detergent extracts. HA-tagged viperin co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged viperin but not with a Myc-tagged control protein, Rp14 (<underline>r</underline>ibosomal <underline>p</underline>rotein <underline>14</underline>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). To determine whether this self-interaction requires the N-terminal amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix, we performed similar co-immunoprecipitations with HA- and Myc-tagged viperin-(&#x00394;1-42) truncation mutants. The viperin mutants were also capable of self-association, indicating that viperin dimerization or multimerization can occur independently of the amphipathic &#x003b1;-helical domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>The N-terminal Amphipathic</italic> &#x003b1;<italic>-Helix Is Necessary and Sufficient to Inhibit Protein Secretion</italic>&#x02014;To determine whether the viperin-induced morphological changes affected ER function, we examined protein trafficking in viperin-expressing cells. Viperin expression in HepG2 cells caused a reduction in protein secretion, as measured by the amount of <sup>35</sup>S-labeled proteins secreted into the supernatant normalized to the total amount of <sup>35</sup>S-labeled proteins in whole cell extracts. Although expression of the green fluorescent protein control had no effect on protein secretion relative to the vector control, viperin expression reduced total protein secretion from HepG2 cells to levels comparable with those observed in cells expressing dominant-negative Sar1 and Arf1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>Sar1dn</italic> and <italic>Arf1dn</italic>) previously shown to dramatically affect protein secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). By combining pulse-chase analysis and immunoprecipitations from cell supernatants and extracts, we specifically examined the secretion of endogenous albumin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>), and transferrin (data not shown) by <sup>35</sup>S-labeled HepG2 cells and found that secretion of all three of these soluble proteins was significantly reduced in viperin-expressing cells.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Viperin self-interacts independently of the N-terminal amphipathic</bold> &#x003b1;<bold>-helix.</bold> 293T cells were transiently transfected with HA- and Myc-tagged WT viperin or viperin-(&#x00394;1-42), lysed, and then examined by Western blotting (<italic>WB</italic>) for protein expression and by co-immunoprecipitation (<italic>IP</italic>) with a control or anti-HA antibody for protein dimerization. Rp14-Myc served as a negative control, and Grp94 served as a protein loading control.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0110966690003"></graphic></fig></p><p>To determine whether the reduction in protein secretion was a direct consequence of crystalloid ER formation or a separate function associated with the N-terminal amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix, we cotransfected various constructs into 293T cells along with the secreted version of placental alkaline phosphatase lacking the membrane anchor (SeAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). SeAP secretion was assayed enzymatically, and intracellular transport was assessed using pulse-chase radiolabeling, immunoprecipitation, and endoglycosidase H digestion. The N-terminal amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix (amino acids 1-42) alone was able to reduce SeAP secretion to levels comparable with WT viperin, whereas secretion in cells expressing viperin-(&#x00394;1-42) was comparable with that in cells expressing the vector control or the control protein Rp14 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Pulse-chase analysis of SeAP showed that that the amphipathic &#x003b1;-helical domain was both necessary and sufficient to inhibit the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of SeAP, measured by the rate of acquisition of endoglycosidase H resistance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Furthermore, the N-terminal amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix fused to monomeric dsRed also inhibited SeAP secretion and significantly delayed the acquisition of endoglycosidase H resistance compared with the vector control or dsRed alone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>).</p><p>Although viperin expression affected the secretion of soluble proteins, there was no discernible effect on the intracellular trafficking rates of membrane-bound proteins. Using a temperature-sensitive variant of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (ts045), we found that the rate at which vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein arrived at the cell surface after shifting to the permissive temperature was comparable in viperin-expressing and control cells (supplemental Fig. 1<italic>A</italic>). Similarly, the rate at which placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that is truncated before the transmembrane domain to yield the soluble SeAP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>), arrived at the cell surface was unaffected in viperin-expressing cells (supplemental Fig. 1<italic>B</italic>). However, transport was significantly delayed by expression of the dominant-negative version of Sar1. Furthermore, viperin expression did not alter the ER-to-Golgi trafficking rates of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (data not shown) or placental alkaline phosphatase, as measured by the acquisition of endoglycosidase H resistance in radiolabel pulse-chase experiments, whereas dominant-negative versions of Sar1 and Arf1 effectively reduced the transport rate (supplemental Fig. 1<italic>C</italic>).</p><p><italic>Mutating Hydrophobic Residues in the Amphipathic</italic> &#x003b1;<italic>-Helix Restores Protein Secretion</italic>&#x02014;Arrangement of the N-terminal domain of viperin into a helical wheel showed the classic amphipathic arrangement of residues, with hydrophobic amino acids localized on an extended face of the &#x003b1;-helix (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). To determine whether this face of the &#x003b1;-helix is involved in inhibiting protein secretion, specific hydrophobic residues were mutated to alanine or glutamic acid (<italic>circled</italic> in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>), and charged arginine residues were mutated to serine (<italic>pink</italic> in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). Although mutating hydrophobic residues to alanine or charged arginine residues to serine did not alter the ability of viperin to inhibit protein secretion (data not shown), mutating hydrophobic residues to glutamic acid partially or completely restored protein secretion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). Although none of the single glutamic acid substitutions affected the ER localization of viperin (supplemental Fig. 2), mutating three hydrophobic residues to glutamic acid disrupted ER association (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). In addition, sequentially deleting turns in the &#x003b1;-helix disrupted ER association, resulting in the progressive relocalization of viperin to the cytosol (supplemental Fig. 3).</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Viperin has a broad range of antiviral activity and is highly conserved in evolution, suggesting that it is functionally extremely important. As is the case for other interferon-induced antiviral proteins, the precise mechanism(s) of action of viperin remains largely unknown. To date, the only mechanistic information indicates an effect of viperin expression on lipid raft microdomains and a potential role for the conserved putative Fe-S-binding motif in HCV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). In this study, we identified and examined the properties of the different domains of viperin. We showed that a region in the C-terminal domain is important for protein dimerization and that the N-terminal amphipathic &#x003b1;-helical domain is required for ER localization and interferes with the secretion of soluble proteins.</p><p>Overexpression of viperin induced dramatic changes in ER morphology that are characteristic of crystalloid ER. Crystalloid ER is induced by a number of membrane-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Current models for crystalloid ER formation propose that smooth ER is morphologically altered when the cytoplasmic domains of ER-bound proteins form high affinity dimers and bring apposing membranes together to form a lattice-like pattern of hexagonally packed tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Consistent with this model, we showed that viperin self-interacts to form multimers, likely to be dimers. The interaction occurred in viperin truncation mutants lacking the amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix, arguing that it is independent of the ER localization domain. However, preliminary size exclusion data (data not shown) obtained with purified, soluble, recombinant viperin lacking the N-terminal &#x003b1;-helical domain suggest that the extent of dimerization is low in solution; membrane association may enhance the tendency to multimerize by limiting movement to the plane of the membrane. We did not find that viperin expression and crystalloid ER formation induced the unfolded protein response, based on analysis of XBP-1 mRNA processing (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Viperin reduces protein secretion by HepG2 cells.</bold><italic>A</italic>, HepG2 cells expressing the indicated proteins were radiolabeled with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine for 1 h and then chased for 2 h.

We also failed to find any effects on steady-state levels or localization of a number of ER resident proteins, including tapasin, calnexin, ERp57, and Grp94 (data not shown). Expressing a fusion protein containing the amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix N-terminal to monomeric dsRed did not induce crystalloid ER formation but still inhibited protein secretion to a level comparable with that observed with WT viperin. We hypothesize that the N-terminal amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix induces localized membrane curvature that is further exacerbated upon viperin dimerization via its C terminus to cause crystalloid ER formation. Previous reports have shown that amphipathic &#x003b1;-helices modulate membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). Specifically, amphipathic &#x003b1;-helices with wide hydrophobic faces, notably Sar1, localize to the ER and induce membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). When specific hydrophobic residues on the Sar1 helical wheel were changed to alanine, the mutant Sar1 proteins induced altered membrane tubulation and affected the size of liposomes generated <italic>in vitro</italic> in association with Sar1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). Our mutational analysis of the amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix of viperin showed that more dramatic changes were required to observe an effect on secretion in that the hydrophobic residues needed to be changed to charged glutamic acid residues rather than alanine residues. This may be because the amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix of viperin, which consists of 42 amino acids compared with 23 residues in the case of Sar1, has a more extended hydrophobic face. Also compatible with this idea is the observation that more than four helical turns had to be deleted or at least three hydrophobic residues had to be mutated to glutamic acid to induce dissociation of viperin from the ER membrane.</p><p>Crystalloid ER formation upon viperin expression is consistent with an increase in membrane curvature of the ER, which may be caused by the amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix and exacerbated by viperin dimerization. It is tempting to infer that the increase in membrane curvature is also responsible for the reduction in protein secretion that is observed upon expression of viperin or the amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix linked to the marker protein dsRed. Although not demonstrated here, the association of viperin with secretory coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles and an enhancement of membrane curvature caused by the &#x003b1;-helix could reduce the size of the vesicles. Geometric principles suggest that a reduction in the volume of secretory vesicles induced by a reduction in curvature would reduce the incorporation of soluble cargo to a much greater extent than transmembrane cargo, which might explain the suppressive effect of viperin expression on the transport of soluble but not membrane-associated proteins. Unfortunately, attempts to purify recombinant WT viperin were unsuccessful, and therefore, we were unable to measure membrane curvature of viperin-associated liposomes <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, the similarities between the amphipathic &#x003b1;-helices of viperin and Sar1 suggest a similar mechanism of ER localization and potentially similar effects on membrane curvature. Alternative hypotheses for a viperin-induced reduction in soluble protein secretion but not membrane-associated proteins do exist, however. For example, viperin could differentially associate with vesicles bearing soluble or transmembrane cargo. Resolution of this question awaits additional experiments.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>The N-terminal amphipathic</bold> &#x003b1;<bold>-helix of viperin is necessary and sufficient to delay ER-to-Golgi trafficking of SeAP.</bold><italic>A</italic>, 293T cells were transiently transfected with SeAP and the indicated amounts of viperin or control constructs and then analyzed for SeAP secretion 24 h post-transfection.

Viperin may inhibit the trafficking of soluble virally encoded and cellular proteins necessary for viral replication, and certain viruses also use membranes derived from the ER for viral replication, budding, and exit via the secretory route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Therefore, one of the antiviral functions of viperin may be to prevent or alter the formation of these membranous complexes, thus affecting viral replication or egress. A previous report suggests that viperin inhibits HCV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>), which is known to generate a replication complex potentially derived from ER membranes. Future studies will investigate if viperin can specifically alter formation of the HCV replication complex and prevent HCV replication.</p><p>Although viperin shares significant homology with the MoaA family of radical <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine enzymes and contains a characteristic conserved C<italic>xxx</italic>C<italic>xx</italic>C motif, to date, we have been unable to show that viperin binds iron. Both <sup>55</sup>Felabeling of viperin-expressing yeast and heavy metal analysis of soluble recombinant viperin produced in insect cells showed no binding of iron or other heavy metals (data not shown). However, a previous study showed that mutating these three cysteines to alanines abolished the anti-HCV activity of viperin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). It is possible that viperin binds Fe-S clusters weakly or transiently or that our expression systems were insufficient to detect metal binding to mammalian viperin. Alternatively, these cysteines may be critical for coordinating another, unknown activity. To further investigate these possibilities, future studies should examine such viperin mutants for antiviral activity against other viruses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M807261200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M807261200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs.
