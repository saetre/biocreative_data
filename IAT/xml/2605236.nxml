However, the mechanisms involved in breaking the immunological tolerance against these poorly immunogenic nuclear components are not fully understood. Impaired phagocytosis of apoptotic cells with consecutive release of nuclear antigens may contribute to the immune pathogenesis. The architectural chromosomal protein and proinflammatory mediator high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is tightly attached to the chromatin of apoptotic cells. We demonstrate that HMGB1 remains bound to nucleosomes released from late apoptotic cells in vitro. HMGB1&#x02013;nucleosome complexes were also detected in plasma from SLE patients. HMGB1-containing nucleosomes from apoptotic cells induced secretion of interleukin (IL) 1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) &#x003b1; and expression of costimulatory molecules in macrophages and dendritic cells (DC), respectively. Neither HMGB1-free nucleosomes from viable cells nor nucleosomes from apoptotic cells lacking HMGB1 induced cytokine production or DC activation. HMGB1-containing nucleosomes from apoptotic cells induced anti-dsDNA and antihistone IgG responses in a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2&#x02013;dependent manner, whereas nucleosomes from living cells did not. In conclusion, HMGB1&#x02013;nucleosome complexes activate antigen presenting cells and, thereby, may crucially contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE via breaking the immunological tolerance against nucleosomes/dsDNA.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; HMGB1, high mobility group box protein 1; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; pDC, plasmacytoid DC; PEG, polyethylene glycol; RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation end products; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; TLR, Toll-like receptor.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease of largely unknown etiology. Genetic and environmental factors such as smoking, UV exposure, and infections increase the risk of disease manifestation. Virtually every organ in the human body can be involved, especially skin, joints, hematopoietic system, kidneys, central nervous system, and heart, thereby causing an ample variety of symptoms.</p><p>Autoantibodies against double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and nucleosomes represent a serological hallmark of SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). These autoantibodies can form immune complexes and immune deposits within kidneys and blood vessels and, hence, crucially contribute to the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis and vasculitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). However, the mechanisms that cause breakage of the immunological tolerance against native chromosomal DNA and nucleosomes, which by themselves are poorly immunogenic, are not understood.</p><p>High mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is an evolutionary conserved ubiquitously expressed chromosomal protein consisting of two positively charged DNA binding domains, called HMG box A and B, and a negatively charged C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). HMGB1 binds to dsDNA, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), distorted DNA, and nucleosomes. HMGB1 stabilizes the structure of nucleosomes and induces DNA bending, thereby participating in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Recently, it has been described that HMGB1 can also act as a proinflammatory mediator when released from cells. Binding of HMGB1 to the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the release of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). In addition, HMGB1 induces up-regulation of activation markers (HLA-DR, CD83, CD80, and CD86) on DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><p>Extracellular HMGB1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of several diseases. Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) showed that HMGB1 is a crucial mediator of late lethality from septic shock. Extracellular HMGB1 has been reported in experimental arthritis models as well as in human rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Importantly, systemic application of either the antagonistic box A or HMGB1-neutralizing antibodies ameliorated collagen-induced arthritis in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).</p><p>During apoptosis, a substantial amount of nuclear HMGB1 gets tightly attached to hypoacetylated chromatin, thereby preventing HMGB1 release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). We hypothesized that in case of clearance deficiency, as found in 30&#x02013;50% of patients with SLE, uningested apoptotic cells may undergo secondary necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). During secondary necrosis, the majority of HMGB1 remains bound to nucleosomes in the insoluble nuclear remnants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>); however, a fraction of the nucleosomes themselves are released in soluble form and may carry along the tightly bound proinflammatory HMGB1.</p><p>It was previously shown that extracellular HMGB1 is present within lesional skin in patients with chronic cutaneous lupus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Moreover, we recently detected HMGB1 in serum and plasma of patients with SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). In this paper, we demonstrate that HMGB1&#x02013;nucleosome complexes are released from secondary necrotic cells and can be found in the blood of patients with SLE. HMGB1&#x02013;nucleosome complexes purified from apoptotic cells induced cytokine expression in macrophages and maturation of DC. In contrast, neither nucleosomes from viable cells nor nucleosomes from apoptotic cells devoid of HMGB1 and with a low level of HMGB2 (HMGB<sup>low</sup>) induced any marked cytokine release. Importantly, immunization with nucleosomes from apoptotic, but not with those from viable cells, resulted in significantly increased anti-dsDNA and antihistone antibody titers in nonautoimmune mice. Hence, nucleosomes with tightly bound HMGB1 may play a crucial role in breaking the immunological tolerance against dsDNA, which represents a key autoantigen in SLE.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Nucleosomes released from late apoptotic cells contain HMGB1</title><p>During apoptotic cell death, oligo- and mononucleosomes are generated by internucleosomal cleavage of chromatin by endonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). In vivo, the appearance of nucleosomes in the circulation is normally prevented by the effective elimination of apoptotic cells by phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). In vitro, nucleosomes are released into culture supernatants when the dying cells enter late stages of apoptosis, i.e., secondary necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). To investigate whether nucleosomes spontaneously released from secondary necrotic cells contain HMGB1, we induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells either by UV irradiation (unpublished data) or staurosporine treatment for 48 h, when virtually all cells had undergone secondary necrosis. Primary necrosis was induced by heat treatment. Using different antihistone and anti-dsDNA antibodies, HMGB1 was precipitated from supernatants of secondary necrotic cells but not from those of primary necrotic cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). From supernatants of primary heat-induced necrotic cells, HMGB1 was precipitated only by anti-HMGB1 antibodies, indicating that HMGB1 released from primary necrotic cells is not associated with nucleosomes. Early apoptotic cells did not release detectable amounts of HMGB1 (unpublished data). Hence, nucleosomes released from cultured cells undergoing secondary necrosis are, at least partially, associated with HMGB1.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>HMGB1 is associated with nucleosomes spontaneously released during secondary necrosis.</bold> For induction of secondary necrosis (SN), Jurkat cells were treated with 2 &#x003bc;M staurosporine for 48 h.

To test if these circulating immune complexes contain HMGB1, immune complexes were precipitated from sera of patients with SLE and other diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, allergies, and infections, as well as from healthy controls, and analyzed by Western blotting. In six of eight SLE sera, HMGB1 was readily detectable. In contrast, in precipitates of 4 healthy donors and 10 non-SLE patients, no or very little HMGB1 could be detected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and not depicted).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Nucleosomes circulating in the blood of patients with SLE are complexed with HMGB1.</bold> (A) Circulating immune complexes in the blood of patients with SLE contain HMGB1.

Mononucleosomes were predominantly found in fraction 4 of all preparations as demonstrated by detection of mononucleosomal DNA and histones (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In the case of viable cells, HMGB1 was found almost exclusively at the top of the gradient in the fractions that did not contain nucleosomes/DNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In preparations from necrotic cells, only minute amounts of HMGB1 were detected in the mononucleosomes containing fractions 4 and 5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). In cells necrotized by other means, such as freeze thaw, most HMGB1 was found at the top of the gradient, and again only minute amounts of HMGB1 were detected in association with mononucleosomes or in the high molecular mass fractions 6&#x02013;8 (unpublished data). Only preparations from apoptotic cells contained substantial amounts of HMGB1 in nucleosomal fractions 4 and 5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). In addition, relatively large quantities of HMGB1 were found at the top of the density gradient from apoptotic cells, indicating free HMGB1. Fraction 4, mainly containing mononucleosomes, was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining of gels to proof the predominant composition of histones and the purity of the preparations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that HMGB1 is primarily attached to nucleosomes from apoptotic cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>HMGB1 cofractionates with nucleosomes from apoptotic cells.</bold> For induction of apoptosis, Jurkat cells were treated with 1 &#x003bc;M staurosporine for 8 h.

Apoptotic nucleosomes, which contained substantial amounts of HMGB1, potently stimulated the secretion of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and IL-10, whereas nucleosomes from viable cells, which did not contain HMGB1, failed to induce cytokine release. Nucleosomes from necrotic cells containing less HMGB1 than those from apoptotic cells induced measurable cytokine secretion but less than apoptotic nucleosomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). We could not detect IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-8, and IL-18 secretion by human macrophages after exposure to nucleosomes (unpublished data). Similar results were obtained using mouse peritoneal macrophages (unpublished data). Nucleosomes isolated from cells treated with other inducers of apoptosis, such as anti-Fas antibodies or UV irradiation, elicited comparable cytokine release to nucleosomes from staurosporine-treated cells (unpublished data). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in cytokine induction by nucleosomes prepared from early or late apoptotic cells (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081165/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081165/DC1</ext-link>). Importantly, nucleosomes spontaneously released from late apoptotic cells also induced cytokine release from human monocyte-derived macrophages (Fig. S2).

Usually, purified dsDNA and nucleosomes are poorly immunogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). It is still unknown why nucleosomes, which are ubiquitous and abundant self components, become immunogenic in SLE. Mono- and oligonucleosomes are formed during apoptosis by cleavage of chromatin and might appear on the cell surface and in apoptotic blebs at later stages of the apoptotic death process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Normally, apoptotic cells are removed swiftly by phagocytes before nucleosomes are released. However, if dying cells enter late stages of apoptosis, nucleosomes are released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). We detected nucleosomes complexed with HMGB1 in the supernatants of secondary necrotic but not primary necrotic cells. Hence, in conditions with impaired clearance of apoptotic cells, as is observed in a subset of patients with SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), nucleosomes complexed with the endogenous adjuvant HMGB1 may get released and foster an autoimmune response.</p><p>In fact, nucleosomes are often detectable in the blood of patients with SLE and are thought to result from in vivo cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). Nucleosomes and DNA appeared in a dose-dependent manner in the plasma of mice treated with apoptosis-inducing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). In SLE, nucleosomes predominantly exist in the form of immune complexes because of the presence of respective autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). We detected HMGB1 in circulating immune complexes from SLE patients but not from controls. Because of the presence of autoantibodies to HMGB1 in a substantial number of patients with SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>), there could also be immune complexes containing only HMGB1. However, coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that HMGB1 that was detectable in the serum and plasma of SLE patients was, at least partially, associated with dsDNA and nucleosomes. No HMGB1-containing immune complexes were detectable in healthy individuals, although anti-HMGB1 antibodies were also present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). Most likely, in healthy subjects HMGB1 is usually not released because of a rapid clearance of dying cells; hence, no immune complexes are formed. Previous studies demonstrated that, in apoptotic cells, HMGB1 is firmly bound to hypoacetylated chromatin, even after undergoing secondary necrosis. In contrast, HMGB1 is rapidly lost from chromatin of primary necrotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Therefore, HMGB1&#x02013;nucleosome complexes in the blood of patients with SLE might be predominantly derived from secondary necrotic rather than from primary necrotic cells.</p><p>Recent findings of Bell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>) demonstrated that HMGB1 release may not be an exclusive feature of primary necrosis. At least in certain cells, HMGB1 release occurs also during late apoptotic cell death, even before release of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). In this paper, we show that at least some of the HMGB1, which is released from secondary necrotic cells, is bound to nucleosomes. Nucleosomes from viable cells contained virtually no HMGB1. Only a fraction of apoptotic cell&#x02013;derived nucleosomes contained HMGB1, suggesting that the formation of high-affinity complexes between nucleosomes and HMGB1 is restricted to certain subsets of nucleosomes and/or HMGB1. The amount of these complexes may depend on cell types and different apoptotic pathways.</p><p>Most importantly, apoptotic cell&#x02013;derived nucleosomes displayed a potent proinflammatory effect. Nucleosomes purified from HMGB1-deficient apoptotic MEF induced very little TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-10 secretion. Those from HMGB<sup>low</sup> cells, which are deficient for HMGB1 and very low in HMGB2, did not stimulate any TNF-&#x003b1; or IL-10 release. These data indicate a direct and critical role of HMGB1 in the proinflammatory properties of nucleosomes derived from apoptotic cells and suggest that HMGB2, which displays a similar amino acid sequence and shares many if not all of the biochemical properties with HMGB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>), also exhibits a proinflammatory potential. Notably, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and IL-10, which are induced by apoptotic nucleosomes, are elevated in the serum of patients with SLE and may contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>). However, the role of TNF-&#x003b1; appears to be ambivalent in SLE. On one side, IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; production, which may contribute to the immune pathogenesis of SLE, is normally down-regulated by TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>). On the other side, TNF-&#x003b1; is found in the serum and inflamed kidneys of SLE patients and might contribute to the inflammatory process and organ damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>). In SLE, TNF-&#x003b1; may fail to regulate IFN-&#x003b1; production adequately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>), and a combined increase of both cytokines could promote the pathogenesis.</p><p>Most of the biological effects of HMGB1 are proposed to be mediated by the multiligand receptor RAGE as well as TLR2 and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>). A very recent study demonstrated that HMGB1, in complex with CpG oligonucleotides, binds more efficiently to RAGE than HMGB1 alone. The CpG oligonucleotide-mediated TLR9-dependent cytokine release from B cells and pDC was strongly enhanced by HMGB1 and was dependent on RAGE and TLR9. However, the exact mechanism remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to these data on HMGB1&#x02013;CpG oligonucleotide complexes, HMGB1-containing nucleosomes from apoptotic cells induced cytokine release from macrophages independently of RAGE, TLR4, and TLR9, whereas only TLR2 signaling was essential. The immunization of TLR2-deficient mice with apoptotic nucleosomes did not result in a marked induction of anti-dsDNA or antihistone antibodies, a fact which confirmed the crucial role of TLR2 for the immune stimulatory effect of HMGB1&#x02013;nucleosome complexes in vivo. Interestingly, the presence of a single loss-of-function allele of the Mal/TIRAP protein, which is essential for TLR2- and TLR4-mediated signal transduction, was found to be protective against SLE, whereas it had no influence on the occurrence of rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>). Based on our results, HMGB1 might represent the link between TLR2 signaling and the pathogenesis of SLE. As it has been shown in MRL/lpr mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>), the formation of autoantibodies to dsDNA and ribonucleoprotein particles may additionally require TLR9 and TLR7, respectively.</p><p>In contrast to CpG oligonucleotides and CpG&#x02013;HMGB1 complexes, HMGB1&#x02013;nucleosome complexes by themselves did not cause IFN-&#x003b1; release from pDC. However, in the presence of sera containing high concentrations of anti-dsDNA antibodies together with nucleosomes, there was a strong induction of IFN-&#x003b1;, which may play a crucial role in the immunopathogenesis of SLE (Fig. S3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>). Moreover, preliminary data indicate that in mice immunized with nucleosomes from apoptotic cells, but not from viable cells, subsequent injections of nucleosomes induced IFN-&#x003b1; release in vivo. These data suggest that apoptotic nucleosomes may initiate autoantibody formation to dsDNA. Subsequent release of nucleosomes leads to the formation of immune complexes and IFN-&#x003b1; secretion, which then acts as an amplification loop of autoimmunity and inflammation (Fig. S5).</p><p>DC are important regulators of immune responses. Mature DC are especially required for the priming of T helper cells. DC mature upon recognition of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>). DC-mediated autoimmune responses can occur also in the absence of pathogens. Under such conditions, endogenous molecules acting as alarmins may activate APC and enhance the expression of costimulatory and MHC class II molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>). It has been previously demonstrated that recombinant HMGB1 and the HMGB1 B box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) as well as HMGB1-containing supernatants from WT MEF, but not from their <italic>Hmgb1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> counterparts, induced maturation of DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). In addition, other groups demonstrated that chromatin/nucleosome-containing immune complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>) and free nucleosomes purified from calf thymus directly interact with DC and can activate them via TLR9-dependent and -independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). In this paper, we demonstrated that apoptotic cell&#x02013;derived nucleosomes induced markedly stronger DC maturation as compared with those from viable cells. In addition, nucleosomes derived from apoptotic HMGB<sup>low</sup> MEF did not induce DC maturation, again demonstrating a critical role of HMGB proteins acting as endogenous adjuvants enhancing the antigen-presenting function of DC.</p><p>Although it is believed that nucleosomes constitute one of the primary autoantigens in SLE, previous attempts to immunize nonautoimmune mice with nucleosomes purified from viable cells failed to trigger relevant autoantibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). In agreement with these previous studies, we also did not observe a significant induction of anti-dsDNA antibodies after immunization with nucleosomes from viable cells. Importantly, immunization with HMGB1&#x02013;nucleosome complexes from apoptotic cells, which activate macrophages and induce DC maturation in vitro, translated into significantly increased anti-dsDNA antibody generation in nonautoimmune mice. Mevorach et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref>) immunized nonautoimmune mice with whole apoptotic cells but could not detect antibodies against dsDNA, only antibodies against ssDNA. The failure of whole apoptotic cells to induce disease relevant anti-dsDNA antibodies in nonautoimmune mice may be caused by the rapid clearance of apoptotic cells and their antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref>).</p><p>In summary, HMGB1-containing apoptotic cell&#x02013;derived nucleosomes may critically contribute to break peripheral tolerance against nuclear antigens in SLE via their proinflammatory actions on various cell types, especially macrophages and DC. Moreover, our findings implicate that antagonizing of HMGB1 might represent a novel treatment strategy for SLE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Serum samples.</title><p>For serum preparation, venous blood was collected from healthy donors and patients with SLE or other diseases into tubes without anticoagulants (Monovette) and centrifuged at 2,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C.

All nucleosome preparations were tested for LPS contaminations using the E-TOXATE kit (Sigma-Aldrich) and the QCL-1000 chromogenic endotoxin detection assay (Cambrex). Nucleosome preparations were used only if the Limulus (E-TOXATE) assay was negative and the endotoxin concentration was &#x0003c;0.2 U/ml as detected by QCL-1000.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Western blot analyses.</title><p>Equal amounts of each fraction obtained by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore).

Fig. S2 shows that nucleosomes, which were spontaneously released from late apoptotic/secondary necrotic cells, contain HMGB1 and induce TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-10 release from human macrophages. Fig. S3 demonstrates that nucleosomes isolated from either viable or apoptotic cells do not stimulate IFN-&#x003b1; release from human pDC. However, nucleosomes together with anti-dsDNA antibodies containing serum induced a strong IFN-&#x003b1; release that was comparable to CpG oligonucleotides. Fig. S4 shows the induction of anti-Sm antibodies in BALB/c mice that had been immunized three times with apoptotic nucleosomes but not in those mice that had been immunized with viable nucleosomes.
