However, we demonstrate that the mouse TrkB mRNA contains two independent IRESes. The mouse TrkB mRNA consists of one of two 5&#x02032; leaders (1428 nt and 448 nt), both of which include the common 3&#x02032; exon (Ex2, 344 nt). Dicistronic RNA transfections and <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of monocistronic RNA demonstrated that both full-length 5&#x02032; leaders, as well as Ex2, exhibit IRES activity indicating the IRES is located within Ex2. Additional analysis of the upstream sequences demonstrated that the first 260 nt of exon 1 (Ex1a) also contains an IRES. Dicistronic RNA transfections into SH-SY5Y cells showed the Ex1a IRES is constitutively active. However, the Ex2 IRES is only active in response to retinoic acid induced neural differentiation, a state which correlates with the synthesis of the ITAF polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB1). Correspondingly, addition or knock-down of PTB1 altered Ex2, but not Ex1a IRES activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic>, respectively. These results demonstrate that the two functionally independent IRESes within the mouse TrkB 5&#x02032; leader are differentially regulated, in part by PTB1.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, recruitment of canonical factors including the ribosome to the 7-methyl guanosine cap structure on the 5&#x02032; end of the mRNA is thought to be the primary mechanism by which translation initiation occurs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Kozak1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the current literature suggests that most eukaryotic IRESes require non-canonical translation factors referred to as IRES transactivating factors (ITAFs) for initiation. The three isoforms of polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB1, 2 and 4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Giraud1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Wollerton1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, La protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Holcik1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and upstream of n-ras protein (unr) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Mitchell2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> are examples of ITAFs required for efficient translation from eukaryotic and viral IRESes. These proteins may function as chaperones, altering or maintaining specific RNA structures that permit binding of the translational machinery (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Spriggs1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>). This theory is supported by work from the Niepmann lab demonstrating that binding of PTB to the foot-and-mouth disease (FMDV) IRES enhances the recruitment of the initiation factor eIF4G and stimulates FMDV IRES activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Song1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, it has been shown that the eukaryotic Apaf-1 5&#x02032; leader undergoes secondary structure changes upon the binding of unr and PTB, allowing for internal initiation of translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Mitchell1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Utilization of eukaryotic IRESes often occurs during cellular events that reduce cap-dependent translation. For example, during mitosis the family of eIF4E binding proteins (4E-BP) is hypophosphorylated, which enhances their ability to bind eIF4E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Pyronnet1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The sequestering of eIF4E inhibits cap-dependent translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Sonenberg1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and the overall level of protein synthesis is decreased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Qin1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

For PITSLRE kinase, its IRES activity partially depends on the upregulation of unr expression at the G2/M junction underscoring not only the importance of the cell state, but also the importance of ITAF availability for internal initiation.</p><p>Studies in model systems indicate that neural activity may also promote dependency on internal initiation of translation.

The TrkB receptor is synthesized under diverse conditions and its activity contributes to multiple cellular processes (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Huang2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>). In neural stem cells, the TrkB mediated pathway promotes cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Ahmed1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In the adult, TrkB activity contributes to changes in synaptic efficacy and local connectivity, ultimately affecting learning and memory (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Huang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>). Owing to its diverse functions, TrkB expression is regulated at multiple steps in response to various cellular conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Metsis1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Lucarelli1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Jullien1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, ischemia also inhibits cap-dependent translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Lindvall1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> suggesting that the upregulation of TrkB occurs in a cap-independent manner. In accordance with this observation, our lab has demonstrated that the 5&#x02032; leader of the mRNA encoding for human TrkB contains an IRES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Dobson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We hypothesized that if IRES-dependent translation was a critical mechanism for the synthesis of TrkB protein, then both the presence of an IRES and its mechanism would be evolutionarily conserved. The human TrkB 5&#x02032; leader is derived from alternative transcriptional start sites and alternative splicing of five exons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Stoilov1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the IRES was localized to exon 5, which is present in all 5&#x02032; leader variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Dobson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike the human 5&#x02032; leader, the mouse TrkB 5&#x02032; leader is transcribed from two promoters and is comprised of two exons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Barettino1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. However, similar to the human TrkB 5&#x02032; leader, all of the mouse TrkB 5&#x02032; leaders contain a 3&#x02032; common exon, exon 2. The human exon 5 and the mouse exon 2 sequences share a 63&#x00025; identity with regions of high similarity on the extreme ends of the exons. Consequently, we predicted that the mouse TrkB 5&#x02032; leader would mediate internal initiation and that the IRES would be located within Exon 2.</p><p>In the present report we establish that the mouse TrkB Exon 2 does contain an IRES. But surprisingly, an IRES is also located within Exon 1 demonstrating the presence of two IRESes initiating translation of the same open reading frame. The two IRESes are differentially utilized based on the differentiation state of a neuronal cell line. This phenomenon is explained in part by the observation that PTB1 differentially affects translation mediated by the two IRESes, despite the fact that PTB1 binds both IRESes with similar affinity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Mouse TrkB 5&#x02032; Leaders Contain a Potential IRES Element</title><p>To determine if the full-length 5&#x02032; leaders generated from the first promoter, Leader 1 (L1, 1.428 kb), from the second promoter, Leader 2 (L2, 448 nt), and Exon 2 (Ex2, 344 nt) exhibited IRES activity, they were inserted into the intercistronic region of the dicistronic luciferase DNA vector pRF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003242-g001">Fig 1a and 1b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Stoneley1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

The relatively large decrease in the overall level of translation from the mRNA containing the EMCV IRES when cap-dependent translation is shut down is believed to be due to the addition of a cap structure to the mRNA. This creates an artificial context for the EMCV 5&#x02032; leader and when uninhibited, allows for the cap structure to compete with the IRES for translational machinery. All three mRNAs containing the different mouse TrkB 5&#x02032; leaders showed a smaller reduction in activity compared to that observed from the pGL3 mRNA. Ex2 and L2 exhibited similar reductions of approximately 50&#x00025;. L1 exhibited only a 15&#x00025; decrease in <italic>Photinus</italic> luciferase activity in the presence of hypophosphorylated 4EBP. This result supports the conclusion that all three TrkB 5&#x02032; leaders can initiate translation independent of the cap. It also suggests that the contribution of cap- and IRES-dependent translation may vary for each leader.</p><fig id="pone-0003242-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003242.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>The mouse TrkB 5&#x02032; leaders are able to initiate translation when cap-dependent translation is inhibited.</title><p>A) A dual monocistronic construct containing the pGL3 multiple cloning site upstream of the <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase and the pGL3 multiple cloning site, EMCV, or the TrkB 5&#x02032; leaders upstream of the <italic>Photinus</italic> luciferase gene was co-transfected into C6 cells with a construct encoding for a hypophosphorylated 4EBP construct or a null vector.

Since the TrkB receptor contributes to different cellular functions in neural stem cells and neurons, we were interested in determining whether differentiation also affected IRES activity. To examine the effects of differentiation on the TrkB IRESes, we chose SH-SY5Y cells, a neuroblastoma that generates a differentiated neuronal phenotype when exposed to retinoic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Mitchell2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

This result suggests that the Ex1a IRES is constitutively active is SH-SY5Y cells, while the Ex2 IRES is only active in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells.</p><p>The ability of Ex2 to internally initiate translation in differentiated but not undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells indicates the presence of a factor that is induced upon differentiation. Since we have already established that PTB1 affects the IRES activity from the mouse TrkB IRESes differentially, it suggests that PTB1 may be the factor responsible for the differential regulation observed in the SH-SY5Y cells.

The IRES in Ex2 is active in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, binds PTB1, and its activity is enhanced in the presence of PTB1. On the other hand, the IRES within Ex1a is active in both differentiated and undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells, binds PTB1, but its activity is unaffected in the presence of PTB1.

Removal of the promoter and intron from the dicistronic construct demonstrated that all three TrkB 5&#x02032; leaders exhibit some level of cryptic promoter activity.

Together, these data suggest that despite the presence of a cryptic promoter, the mouse TrkB 5&#x02032; leaders can internally initiate translation.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Multiple IRESes Present in a Single mRNA</title><p>The mouse TrkB mRNA is one of only a few eukaryotic mRNAs to contain two IRESes within the same mRNA. Transcription of the mouse TrkB gene from promoter 1 yields the 5&#x02032; leader 1 with IRESes located within Ex1 and Ex2. The IRES in Ex1 was further localized to the 5&#x02032; end, a region that is within all alternatively spliced variants. The rationale for multiple IRESes on the same 5&#x02032; leader is not known. It is possible that multiple IRESes work cooperatively to increase IRES activity. If this was occurring with the Ex1a and Ex2 IRESes, we predict the presence of both IRESes (L1) would generate higher IRES activity than either IRES alone. However, L1 exhibited a lower P&#x02236;R ratio than either Ex1a or Ex2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003242-g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p><p>A second possibility is that the two IRESes initiate at different initiator codons. This situation occurs with the two IRESes located within the c-myc mRNA. The upstream element, IRES 1, initiates translation of the MYCHEX1 open reading frame (ORF) while the downstream IRES 2 initiates the c-myc 1/ c-myc 2 ORF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Nanbru1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, two IRESes exist in the 5&#x02032; leader of the mRNA coding for endothelial growth factor (VEGF). They control initiation at two alternative start sites yielding a protein with a different N-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Huez1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Huez2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, an upstream ORF (uORF) located between the two IRESes determines which IRES is utilized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Bastide1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. The mouse TrkB Exon 1 contains 15 potential uORFs that could also regulate the usage of the two TrkB IRESes. Only one uORF (&#x02212;1048 nt in Ex1b) is in a moderately favorable Kozak context. It would therefore, be of interest to determine if the predicted 4.2 kD product encoded in Exon 1 is synthesized. We cannot identify at present, whether one or both IRESes is utilized in the full length L1 5&#x02032; leader. However, since all 5&#x02032; leaders containing one or two IRESes (regardless of the presence of uORFs) yield equivalent levels of luciferase protein it indicates that the major ORF is the <italic>Photinus</italic> luciferase ORF. This observation is in agreement with the identification of a single initiation start site in both the mouse and human TrkB genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Stoilov1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Barettino1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, and would be the first example of two unique IRESes being used to produce the identical protein.</p><p>A third explanation is that the two IRESes are differentially employed. Multiple mechanisms may exist to ensure the presence and/or use of one IRES. For example, neural activity increases transcription mediated by promoter 2 generating an mRNA with only one IRES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Kingsbury1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, the presence of RNA upstream of an IRES may inhibit its function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Yaman1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. In this case, the Ex1a IRES would be active in the full-length leader if the presence of the upstream sequence inhibits the Ex2 IRES. Finally, when both IRESes are present, IRES selection may be regulated by the presence of ITAFs. It has been well documented that IRESes are neither constitutively nor ubiquitously active. IRESes, including those in the mouse TrkB 5&#x02032; leaders, as well as human TrkB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Dobson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, c-IAP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-VanEden2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, Apaf-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Nevins1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> and c-myc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Stoneley2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, demonstrate varying activities in different cell lines, presumably due to differential expression of ITAFs. Indeed, we have shown that the two IRESes within the TrkB 5&#x02032; leader are differentially regulated within a cell line. This level of regulation is likely functional within primary neurons. For example, Ex2 IRES is only active in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, a model for post-mitotic neurons that are capable of neural activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Tosetti1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.

This observation provides a link between the differential usage of the TrkB promoters and TrkB translation.</p><p>At the molecular level, differential usage of the two TrkB IRESes may be regulated in part by PTB1. IRES activity <italic>in vitro</italic> mediated by the Ex2 IRES was increased in the presence of PTB1.

It remains possible that PTB1 plays a role in enhancing Ex1a IRES activity in conjunction with additional factors that are absent from RRL and SH-SY5Y cells. The Apaf-1 and BAG-1 IRESes require the presence of unr and poly(rC) binding protein 1 respectively, in addition to PTB1, for IRES activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Mitchell1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Pickering1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The position of the PTB1 site within the mRNA secondary structure can determine whether PTB1 binding can affect IRES activity.

The Willis lab demonstrated that the PTB1 binding site, a CCU repeat, can only internally initiate translation when present within a stem structure and not as single stranded RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Mitchell3">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, it would be predicted that potential PTB1 binding sites within Ex2 are in a double stranded conformation, while those within Ex1a would exist in a single stranded state.</p><p>It is also possible that PTB1 binding to the TrkB mRNA occurs to mediate another mRNA processing event. PTB1, in addition to regulating internal initiation, also affects RNA splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-GarciaBlanco1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Since Exon 1 is alternatively spliced, it is possible that PTB1 is binding for that purpose. In addition, the assay was performed in isolation of other polypyrimidine binding proteins that may normally compete with PTB1 for the binding sites within TrkB and prevent the binding of PTB1.</p><p>Differential use of the TrkB IRESes may be a mechanism to regulate protein expression levels. For instance, the selection of which IRES is utilized will alter the sequence and distance over which the ribosome must scan, in a similar manner to that predicted for ribosomes recruited to the cap structure. For example, a long G/C rich 5&#x02032; leader will impede ribosomal scanning and decrease the overall level of protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003242-Merrick1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of TrkB, the distance from the Ex1a IRES is over 1kb long, is G/C rich, and contains multiple upstream AUGs. Therefore, when less TrkB is required, initiation could occur from the Ex1a IRES. However, when TrkB upregulation is required to affect synaptic plasticity in response to neural activity, initiation could occur from the shorter, and now more prevalent Ex2 IRES. Consequently, the presence of multiple IRESes on a single 5&#x02032; leader may provide an additional mechanism to regulate protein synthesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Constructs</title><p>The mouse TrkB 5&#x02032; leaders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003242-g001">Fig 1a</xref>), with the exception of L1, were cloned from a mouse brain cDNA library (Clontech) with EcoRI and NcoI restriction sites.
