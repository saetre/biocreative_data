However, little is known about the genes important in controlling call production. Here, we study the induction and regulation of USVs in muscarinic and dopaminergic receptor knockout (KO) mice as well as wild-type controls during sexual behavior. Female mouse urine, but not female rat or human urine, induced USVs in male mice, whereas male urine did not induce USVs in females. Direct contact of males with females is required for eliciting high level of USVs in males. USVs (25 to120 kHz) were emitted only by males, suggesting positive state; however human-audible squeaks were produced only by females, implying negative state during male-female pairing. USVs were divided into flat and frequency-modulated calls. Male USVs often changed from continuous to broken frequency-modulated calls after initiation of mounting. In M2 KO mice, USVs were lost in about 70&#x02013;80&#x00025; of the mice, correlating with a loss of sexual interaction. In M5 KO mice, mean USVs were reduced by almost 80&#x00025; even though sexual interaction was vigorous. In D2 KOs, the duration of USVs was extended by 20&#x00025;. In M4 KOs, no significant differences were observed. Amphetamine dose-dependently induced USVs in wild-type males (most at 0.5 mg/kg i.p.), but did not elicit USVs in M5 KO or female mice. These studies suggest that M2 and M5 muscarinic receptors are needed for male USV production during male-female interactions, likely via their roles in dopamine activation. These findings are important for the understanding of the neural substrates for positive affect.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reproduction requires detecting, recognizing and courting a potential mate in mammals.

The condenser microphone was positioned 23 cm above the floor of test cage. All sound equipment used in this study had a flat response to a maximum of 200-kHz unless otherwise indicated. During testing, the occurrence of vocalizations was monitored through headphones with a QMC heterodyne receiver (bat detector) that reduced the frequency of ultrasound into the human auditory range. The ultrasound detector was set to maximum 200-kHz (sampling frequency) enabling it to detect calls through the frequency range of 1 to 200-kHz (in some cases, 1 to 300-kHz). Spectral analyses of the non-transformed ultrasonic recordings were performed using Avisoft SASLab Pro software (Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany) working on Windows XP, which performs a continuous fast-Fourier analysis and displays the results on a screen. The duration, peak frequency and bandwidth of USVs were analyzed according to the Avisoft software manual. The USVs with bandwidth &#x02264;5-kHz is considered as flat USVs, whereas those whose bandwidth being &#x0003e;5-kHz is considered as frequency-modulated USVs. To ensure the accuracy of the data, a certain number of USVs (&#x0003e;60) were counted as flat and frequency-modulated USVs and confirmed by measuring their bandwidths (frequency change). Only a high coefficient ratio (&#x0003e;0.95) for inter-rater-reliability obtained was considered valid data. If the USVs was discontinuous, it was named broken USV. In particular, if USV was broken by a sudden downward step, with a harmonic at the octave, it was named a &#x0201c;broken&#x0201d; USV.
