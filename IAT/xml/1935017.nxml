Both transcription and splicing are highly ordered processes involving intricate protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Transcription is regulated by protein complex composed of transcription factors, basal transcriptional machinery and a group of co-activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), while pre-mRNA splicing is carried out by spliceosome that consists of five conserved small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) U1, U2, U5, base-paired U4/U6 and a large number of less precisely defined non-snRNP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Accumulating evidence supports the concept that transcription and splicing are coordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). The key factor linking these processes is the C-terminal domain (CTD) of pol II large subunit which plays essential role both in transcription and RNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Additionally, CTD associates with general RNA processing machineries, functioning in mRNA capping, pre-mRNA splicing, polyadenylation and alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). However, recent evidence supports the idea that CTD is required for efficient co-transcriptional editing of some pre-mRNA, but is not required for efficient splicing of the pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Thus, the CTD is most likely a coordinator, rather than a simple enhancer of RNA processing. Additional evidence supporting the coupling between transcription and polyadenylation is emerging from recent proteomic analyses of the human spliceosome which revealed that at least 30 spliceosomal proteins are also participating in other gene expression steps besides splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). For example, transcription cofactor such as TAT-SF1 (TAT specific factor 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), CA150 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and SKIP (Ski-binding protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) have also been identified in the spliceosome. These results imply that gene expression machineries are extensively coupled via protein&#x02013;protein interactions. However, although the evidence of CTD recruitment of mRNA processing factors is well documented, the interactions between CTD and other proteins that link transcription and RNA processing have been poorly characterized. Hence, identification of functional protein complexes and the shared protein components between them is an essential step in understanding the physiological mechanisms that couple transcription and RNA processing.</p><p>p100 protein was first identified as a co-activator of EBNA2 (Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus nuclear protein 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), and subsequently discovered as co-regulator of pim-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and STAT6 transcription factor in IL-4 mediated gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). p100 functions also as a co-activator of STAT5 in prolactin (PRL) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and in mammary epithelial cells p100 protein levels increase in response to PRL during lactation and correlate with induction of &#x003b2;-casein gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In addition, p100 has been linked to the pathogenesis of autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), and identified in the RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). These studies suggest that p100 protein participates in several biological responses and that the protein may play distinct roles in various cellular events.</p><p>p100 protein consists of four similar domains with homology to the staphylococcal nucleases (SN), followed by a C-terminal Tudor-SN (TSN) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The SN-like domains of p100 have been implicated in protein interactions, and the SN-like domains of p100 protein recruit CBP and RNA pol II to STAT6 and facilitate the formation of STAT6 enhanceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The function of p100 TSN domain has remained elusive, but the Tudor domain is 30% homologous to SMN (survival of motor neuron protein) Tudor domain, which functions in the assembly of snRNP complexes and pre-mRNA splicing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we demonstrate a novel function for p100 protein as an interaction partner for spliceosomal snRNPs. First, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down assay to demonstrate that TSN domain of p100 protein associates with a subset of U5 snRNP core proteins, and is capable of precipitating all snRNAs. We next showed that exogenously added p100 protein can kinetically enhance both the <italic>in vitro</italic> spliceosome complex formation and the first step of pre-mRNA splicing. Thus our results suggest that human p100 protein is a novel dual function regulator of both gene transcription and pre-mRNA splicing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and cells</title><p>HeLa cells and COS-7 cells were cultured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).

Additionally, northern analysis of the pull-down reactions using spliceosomal snRNA-specific probes and U7-specific probe revealed, similarly to the control SMN pull-down, an efficient pull-down with the GST-p100-TSN fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). In contrast, no interaction was observed with the 7SK, which is another nuclear snRNP. This suggests that the common features of spliceosomal U-snRNPs and U7 snRNP, Sm-proteins and trimethylated cap structure may be recognized by p100-TSN domain, because both features are missing from 7SK RNP. U6 snRNP lacks these features as well, but its precipitation is promoted by base-pairing with U4. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>p100 protein associates with snRNP via TSN domain.

Splicing reactions were either pre-incubated with purified p100 protein or mock-treated, followed by the addition of radiolabeled splicing substrate and subsequent time-course analysis of the splicing reactions. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A show that the appearance of the ligated mRNA and exon-lariat intermediate is faster and respond in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 6&#x02013;8, 10&#x02013;12) as compared to the reactions containing no exogenously added p100 protein (lanes 2&#x02013;4). In particular, the first detectable signal from ligated mRNA and exon-lariat intermediate were consistently observed at earlier time point in splicing reactions containing p100. For example, ligated mRNA appeared at 15&#x02009;min time point with 6-ng/&#x003bc;l p100 protein (lane 10), and at 30&#x02009;min with 3-ng/&#x003bc;l p100 protein (lane 7), while it was hardly detectable at 30&#x02009;min in the control (lane 3). Similar trend is seen with ligated exons, which have reached their maximal intensity already at 45&#x02009;min time point while the control reaction has not (lanes 8 and 12 compare with lane 4). Significantly, there were no major differences in the levels of splicing intermediates and products at the terminal 60-min time point (lanes 5, 9 and 13) or after (data not shown), suggesting that the added p100 does not increase the overall level of <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing, but rather accelerates the kinetics of the splicing reaction. As the second step is not markedly influenced, that is, the amount of excised intron was quantitatively similar in the splicing reactions with or without addition of p100 protein (compare lanes 4, 8 and 12, lanes 5, 9 and 13), the results suggest that either first step, or the assembly steps prior to catalysis were affected. Control reactions with added BSA did not show any stimulatory effect on splicing, thus ruling out possible effects of overall protein concentration (data not shown). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Effect of p100 protein on the spliceosome assembly and splicing activity. <italic>In vitro</italic> splicing or spliceosome complex assembly reactions were carried out with AdML splicing substrate in condition indicated above each lane.

The reactions were either kept on ice (0-min time point), or incubated at 30&#x000b0;C up to 60&#x02009;min prior to gel analysis. In the control reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;5) the non-specific complex H is first detected at 0&#x02009;min time point, complex A at 5&#x02009;min time point and the later B and C complexes after 30&#x02009;min of incubation. In the presence of p100 protein, we reproducibly observed relatively strong complex A formation in reactions on ice (lanes 1, 6 and 11) in a p100 protein dose-dependent manner. Additionally, in those reactions the complex A band has reached its maximal intensity already at 5&#x02009;min time point. Furthermore, the kinetic appearance of B and C complexes was also accelerated. The complex B could be detected already at 5&#x02009;min time point in the reaction with 6-ng/&#x003bc;l p100 protein (lane 12), and at 10&#x02009;min (lane 8) with 3-ng/&#x003bc;l p100 protein, while at 30&#x02009;min (lane 4) in the control reaction. Finally, there appears to be a faster turnover of the splicing reaction particularly with the higher concentration of the p100 as the level of complexes detected in the native gel drops significantly after 60&#x02009;min of incubation (compare lanes 5, 10 and 15). Furthermore, the stimulation of the complex formation appears to be dose-dependent as the complex formation is faster in the reaction containing a large amount of the p100 protein (compare reactions 6&#x02013;10 and 11&#x02013;15), which is consistent with the results observed in splicing reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). To validate this point further, we determined the intensities of A and B complex from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B using a phosphoimager and normalized each set by setting the highest value of complex A to 1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, the addition of p100 protein accelerated the kinetics of complex A and B formation, the transition of complex A to B (at 30&#x02009;min in control, 10&#x02009;min with 3&#x02009;ng/&#x003bc;l and 5&#x02009;min with 6&#x02009;ng/&#x003bc;l p100 protein), and also the decay at later time points.</p><p>To rule out possible stimulatory effects of increased protein concentration, similar native gel analyses were carried out using equivalent amounts of control proteins, such as GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) and BSA, neither of which changed the kinetics of the complex formation (data not shown). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Effect of p100 TSN domain on the spliceosome assembly and splicing activity.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, addition of the recombinant TSN domain resulted in clear accumulation of final product and lariat intermediate of RNA already after 30&#x02009;min reaction (lanes 9 and 10, 12 and 13). Particularly the lariat intermediate band is 2 to 3.5-fold (in lanes 9 and 12, respectively) more intense than the corresponding bands in lanes 3 and 6. The GST control (lanes 5&#x02013;7) did not display any differences compared to the reaction without any additional protein (lanes 2&#x02013;4). Additionally, the isolated TSN-domain displays similar dose-dependent stimulation of the splicing kinetics as the full-length p100 protein (compare lanes 8&#x02013;10 and 11&#x02013;13). At 30&#x02009;min time point (lanes 3, 6, 9 and 12), the amount of ligated mRNA, especially the exon-lariat intermediates were increased with the addition of TSN protein. Surprisingly, the addition of recombinant SN domain of p100 protein led to a total block of the splicing reaction (lanes 14 and 15). Taken together, the splicing analysis indicates that the TSN domain alone is sufficient to accelerate the kinetics of the splicing reaction.</p><p>These results were confirmed with the native gel analysis. Consistent with the splicing result, the native gel analysis demonstrated that TSN domain alone has a similar function in splicing as the full-length p100 protein, that is, it accelerated the kinetics of the spliceosomal complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B lanes 11&#x02013;15, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C), while the GST control had no effect on the pattern of spliceosome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, lanes 6&#x02013;10). In particular, in reactions containing 6-ng/&#x003bc;l GST-TSN domain the A-complex reached it's maximal intensity after 5&#x02009;min incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 12; 5C bottom panel) while in control reactions, the maximal intensity appeared after 30&#x02009;min incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, lanes 4 and 9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, top and middle panels). In contrast, addition of the recombinant SN domain blocked the formation of all the specific complexes, leading to a formation of an unknown complex with an intermediate mobility between H and A complexes (lanes 16&#x02013;20). This result is consistent with the observation above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), which indicated that addition of the SN-domain alone caused a complete inhibition of splicing, but at present we do not know if it has any biological significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The p100 protein is an evolutionarily conserved protein present in the genomes of various eukaryotes from fungi to vertebrates (for example, in <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum, Saccharomyces pombe, Mus musculus, Bos taurus</italic> and humans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Human p100 protein is composed of four repeats of SN-like domains and a TSN domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The SN-domains consist of two subdomains of which the first subdomain belongs to the large OB-fold superfamily, and the second subdomain consists of two independently folded-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The TSN domain of p100 is a hybrid of SN-like domain and a domain that is found in multiple copies in the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Tudor protein.</p><p>We have previously shown that the SN domains of human p100 recruit STAT6 and CBP to RNA pol II, resulting in enhanced STAT6-mediated transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Here we provide evidence that the TSN domain of p100 protein is associated with U5 snRNP via specific interactions with U5-220 both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Under high salt (700&#x02009;mM NaCl) concentrations we detected association with the U5 snRNP specific proteins including U5-220, U5-200 and U5-116, which is consistent with previous reports showing that these proteins form a stable, RNA-free subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36 B37 B38 B39">36&#x02013;39</xref>). Additionally, under moderate salt concentrations we observed interactions with U1, U2, U4, U5, U6 and U7 snRNPs, but not with 7SK snRNP. The appearance of U7, but not 7SK in p100-TSN precipitation indicates that p100 protein is likely to interact with snRNP via recognition of TMG-cap or Sm-protein both of which are present in spliceosomal snRNPs and in U7 snRNP. The efficient co-immunoprecipitation of p100 along with the spliceosomal snRNPs using TMG-cap-specific antibody, argues that TMG-cap may not be the recognition structure of p100, and suggests two modes for the interaction of p100 and snRNPs, one is via the recruitment of U5 snRNP, the other one is via the association of Sm-protein. Finally, we provide evidence that addition of p100 protein or the TSN-domain to an <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing reaction accelerates the kinetics of splicing intermediate and product formation by enhancing the complex A formation and the transition from A to B complex</p><p>Comparison of the Tudor-domains of p100, splicing factor SMNrp/SPF30 and SMN demonstrates sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) between the Tudor domains. This is further supported by our recent structural analysis of the isolated TSN-domain of p100 using X-ray crystallography (Shaw,N. <italic>et al</italic>., submitted for publication) demonstrating that the TSN domain has a hydrophobic core, composed of aromatic residues F715, Y721, Y738 and Y741, which is highly similar to the Tudor domain of SMN. The hydrophobic core mediates interactions between SMN and the Sm-proteins, by binding with the dimethylarginine modifications of the Sm-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, mutations of the conserved tyrosine residues (Y738A, Y741A) of the aromatic cage (Shaw,N. <italic>et al</italic>., submitted for publication) abolished the interactions between TSN domain and snRNAs. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Sequence alignment of the human SPF30, SMN and p100 proteins.

Similarly to our study, all snRNPs are co-immunoprecipitated with SMNrp/SPF30 antibodies, and conversely the SMNrp/SPF30 is present in anti-TMG IP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Interestingly, SMNrp/SPF30 has been shown to be essential for the recruitment of the tri-snRNP to the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), indicating that it functions during the same spliceosome assembly step as p100 protein. It is possible that the p100 utilizes similar interaction mechanisms as the SMNrp/SPF30 during the spliceosome assembly, although the specific molecular interactions are most likely different.</p><p>We investigated the functional significance of the p100: snRNP interaction using an <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing and spliceosome complex-formation assays using a generic splicing substrate (AdML), and found that p100 accelerated the kinetics of the mature spliceosome formation before the first catalysis. Addition of either a purified full-length p100 protein or the plain TSN domain enhanced spliceosome formation, particularly the formation of the complex A and the transition from A to B complex. In contrast, p100 fragment encompassing the SN domains of the p100 severely inhibited the <italic>in vitro</italic> spliceosome assembly, but we do not know if it has any biological significance. Because p100 only accelerated the kinetics of the spliceosome assembly, but did not affect the overall level of splicing, we hypothesize that p100 may function by recruiting snRNPs, particularly the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, onto spliceosome as supported by the specific interactions between snRNPs and p100.</p><p>An important question related to the function of p100 in spliceosome assembly <italic>in vivo</italic> is that why has p100 passed undetected in the extensive proteomic analyses of spliceosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>) and why it can enhance the splicing of a generic splicing substrate. A possible explanation is that compared to the previously identified factors functioning during spliceosome assembly, such as SMN or SMNrp/SPF30, the p100 is a large modular protein composed of multiple SN-domains in addition to the TSN domain and has thus other functions besides RNA processing. Our previous studies indicated distinct functions for the different domains, and the SN-like domain alone was sufficient to enhance STAT6-mediated transcription activity in response to IL-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), while expression of the TSN alone did not affect the transcriptional response. Here we show that the isolated TSN stimulated the kinetics of spliceosome assembly, while the isolated SN-domain was highly inhibitory in the <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing assay. The stimulation of splicing of a generic splicing substrate may reflect the conditions of the in vitro reaction in which the p100 protein is free in the solution, while <italic>in vivo</italic> it may be associated with specific genes via promoter regions. Taken together, the results from this and previous studies suggest that the human p100 protein is dual function regulator of gene expression, capable of interacting with different protein complexes through distinct domains. Thus, it is possible that p100 protein may cooperate with RNA pol II and selectively coordinate gene transcription and pre-mRNA splicing.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm470_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="nar_gkm470_supplamentary_figure_1-m.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm470_supplementary_data.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Paula Kosonen, and Hao Zhang for technical assistance, Dr Robin Reed for providing AdML plasmids, Dr Samuel I.
