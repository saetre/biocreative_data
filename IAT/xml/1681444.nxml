Synthetic lethal interactions have been rationalized with two hypotheses: (i) two genes in a single linear pathway can show synthetic lethality; (ii) synthetic lethal genes act in parallel or compensating pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Tucker and Fields, 2003</xref>). These two hypotheses predict distinctly different patterns of synthetic lethality: enrichment of interactions within single pathways versus depletion of interactions within pathways and enrichment between pathways. These two hypotheses also make different predictions for the non-lethal phenotypes of the underlying single gene deletions: a shared phenotype for genes in a single pathway, or possibly differing phenotypes for genes in parallel pathways.</p><p>Hypothesis (i) is possible only when alleles are hypomorphic but not complete loss-of-function mutants: each mutation reduces flux partially, but the combined reduction from two mutations leads to lethality. Hypothesis (i) does not apply to synthetic lethality between null alleles, with complete loss of function. Hypothesis (ii) is expected in this case, with each null mutation knocking out one of the two parallel pathways that sustain normal growth. In this view, an essential protein complex that retains function when single non-essential subunits are deleted (but not multiple subunits simultaneously) is formally represented by multiple pathways, one for each functional stoichiometry, connected in parallel.</p><p>Data sets to test these rationales are arising from high-throughput synthetic lethality screens accomplished in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> using synthetic genetic array (SGA) and synthetic lethality analysis on microarrays (SLAM). These screens test a deletion of interest (query gene) against all possible viable yeast single-deletion strains (target genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Tong <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Ooi <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Pan <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). As human disease susceptibility may encompass gene mutations in multiple pathways, synthetic lethality is relevant to human disease processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Tucker and Fields, 2003</xref>).</p><p>We focus on the subset of genetic interactions restricted to synthetic lethal interactions and synthetic fitness (slow growth) defects between <italic>null alleles</italic>. These interactions are easier to interpret than more general genetic interactions (enhancer, suppressor screens) or other types of mutant alleles (e.g., hypomorphs of essential genes). Null mutants constructed by the International Yeast Gene Deletion Consortium represent the vast majority currently under study by the yeast community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Giaever <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). For brevity, we use the term synthetic lethal to include both the lethal and reduced fitness phenotypes.</p><p>Synthetic lethal interactions have been used to predict that interaction partners share function in the same pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Tong <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Wong <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Here, we emphasize the alternative hypothesis suggested above, that synthetic lethal interactions bridge parallel pathways, which are in a sense orthogonal to direct synthetic lethal interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). This concept is formalized computationally as follows. Pathway membership is inferred using the hypergeometric <italic>P</italic>-value for a shared pattern of interaction partners, which we abbreviate as the congruence score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). We present evidence that functional associations inferred from the congruence score are stronger than associations between the synthetic lethal interaction partners themselves. Two types of functional associations are explored: biochemical participation in protein complexes, through joint analysis of synthetic lethal interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Tong <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) with protein complex data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Gavin <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Ho <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Mewes <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S1 and S2</xref>); and phenotypes of the underlying single gene deletion mutants, including nuclear migration and drug sensitivity. The nuclear migration assay and the physical interaction detected between Jnm1p and Yll049wp confirm our prediction that the previously uncharacterized yeast gene <italic>YLL049W</italic> is a new member of the dynein&#x02013;dynactin pathway.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Congruent genes function in the same pathway</title><p>As has been noted previously, only &#x0223c;1&#x00025; of synthetic lethal interactions occur between genes whose products reside in a single protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Tong <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). While, as pointed out by the authors of that paper, this is a greater fraction than would be expected by chance, it is clear that the vast majority of synthetic lethal interactions are not explained by common protein complex membership and we would argue that this 1&#x00025; represents the exception and not the rule. The parallel pathway model suggests that genes sharing synthetic lethal interaction partners may function in a single pathway, and their gene products should have an increased probability to reside in a single protein complex.</p><p>The raw number of shared genetic interaction partners has been used previously to rank the probability of a physical interaction between the corresponding gene products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Tong <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Here, we instead use the hypergeometric <italic>P</italic>-value for the number of shared neighbors, which accounts for the number of interaction partners of each gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). To convert this value to a convenient scale, we define the congruence score as the negative log<sub>10</sub> of the <italic>P</italic>-value; related measures have been used to analyze protein interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Goldberg and Roth, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Schlitt <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) and multiple characters from single RNA interference (RNAi) screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Gunsalus <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). The congruence score has the benefit of providing a natural significance threshold incorporating the size of the network. The performance of a predictive method can be visualized by plotting the number of true positives versus the number of false positives as a function of the number of predictions made, known as a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Based on the area under the ROC curve, the performance of congruence score method is superior to counting the number of shared partners in predicting protein complex membership in the stringent regime (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p><p>We separated the synthetic lethal interaction data into &#x02018;query' and &#x02018;target' sets, based on whether each gene node represents a non-essential query gene (126 are included in the published data) or a target gene (982 of which are synthetic lethal partners of at least one query). We calculate congruence scores for each pair of target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>).</p><p>The fraction of target gene pairs in the same protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Gavin <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Ho <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) increases with congruence score, rising to 100&#x00025; at the highest values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). Analysis using the MIPS database of curated complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Mewes <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) yields similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Even for the smallest non-zero congruence scores, the observed fractions of pairs within the same complex are greater than expected by chance (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.005). Gene products of pairs with congruence score &#x02a7e;5 have a higher probability of protein complex co-residence than products of synthetic lethal interaction partners. Moreover, using synthetic lethal interactions to predict complex co-residence shows higher false positive rate (&#x0005b;false positives&#x0005d;/&#x0005b;false positives&#x0002b;true negatives&#x0005d;) and higher false discovery rate (&#x0005b;false positives&#x0005d;/&#x0005b;false positives&#x0002b;true positives&#x0005d;) than using congruence score (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p><p>Functional associations, determined by extracting Gene Ontology (GO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ashburner <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>) annotations and calculating correlations based on the depth of the deepest parent term (see Materials and methods), are greater for congruent genes than for synthetic lethal pairs. Biological Process and Cellular Component correlations increase with congruence score and are greater than the similarity between direct genetic interaction partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). As is typically the case, the GO Molecular Function annotations have smaller correlation as they refer to molecular, rather than biological, roles. For congruence scores &#x02a7e;7, &#x02a7e;10, and &#x02a7e;6, respectively, the GO process, function, and component correlations for congruent gene pairs are significantly higher than the corresponding correlations for the raw synthetic lethal pairs (0.25, 0.05, and 0.31), respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Calculations based on semantic similarity of GO terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Lord <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) show even stronger performance of the congruence score relative to synthetic lethality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S12</xref>).</p><p>In summary, a congruence interaction with score &#x02a7e;10 provides a tighter functional relationship than synthetic lethality, consistent with our interpretation of single versus parallel pathways. Although individual synthetic lethal gene pairs may share synthetic lethal partners (as observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Tong <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), high congruence score typically excludes direct synthetic lethal interaction, in agreement with our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). When congruence score is greater than or equal to 14, the binomial <italic>P</italic>-value for observed number of synthetic lethal interactions becomes insignificant given the overall frequency of synthetic lethal interactions observed in the entire congruence data set (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>A network generated by setting a threshold congruence value &#x02a7e;10 recapitulates known functional associations and suggests novel associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>). Sets of genes known to function within the same pathway tend to cluster together. As expected, the congruence links overlap known protein interactions, whereas synthetic lethal links do not. For example, a prefoldin complex gene cluster inferred from congruence links (<italic>PAC10</italic>, <italic>GIM3</italic>, <italic>GIM4</italic>, <italic>GIM5</italic>, and <italic>YKE2</italic>) corresponds to the <italic>PAC10</italic> complex shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>.</p><p>In some cases where proteins encoded by genes with congruence links were not detected within the same protein complex by high-throughput studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Gavin <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Ho <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>), other experiments have indicated physical interactions. <italic>SWR1</italic>, <italic>SWC1</italic>, <italic>VPS71</italic>, <italic>VPS72</italic>, <italic>SIF2</italic>, and <italic>ARP6</italic> encode subunits of <italic>SWR1</italic> chromatin remodeling complex catalyzing exchange of histone H2A with histone variant Htz1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Mizuguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Genes in a highly connected congruence cluster may function in the same pathway through transient physical interactions, or they may participate in a pathway as separate physical entities. For example, Cin1p, Cin2p, and Pac2p are all tubulin folding factors that function in a pathway leading to microtubule stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hoyt <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). Physical interaction between Pac2p and Cin1p has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Fleming <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). Cin8p is a kinesin motor protein involved in mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation, and interacts with microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gheber <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). Possibilities include that Cin1p, Cin2p, Pac2p, and Cin8p interact transiently during mitosis, or that they influence the same molecular environment independently. For example, activities of Cin1p, Cin2p, and Pac2p might generate an optimal microtubule substrate for Cin8p.</p><p>The largest connected component in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref> includes known members of the dynein&#x02013;dynactin spindle orientation pathway (<italic>ARP1</italic>, <italic>NUM1</italic>, <italic>DYN1</italic>, <italic>PAC11</italic>, <italic>PAC1</italic>, <italic>DYN2</italic>, <italic>JNM1</italic>, <italic>YMR299C</italic>, and <italic>NIP100</italic>) and corresponds to a group observed previously using clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Tong <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). The dynactin protein complex (Arp1p, Jnm1p, and Nip100p) defined by biochemical studies is required for proper spindle orientation and chromosome partitioning to daughter cells during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kahana <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Additional reported protein&#x02013;protein interactions in this congruence cluster include Jnm1p&#x02013;Yll049wp, Nip100p&#x02013;Pac11p, Pac11p&#x02013;Dyn2p, and Pac11p&#x02013;Num1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Uetz <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Farkasovsky and Kuntzel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Ito <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). We predict <italic>YLL049W</italic> as a new component of the dynein&#x02013;dynactin spindle orientation pathway, which is consistent with previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Tong <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). We have experimentally validated the functional prediction of <italic>YLL049W</italic> by showing that its null mutant allele exhibits a nuclear migration defect similar to dynactin component <italic>JNM1</italic>. Furthermore, we have successfully detected a physical interaction between Jnm1p and Yll049wp using a directed two-hybrid test. Both experiments will be described in detail in the next section. The second uncharacterized open reading frame (ORF), <italic>YDR149C</italic>, is also congruent to dynein&#x02013;dynactin components. Its ORF overlaps the beginning of its neighbor <italic>NUM1</italic>, and we suggest that the <italic>ydr149c</italic>&#x00394; phenotype is in fact due to concomitant mutation of <italic>NUM1</italic>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Congruence scores predict pathway components and quantitative phenotypes</title><p>Distinct lesions to a single pathway branch should result in similar systems-level perturbations. We reasoned that similarity of a numeric phenotype of a deletion mutant should be better predicted by congruence score than by a direct synthetic lethal interaction.</p><p>We investigated the ability of the congruence score to predict the penetrance of nuclear migration defects in a population of mutant cells. Mutations in the dynein&#x02013;dynactin spindle orientation pathway are known to increase the nuclear migration defect rate. We selected six genes in the pathway as landmarks (<italic>DYN1</italic>, <italic>ARP1</italic>, <italic>DYN2</italic>, <italic>JNM1</italic>, <italic>NUM1</italic>, and <italic>NIP100</italic>) and then measured the defect rate at 13&#x000b0;C for 59 mutants of genes with congruence score &#x02a7e;4 to at least one of the landmarks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). To summarize the relationship between phenotype and congruence score, each mutant's migration defect (&#x00025; abnormal) was plotted as a function of congruence scores to landmark genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). The average congruence score is highly correlated with the defect rate (Spearman correlation coefficient&#x0003d;0.51, two-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x0003d;3.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>). Additionally, at or above congruence score of 10, all mutants exhibit moderate to severe nuclear migration defects (14&#x02013;80&#x00025; abnormal cells).</p><p>Among the mutants found to exhibit a nuclear migration defect was one representing the unstudied gene <italic>YLL049W</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Further analysis of the <italic>yll049w</italic> mutant showed that the observed defects are temperature-dependent, similar to <italic>jnm1</italic> mutants, whereas a mutant for the Kinesin-related <italic>KIP2</italic> gene displayed temperature-independent defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Notably, the <italic>JNM1&#x02013;YLL049W</italic> congruence score (15.2) is higher than the <italic>JNM1&#x02013;KIP2</italic> congruence score (10.8), consistent with more similar phenotypes.</p><p>It is evident from this analysis that uncharacterized ORF <italic>YLL049W</italic> is required for robust nuclear migration. High-throughput yeast two-hybrid results suggested a protein&#x02013;protein interaction between Yll049wp and dynactin subunit Jnm1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Ito <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). We have experimentally confirmed this physical interaction between Yll049wp and Jnm1p using a different two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). These results provide supporting evidence for interaction between the two proteins, but do not address whether the association is stable, transient, or bridged by other proteins. The dynein&#x02013;dynactin pathway for nuclear positioning includes many protein components that are not dynein or dynactin complex members, whose contributions influence microtubule dynamics, the formation of a capture site on the cell cortex, and proteins that regulate spatial and temporal steps in the determination of nuclear orientation and migration during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Sheeman <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Knaus <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Kip2p acts to ensure nuclear positioning within the dynein&#x02013;dynactin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Miller <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>) by transporting dynein to the microtubule plus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Carvalho <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Our data indicate that <italic>YLL049W</italic> is a previously unknown component of the dynein&#x02013;dynactin spindle orientation pathway and suggest that it might be a subunit of yeast dynactin. Elucidation of the specific molecular function of <italic>YLL049W</italic> will require further study.</p><p>To test the general application of using congruence score as phenotype predictor, we chose sensitivity to benomyl, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent, as our second phenotype assay for deletion mutants. The microtubule biogenesis gene <italic>CIN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Hoyt <italic>et al</italic>, 1990</xref>) was selected as the benomyl-sensitive landmark. Null mutants of 31 genes with congruence scores &#x02a7e;4 for <italic>CIN1</italic> were tested for growth defects on medium containing 5 &#x003bc;g/ml of benomyl at 25&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). With increasing congruence score cutoff, the fraction of benomyl-sensitive null mutants rises to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). We again observed significant correlation between the congruence score and the fraction of benomyl-sensitive mutants (Spearman correlation coefficient&#x0003d;0.49, two-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x0003d;0.006).</p><p>To validate the hypothesis that congruence interaction inferred from synthetic lethality indicates a closer functional association between genes than direct synthetic lethality, we selected landmarks of seven benomyl-sensitive mutant strains (<italic>cin1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>yml094c-a</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>pac10</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>pfd1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>gim3</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>tub3</italic>&#x00394;, and <italic>gim5</italic>&#x00394;) from the top list of 451 candidate benomyl-sensitive mutant strains from a recent high-throughput genetic screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Pan <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). We then ranked genes based on their average congruence score with seven landmarks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). As a test of the competing hypothesis that synthetic lethal interactions themselves indicate direct functional associations, we also ranked genes by the raw number of synthetic lethal interactions with seven landmarks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). The congruence score and the raw number of interactions were then tested for correlation with benomyl LD<sub>50</sub>, the dose that is lethal to at least 50&#x00025; of the cells, equivalent to control/experimental hybridization signal ratio &#x02a7e;2 used as threshold by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Pan <italic>et al</italic> (2004)</xref>.

These results support the idea that genetic congruence correlates better with a given phenotype than direct synthetic lethal interaction and indicate that congruence is a superior measure for predicting certain phenotypes.</p><p>All genes having high congruence scores with landmarks are involved in direct microtubule biogenesis.

The five prefoldin members used as query genes in SGA exhibit much more significant overlap among themselves (congruence scores in the range of 23&#x02013;67) than to <italic>PFD1</italic>. However, this may arise from systematic biases between the SGA and dSLAM methods rather than a biological distinction for <italic>PFD1</italic>. Additionally, 13 of 33 <italic>PFD1</italic> synthetic lethal partners map to reported protein complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>).

Double mutant cells of these two pathways fail in Cdc14p release from the nucleolus and arrest in telophase with a large-budded morphology.</p><p>To test the parallel pathway model, we performed dSLAM experiments using <italic>SLK19</italic>, <italic>SPO12</italic>, and <italic>LTE1</italic> as queries; <italic>CLA4</italic> was previously used as a query in the SGA study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Tong <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S9</xref>).

In addition, our genome-wide screens discovered synthetic lethal interactions between <italic>LTE1</italic> and <italic>SIN3</italic>, <italic>RPD3</italic>, <italic>PHO23</italic>, and <italic>SAP30</italic>, the components of the Sin3/Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Loewith <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S9</xref>). Although most were initially not identified in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Tong <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), we also observed synthetic lethal interactions between <italic>CLA4</italic> and all four components of the Sin3/Rpd3 complex (data not shown). These interactions were specific to MEN because synthetic lethality was not observed between the Sin3/Rpd3 histone deacetylase components and FEAR network components in either dSLAM or individual assays. These results led us to predict that the Sin3/Rpd3 histone deacetylase might play an important role during mitotic exit when the MEN pathway is mutated. In support of this, cells of the double mutants, <italic>lte1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rpd3</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>lte1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>sin3</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>lte1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>sap30</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>lte1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>pho23</italic>&#x00394;, were unable to exit mitosis, and arrested with a dumbbell-shaped morphology typical of a mitotic exit defect. Furthermore, the viability of these double mutants was restored when <italic>TAB1-6</italic>, a dominant allele of <italic>CDC14</italic> that binds weakly to the negative regulator Cfi1p/Net1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Shou <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>), but not the wild-type <italic>CDC14</italic> was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, this <italic>TAB1-6</italic> allele also suppressed the lethality of an <italic>lte1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>slk19</italic>&#x00394; double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus the Sin3/Rpd3 histone deacetylase likely acts in parallel with MEN in promoting exit from mitosis.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Synthetic lethal interaction provides evidence for compensating gene function. This compensation has been rationalized as buffering within a single pathway, or buffering between two parallel or compensating pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Tong <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Wong <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). We find that the parallel pathway model permits successful inference of protein complex membership from synthetic lethal data. The parallel pathway model, but not the single pathway model, yields successful predictions for phenotypes including nuclear migration defect rates and drug sensitivity. The parallel pathway model is also consistent with known pathways comprising genes identified in synthetic lethal screens. The model motivated our confirmation of <italic>YLL049W</italic> as participating in the dynein&#x02013;dynactin nuclear migration pathway by phenotypic analysis, permitted identification of benomyl-sensitive strains based on congruence to landmark genes, and yielded a novel prediction of Sin3/Rpd3 histone deacetylase as a new module for mitotic exit that acts in parallel with MEN.</p><p>Using a different analysis strategy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kelley and Ideker (2005)</xref> recently reported that synthetic lethal interactions are typically &#x02018;between pathway', whereas &#x02018;within-pathway' interactions occur infrequently. For their purposes, all subsets of proteins that are densely connected by physical interactions in non-mutant cells were considered &#x02018;within pathway'. If a pathway is defined strictly by its components, however, the view that null allele synthetic lethality must always occur between parallel pathways can be enforced, precluding &#x02018;within-pathway' explanations. In such a view, members of a protein complex that functions in the absence of either of two subunits, but not both, would participate in three parallel pathways: one that includes all possible components, and one for each &#x02018;incomplete' complex (all of which might function in non-mutant cells). More generally, methods that summarize synthetic lethal relationships are often more useful than raw synthetic lethal pairs.</p><p>This recent analysis also predicted that Yll049wp associates with dynactin during spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kelley and Ideker, 2005</xref>), consistent with our observation from congruence analysis that <italic>YLL049W</italic> is functionally related to dynein&#x02013;dynactin pathway. Our characterization includes experimental validations that support the prediction, and provides evidence from congruence score and detailed phenotype that the function of <italic>YLL049W</italic> is more similar to <italic>JNM1</italic> than <italic>KIP2</italic>. Confirmation of a physical interaction between <italic>YLL049W</italic> and <italic>JNM1</italic> further suggests that the prediction will be useful in future detailed analysis of the molecular role of <italic>YLL049W</italic>.</p><p>The congruence score metric compares favorably with other methods for inferring functional associations from synthetic lethal data. First, it produces stronger inference of gene function than the underlying direct genetic interactions. For example, direct interactions are unable to predict benomyl sensitivity, whereas congruence is a strong predictor of similar sensitivity. Second, the congruence metric naturally provides a <italic>P</italic>-value and can give improved performance relative to the raw count of the number of shared interaction partners. Finally, the <italic>P</italic>-values provided by the congruence score can provide an advantage over methods such as hierarchical clustering, which continue to depend on visual inspection of clusters and definition of cluster boundaries.</p><p>The quantitative characteristic of each congruent pair interaction can be used to consider interactions above a given threshold, allowing experimentalists to consider which network features reflect the most significant evidence in the data set, and to include less significant observations to be evaluated when desired. Importantly, a congruence summary at any significance level quantitatively relates genes according to their functional similarity by interaction profiles, not individual synthetic lethal pairings. To identify congruent gene pairs with greater or lesser significance, the interaction linkages can be annotated, or the map can be redrawn at differing congruence cutoff scores. For example, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref> are all target gene congruence network by setting congruence score &#x02a7e;8, &#x02a7e;10, and &#x02a7e;15, respectively. This aspect of network analysis will become increasingly important as the information summarized within it grows. Some biologically important relationships may inherently be present in the genetic congruence network only at relatively low significance overall. These can be viewed by extracting a local network containing first-degree congruence relationships in much the same way as the current large-scale interaction network is commonly viewed in subsections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Tong <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Ooi <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>A possible limitation of our analysis is the low coverage of the synthetic lethal network, with only &#x0223c;2&#x00025; screened by high-throughput methods using query genes selected on the basis of specific biological themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Tong <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). To assess the sensitivity of our analysis to missing data, and also to possible false positives, we repeated our analysis with data sets modified to contain up to 30&#x00025; false positives (random interactions added to the data) and 30&#x00025; false negatives (observed interactions removed from the data) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>). Note that the false-positive rate is quite low for the SGA data owing to confirmation by tetrad or random spore analysis; false negatives are estimated in the range of 17&#x02013;41&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Tong <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Although the congruence scores shift to lower values, the overall performance is similar to using the original data set (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>). These observations suggest that the congruence score method is robust to noisy and incomplete data.</p><p>Continuing genetic interaction screens will generate increasing volumes of data. A critical challenge is to develop computational approach to integrating these data and eventually understanding gene function. Several hurdles will need to be surmounted. Essential genes are missing from the synthetic lethal network, although they may be probed eventually using non-null mutant alleles. Certain higher-order redundancy processes may also require more than two-gene deletion to be observed. The most promising approach to ease the limitations may be to combine different types of networks for improved inference. We have performed joint analysis on genetic network and physical network to argue that the correct functional links between genes should be orthogonal to the synthetic lethal interaction (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>). Future studies by combining other types of heterogeneous network data, such as gene expression and phylogenetic information, will certainly improve our inference of biological systems.</p><p>This work in budding yeast, made possible by the development of the comprehensive deletion collection, massively parallel phenotyping techniques, and quantitative analysis of synthetic lethal interaction data within a statistical framework, will create a template for testing and improving our understanding of biological buffering and genetic robustness in many systems as researchers gather similar information data sets from other organisms. Genome-wide synthetic lethality screens using RNAi are becoming available in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">van Haaften <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) and may eventually allow analysis similar to the one we have performed in yeast.

In instances where RNAi knockdown is complete, the congruence score method should provide a quantitative metric for shared gene function through calculating the probability of a gene pair sharing phenotypic defects in the RNAi screens. Therefore, the methodology we have applied to predict gene functions from yeast genomic synthetic lethality can be certainly extended to analogous RNAi screens for the discovery of novel gene tasks in higher organisms.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data sources</title><p>Synthetic lethal interactions, including lethal and sick phenotypes, were derived from SGA analysis in budding yeast, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Tong <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).

We first attempted to make yeast strains expressing fusion proteins (Yll029w-3HA, Yll049w-13Myc, Jnm1-3HA, and Jnm1-13Myc) by genomic integration using the Pringle cassettes that confer G418 resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Longtine <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). For all four cases, multiple G418-resistant integrants were selected and confirmed by PCR diagnosis. In each case, yeast extracts were prepared from two representative candidate clones and analyzed by Western blot for expression of fusion protein. While the Jnm1-3HA and Jnm1-13Myc fusion proteins were easily detected, we were unable to detect either Yll049w-3HA or Yll049-13Myc. One possible explanation is that the expression level from the endogenous <italic>YLL049W</italic> promoter is so low that the fusion proteins cannot be detected. We thus obtained from Dr Heng Zhu a plasmid (with <italic>URA3</italic> as the selectable marker) that has been reported to overexpress GST-Yll049w under control of the robust galactose-inducible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). We transformed this plasmid into yeast strains expressing both Jnm1-3HA and Jnm1-13Myc and grew the transformants in synthetic medium lacking uracil (for selecting the plasmid). Standard galactose induction protocol was followed to induce expression of GST-Yll049w (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Again, we were unable to detect the GST-Yll049w fusion protein in these strains. In contrast, GST-Ctf4 and GST-Jnm1 fusion proteins were expressed at high levels from strains harboring the corresponding GAL1-GST fusion plasmids under the same conditions. This result suggests that the Yll039w protein might become extremely unstable when tagged with epitope tags. Given that the Yll049w fusion proteins were not expressed at detectable level, we were unable to perform co-IP or GST pull-down experiments to confirm a physical interaction between Yll049w and Jnm1. We also note that a yeast strain expressing Yll049w-TAP was not available from the collection of TAP-tagged yeast strains made by O'Shea and Weissman's group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Ghaemmaghami <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), possibly because such a strain did not express detectable fusion protein.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="N0x969d9e0N0x9b488d8" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supplemental Material</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb4100034-s1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Congruent synthetic lethal (SL) interactions are consistent with functional pathway membership.

Black arrows indicate the schematic flow of a process, with essential genes (red circles) connected by non-essential genes (black circles) organized into two parallel pathway branches (black dashed lines). If at least one of the pathway branches is required for viability, SL interactions (red lines) will be observed between the pathway branches but not within a pathway branch. In this picture, deleting any component of a pathway branch destroys its activity. (<bold>B</bold>) Directly observed SL genetic interactions bridge pathway branches. The table indicates that SL interactions will be observed between components of the two pathway branches, whereas no interactions will be observed within a branch. (<bold>C</bold>) Functional associations inferred from the congruence score (blue lines) join the components of a pathway branch. The table indicates raw number of SL interaction partners shared by a pair of genes and its conversion to the congruence score, calculated as the &#x02212;log<sub>10</sub><italic>P</italic>-value for partner sharing.
