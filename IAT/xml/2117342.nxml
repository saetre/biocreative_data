Data have accumulated over decades suggesting that variability in human susceptibility to TB disease has a genetic component. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in initiating the innate immune response to many pathogens in mouse models, but little is known about their role in human infections. Human TLRs have been reported to recognize mycobacterial antigens and initiate an immune response. We tested the hypothesis that amino acid-altering polymorphisms in five TLRs were associated with susceptibility to TB disease using a population-based case-control study with 1,312 adult TB patients and controls. Full-coding region sequencing of the five TLR genes in all 1,312 subjects yielded a data set in excess of 16 Mb. Rare nonsynonymous polymorphisms in <italic>TLR6-TLR1-TLR10</italic> were significantly overrepresented among African-American TB cases compared with ethnically-matched control subjects. Common nonsynonymous polymorphisms in <italic>TLR6-TLR1-TLR10</italic> also were significantly associated with TB disease in certain ethnic groups. Among African Americans, homozygotes for the common-variant haplotype TLR1-248S, TLR1-602I, and TLR6-249S had a significantly increased TB disease risk. A transmission/disequilibrium test on an independent sample found that the TLR1-248S variant was preferentially transmitted to diseased children, thereby confirming disease association. These results are consistent with recent reports implicating TLR1 variants, including TLR1-602, in significantly altered innate immune responses. Also consistent with disease association, rare TLR6 variants were defective in their ability to mediate NF-&#x003ba;B signal transduction in transfected human cells. Taken together, the data suggest that variant TLRs contribute to human susceptibility to TB disease. Extensive full-exon resequencing was critical for revealing new information about the role of TLRs in human-pathogen interactions and the genetic basis of innate immune function.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB), is a leading public health problem in the United States and throughout the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-World1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Development of active TB disease depends on a complex relationship between the bacterium and the host. Importantly, only about 10&#x00025; of presumed immunologically normal individuals who are exposed to MTB will develop disease in their lifetime. The molecular mechanisms responsible for susceptibility to clinical disease caused by this pathogen are poorly understood.</p><p>Many lines of evidence suggest that host genetics contributes to the susceptibility of humans to developing disease after exposure to MTB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Kallman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Remus1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

For example, alleles of genes encoding HLA class II antigens, mannose-binding protein, natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1), vitamin D-receptor, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-1 receptor, IL-8, IL-12 receptor, MCP-1, DC-SIGN, SP110, TIRAP, MAL, and interferon-&#x003b3; have been reported to be associated with TB disease in some populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Casanova1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Khor1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. However, with few exceptions, the disease-associated alleles reported in these studies have only relatively modest effects, suggesting that additional susceptibility genes remain to be discovered.</p><p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of proteins that play a key role in the innate immune response to infectious agents through their ability to discriminate conserved microbial structures, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), from self <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Akira1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. TLR recognition of PAMPs such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), teichoic acid, and surface lipoproteins, initiates signal transduction through the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Akira1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B induces transcription of proinflammatory cytokine genes essential to mounting a protective immune response and host defense. Different TLRs recognize distinct classes of products synthesized by pathogens. For example, TLR4 is a receptor for LPS made by Gram-negative bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Tapping1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this role, Arbour <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Arbour1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> reported that amino acid polymorphisms in the extracellular domain of TLR4 conferred altered responsiveness to inhaled LPS in humans. Among the human TLR family members described to date, TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, and TLR9 have been implicated in the recognition of bacterial components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Akira1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

For example, the G and A alleles of N248S had allele frequencies of 0.789 and 0.211 respectively, in African Americans compared with 0.116 and 0.884, respectively in European Americans. Alleles of both NSPs (248S and 602I) were associated with TB disease in African American patients. N248 (common in European Americans) is a conserved amino acid site in the extracellular domain of TLR1 and TLR6 (N253), and is a putative glycosylation site. Replacement of the Asn residue with Ser might result in altered glycosylation, potentially changing TLR1 folding or function (e.g., PAMP recognition or signal transduction). The S602I amino acid replacement alters the first amino acid of the inferred intracellular domain of TLR1, and this residue varies in TLR10 (L602) and TLR6 (I607). The odds ratios for the tests of association of TLR1 N248S and S602I with TB in African Americans were 1.63 and 2.50 (with tail <italic>P</italic> values of 0.009 and &#x0003c;0.001 respectively), whereas the respective odds ratios in European Americans were 0.20 and 0.49 (neither significant).

If this is the case, it is reasonable to expect that some of the rare TLR variants have altered function. Because it was not practical to study the functional aspects of all TLR variants, we elected to focus our efforts on several TLR6 variants. This TLR was chosen for analysis because it has been implicated in MTB-host interaction in the mouse, and reporter assays were available at the time when the nucleotide sequence data were completed. It has previously been shown with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that mouse TLR6 and TLR2 associate in a ligand-independent manner to form a functional complex that constitutively signals through the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Ozinsky1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

To test this hypothesis, we generated TLR6 cDNA vectors expressing wild-type TLR6, a dominant negative form of TLR6 (Pro680His), and 5 TLR6 variants. Of the 5 rare variants examined, 2 were truncated receptors, the other two each had a single amino acid substitution in the TIR domain. The <italic>TLR6</italic> constructs were co-transfected with a human <italic>TLR2</italic> expression vector and an NF-&#x003ba;B reporter into HEK 293 cells and their ability to mediate NF-&#x003ba;B activation was assessed. As predicted, the Pro680His dominant negative replacement completely abolished NF-&#x003ba;B activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001318-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The truncated TLR6 variants (Leu251stop and codon 460/461-5 bp deletion) and one of the TIR domain variants (Asn690Thr) were significantly impaired in their ability to induce NF-&#x003ba;B activation compared to wild-type TLR6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001318-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The rare variant (Thr255Ile) characterized by a substitution in a region of the extracellular domain containing a cluster of rare polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001318-g001">Figure 1</xref>), also had a significant decrease in NF-&#x003ba;B signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001318-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001318-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001318.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Altered NF-&#x003ba;B signal transduction by rare variants of TLR6.</title><p>HEK 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with <italic>TLR2</italic> and the indicated <italic>TLR6</italic> variant expression plasmids, NF-&#x003ba;B reporter (firefly luciferase), and &#x003b2;-actin <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase plasmids.

Of note, Thr756 is one of two amino acids in the entire TIR region that varies between humans and chimpanzees, whereas the Asn690Thr replacement is located in a region of the molecule that is well conserved in human, chimpanzee, and mouse TLR6 (data not shown). These observations suggested that an amino acid replacement at Asn690 would have a more substantial detrimental effect on NF-&#x003ba;B signaling than variation located at Thr756.

Among the 99 families studied, 64 families with both parents available were informative for conventional transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) analysis by having at least one parent who was heterozygous for N248S. A total of 99 transmissions of the A (Asn) or G (Ser) allele of the TLR1 248 codon occurred from heterozygous parents to affected children. The G allele was transmitted 61 times compared to 38 times for the A allele, a significant excess (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.021) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001318-t003">Table 3</xref>).

First, there was a significant increase in the frequency of rare NSPs in TB patients compared to the matched controls. Second, in the case of <italic>TLR1</italic>, the TDT analysis revealed that the allele encoding the TLR-248S variant was significantly overrepresented among diseased children (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.021). Third, cell biology studies found that several of the <italic>TLR6</italic> variants were deficient in ability to mediate signal transduction. A fourth line of evidence stems from the population genetics analysis. By aligning human <italic>TLR6</italic> coding sequences with the <italic>Bos taurus</italic> homolog (NM_001001159.1), we find that there were 167 nonsynonymous differences and 193 synonymous differences. These numbers vary somewhat depending on the human allele one uses, but the conclusion is robust to this choice&#x02013;the patient sample has an excess of nonsynonymous variants (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;24) relative to the number of synonymous variants (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9) compared to the degree of divergence with cow (McDonald&#x02013;Kreitman test, <italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8.39, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.004). The pattern of polymorphism in <italic>TLR6</italic> in TB patients deviated significantly from neutrality, and the major cause was an excess of rare mutations that would alter the primary amino acid sequence of TLR6. Inasmuch as singleton mutations occurred in significant excess in TB patients, the increase in susceptibility to TB disease associated with these polymorphisms must be substantial. In this regard, we note that before the introduction of widespread anti-MTB drug therapy in the 1950's, the death rate from TB was very high. Hence, the data are broadly consistent with a process whereby variants that reduce the ability to fight infections enter the population by mutation, but have been maintained at a low frequency by the action of natural selection. This process leads to an excess of rare nonsynonymous polymorphism in the human population compared to the number of nonsynonymous fixations between humans and chimpanzees.</p><p>Haplotype analysis can be more powerful than SNP analysis for providing insight into the genetic basis of complex traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Morris1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, and provides a fifth line of evidence for the role of TLR polymorphism in TB susceptibility. We found that both rare SNPs and rare haplotypes of <italic>TLR6</italic> also were significantly overrepresented among the TB patients relative to the matched control population. The rare haplotypes present in TB patients do not cluster closely together in the phylogenetic network of TLR6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001318.s004">Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001318.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

This test found that only 3 out of 1000 samples had more than the observed number of singletons present in the group of cases than was observed in <italic>TLR6</italic>. The data appear to be consistent with the rare haplotypes being derived independently (and by their rarity, we infer recently) from multiple common haplotypes by single genetic events such as nucleotide substitution or deletion of a short segment of DNA. Insofar as <italic>TLR6</italic> is concerned, this means that TB disease is not associated with a single unique mutation, rather, many independent mutations are associated with enhanced disease susceptibility.</p><p>Our findings may bear on a report in the literature suggesting that African Americans may have an enhanced susceptibility to TB disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Stead1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. We found significant association between common and rare NSPs and increased susceptibility to TB disease in African Americans. The TDT analysis also revealed an association between TLR1 and TB susceptibility. However, these findings were not uniformly the case in the European American and Hispanic populations. It is reasonable to consider what factors may account for the differences between populations. On average, these three populations have quite different recent ancestral histories, which means that they have undoubtedly encountered distinct selective forces, including but not limited to lethal infectious agents such as <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. In this regard, we note that Ferwerda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Ferwerda1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> recently have hypothesized that certain nonsynonymous amino acid changes polymorphisms in TLR4 rose to high frequency in sub-Saharan Africa because they protect against malaria.</p><p>Simply because of their rarity, individual rare variants are not shared across populations, adding to the apparent heterogeneity across population samples in TLR associations. It is very possible that some rare variants increase and some decrease susceptibility to TB. Given that the long-term effective population size of African Americans is larger than the other two populations we studied, one would expect more rare variants to occur in that population. Although several environmental factors are likely operative, and many genes contribute to TB susceptibility, a larger pool of rare variants (in either TLRs or other proteins) could be a factor contributing to an enhanced susceptibility to TB. We note that different selection pressures may also account for the reciprocal allele frequencies at the common variant sites (for example, TLR1-248 and TLR1-602) observed in the African American and European American populations. We also note that several of the amino acid polymorphisms we identified in TLR1 and TLR2 map to regions of these proteins that interact with each other and with lipopeptide, as recently revealed by crystal structure analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Jin1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Detrimentally Altered Signal-Transduction by Rare Variants of TLR6 and TB Disease Susceptibility</title><p>Whether an individual develops TB disease or remains asymptomatic after exposure to the bacterium depends on the ability of the host to effectively kill MTB or sufficiently control its replication.

TLR6 forms a heterodimeric complex with TLR2 to activate macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Ozinsky1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, a critical step in defense against MTB. Bulut <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Bulut1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> reported that the dominant-negative mutant of mouse TLR6 (Pro691His) inhibited the ability of transfected cells to respond to soluble tuberculosis factor. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that some of the rare TLR6 variants we identified in the TB patients have altered function. Indeed, the results of our cell biology studies, which focused on the formation of a functional TLR2/TLR6 signaling complex, confirmed this idea. Under a current model of TLR function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Akira1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, the proinflammatory signal-transduction cascade that protects the host from disease caused by MTB may be detrimentally altered in individuals with rare TLR6 variants, thereby leading to enhanced likelihood of clinical disease. Studies are underway to examine this issue in the context of primary cells obtained from patients and controls with known <italic>TLR6</italic> genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Rare Variants of Proteins Involved in Human Innate Immune Function and Infectious Disease Susceptibility</title><p>It is generally accepted that human susceptibility to TB disease is a complex genetic trait <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Casanova1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Bellamy1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Substantial controversy exists in human medical genetics regarding the contribution of common and rare mutations to susceptibility to complex diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Weiss1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Wright1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. One school of thought favors the idea that common genetic diseases are associated with polymorphisms that are present in relatively high frequency in a population (common disease/common variant model). Another school of thought argues that rare mutations play a much more important role in susceptibility to common diseases than usually assumed, and interest in this area is accelerating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Cohen1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Topal1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. The results of our study support both arguments. While we do find common variants that display significant association with TB susceptibility, we also present evidence that rare variants of proteins that detrimentally alter innate host defense are important contributors to the outcome of the interaction between a bacterial pathogen and the infected individual. This theme is echoed by the finding that a large array of distinct rare variants of the IL-12 receptor &#x003b2;1 result in enhanced susceptibility to infections caused by bacteria such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp., <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> BCG, and environmental mycobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-LichtenauerKaligis1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Fieschi1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, we note that well over 200 otherwise rare mutations can cause X-linked chronic granulomatous disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Heyworth1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, an abnormality characterized by altered ability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to kill several bacterial and fungal pathogens. Similarly, Picard <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Picard1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref> recently reported the occurrence of rare mutations in IRAK-4 that confer susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections.</p><p>Thus far, human TB susceptibility studies have been conducted largely by association studies that examine the effect of common mutations in patients and controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Casanova1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Bellamy1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. One important practical consequence of the involvement of many distinct rare variants in host defense is that it likely will be necessary to completely sequence candidate susceptibility genes in large samples of affected individuals and control subjects to identify disease association.</p><p>In summary, by discovering a link between TLR variants, altered TLR signal transduction, and enhanced susceptibility to TB disease, our findings provide strong impetus to analyze the relationship between nucleotide sequence variation in other human candidate genes, and susceptibility to infectious agents. Our study was designed to investigate the association of TLR variants with TB disease in only one geographic area that was purposely defined narrowly. Our findings may not be generally applicable to all TB patients. Indeed, there is substantial variance in the results of TB susceptibility studies reported in the literature for mice and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Casanova1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Bellamy1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Kramnik1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of humans, this variance may be caused by differences in ethnicity, environmental factors such as nutrition, and exposure to nontuberculous mycobacteria. Another variable that may, in principle, influence host-pathogen interaction is the relative frequency of distinct clones of MTB circulating in the human population under study. Although strains of MTB are, on average, relatively closely related in overall chromosomal character, many strain-to-strain genetic differences have been described, and the frequency of occurrence of distinct clones differs geographically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Sreevatsan1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Gutacker1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, evidence is accumulating that strains can differ significantly in virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Manca1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. The possibility that different host genotypes have differential susceptibility across different MTB strains remains to be tested. It is a formal possibility that the mechanisms used by MTB strains to overcome host immunity differ in a strain-dependent fashion, or differ depending on human genotype/strain genotype combination. Clearly, studies analogous to the one we report here need to be conducted in human populations that differ in ethnicity and age from the one we investigated. It is also reasonable to speculate that rare TLR variants influence human susceptibility to disease caused by other infectious agents.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Population-Based Adult Case-Control Study</title><p>This study was based on analysis of 1,312 HIV-seronegative adults living in Houston, Texas, enrolled in a population-based study of TB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Ma1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001318-Ma2">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>.
