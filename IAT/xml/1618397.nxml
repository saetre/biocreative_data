Eag1 was expressed in 71% of all tumours, with frequencies ranging from 56% (liposarcoma) to 82% (rhabdomyosarcoma). We detected differences in expression levels depending on the histological type, but no association was seen between expression of this protein and sex, age, grade or tumour size. Four cell lines derived from relevant sarcoma histological types (fibrosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma) were tested for Eag1 expression by real-time RT-PCR. We found all four lines to be positive for Eag1. In these cell lines, blockage of Eag1 by RNA interference led to a decrease in proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Eag1 is aberrantly expressed in over 70% sarcomas. In sarcoma cell lines, inhibition of Eag1 expression and/or function leads to reduced proliferation. The high frequency of expression of Eag1 in primary tumours and the restriction of normal expression of the channel to the brain, suggests the application of this protein for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Ion channels play important roles in several cellular functions such as excitability, contraction, cell cycle progression and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The link between ion channels and disease has received widespread attention in the last decade as mutations in several ion channels have been shown to be responsible for certain neurological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Whereas many of these mutations affect well-characterised channels of the nervous system, little is know about the effects in non-excitable cells. The voltage-activated potassium channel ether &#x000e0; go-go (Eag1) has recently gained increased interest because of its potential oncogenic role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] have shown that the Eag1 channel is involved in cell-cycle progression of tumour cells, and that a significant reduction in the cell proliferation of these cell lines could be achieved by inhibiting Eag1 expression using antisense oligonucleotides. It has also been reported that expression of this channel in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) increased both metabolic activity and proliferation rate. In an immunodeficient mouse model, Eag1-transfected CHO cells caused rapidly growing tumours, while wild type CHO cells were much less aggressive, suggesting that Eag1 expression confers a selective advantage to cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Recently, functional expression of Eag1 was found in samples of cervix carcinoma from patients, while the channel was absent in normal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Another example of the relationship of Eag1 with the cell cycle is the expression of the channel in myoblasts, but not in adult human skeletal muscle. This suggests that Eag1 expression is a cell-cycle related phenomenon, since myoblast fusion is intimately coupled to irreversible cell cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Together, these data point to a direct involvement of Eag1 channels in cell proliferation and suggest that these channels participate in the transformation of normal cells into tumour cells. Because of their oncogenic properties, their restricted distribution in normal tissue and ubiquitous expression in tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], Eag1 potassium channels have gained recent interest as potential targets for cancer detection and therapy.</p><p>Soft tissue sarcomas are relatively rare (less than 1% of all cancers) and represent a highly heterogeneous group of tumours. More than 40% of new sarcoma patients die from the disease each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The relatively small number of cases and great diversity in histopathologic presentation, anatomic site and biological behaviour has made a comprehensive understanding of these disease entities extremely difficult. Clinicians and patients are still faced with limited options of chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy, with only modest improvement in survival and cure. While surgery and radiation therapy can be effective in soft tissue sarcomas that manifest a more regional biology, sarcomas with a more systemic biology benefit little from the currently available therapeutic tools. In the present work we studied the expression of Eag1 in soft tissue sarcomas of patients because the normal cells that give rise to these tumours do not express the Eag1 channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Efficiency of Eag1 detection depends on the duration of storage</title><p>Samples from 210 patients with soft tissue sarcoma were stained for Eag1 expression, from which positive signals were observed with high frequency.

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> (<italic>insert</italic>) shows the distribution of Eag1-expressing tumours as a function of the year (between 1997 and 2004) in which the sample had been originally obtained. Most of the cases stemming from 1997 to 1999 were negative, while 50% of cases from 2000 onwards were positive. The limited number of cases from 2002 precludes statistical analysis, but 70% of tumours dating from both 2003 and 2004 were positive. There is an inverse correlation between the time elapsed between storage of the sample and the performance of immunohistochemistry (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Samples archived for up to two years have a homogeneous positive rate for Eag1 and there is no statistically significant difference between samples stored for one or two years. Samples older than three years showed a decrease in positive signals for Eag1, with 22% of positive cases in six-year old samples. This strongly suggests that the Eag1 antigen is labile and becomes undetectable with time. We cannot exclude that the storage conditions could influence antigen stability, and further studies will be required to clarify under which conditions the Eag1 antigen becomes unstable. This particular feature of the Eag1 protein impairs retrospective studies and reduces the effective availability of samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Eag1 is frequently expressed in soft tissue sarcomas</title><p>Due to the aforementioned limitations, we used only recently obtained samples for analysis. We stained samples from resective surgical interventions not older than one year (from 2003 and 2004). This limited our collection to 121 samples from 119 sarcoma patients. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> summarises the clinico-pathological features of the cases and the Eag1 channel expression. The frequency of expression of Eag1 in soft tissue sarcoma averaged 71% of the cases studied, with variations between histological types from 56% (liposarcoma) to 82% (rhabdomyosarcoma). No association was detected between Eag1 expression and sex, age, site, grade or tumour size. The expression of Eag1 in the primary site or in metastases (75 and 85%, respectively) was higher than in recidivating tumours (56%), but this difference was not statistically significant. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows representative images of normal (morphologically non-malignant) and neoplastic tissue from all six subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma studied here.

We considered staining intensities of 1+ as low Eag1 expression and 2&#x02013;3+ as high Eag1 expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Analysing tumours using this score system, we found high Eag1 expression in 57 patients (47% of the total population), while the other 29 cases showed low Eag1 expression (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

Previous and ongoing studies on this channel have demonstrated that it is expressed in a very selective manner in the brain and a few peripheral cell populations, all of which are epithelial in origin. No expression of the channels has been detected in connective tissues. However, we have found channel expression in 70% of human soft tissue sarcomas and several sarcoma cell lines, but this does not correlate with epidemiological or pathological parameters of the tumours, except for the histological type; rhabdomyosarcoma and synovial sarcoma are strongly positive most frequently.</p><p>Unfortunately, samples stored for periods of time longer than two years give unreliable results, probably due to antigen degradation during storage. The liability of the antigen under the archival conditions is not unique for Eag1. An apparent reduction in signal was observed for oestrogen receptor in ten breast cancer samples that were re-evaluated four years after the first analysis (data not shown). These findings imply that archival samples have to be used cautiously when testing potential clinical correlations of a particular antigen. In the case of Eag1, this precludes retrospective studies spanning periods longer than two years. We have nevertheless initiated the prospective analysis of our cases. Despite the limited time period (and number of cases), we have found that the tumours from patients who died over the two-year follow up period were much more likely to express significant levels of Eag1. Of the 19 registered deaths, tumours from 17 expressed Eag1 highly. We could not extract much information from histological samples such as rhabdomyosarcoma or synoviosarcoma because of their generally high Eag1 expression levels (29% and 17% mortality, respectively, all these cases showed high Eag1 expression). Nevertheless, a detailed analysis of the outcome in the liposarcoma population suggests the association of high Eag1 expression with a bad prognosis. Of the 32 liposarcoma cases, 6 (19%) had died during the two-year follow-up period and 5 of these were high Eag1 expressing tumours. These fatalities correspond to 38% of the total high Eag1 expressing liposarcomas, while 93% of the patients with Eag1 negative tumours survived the follow-up period. We also found an indication that the frequency of recurrent disease was higher in the Eag1 positive population- the incidence of recurrence (13%) in Eag1 positive cases was twice as great as that of the Eag1 negatives (6%). Taken together, our data may indicate an association between Eag1 expression and bad prognosis. Further studies with a longer outcome (5 years) and a higher number of patients will clarify the potential usefulness of Eag1 as a prognostic marker.</p><p>Due to the behaviour of the antigen with time, prospective studies will be required to investigate whether there is any correlation between levels of Eag1 expression and clinical outcome and/or response to therapy. Such a correlation would obviously be of great interest, since the channel could then serve as a prognostic marker. The lack of correlation of the channel with epidemiological factors (sex, age, grade and site of tumour) makes it difficult to assess a potential prognostic value of Eag1 expression at this stage. However, it should be kept in mind that the histopathological samples showing the highest abundance of Eag1 expression, rhabdomyosarcoma and synovial sarcoma (p &#x0003c; 0.01), are particularly aggressive tumours. There was also a clear difference between tumour and morphologically non-malignant tissue in the same slides with respect to Eag1 expression, the non-malignant tissue always being negative. This could open the possibility of the use of Eag1 as a tool for the differential diagnosis of malignant transformation together with morphological criteria.</p><p>It is still remains possible that the frequency of negative tumours (29%) in our series is due to poor detection sensitivity of the antibody and that the actual incidence of Eag1 expression is even higher. Our Eag1 detection procedure relied on a directly coupled single chain antibody. This reduces the probability of false positives that can arise with the use of secondary antibodies and developing systems, but simultaneously looses two multiplicative amplification steps &#x02013; the secondary antibody and the widely used peroxides polymers. Therefore, while our method is more specific, it is about 60 times less sensitive than other conventional immunohistochemical procedures. The application of methods specifically designed to detect minute quantities of biological macromolecules such as in-situ immuno-PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] will give a clearer estimate of the actual incidence of Eag1 over-expression in soft tissue sarcomas. Another factor increasing the difficulty of analysing Eag1 expression, and more specifically its potential usefulness as a tumour marker, is that Eag1 immunoreactivity is mainly intracellular (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Although electrophysiological experiments detected Eag1 currents in tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], unequivocally indicating surface expression of functional channel proteins, the vast majority of the protein in a particular cell is intracellular. Even the artificially expressing cell line used in this study shows mainly cytoplasmic Eag1 staining, while exhibiting robust Eag1 currents in electrophysiological experiments. We therefore cannot exclude a correlation between plasma membrane Eag1 and clinical outcome.</p><p>Among the positive specimens, tumour cells and the surrounding morphologically non-malignant cells can be clearly demarcated. Should Eag1 consistently be a distinct characteristic of tumour cells, this finding presents a potential therapeutic opportunity to distinguish between normal and tumour cells. If at least a fraction of the protein is accessible from the extracellular side, Eag1 may be a good candidate for immunotherapeutical approaches. In vitro experiments in this study showed that several sarcoma cell lines express abundant Eag1 protein and that blockage of the channel by imipramine correlates with a reduction of cell proliferation. Unfortunately, the tricyclic anti-depressant imipramine blocks not only Eag1 but also many different channels such as cardiac and neuronal sodium, calcium and potassium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. To overcome this problem we used RNA interference, which represents a suitable alternative to functional blockers of channel activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. siRNAs for Eag1 have been thoroughly characterized and do not induce non-specific responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Eag1 siRNA treatment resulted in a reduction of proliferation in all soft tissue sarcoma cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) to an extent comparable to that induced by imipramine.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although absent from healthy tissues, Eag1 expression can be detected in 70% soft tissue sarcomas. The frequency of Eag1 expression depends on the histological type, but we found no association with other epidemiological parameters. We could establish a preliminary association of high Eag1 expression and bad prognosis. Additionally, we could show that inhibition of Eag1 expression and/or function reduces the proliferation of several sarcoma cell lines. These findings highlight the role of Eag1 in the proliferation of tumour cells and prompt further studies to validate Eag1 as a potential diagnostic tool and/or anti-cancer ion channel target.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Two hundred and ten patients from the Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA), who had surgery between 1997 and 2004 for resection of soft tissue sarcomas were included in this study.

Sections were deparaffinated in xylene and rehydrated in descending alcohols. Antigen retrieval was performed by heating the slides for 30 minutes in a steamer in 10 mM citrate buffer solution pH 6.0. Afterwards, the slides were cooled down to room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Non-specific binding sites were blocked using 10% BSA in TBS for 30 minutes at room temperature.
