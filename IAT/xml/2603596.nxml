The ectopic overexpression of miR-221 is able, per se, to confer a high growth advantage to LNCaP-derived tumors in SCID mice. Consistently, the anti-miR-221/222 antagomir treatment of established subcutaneous tumors derived from the highly aggressive PC3 cell line, naturally expressing high levels of miR-221/222, reduces tumor growth by increasing intratumoral p27 amount; this effect is long lasting, as it is detectable as long as 25 days after the treatment. Furthermore, we provide evidence in favour of a clinical relevance of the role of miR-221/222 in prostate carcinoma, by showing their general upregulation in patient-derived primary cell lines, where we find a significant inverse correlation with p27 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These findings suggest that modulating miR-221/222 levels may have a therapeutic potential in prostate carcinoma.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>MicroRNAs are short (&#x0223c;22 nt) RNA molecules whose relevance as regulators of gene expression has been shown in relatively recent times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Ambros1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, during which, however, a huge amount of data have been collected demonstrating that they play extremely important roles in almost all aspects of biology, such as development and disease. They commonly act as negative regulators of the expression of protein coding genes, usually recognizing and binding to specific sites in the 3&#x02032;UTRs of their mRNAs, and impairing their translation, or sometimes even inducing the degradation of the target mRNA (for an exhaustive review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Filipowicz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Among oncomiRs, we and others previously found that miR-221 and miR-222 are involved in several different types of human neoplasms, such as glioblastoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Ciafr1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Medina1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, prostate carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Galardi1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, non-small cell lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Yu1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Garofalo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, hepatocellular cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Meng1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Fornari1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, pancreatic cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Lee1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, and many others. The common observation was that this couple of microRNAs, or at least one of them, is significantly upregulated in tumors versus normal tissues, and often its expression marks the most aggressive forms of human solid tumors. The molecular basis of their &#x0201c;oncogenic&#x0201d; role was clarified for the first time by our group in the context of prostate carcinoma cells, through the discovery of their target mRNA, p27<sup>kip1</sup>, a negative regulator of cell cycle progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Galardi1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, and then this same finding was confirmed in most forms of cancers where the overexpression of miR-221/222 had been detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-LeSage1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Medina1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Garofalo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Fornari1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Visone1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this way a single microRNA can control a whole biological (or pathological) pathway by &#x0201c;hitting&#x0201d; numerous of its keypoints. The reason accounting for the recognition of shared targets for both miR-221 and miR-222 is found in their &#x0201c;seed&#x0201d; sequences, short (&#x0223c;7&#x02013;8 nt) regions at their 5&#x02032; ends through which they bind their target sites in mRNA 3&#x02032;UTRs: these &#x0201c;seeds&#x0201d; are identical in miR-221 and miR-222 and are also very well evolutionarily conserved, likely indicating the common involvement of these two microRNAs in the same pathways.</p><p>Prostate carcinoma represents a big challenge to the scientific and clinical community as it remains the most common malignancy in men of the Western world, where it is still the second leading cause of cancer death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Jemal1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

On the other hand, we sought to investigate if it is possible to inhibit miR-221 and miR-222 expression in mouse models of established prostate carcinoma, in order to set up the premises for a future therapeutic approach. To achieve this goal, we treated pre-established tumors induced by the s.c. injection of PC3 cells into SCID mice, with anti-miR-221 and anti-miR-222 &#x0201c;antagomirs&#x0201d;, cholesterol-conjugated antisense molecules previously shown to own a good bioavailability and stability <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Krtzfeld1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Krtzfeld2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, we wanted to validate the clinical relevance of miR-221/222 expression in prostate tumors, and thus we measured the expression of these two microRNAs in primary cells from 18 patients with stage II&#x02013;III prostate cancer, and concurrently quantified p27 expression, to check if the inverse relationship linking miR-221/222 to p27 is reproducible and significant in clinical samples.</p><p>Our findings indicate that miR-221 and miR-222 are key modulators of prostate carcinoma also <italic>in vivo</italic>. In fact, their inhibition significantly slows down tumor growth in a mouse model, and they appear aberrantly expressed in patient samples compared to normal tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The overexpression of miR-221 is sufficient to strongly enhance growth of LNCaP xenografts</title><p>We have recently shown that miR-221 and miR-222 are positive regulators of <italic>in vitro</italic> prostate carcinoma growth through the repression of p27 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Galardi1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

for the scientific and clinical community as it is, in its most aggressive forms, untreatable and the second leading cause of cancer death in men from the Western world. Effective treatments are still missing for the most aggressive forms of this tumor, and, also, there is still a great need for precise molecular markers of prostate carcinoma. In the recent years, the data collected about tumor-specific microRNA expression have shed a very promising light on the possibility of classifying some tumors on the basis of specific microRNA expression, raising new hopes about the use of microRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic tools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Dalmay1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In our work we aimed to demonstrate that the overexpression of miR-221 and miR-222, a couple of microRNAs that we had previously shown to be strongly upregulated <italic>in vitro</italic> in aggressive prostate carcinoma cell lines, is relevant to prostate carcinoma cell growth <italic>in vivo</italic>, both in mouse models and in human tumor samples. To achieve this, we have overexpressed miR-221 in the poorly aggressive human prostate carcinoma cell line LNCaP, and observed the growth of tumor xenografts derived from those cells in SCID mice. Our results are in full agreement with the pro-proliferative action of miR-221: tumors grew faster and larger, their mitotic and proliferative (Ki-67) indexes were strongly enhanced, and the long-lasting overexpression of miR-221 reduced the tumor expression of p27, again confirming our <italic>in vitro</italic> data.</p><p>However, of course, the great interest of this observation lies in its reverse implications: that inhibiting miR-221 and miR-222 in prostate carcinoma may be a way to reduce its growth potential. Indeed, we have demonstrated this <italic>via</italic> two different approaches whose results anyhow converge towards the same conclusion. We have pre-transfected cells from the highly aggressive PC3 cell line with LNA antisense oligonucleotides targeting miR-221 and miR-222, and subsequently followed the growth of tumor xenografts obtained through the injection of pre-transfected cells into SCID mice. On the other hand, we have injected anti-miR-221 and anti-miR-222 antagomirs into pre-established PC3 xenografts. Both approaches clearly aimed at reducing miR-221 and miR-222 in the tumors but, while the first one theoretically conferred a delay to pretransfected cells that received the LNA oligoes, before they settled in the host environment and started assembling a true tumor, the second one more closely mimicked a &#x0201c;treatment&#x0201d;, as it was performed in already grown tumors, where cells had already formed their network of contacts within the host body. For these reasons we believe that our positive data in this latter settlement are the most significant and interesting, as they show that miR-221/222 inhibition can reduce the growth of pre-established prostate carcinoma xenografts. Once more, we show that treated tumors growing smaller than controls maintain reduced levels of miR-221 and miR-222 for the whole duration of the experiments, and that this produces a permanent upregulation of p27, otherwise low in control tumors. Thus, our prostate carcinoma xenograft data demonstrate, as a whole, that miR-221 (and most likely miR-222, even if here we are not providing a direct evidence for this) is sufficient to strongly enhance prostate carcinoma growth and, consequently, that the inhibition of miR-221 and miR-222 is necessary, and in fact effective, to reduce the <italic>in vivo</italic> growth of this tumor. We think that our data involving antagomirs, beside being promising <italic>per se</italic>, represent one of the first attempts to use these molecules locally in a tumor. In fact, while most of the papers published to date provide data about the systemic use of use of antagomirs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Krtzfeld2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Car1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, only two recent papers have described the intra-tumoral treatment with antagomirs: Felicetti and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Felicetti1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> employed antagomir doses similar to the ones we have used here, to treat melanoma xenografts, obtaining inhibitory results comparable to ours, even if the growth of the tumors was not followed for as long as we did in our present work. In a different work, Fontana and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Fontana1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> injected anti-miR-17-5p antagomirs into neuroblastoma xenografts, indeed obtaining a total regression of 30&#x00025; of tumors. It must be noticed, though, that the antagomir dosage employed in that work is several orders of magnitudes higher than the one we have used here. Moreover, the molecular analyses demonstrating the effectiveness of antagomir treatment were performed at very short times after antagomir injection, whereas we were able to prove an effective downregulation of miR-221/222, and a consequent upregulation of p27, for longer than three weeks.</p><p>Finally, we think that the relevance of our data, collected in mouse models of prostate carcinoma, is supported by the last results we show in this study, about a significant inverse correlation between miR-221/222 and p27 expression in primary cell lines derived from tumor samples of prostate carcinoma. Reduced p27 expression was associated with the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer and poor survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Fernandez1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Said1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, to such an extent that p27 was proposed as a biomarker for this tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Said1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we still lack a full comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms perturbing p27 expression during prostate carcinoma onset and progression. We believe that our work now indicates that miR-221/222 upregulation may be one of the possible mechanisms responsible for p27 downregulation in this tumor. Further studies are certainly needed to more deeply dissect miR-221/222 role, also taking into account that it is very likely that their oncogenic action is not limited to the inhibition of p27, as recently demonstrated in other tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Medina1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004029-Fornari1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our results represent the first step toward a possible use of miR-221/222 as molecular markers for prostate carcinoma, and set the base for the future employment of anti-miR-221/222 antagomirs for the inhibition of prostate carcinoma growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines and transfections</title><p>LNCaP and PC3 cell lines were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10&#x00025; heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 20 mM L-Glutamine, 100 U/ml of penicillin G sodium, 100 &#x000b5;g/ml of streptomycin sulphate in a humidified atmosphere containing 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Transfections were performed by Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Italy) using 8 &#x000b5;g of plasmid DNA in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen, Italy), as recommended by the manufacturer.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>In vivo studies</title><p>For studies involving LNCaP cells, 3&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> exponentially growing, empty vector-transduced or miR-221-transduced LNCaP cells were resuspended in a solution of 50&#x00025; Matrigel in PBS, and s.c. injected into the left and the right flank respectively of 5 wk old male CB.17 SCID mice (Harlan Italy S.r.l.).</p><p>For the experiments with <italic>in vitro</italic> transfected PC3 cells, LNA oligonucleotides against miR-221 and miR-222, and a negative control oligonucleotide were obtained from Ambion Inc.

Another set of slides was stained with rabbit monoclonal antibody to Ki67 (Ventana Medical System Inc., Tucson, AZ, USA) to observe the proliferating cells, and the slides were viewed on a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon Corporation,Tokyo, Japan). The Ki-67 labeling index was determined by counting 1000 tumor cells at &#x000d7;60 magnification. Ten high power fields, each containing 150&#x02013;200 cells, were randomly selected for counting on each slide at a &#x000d7;600 magnification. Brown, granular nuclear staining was considered to be positive for Ki-67. Labeling indices were calculated as the percentages of tumor cells with positive nuclear staining. Immunostaining was performed blindly and scored on prostate tumor tissue sections from each mouse (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10 per group; two sections from each tumor) by an independent pathologist. The number of positive cells over the total number of cells were counted manually by two independent operators. Both the Ki67-stained and unstained cells were counted, and the number of Ki67-positive cells per total number of cells determined the Ki67 score. For statistical evaluation, the Ki67 scores and the mitotic index were averaged over ten fields in each tumor and averaged again over all tumors in each group.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Primary prostate cells</title><p>Tissues were obtained from radical prostatectomy at the Department of Urology, S.

For a detailed description of patients' samples, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004029-t001">Table 1</xref>. The tumoral or non-tumoral nature of each sample was determined by histopathological examination.
