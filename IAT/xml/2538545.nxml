In our previous studies, we have shown that TTC9A was a hormonally-regulated gene in breast cancer cells. In this study, we found that TTC9A was over-expressed in breast cancer tissues compared with the adjacent controls (P &#x0003c; 0.00001), suggesting it might be involved in the breast cancer development process. The aim of the current study was to further elucidate the function of TTC9A.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Breast samples from 25 patients including the malignant breast tissues and the adjacent normal tissues were processed for Southern blot analysis. Yeast-two-hybrid assay, GST pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitation were used to identify and verify the interaction between TTC9A and other proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Tropomyosin Tm5NM-1 was identified as one of the TTC9A partner proteins. The interaction between TTC9A and Tm5NM-1 was further confirmed by GST pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitation in mammalian cells. TTC9A domains required for the interaction were also characterized in this study. The results suggested that the first TPR domain and the linker fragment between the first two TPR domains of TTC9A were important for the interaction with Tm5NM-1 and the second and the third TPR might play an inhibitory role.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Since the primary function of tropomyosin is to stabilize actin filament, its interaction with TTC9A may play a role in cell shape and motility. In our previous results, we have found that progesterone-induced TTC9A expression was associated with increased cell motility and cell spreading. We speculate that TTC9A acts as a chaperone protein to facilitate the function of tropomyosins in stabilizing microfilament and it may play a role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Human tetratricopeptide repeat domain 9 (TTC9) was first reported as a hypothetical protein KIAA0227 by Nagase et al, based on the sequence analysis of a cDNA clone isolated from a brain cDNA library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It was later identified as a steroid hormone-regulated gene in various breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It seems that there is a family of TTC9 protein. The MGC program at the National Institutes also identified cDNA sequences named as TTC9B and TTC9C, which share 46% and 35% homology with TTC9A in amino acids sequence, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, TTC9B and TTC9C have not been identified at the protein level. Nonetheless, to keep up with the information in the NCBI database, TTC9 is now referred to as TTC9A in this article.</p><p>TTC9 family belongs to a large family of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)- containing proteins. The TPR domain is a 34 amino acids (aa) consensus motif that is found in tandem repeats of varying number in different proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Circular dichroism (CD) studies indicate that TPR motifs are approximately 50% &#x003b1;-helical structures with little or no &#x003b2;-sheet formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Crystallographic structure analysis of TPR-containing proteins revealed that TPR motif generally forms an antiparallel &#x003b1;-helical hairpin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Clustering of these hairpins in tandem generates a domain with a grooved surface and dimension that can conveniently grasp another polypeptide. Generally, by generating a flexible, mutable domain that can facilitate specific protein-protein interactions, the TPR motif presents an elegant evolutionary solution contributing to the fundamental biological importance of coordinating interactions among gene products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The functions of TPR containing protein include cell cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], transcription and splicing events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], protein transport especially protein import [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], regulatory phosphate turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and protein folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. TTC9A contains three TPR domains at its carboxyl-terminus, at amino acid positions 57&#x02013;90, 128&#x02013;161 and 164&#x02013;197.</p><p>In previous studies, we have identified the open reading frame of TTC9 gene and confirmed the protein size of TTC9A to be 222 aa. Using mouse polyclonal antibody generated against TTC9A protein, TTC9A was shown to be ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. In breast cancer cells, TTC9A was predominantly concentrated to the endoplasmic reticulum and was regulated by a number of factors, such as growth factors, serum factors and steroid hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although existing results suggest that TTC9A could be an important protein ubiquitously expressed in all cell and tissue types, the exact role of TTC9A remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we found that TTC9A mRNA was significantly over-expressed in breast cancer tissues compared with the adjacent normal breast tissues, which suggested TTC9A could be an important gene involved in hormone signaling and breast cancer development. By yeast-two-hybrid assay, we identified one of TTC9A interacting proteins, TM5/TM30nm, which is also referred to as Tm5NM-1 and is a non-muscle tropomyosin encoded by &#x003b3;-tropomyosin gene. The tropomyosins are a group of actin-binding proteins found in skeletal muscle, smooth muscle and non-muscle tissues. They are either hetero- or homo-dimeric proteins with a rod-shaped, &#x003b1;-helical coiled-coil structure. Usually the dimers form a head-to-tail polymer running along the major groove in the actin filament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Mammalian and avian tropomyosins are encoded by four genes, i.e. &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;, &#x003b4; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Historically, the tropomyosin proteins have been divided into two classes, high-molecular-weight (HMW) and low-molecular- weight (LMW), which are ~284 aa and 247 aa in length, respectively. This size difference is generated by the use of alternative promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], alternative splicing of mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and different 3' UTR processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These mechanisms give rise to over 40 tropomyosin isoforms.</p><p>Tropomyosins are believed to be involved in the stabilization of actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Actin filaments which lack tropomyosins tend to be rapidly undergoing assembly and disassembly process, such as those associated with neuronal growth cone filopodia and the leading edge of mammary adenocarcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In skeletal muscle, tropomyosins serve to mediate the effect of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>on the actin-myosin interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Instead of binding Ca<sup>2+ </sup>directly, they perform this function by acting as bifunctional molecules, binding to actin on one hand, and providing specific sites for the binding of the troponin complex of regulatory proteins on the other hand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Though the precise function of non-muscle tropomyosin is less understood, some in vitro studies have shown that non-muscle tropomyosins are able to differentially protect actin from the severing action of gelsolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and can regulate the Mg-ATPase activity of myosins to varying degrees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, it seems that non-muscle tropomyosins play an important role in tumor development. For example, down-regulation of tropomyosin 2 was essential in ras-mediated malignant transformation of fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Tropomyosin 3 isoform 2 (also termed as TM5/TM30nm or Tm5NM-1) was expressed at a higher level in highly metastatic B16 mouse cell line than in mouse cell line exhibiting a lower metastasis rate. Similar result was also obtained in rat cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>This study also identified specific domains in TTC9A that is crucial in the interaction with Tm5NM-1. The significance of the interaction between TTC9A and Tm5NM-1 is yet to be elucidated. On the other hand, our previous studies have shown that in breast cancer cells, the up-regulation of TTC9A expression by progesterone was associated with increased cell focal adhesion and motility. All these findings suggest a possible role of TTC9A in cell-matrix adhesion and in tropomyosin-mediated stabilization of actin microfilament.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell line and reagents</title><p>COS-7 cells were obtained from Dr. Koh Cheng Gee, School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.</p><p>COS-7 cells were routinely maintained in phenol red- and high D-glucose- containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM glutamine and 40 mg/L gentamicin.</p><p>All cell culture reagents were bought from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, California).

As breast cancer is well-known to be a hormone-dependent malignancy, it is noteworthy to know whether TTC9A is over-expressed in breast cancer tissues and if its expression is correlated with hormone receptor status. 25 matched pairs of human breast cancer tissue and the adjacent normal tissue were analyzed for TTC9A mRNA expression. The results presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> were obtained by RT-PCR as illustrated in the "materials and methods" and the PCR products were quantitated by Southern blotting analysis. 36B4, which codes for human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0, was used as a control for cDNA input (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Since the expression of 36B4 varied among samples, GAPDH was also included as a normalization standard for cDNA input. It turned out that the expression levels of these housekeeping genes were always higher in tumor tissues compared with the corresponding normal tissues. This variation has been reported before. For example, GAPDH expression was 3.3-fold higher in seminoma compared with normal testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Similarly, GAPDH transcription was significantly greater in both colonic adenomas and cancers than in normal mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Nonetheless, the results revealed that the relative expression of TTC9A mRNA, when normalized to either 36B4 or GAPDH, was significantly higher in breast cancer tissue compared with its adjacent normal tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.00001). It is also notable that nearly all the tumor tissues expressed higher level of TTC9A mRNA compared with its adjacent controls. However, we found no correlation of TTC9A expression with other clinic pathological data such as tumor size, nuclear grade, axillary's lymph node status or hormone receptor expression.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The expression level of TTC9A mRNA was significantly higher in breast cancer tissues than that in the adjacent normal breast tissues.</bold> Total RNA was extracted from human breast cancer tissues and the matched adjacent normal breast tissues.

In an initial attempt to investigate the relationship between TTC9A function and cancer development, we searched for binding partners of the protein. To accomplish this, we performed a yeast-two-hybrid screening of a cDNA library from breast cancer cell line MCF-7, using full-length TTC9A as the bait. The coding region of the 222 aa TTC9A protein was cloned into the 'bait' vector, pLex A, which contains the DNA-binding domain. MCF-7 cDNA libraries were fused to the activation domain in the 'pray' vector p42AD. The bait vector and the cDNA libraries were transformed into yeast strain EGY48 together with a lacZ reporter gene. 30 positive clones, in which the coding regions of the library plasmids were in frame with the activation domain according to the sequencing results, were obtained after two rounds of specificity test. Among them, 5 clones contained genes coding for human tropomyosin Tm5NM-1, which is encoded by &#x003b3;-tropomyosin gene of the tropomyosin family.</p></sec><sec><title>TTC9A protein can interact with cellular expressed Tm5NM-1</title><p>The binding of TTC9A to Tm5NM-1 was further examined by GST-pull down assay. In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, Tm5NM-1-(His)<sub>6 </sub>expression vector was transfected into COS-7 cells and GST-TTC9A was used as a "bait" to pull down the cellular expressed Tm5NM-1 protein. As shown in the figure, Tm5NM-1 was pulled down by GST-TTC9A, but not by the GST-tag, suggesting that GST-TTC9A did interact with cellular expressed Tm5NM-1. The specificity of the interaction was further confirmed by GST pull-down assay with different amount of bait protein. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> showed that the protein amount of Tm5NM-1 pulled down by GST-TTC9A increased proportionally to the amount of bait protein used in the assay. However, bands other than the expected Tm5NM-1 were also observed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and these non-specific bands were not observed in sample with GST protein.

This means that the amounts of protein expressed by these constructs were not necessarily less than those by other smaller truncations which showed broader bands.

TTC9A (1&#x02013;100), which contains the first TPR domain, interacted with Tm5NM-1 to some extent but the interaction was weaker than TTC9A (1&#x02013;115). Since the first TPR domain lies in residues 57&#x02013;90, it is plausible that the first TPR domain is required for the interaction. To confirm this postulation, more truncations of TTC9A protein were tested. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> revealed that TTC9A (1&#x02013;95), TTC9A (1&#x02013;105) and TTC9A (1&#x02013;110), which include the first TPR domain, showed obvious interaction with Tm5NM-1. In addition, the linker peptide (aa 91&#x02013;127) between the first and the second TPR may facilitate the binding between these two proteins, as TTC9A (1&#x02013;128) pulled down more Tm5NM-1 than TTC9A (1&#x02013;95), TTC9A (1&#x02013;105) and TTC9A (1&#x02013;110) did (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).</p><p>The observation that full-length TTC9A showed weaker interaction to Tm5NM-1 than TTC9A (1&#x02013;115) and TTC9A (1&#x02013;128) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) suggested that the C-terminal part of TTC9A protein could have some inhibitory effect on the interaction between these two proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). This notion is further supported by the observation that TTC9A (1&#x02013;161) and TTC9A (1&#x02013;197) pulled-down less Tm5NM-1 than TTC9A (1&#x02013;128) did (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).</p><p>To further verify the importance of TTC9A (1&#x02013;50), the linker region and the second and the third TPR domains in the interaction with Tm5NM-1, an experiment was performed to take account of the amount of TTC9A and the truncated proteins pulled-down (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). It shows that TTC9A (1&#x02013;50) did not interact with Tm5NM-1 but TTC9A (51&#x02013;115) did, even though similar amount of TTC9A (1&#x02013;50) and TTC9A (51&#x02013;115) were pulled-down. This suggests that the first TPR played some role in the interaction with Tm5NM-1. Secondly, although more TTC9A (51&#x02013;222) (the saturated whitish band pointed by arrow) were pulled-down than TTC9A (51&#x02013;115), it did not interact with Tm5NM-1 but TTC9A (51&#x02013;115) did. We speculate that either aa.1&#x02013;50 is required for the full length TTC9A to interact with Tm5NM-1 or that the second and the third TPR domain adversely affected the interaction. Although there appeared to be more TTC9A (1&#x02013;115) pulled-down than TTC9A, the relative amount of Tm5NM-1 pulled-down by TTC9A (1&#x02013;115) appears to be more than that by TTC9A, and this lends support to the speculation that the second and the third TPR domains are inhibitory to the interaction with Tm5NM-1. This takes account of the fact that the signal for the TTC9A band is saturated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, lane two in the lower panel), so the amount of TTC9A pulled-down is more than it appears to be.</p><p>It is very important to verify the interaction between endogenous TTC9A and Tm5NM-1. We have tried several times for the endogenous pull-down using either TTC9A or Tm5NM-1 polyclonal antibodies. Unfortunately, we obtained very weak pull-down of high background. We suspect that the binding of polyclonal antibodies to multiple epitopes of the endogenous TTC9A or Tm5NM-1 interfered with their interaction with the target protein. Regrettably, monoclonal antibodies to TTC9A or to Tm5NM-1 are not available at this point in time.</p><p>Non-muscle tropomyosins generally help to stabilize actin filament. Over- expression of tropomyosin-1 in breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 was found to promote the assembly of stress fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The interaction of TTC9A with Tm5NM-1, together with the observation that in breast cancer cell line ABC28, TTC9A was up-regulated by progesterone, accompanied with a drastic increase in focal adhesion and in F-actin formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], led us to hypothesize that TTC9A may be involved in cell cytoskeleton organization and cell adhesion. However, knock-down of TTC9A expression by 70 &#x02013; 80% did not abolish progesterone-induced increase of F-actin (data not shown). This suggested that either TTC9A was not essential in the formation of focal adhesion and stress fibers, or that other TTC9 family proteins were able to compensate for the lost function of TTC9A.</p><p>Tm5NM-1 and other tropomyosin family members are well-known for their association with the cytoskeleton system. An elevated level of Tm5NM-1 has been found in high-metastatic mouse melanoma cells and transformed rat fibroblastic cells, which suggested a function of Tm5NM-1 in inhibiting the polymerization and/or the formation of the bundles of actin microfilaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Studies have also revealed that the multiple isoforms of non-muscle tropomyosin might play a role in modulating the organization of microfilaments in cells by regulating the interaction between actin and other actin-binding proteins, such as filamin, spectrin, caldesmon, gelsolin and DNase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that TTC9A participates in the complex cytoskeleton regulation through its interaction with Tm5NM-1, or with other tropomyosins.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this study revealed that TTC9A was over-expressed in breast cancer tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues, suggesting that TTC9A might be an important gene involved in the breast cancer development process. We have identified Tm5NM-1, a tropomyosin family protein, as one of the TTC9A-interacting proteins. The results also suggest that the first 50 aa of TTC9A was required for the interaction with Tm5NM-1, although the segment alone did not bind to Tm5NM-1. Furthermore, the first TPR domain and the linker segment between the first two TPR domains may play an important role for the binding of TTC9A to Tm5NM-1, while the last two TPR motifs may be inhibitory on the interaction. The exact function of TTC9A remains unknown at current stage. The interaction with Tm5NM-1 suggests that TTC9A might act as a chaperone protein in the organization of cell cytoskeleton. Currently, TTC9A gene knockout study in mice is underway to define the physiological role of the gene <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SLC performed most of the experiments, analyzed and interpreted data and participated in the manuscript writing.
