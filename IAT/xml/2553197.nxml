The cytoskeletal ankyrin repeat protein VAB-19 is required for cell shape changes and localizes to cell-matrix attachment structures. The molecular functions of VAB-19 in this process are obscure, as no previous interactors for VAB-19 have been described.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In screens for VAB-19 binding proteins we identified the signaling adaptor EPS-8. Within <italic>C. elegans</italic> epidermal cells, EPS-8 and VAB-19 colocalize at cell-matrix attachment structures. The central domain of EPS-8 is necessary and sufficient for its interaction with VAB-19. <italic>eps-8</italic> null mutants, like <italic>vab-19</italic> mutants, are defective in epidermal elongation and in epidermal-muscle attachment. The <italic>eps-8</italic> locus encodes two isoforms, EPS-8A and EPS-8B, that appear to act redundantly in epidermal elongation. The function of EPS-8 in epidermal development involves its N-terminal PTB and central domains, and is independent of its C-terminal SH3 and actin-binding domains. VAB-19 appears to act earlier in the biogenesis of attachment structures and may recruit EPS-8 to these structures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>EPS-8 and VAB-19 define a novel pathway acting at cell-matrix attachments to regulate epithelial cell shape. This is the first report of a role for EPS-8 proteins in cell-matrix attachments. The existence of EPS-8B-like isoforms in Drosophila suggests this function of EPS-8 proteins could be conserved among other organisms.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many organisms and organs develop from spherical or ovoid primordia that undergo elongation along an axis. The cellular bases for these elongation movements have been explored in a number of organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003346-Keller1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In organs such as the vertebrate notochord, internally generated hydraulic pressure is resisted by an extracellular sheath whose geometry distributes the forces to the ends of the cylinder, resulting in elongation of the organ. The elongation of the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryo is another example of a pressure-driven elongation process, but differs from the notochord in that the forces are generated by precisely arranged circumferential bundles of actin filaments in the apical layer of the enveloping epidermis. Contraction of these circumferentially oriented actin bundles (CFBs) in the epidermis causes coordinated contraction of the epidermal cells, and concomitant elongation of the epidermal cells (and all internal tissues) along the perpendicular anterior-posterior axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003346-Chisholm1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Analysis of elongation defective mutants has identified epidermal proteins that regulate actin-based contractions, supporting the model that actomyosin based contraction of lateral epidermal cells provides the driving force for epidermal cell shape change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003346-Priess1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003346-Diogon1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Epidermal elongation also requires epidermal cell-matrix attachment structures known as fibrous organelles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003346-Francis1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> or trans-epidermal attachments (TEAs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003346-Ding1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Trans-epidermal attachments are composed of apical and basal hemidesmosome-like membrane plaques connected by intermediate filaments (IFs). TEAs are found in dorsal and ventral epidermal cells, where they connect underlying body wall muscles (or their associated basement membrane) to the apical cuticle. Within epidermal cells, TEAs are further segregated into stripes between the circumferential actin bundles.</p><p>Several components of attachment structures are essential for epidermal elongation. VAB-10A, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of the cytoskeletal linker protein Plectin, is localized to the membrane-proximal plaques of TEAs, and is essential for elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003346-Bosher1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins IFB-1 and IFA-3 are also found in embryonic attachment structures and are required for elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003346-Woo1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The ankyrin repeat protein VAB-19 is also essential for epidermal elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003346-Ding2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. VAB-19 localizes to trans-epidermal attachments but is not required for their initial assembly. VAB-19 instead appears to be required for later localization of attachment structures to muscle-adjacent regions of epidermis.</p><p>VAB-19 is a member of a conserved family of ankyrin repeat containing proteins thought to function in the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003346-Zhu1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. A human ortholog of VAB-19, Kank, was identified as a candidate tumor suppressor for renal cell carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003346-Sarkar1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In mammalian cells the Kank protein can inhibit actin stress fiber formation via the RhoA GTPase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003346-Kakinuma1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Kank is thought to regulate RhoA as part of a complex with 14-3-3 proteins, which interact with coiled coil motifs in the Kank N-terminus. However, many questions remain concerning how VAB-19/Kank related proteins are regulated and how they function in vivo. To understand how VAB-19 functions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> epithelial cell shape change we focused on its most highly conserved region, the ANK repeat domain, which is necessary for VAB-19 function but not for its subcellular localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003346-Ding2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. As ANK repeats function as protein-protein interaction interfaces, VAB-19 may bind one or more conserved proteins via this domain.</p><p>Here we report that the cell signaling adaptor protein EPS-8 interacts with the VAB-19 ANK domain, and that EPS-8 colocalizes with VAB-19 at epidermal attachment structures. Eps8 has been implicated in many aspects of growth factor signaling and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003346-Offenhauser1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Vertebrate genomes encode multiple Eps8-related genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003346-Tocchetti1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome contains a single locus, <italic>eps-8</italic>.

These allelic differences imply that the morphogenetic function of EPS-8 requires its PTB domain, and possibly the N-terminal part of the central domain, but not the SH3 domain or C-terminal actin binding domains. Further, the two EPS-8 isoforms may function redundantly in epidermal morphogenesis, as removal of either isoform alone does not affect morphogenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, either EPS-8A::GFP or EPS-8B::GFP fusion proteins fully rescued <italic>eps-8(jc36)</italic> embryonic phenotypes when expressed under the control of the <italic>vab-19</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003346-g002">Figure 2G, H</xref>). These rescue experiments also indicate that EPS-8 functions cell autonomously in the epidermis to promote morphogenesis.</p><p>To test whether VAB-19 and EPS-8 display genetic interactions consistent with function in a common pathway we constructed double mutants using the partial loss of function allele <italic>vab-19(e1036cs)</italic> and the phenotypically silent allele <italic>eps-8(ok539)</italic>. <italic>vab-19(e1036)</italic> is a cold-sensitive allele that appears to eliminate function at 15&#x000b0;C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003346-Ding2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Such <italic>vab-19 eps-8</italic> double mutants resembled the <italic>vab-19</italic> null phenotype, in that they arrested at the two-fold stage of embryogenesis with detached muscles and deformed head and tail epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003346-g002">Figure 2J</xref>). However, at higher temperatures the penetrance of lethal phenotypes in <italic>vab-19 eps-8</italic> double mutants was not significantly different from <italic>vab-19(e1036)</italic> single mutants (not shown). These observations suggest that although elimination of the EPS-8B isoform does not itself have a dramatic effect on morphogenesis, it can affect development when VAB-19 is present in limiting amounts. This dose-dependent phenotypic enhancement is consistent with VAB-19 and EPS-8 acting in a common pathway or in closely related parallel pathways in controlling epidermal morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>EPS-8 is required for late aspects of attachment structure development and for normal actin organization</title><p>As EPS-8 appears to be a new component of epidermal attachment structures, we examined the effect of <italic>eps-8</italic> mutations on other attachment structure components.

Instead, the N-terminal PTB and the central domain of EPS-8 are important for its role in cell-matrix attachments. Our data are consistent with a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003346-g004">Figure 4M</xref>) in which VAB-19 is initially localized to cell-matrix attachments via motifs in its N-terminus.

Our attempts to test this possibility using the two-hybrid procedure have so far been inconclusive due to the strongly self-activating properties of the relevant VAB-19 and VAB-10 domains in LexA fusions (not shown). The VAB-19 ANK repeats then provide an interaction surface that recruits EPS-8 isoforms via the EPS-8 central domain. Localized EPS-8 might then interact with, recruit, or exclude additional proteins via its PTB domain, or VAB-19 and EPS-8 might together form a complex that recruits additional proteins.
