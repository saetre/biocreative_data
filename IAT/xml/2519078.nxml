Here we report the cloning and comparative expression analysis of <italic>R-SPONDIN1 </italic>orthologues in the mouse, chicken and red-eared slider turtle, three species with different sex-determining mechanisms.

In the mouse gonad, <italic>Rspo1 </italic>mRNA is expressed in the somatic cell lineage at the time of ovarian differentiation (E12.5&#x02013;E15.5), with little expression in germ cells. However, the protein is localised in the cytoplasm and at the cell surface of both somatic (pre-follicular) and germ cells. In the chicken embryo, <italic>RSPO1 </italic>expression becomes elevated in females at the time of ovarian differentiation, coinciding with female-specific activation of the <italic>FOXL2 </italic>gene and estrogen synthesis. RSPO1 protein in chicken is localised in the outer cortical zone of the developing ovary, the site of primordial follicle formation and germ cell differentiation. Inhibition of estrogen synthesis with a specific aromatase inhibitor results in a decline in chicken <italic>RSPO1 </italic>expression, indicating that RSPO1 is influenced by estrogen. In the red-eared slider turtle, which exhibits temperature-dependent sex determination, up-regulation of <italic>RSPO1 </italic>occurs during the temperature-sensitive period, when gonadal development is responsive to temperature. Accordingly, <italic>RSPO1 </italic>expression is temperature-responsive, and is down-regulated in embryos shifted from female- to male-producing incubation temperatures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results indicate that <italic>RSPO1 </italic>is up-regulated in the embryonic gonads of female vertebrates with different sex-determining mechanisms.

In most mammals, the Y-linked <italic>SRY </italic>gene initiates testicular development by directing Sertoli cell differentiation and the organization of seminiferous cords [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Leydig and other cell types then differentiate around the cords, testosterone is released and male development is elaborated. A number of transcription factors and signalling molecules are now known to play a role in testicular differentiation upstream and downstream of SRY. These include <italic>GATA4, FOG2</italic>, <italic>WT1, SOX9, SF1, DAX1 </italic>and <italic>FGF9 </italic>(reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). In contrast, the molecular control of ovarian development is less well understood. In XX mouse embryos, the earliest signs of ovarian differentiation include entry of primordial germ cells into the first stages of meiosis, followed by a fragmentation of primitive sex cords around the germ cells and their organization into primordial follicles. Expression based screens have shown that the differentiating ovary has a robust program of gene expression, equalling that of the testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. One requirement for proper ovarian development is Wnt signalling. The <italic>Wnt4 </italic>gene is up-regulated in embryonic mouse XX gonads, while loss-of-function mutants have masculinized XX gonads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Conversely, testicular vascular development and androgen production are retarded in XY embryos over-expressing <italic>Wnt4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, <italic>Wnt4 </italic>has been shown to play a role in both testis and ovary formation, since loss of Wnt4 signalling interferes with proper Sertoli cell development in males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Most recently, it has been shown that compound mutants lacking both <italic>Wnt4 </italic>and the transcription factor <italic>Foxl2 </italic>develop as XX males, with patent testes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These observations point to an important additive role for these two genes in ovarian differentiation.</p><p>A new gene implicated in female development is <italic>R-SPONDIN1 </italic>(<italic>RSPO1</italic>). This gene was identified in humans through linkage analysis of a family and an isolated individual with hyperkeratinised skin, a predisposition to squamous cell carcinoma and 46, XX female-to-male sex reversal. Two separate loss of function mutations were found in the <italic>RSPO1 </italic>gene of affected patients: a single nucleotide insertion resulting in a premature stop codon and a 2.5 kb deletion spanning exon 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These mutations resulted in testis formation and male development in XX individuals, in the absence of <italic>SRY</italic>. It follows that <italic>RSPO1 </italic>plays a role in ovarian development and that repression of <italic>RSPO1 </italic>is compatible with testicular development. Mouse <italic>Rspo1 </italic>is expressed in those tissues affected by <italic>RSPO1 </italic>mutations in humans, such as the skin and embryonic gonads. Very recently, the mouse <italic>Rspo1 </italic>null mutant has been described. <italic>Rspo1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>XX mice are masculinized, with depleted germ cells, male-like vascularisation, deregulation of <italic>Wnt4 </italic>expression and ectopic testosterone production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Altogether, these data indicate that <italic>RSPO1 </italic>is an important gene involved in mammalian ovarian development.</p><p>RSPO1 is a member of a small family of secreted growth factors. The four <italic>R-spondin </italic>genes in mouse show similar expression patterns to Wnt signalling molecules, and Rspo proteins can operate through the canonical Wnt signalling pathway, stabilising intracellular &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. &#x003b2;-catenin can then enter the nucleus, where it interacts with members of the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors to regulate gene expression. The Rspo proteins can therefore potentially regulate functions mediated by &#x003b2;-catenin, such as cell fate decisions and embryonic patterning. Recent data indicate that RSPO1 stimulates the &#x003b2;-catenin signalling pathway by binding the WNT co-receptor, LRP6, modulating its availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It is possible that Rspo proteins may also operate independently of Wnt signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, given the relationship between Rspo proteins and the Wnt pathway, and the importance of Wnt4 for gonadal development, these two factors might interact to play a role in ovary development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>It has been suggested that <italic>RSPO1 </italic>could represent the key ovary-determining gene in humans, and possibly all mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, XX <italic>Rspo1 </italic>null mutant mice are only partially sex-reversed, implying that <italic>Rspo1 </italic>alone is not the key "ovary-determining gene" (at least in mammals). Here, we describe the spatial and temporal expression profiles of <italic>Rspo1 </italic>in the embryonic gonads of the mouse, chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) and the red-eared slider turtle (<italic>Trachemys scripta</italic>). These three species have different sex-determining mechanisms; XY male heterogamety in mouse, ZW female heterogamety in chicken and temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in the turtle. Despite these different sex-determining triggers, <italic>RSPO1 </italic>shows a conserved ovary-specific expression profile in all three species. These observations suggest that <italic>RSPO1 </italic>has an important role in ovarian development in amniotic vertebrates.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>RSPO1 </italic>orthologues</title><p>PCR of gonadal cDNA was used to amplify chicken and turtle (<italic>T. scripta</italic>) orthologues of mammalian <italic>RSPO1</italic>.

In E14.5 mouse gonads, Rspo1 protein was detected in the ovary, but not in the testis (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In the female, Rspo1 protein was detectable throughout the gonad. The protein was localised in the cytoplasm and cell membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). In females, Rspo1 protein generally co-localised with Wt1, a somatic cell marker, although some Rspo1<sup>+ </sup>cells were not Wt1<sup>+ </sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). In E14.5 male gonads, only background staining was detected with the goat anti-mouse antibody used here (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Double staining with the (meiotic) germ cell marker, Scp3, indicated Rspo1 localisation in germ as well as somatic cells of the developing ovary (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>), but not in males (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). In the chicken embryo, gonads were immunostained at E8.5 (during the period of gonadal sex differentiation) and at E12.5 (when gonadal differentiation is advanced and just prior to the onset of meiosis in females). RSPO1 protein was detected in the outer cortical zone of the developing left ovary. This is the site of germ cell meiosis, and the differentiation of somatic supporting cells into primordial follicles. The underlying medulla, which expresses aromatase protein and synthesises estrogens, was negative for RSPO1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).

In all three species, <italic>RSPO1 </italic>mRNA expression becomes elevated in female gonads at the time of somatic cell organization around the germ cells and the onset of germ cell meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In the mouse and chicken, RSPO1 expression at this time is predominantly or exclusively localised in the somatic cells. Altogether, these observations implicate RSPO1 in a conserved pathway leading to folliculogenesis and germ cell development. The mouse expression data are in agreement with previous studies showing ovary-specific <italic>Rspo1 </italic>mRNA expression in mammalian embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and with the impaired follicle development reported in <italic>Rspo1 </italic>null mutant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Immunofluorescence of Rspo1 protein confirmed a somatic localisation in developing mouse and chicken ovaries, in the cell membrane and around somatic and germ cells. This is consistent with a role of Rspo1 as a secreted signalling molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], suggesting that RSPO1 secreted from somatic (pre-follicular) cells has a role in both somatic and germ cell development. This is in agreement with a recent study of embryonic goat gonads, showing somatic and germ cell surface localisation of RSPO1 in the cortical region of the developing ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Mammalian RSPO1 has a predicted signal sequence at its N-terminus, and the protein has been reported to be present in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of transfected 293T cells (human embryonic kidney cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, all mammalian RSPOs have a thrombospondin motif and they have been shown to bind heparin sulfate proteogylcans on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, a potential nuclear localisation signal has also been identified at the carboxy terminus of mouse Rspo1 and transfected COS7 cells show localisation in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Similarly, goat RSPO1 protein translated from a second putative ATG also localises to the nucleus of transfected COS7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The potential role of nuclear localised RSPO1 is unknown, although in transfected cells it appears to associate with nucleoli. However, Western blots show that a number of different RSPO1 isoforms may be produced in transfected cells, some processed for the nucleus and others for the cytoplasm/secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In our study, no nuclear localisation of endogenous Rspo1 protein was detected. The commercial antibody used here was raised against the amino terminus of recombinant mouse Rspo1 (amino acids 21&#x02013;209). It is possible that the antibody fails to detect any nuclear localised RSPO1, if a 5' splice variant lacks amino acids 21&#x02013;209. Further studies are required to clarify if an endogenous isoform lacking the N terminal signal sequence can localise to the nucleus.</p><p>Given that it engages the effector pathway of Wnt signalling, &#x003b2;-catenin, in other systems, it is expected that Rspo1 plays a role in ovarian development by influencing &#x003b2;-catenin. &#x003b2;-catenin has two potential roles in the cell; transactivation of target genes and the formation of adherent-type junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], either or both of which may be important for ovarian differentiation. Rspo1 may act together with Wnt4 in the developing ovary. The spatial and temporal expression profile of <italic>Rspo1 </italic>is similar to that of <italic>Wnt4 </italic>in mouse and chicken; <italic>Wnt4 </italic>is up-regulated in the gonadal somatic cell lineage of presumptive females in both species (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. <italic>Wnt4 </italic>expression is de-regulated in the <italic>Rpso1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the red-eared slider turtle, <italic>WNT4 </italic>mRNA is expressed at similar levels during the TSP in the gonads of embryos developing at both MPT and FPT, and only becomes dimorphic during later ovarian differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In the mouse embryo, transgenic and knock-out studies have shown that Wnt4 plays a role in ovarian development, by repressing male-typical steroidogenesis and vascular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, Wnt4 functions to antagonise the testis-promoting effects of Fgf9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Some <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>studies have suggested that, in embryonic ovaries, Wnt4 may function in a non-canonical fashion to block stabilisation of &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and instead sequester it to the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, most recently, it has been shown using <italic>in vivo </italic>transgenic mouse models that Rspo1 and Wnt4 both activate canonical &#x003b2;-catenin signaling in the embryonic ovary, with Rspo1 acting upstream of Wnt4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] (<italic>Rspo1 </italic>expression is not affected in XX <italic>Wnt4 </italic>null mutants). While the <italic>Rspo1 </italic>and <italic>Wnt4 </italic>XX null mutants are both masculinized, neither is fully sex-reversed. It is therefore likely that these two factors operate synergistically to activate the canonical &#x003b2;-catenin signaling involved in mouse ovarian development. In this context, it will be of interest to examine the phenotype of <italic>Rspo1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>/Wnt4<sup>-/- </sup>compound mutants, in which complete XX female-to-male sex reversal might occur.</p><p>The immunofluorescent studies reported here for mouse and chicken indicate that Rspo1 protein also localises at or in female germ cells (oogonia). However, the qRT-PCR data indicate that transcript expression is low in fetal germ cells, at least in mouse (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The immunofluorescent results may therefore reflect the localisation of secreted Rspo1. Rspo1 is synthesised primarily in somatic cells, but is secreted and becomes localised at the cell membrane and within both somatic and germ cells. Localisation of RSPO1 protein at the cell membrane of both somatic and germ cells was also recently reported in embryonic goat ovaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This implies that it has a function in both cell types during ovarian development, that is, during the organization of primordial follicles. These observations are consistent with the recent description of the XX Rspo1<sup>-/- </sup>mice, which are subfertile, with a decline in the number of oocytes and impaired follicle formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This indicates that Rspo1 signaling plays a role in germ cell development and differentiation.</p><p>In the chicken embryo, morphological differentiation of the gonads begins at embryonic day 6 &#x02013; 6.5 (stages 29&#x02013;30; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]), when <italic>SOX9 </italic>expression begins in ZZ (male) gonads and <italic>Aromatase </italic>expression begins in ZW (female) gonads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. At this time, chicken <italic>RSPO1 </italic>expression was sexually dimorphic, showing higher expression in putative ovaries (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In fact, female-enriched <italic>RSPO1 </italic>expression was detectable as early as E4.5, which precedes Aromatase activation (E6.0). However, the expression seen at E4.5 represents both gonad and mesonephric tissue, as the two tissues could not be easily separated. Therefore, expression in the mesonephros cannot be ruled out. By E6.5, however, gonad-specific <italic>RSPO1 </italic>expression was higher in female gonads compared to males. The <italic>RSPO1 </italic>gene is autosomal in chicken and is therefore not the master sex determinant in birds, which must lie on a sex chromosome/s (Z or W). However, its early sexually dimorphic expression profile in the gonad indicates that <italic>RSPO1 </italic>is upstream in the avian sex-determining pathway, as inferred from the mouse and human studies. The exact onset of gonadal <italic>RSPO1 </italic>expression in the chicken embryo is unclear. Since <italic>WNT4 </italic>is female up-regulated in the embryonic chicken, as in mouse, it is likely that RSPO1 regulates and interacts with WNT4 in birds as in mammals. This molecular aspect of ovarian differentiation may therefore be conserved between birds and mammals.</p><p>Chicken RSPO1 protein was localised within the outer cortical zone of the developing left ovary (absent in the right gonad, which regresses during development). The real time PCR analysis showed low levels of <italic>RSPO1 </italic>mRNA at E8.5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), although strong protein expression was nevertheless detected in the cortex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This may reflect the small proportion of the gonad that comprises cortex at E8.5, resulting in low <italic>RSPO1 </italic>mRNA levels when expressed relative to whole gonadal mRNA (i.e., the <italic>HPRT </italic>normaliser used here). Thus, proliferation of the left cortex over development correlated with increased <italic>RSPO1 </italic>mRNA levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Widespread protein localisation in the cortex of the female chicken embryo suggests both somatic and germ cell expression. Cortical RSPO1 expression may be stimulated by estrogen, as indicated by the aromatase inhibitor studies. Aromatase enzyme is expressed early in avian gonadal sex differentiation, producing estrogen female-specifically from E6.0. In chicken embryos treated with the aromatase enzyme inhibitor, fadrozole, the left ovarian cortex did not proliferate and <italic>RSPO1 </italic>mRNA expression declined (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Furthermore, RSPO1 expression could not be detected by immunofluorescence in female gonads after aromatase inhibition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Previous studies have also shown that the left ovarian cortex does not proliferate in chicken embryos treated with aromatase inhibitor, indicating that its development is estrogen dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The decline of <italic>RSPO1 </italic>expression after aromatase inhibition may therefore reflect a lack of cortical (pre-follicular) cell proliferation. In the chicken embryo, the transcription factor, <italic>FOXL2</italic>, is expressed female-specifically just prior to aromatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and several lines of evidence suggest that FOXL2 activates the <italic>Aromatase </italic>gene during avian (and mammalian) ovarian development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Chicken <italic>FOXL2 </italic>and <italic>Aromatase </italic>are both expressed in the gonadal medulla from E5 &#x02013; 6, while RSPO1 is expressed in the cortex. Activation of <italic>RSPO1 </italic>expression may therefore be independent of the FOXL2-aromatase pathway (as indicated in goat embryos lacking <italic>FOXL2</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]) or <italic>RSPO1 </italic>may lie downstream of aromatase in the avian ovarian pathway. However, the aromatase inhibition experiment indicates that estrogen synthesis is required to maintain <italic>RSPO1 </italic>expression, possibly by maintaining the cortical pre-follicular cell population (Note that expression of <italic>FOXL2 </italic>is also retarded in female embryos when aromatase is inhibited, even though FOXL2 expression begins prior to aromatase, implying an estrogen feedback maintenance mechanism; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]).</p><p><italic>RSPO1 </italic>expression was also sexually dimorphic in the gonads of the turtle, <italic>T. scripta</italic>, a reptile with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Expression was significantly higher in turtle embryos incubated at the female-producing temperature (31&#x000b0;C), and expression declined in embryos shifted from the female- to male-producing temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Sexually dimorphic expression of <italic>RSPO1 </italic>expression occurred during the temperature-sensitive period (TSP), when bipotential gonads are sensitive to the action of temperature. The temperature-sensitive molecule in reptiles with TSD remains unknown, but genes up-regulated during the critical TSP are likely to be key candidates for early mediators of gonadal development. In <italic>T. scripta</italic>, the TSP spans stages 14 &#x02013; 19/20, and sexual differentiation of the gonads begins near the end of this period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. <italic>RSPO1 </italic>mRNA was more highly expressed in gonads incubated at FPT from stage 17, during the middle of the TSP and before the onset of gonadal sex differentiation. <italic>RSPO1 </italic>may therefore lie upstream in the genetic cascade leading to female development in species with TSD, as inferred for birds and mammals. The temperature shift experiments indicate that <italic>RSPO1 </italic>expression responds to temperature. However, lack of up-regulation in male embryos shifted to the female temperature may indicate that <italic>RSPO1 </italic>up-regulation has not yet occurred within one stage post-shift. Future studies extending analysis to later stages would clarify this point. Factors such as the candidate male determinant <italic>DMRT1 </italic>are male-specific from an early stage during the TSP in <italic>T. scripta </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], and these factors may pre-empt RSPO1.</p><p>As in chicken, <italic>FOXL2 </italic>and <italic>aromatase </italic>are up-regulated at the female temperature in <italic>T. scripta </italic>(from stage 18 and stage 19, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Therefore, similar to the case in chicken, FOXL2/aromatase may play a role in formation of the ovarian medulla, while RSPO1 may be more important for differentiation that occurs in the outer cortex, namely, primordial follicle development. In egg-laying vertebrates such as birds and reptiles, estrogen synthesised by aromatase is important for stimulating development of the outer cortex of the gonad. It is therefore possible that <italic>RSPO1 </italic>expression is maintained by estrogen during ovarian development in oviparous species, as suggested by the aromatase inhibitor experiments in the chicken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. This may be a direct effect of estrogen on <italic>RSPO1 </italic>expression, or, as discussed above, an indirect effect via maintenance of the pre-follicular cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>RSPO1 has a conserved, female-specific expression profile that implies an important role in vertebrate ovarian development. The gene is up-regulated at the earliest stages of ovarian sex differentiation in animals with different sex-determining mechanisms (XY male heterogamety in mammals, ZW female heterogamety in birds, and TSD in a reptile). <italic>RSPO1 </italic>mRNA expression is enriched in ovarian somatic cells, while the protein localises to the cell surface and cytoplasm of both somatic and germ cells. Taken together, the data indicate that RSPO1 has a role in primordial follicle development. Further studies are required to determine how <italic>RSPO1 </italic>expression is regulated in the different groups, and to elucidate its mechanisms of action, likely to be mediated by interaction with Wnt signaling and stabilisation of &#x003b2;-catenin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Embryos</title><p>Mouse strains were either outbred CD1 or, for isolating germ versus somatic cells, OG2 male &#x000d7; CD1 female matings.

This allowed the isolation, by FACS, of GFP+ germ cells versus GFP- somatic cells. Mouse embryos were collected from embryonic day (E) 12.5 &#x02013; 16.5. Embryonic day 0.5 was recorded as the morning of vaginal plug detection following overnight matings. From E12.5, the sex of embryonic mouse gonads can be determined by the presence/absence of organising seminiferous cords. Chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus domesticus</italic>) embryos were obtained form a local supplier and incubated under humid conditions at 37.8&#x000b0;C. Embryos were harvested at various days throughout development and staged according to the morphological criteria of Hamburger and Hamilton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Paired gonads were dissected away from the adjoining mesonephric kidneys and tissues prepared for RNA extraction or immunofluorescence (see below). (Except for E4.5, stage 25, where gonads + mesonephros were taken). Tissues were harvested at embryonic day (E) 4.5 (stage 25), E6.5 (stage 31), E8.5 (stage 33), 10.5 (stage 36) and 12.5 (stage 38). In the chicken, gonads are undifferentiated at E4.5, and morphological differentiation begins at E6.0 (stages 29) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. For sexing, a small piece of limb tissue was digested in PCR compatible buffer containing proteinase K (200 &#x003bc;g/ml at 50&#x000b0;C for at least 30 minutes), followed by rapid PCR amplification of the sex-linked, female-specific <italic>Xho</italic>1 sequence. Amplification of 18S ribosomal RNA genomic sequence was used as the internal control in a duplex reaction, according to the method of Clinton <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. For aromatase enzyme inhibition, eggs were treated with a single injection of fadrozole, a specific non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland). The fadrozole was dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 10 mg/mL and 0.1 mL (1 mg) was injected into the pointed end of each egg. Controls were injected with 0.1 mL of PBS alone. Holes were sealed with tape and incubation allowed to proceed until E8.5 or E12.5.</p><p>Freshly laid red-eared slider (<italic>Trachemys scripta</italic>) eggs purchased from Clark Turtle Farms (Hammond, LA) were maintained as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], in accordance with humane animal practices under IACUC protocol #03102301. Briefly, viable eggs were randomised in trays of moistened vermiculite and placed in incubators (Precision, Chicago, IL) at 26.0&#x000b0;C (a 100% male-producing temperature, MPT) or 31.0&#x000b0;C (a 100% female-producing temperature, FPT). Incubator temperatures were monitored daily with HOBO data loggers (Onset Computer Corp., Bourne, MA) and verified with calibrated thermometers. For temperature shift experiments, multiple trays of 30 eggs/tray were shifted at developmental stage 16 from incubators held at 26.0&#x000b0;C to 31.0&#x000b0;C and vice versa. Progression of development was monitored by staging external morphological characteristics of a sampling of individuals according to Greenbaum's staging series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The temperature-sensitive period (TSP) in the slider turtle spans Greenbaum's stage 14 through stage 19 at a FPT and through stage 20 at a MPT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Shifting eggs during the temperature-sensitive period (TSP) from one end of the temperature spectrum to the other (i.e., from 26&#x000b0;C to 31&#x000b0;C or vice versa) redirects gonadal development, resulting in 100% sex-reversal.

Tissues were then cryo-protected by immersion in 30% sucrose/PBS (overnight at 4&#x000b0;C), infiltrated with OCT embedding compound and frozen on dry ice or isopentane pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Ten micron frozen sections were cut and thaw mounted onto Superfrost Plus slides. Sections were treated with 1% Triton X-100/PBS (10 minutes), washed in PBS, and then blocked for 1 hr at room temperature in 2% BSA in PBS. Primary antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA/PBS and added to sections overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Goat anti-mouse RSPO1 antibody was obtained from R&#x00026;D Systems and used at a dilution of 1:50. Rabbit anti-WT1 was obtained from Santa Cruz Inc. (1:200), while rabbit anti-SCP3 was obtained from Novus Biologicals (1:100). The rabbit anti-aromatase antibody was raised in house and used at 1:5000. After overnight incubation, sections were washed in PBS and secondary antibodies were added in 1%BSA/PBS for 1 hr at room temperature (AlexFluor 488 donkey anti-goat IgG, 1:1000, and AlexaFluor 594 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, at 1:1500). Sections were then washed three times in PBS and mounted in Fluorosave (Calbiochem.). Images were collected on a compound microscope equipped with fluorescent filters.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BSA: Bovine Serum Albumen; Ct: Cycle threshold; DMRT1: Double-sex and Mab-3 Related Transcription factor; E: Embryonic days of development; FGF: Fibroblast Growth Factor; FOXL2: Forkhead box transcription factor 2; FPT: Female-Producing Temperature; HPRT: Hypoxanthine guanine PhosphoRibosylTransferase; MPT: Male-Producing Temperature; RSPO1: R-SPONDIN1; SCP3: Synaptonemal Complex 3; SOX9: SRY-like HMG box 9; SRY: Sex-determining Region of the Y; TSD: Temperature-dependant Sex Determination; TSP: Thermonsensitive Period for sex determination; Wnt4: Wingless related MMTV integration site.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors participated in the design and execution of the study.
