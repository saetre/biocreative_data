Excessive inflammatory responses by airway epithelia have been linked to the overproduction of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and IL-8. The mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood, but normal IL-1&#x003b2; mediated activation of the production of these cytokines occurs via H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dependent signaling. Therefore, we speculated that CFTR dysfunction causes alterations in the regulation of steady state H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We found significantly elevated levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in three cultured epithelial cell models of CF, one primary and two immortalized. Increases in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> heavily contributed to the excessive IL-6 and IL-8 production in CF epithelia. Proteomic analysis of three in vitro and two in vivo models revealed a decrease in antioxidant proteins that regulate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> processing, by &#x02265;2 fold in CF vs. matched normal controls. When cells are stimulated, differential expression in CF versus normal is enhanced; corresponding to an increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> mediated production of IL-6 and IL-8. The cause of this redox imbalance is a decrease by &#x0223c;70&#x00025; in CF cells versus normal in the expression and activity of the transcription factor Nrf-2. Inhibition of CFTR function in normal cells produced this phenotype, while N-acetyl cysteine, selenium, an activator of Nrf-2, and the overexpression of Nrf-2 all normalized H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> processing and decreased IL-6 and IL-8 to normal levels, in CF cells. We conclude that a paradoxical decrease in Nrf-2 driven antioxidant responses in CF epithelia results in an increase in steady state H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which in turn contributes to the overproduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. Treatment with antioxidants can ameliorate exaggerated cytokine production without affecting normal responses.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by a genetic defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a protein that functions primarily as a chloride channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Gadsby1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The most common mutation in humans (&#x00394;F508) results in the misprocessing, subsequent degradation, and loss of function of CFTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Gadsby1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This results in the dysregulation of ion and fluid transport across the epithelium and a number of secondary defects that exacerbate inflammation, which in the airways culminate in respiratory failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Chmiel1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A hall mark of CF lung disease is exaggerated production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Ionescu1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and IL-8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Muhlebach1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, which result in excessive inflammation. Shortly after birth, early onset of lung infection and the accompanying inflammatory response become self sustaining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Oermann1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, and ultimately destroy the airways, impair gas exchange, and lead to respiratory failure and death. Epithelial cells, a primary site of dysfunction in CF, are major contributors to the inflammatory cascades involved in disease. Anti-inflammatory therapy is effective in limiting lung deterioration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Oermann1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, but adverse effects have discouraged the use of both steroidal and non-steroidal drugs. Nevertheless, controlling inflammation appears to slow disease progression.</p><p>The series of events that link CFTR dysfunction to inflammation are not well understood, but may well be a key to controlling lung disease in CF, and may be a good site for therapeutic intervention. A potential mechanism for the perpetual production of inflammatory cytokines observed in CF is oxidative stress, which results from an imbalance of oxidants and anti-oxidants in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Blackwell1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Nemoto1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. As the chief oxidant in cells is H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, recent reports that IL-1&#x003b2; signaling in epithelial cells is mediated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Li1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> support the notion that oxidant imbalances in CF cells would contribute to exaggerated inflammatory responses. Since epithelial cells are central to inflammatory pathways in the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Gadsby1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Oermann1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, it is logical to examine the redox potential of CF epithelia. To date only one study, utilizing fluorescent indicators, has reported that no differences in intracellular redox potential are observed between CF and corrected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Schwarzer1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, no analysis of intracellular steady-state H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration in CF epithelia has been conducted.</p><p>Delineating mechanisms of pulmonary inflammation in CF is perhaps the most pressing need in the field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Chmiel1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Oermann1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we sought to test the hypothesis that excessive inflammation in CF is triggered by the accumulation of intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. To increase confidence in our results we studied five different models of CF epithelia, three <italic>in vitro</italic> and two <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data reveal a significant increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the presence and absence of inflammatory stimuli in the CF state. This increase heavily contributes to the production of the inflammatory cytokine, IL-6 and IL-8.</p><p>To investigate the mechanism of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> elevation, we used 2D electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry to examine the expression of redox proteins that regulate intracellular peroxide. We found significant decreases in the expression of a number of antioxidant enzymes, including thioredoxin-1 (TRX-1), peroxiredoxin-1 (PRDX-1), peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX-6), catalase, and glutathione-S-transferase-pi (GST-pi), but a marked increase in Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD2). This pattern of protein expression is consistent with an environment in which H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production is increased by the SOD2 but the metabolism of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by catalase, PRDX-1, and PRDX-6 is reduced, allowing a net accumulation of intracellular peroxide.</p><p>The observation of changes in the expression of antioxidant enzymes led to an evaluation of the antioxidant response element (ARE). We found that the expression and activity of the transcription factor that facilitates ARE responses, Nrf-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Kang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, was decreased by approximately 70&#x00025; in CF cells vs. normal. Importantly, we were able to rescue CF cells by treatment with antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine or selenium, stabilization of Nrf-2, or the overexpression of Nrf-2. These approaches all normalized H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> processing and decreased IL-6 and IL-8 cytokine production to normal levels in CF cells.</p><p>Taken together, the data present novel evidence that oxidative stress in CF epithelia is not resolved through the ARE due to the dysfunction of Nrf-2. Coupled with an increase in SOD2, loss of Nrf-2 function in CF cells leads to excess intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which mediates exaggerated inflammatory cytokine production in CF epithelia. In the context of disease, this additional component of inflammation in CF is a good target for therapeutic intervention, and our data suggest that treatments that counter elevations in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can alleviate the CF hyper inflammatory phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Intracellular hydrogen peroxide levels are elevated in CF airway epithelia</title><p>In initial studies we compared the cultured CF model cell pairs 9HTEo<sup>&#x02212;</sup> pCEP (normal) and pCEP-R (CF), and the 16HBEo<sup>&#x02212;</sup> S (normal) and AS (CF). We examined H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in CF versus normal cells. In immortalized cell lines, unstimulated CF cells produce significantly higher levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> compared with normal matched pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003367-g001">Figure 1a</xref>).

This is consistent with the notion that peroxide mediated cytokine production in CF cells is already present at maximal levels. Conversely when TNF-&#x003b1;/IL-1&#x003b2; stimulated cells were treated with NAC (1 or 10 mM), a known modulator of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Zafarullah1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, IL-6 and IL-8 production was significantly decreased, especially in the CF cell pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003367-g002">Figure 2c, d</xref>). In these cells, where cytokine secretion is on average 1.5 fold higher than normal matched pairs following inflammatory stimulation, NAC decreased responses to the normal levels exhibited by stimulated normal cells. Finally, we tested the effect of Se, which enhances the activity of seleno-proteins such as TRX-1 and PRDX-1 and 6. A significant decrease in cytokine production was also observed 24 hrs after we supplemented our media with Se (0.1 or 1.0 &#x000b5;M), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003367-g002">Figure 2e, f</xref>). While antioxidant treatment consistently decreased cytokine responses in CF cells, the effect in normal cells was not as robust. This is consistent with the notion that antioxidant mechanisms in CF cells are more compromised versus normal cells, and therefore a more beneficial effect of antioxidants is observed in those cells.

We postulated that CFTR dysfunction may lead to increases in intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and that this would increase production of IL-6 and IL-8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Nemoto1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Yao1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Hayashi1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We found that steady state H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is indeed increased in CF cell lines and primary epithelia following inhibition of CFTR channel function. The novel discovery of the elevation in intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in CF epithelia, which we report here for the first time, coupled with strong evidence that this elevation significantly contributes to inflammatory responses, led to the investigation of the mechanism of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation in CF cells. To do this we studied five different models of CF, using multiple approaches in multiple experiments to increase confidence in our findings.</p><p>First, we examined the source of increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Based on experimental evidence, we suspect that this is the mitochondria. Our proteomic data indicate that the mitochondrial form of SOD, SOD2 exhibits elevated levels of expression in CF epithelia. This is further confirmed by biochemical data that shows significant increases in total cell SOD activity. Superoxide, which is converted to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by SOD2, is expected to be elevated in CF. Increased prenylation in CF epithelia has been shown to increase the activity of isoprenylated proteins such as Rho A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Kraynack1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> versus normal. Rac 1 activity, which is dependent on prenylation through the same pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Rowinsky1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, would be increased leading to elevated NADPH oxidase (Nox 1) activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Sigal1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, increasing superoxide production. Coupled with increases in SOD2 expression and activity, increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, which we observe, would ensue.</p><p>Normally increases in oxidant load activate the ARE to produce proteins including TRX-1, and PRDX-1, 3, 5, and 6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Kang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to catalase, these proteins make up the machinery that cells use to regulate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, to investigate the mechanism of increased intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we examined the expression of the antioxidant proteins that regulate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We found that the expression of these proteins was significantly reduced in a number of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models of CF epithelia. To reduce the complexity of our <italic>in vivo</italic> samples, we used excised nasal tissue, which contains a high proportion of epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-White1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Differences in these cells agree with our data in vitro, and are even more pronounced than those observed in whole lungs. Nevertheless, whole lung protein exhibited differential expression similar to that observed in CF cultured epithelia, with increases in SOD2 and decreases in peroxidase enzymes. This may indicate that this phenomenon is systemic and not confined to epithelial cells. However, this remains to be tested.</p><p>The decrease in expression of protective proteins was linked to the dysfunction of Nrf-2. CF epithelia exhibited significantly lower expression and transcriptional activity of Nrf-2. When Nrf-2 was enhanced in CF cells by a number of approaches, intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and cytokine production decreased to normal levels. Taken together our data strongly indicate that Nrf-2 dysfunction is present in CF epithelia and that, coupled with increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production by SOD2, this results in the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Our data are supported by previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-RoxoRosa1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Pollard1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

An imbalance in the intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> would increase redox mediated activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, and contribute to the excessive production of IL-6 and IL-8, which is present in the CF lung and which we observe in our cultured cell models.</p><p>Lack of CFTR channel function, as is the case for our 9 HTEo<sup>&#x02212;</sup> pCEP-R or inhibited wd-HPTE cells, is sufficient for the elevation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Inhibition of CFTR in normal cells produces elevation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> within 72 hrs. Previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Perez1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> increases in cytokine production following CFTR inhibition are therefore driven, at least in part, by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

Disruption of the transport of GSH by the cell wide inhibition of CFTR may affect levels of GSH in the mitochondria, where it is transported to balance oxidant production. Furthermore, Nrf-2 activity is sensitive to GSH levels in the nucleus. If cellular levels of GSH are disrupted by the inhibition of CFTR, Nrf-2 activity may be affected. Therefore, the transport of GSH may be a CFTR function that is necessary for the normal regulation of the antioxidant response element in epithelial cells.</p><p>We observe a decrease in Nrf-2 levels both in the cytoplasm and nucleus in CF epithelia, compared to normal matched pairs.

Degradation of Nrf-2 will take place once it is released from Keap-1, if it remains in the cytoplasm and does not translocate to the nucleus. Determinants of nuclear translocation following dissociation from Keap-1 are not well understood, but may involve phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Zhang1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and/or association with activating binding partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Kang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Zhang1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. If oxidative stress is elevated in CF, but Nrf-2 is not rapidly localized to the nucleus, a decrease in Nrf-2 levels due to ubiquitination and degradation would be expected, as we observe. This is consistent with our data for tBHQ, which stabilizes Nrf-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Li2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. CF cells treated with tBHQ exhibited increased Nrf-2 activity, as well as decreased IL-6 and IL-8 production. This suggests that differential degradation of Nrf-2 in CF epithelia plays a role in enhanced suppression of its activity.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that the ARE response pathway in CF cells is dysfunctional, with activation of Nrf-2 decreasing in the CF state both in the presence and absence of inflammatory stimulus. The down regulation of Nrf-2 in CF cells, although paradoxical considering the increased levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, may be necessary to avoid the effects of chronic activation of ARE, which include apoptosis and cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Beyer1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Pervaiz1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In the presence of inflammatory stimulation, where differential protein expression becomes more pronounced, as do elevations in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, cytokine production is increased. Conversely, increases in Nrf-2 activity decrease production of IL-8 and IL-6. Therefore, chronic activation of Nrf-2 may be repressed at the cost of increased cytokine production.</p><p>In addition to increasing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels, decreases in Nrf-2 activity in CF cells decrease TRX-1 and GST expression. These proteins are related to the glutathionylation of NF-&#x003ba;B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-PinedaMolina1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, which occurs after prolonged oxidative stress in normal cells and prevents over-activation. Therefore, decreased Nrf-2 activity would be expected to prolong NF-&#x003ba;B activation, and this is consistent with previous data on CF cell line cytokine production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Kube1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. While non-CF cell lines cease to produce GM-CSF and IL-6 by 6 hr and IL-8 by 24 hr, CF cells continue to accumulate these cytokines for the duration of the experiment (48 hr) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Kube1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting a diminished ability of CF cells to inactivate NF-&#x003ba;B once it is activated. Therefore, Nrf-2 down regulation in CF cells may affect cytokine production both by enhancing activation and reducing inactivation of NF-&#x003ba;B. Interestingly, the disruption of Nrf-2 expression in transgenic mouse models alone is sufficient to result in a proinflammatory phenotype in the lungs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Rangasamy1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> and bowels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Osburn1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> of these animals.

The strip is rehydrated for 8&#x02013;12 hours with the application of 50 V at room temperature, then prepared for SDS-PAGE by incubation in reducing buffer (50 mM Tris, 6 M urea, 100 mM DTT, 30&#x00025; glycerol, and 2&#x00025; SDS) for 15 min then in alkylating buffer (50 mM Tris, 6 M urea, 250 mM iodoacetamide, 30&#x00025; glycerol, and 2&#x00025; SDS) for 15 min at room temperature. For the second dimension, the IPG strip is embedded in 1&#x00025; agarose on top of a 12.5&#x00025; acrylamide precast gel. SDS-PAGE is performed for 1 hour at 200 V.

Images acquired with a GS-800 densitometer are imported into the PDQuest&#x02122; 2-D analysis software and compared. Once gels are manually oriented using a few matched protein bands, the software automatically matches all detected bands on comparative gels, and measures band densities. Five gels for each cell type under each condition are averaged and used in our comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Protein digest preparation</title><p>Protein hydrolysis is performed in-gel using porcine trypsin as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Kinter1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, protein bands are excised from the gel using a gel spot cutter, washed with 50&#x00025; Methanol/5&#x00025; acetic acid 3 times for 1 hr at room temp., dehydrated with acetonitrile, rehydrated with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, dehydrated with acetonitrile, and completely dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Gel pieces are then rehydrated with a 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate containing 20 ng/&#x000b5;l trypsin on ice for 10 min. This solution is then removed and 10 &#x000b5;l of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate is added to the gel fragment. The digestion is allowed to occur overnight at room temp. Tryptic peptides are extracted from the gel into 30 &#x000b5;l of 50&#x00025; acetonitrile/5&#x00025; formic acid, centrifuged under vacuum until acetonitrile is removed and the volume is adjusted to 20 &#x000b5;l of 1&#x00025; acetic acid analysis by LC MS-MS.</p></sec><sec id="s4m"><title>Protein identification by mass spectrometry</title><p>The LC MS-MS system is the Thermo Finnigan LCQ-Deca XP plus ion trap mass spectrometer with a nanospray ion source interfaced to self-packed 10 cm&#x000d7;75 &#x000b5;m Phenomenex Jupiter C18 reversed-phase capillary chromatography columns. Samples are loaded manually. Aliquots (2 &#x000b5;l) of an extracted tryptic digest are injected onto the column and the peptides are eluted by an acetonitrile/0.05 M acetic acid gradient at a flow rate of 0.2 &#x000b5;l/min. The nanospray ion source is operated at 1.8&#x02013;2.2 kV. The digest is analyzed using the data dependent multitask capability of the instrument acquiring full scan mass spectra to determine peptide molecular weights and product ion spectra to determine amino acid sequence in successive or &#x0201c;tandem&#x0201d; scans. This mode of analysis produces &#x0223c;4000 collisionally induced dissociation (CID) spectra of ions ranging in abundance over several orders of magnitude (not all CID spectra are derived from peptides). These data are digitally stored using the Xcalibur&#x02122; software. Data analysis is performed using all CID spectra collected in the experiment to search the NCBI non-redundant database with the Mascot and Bioworks search program.</p></sec><sec id="s4n"><title>Measurement of IL-6 and IL-8</title><p>We measure the production of the IL-6 and IL-8 pro-inflammatory cytokines by testing media from treated cells by Luminex&#x02122; ELISA, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Dupont1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4o"><title>Assays for Nrf-2</title><p>We test Nrf-2 activity by measuring firefly luciferase expression driven by the Nrf-2 promoter for glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (sequence: <named-content content-type="gene">GCT CTT CCG GTG CTC TTC CGG TGC TCT TCC GGT GCT CTT CCG GT</named-content>). Cultured cells were grown to 80&#x00025; confluence in 24 well plates. On the day of experiment, growth medium was replaced with transfection medium consisting of Opti-MEM media, 0.9 &#x000b5;g Nrf-2 driven firefly luciferase, and 0.1 &#x000b5;g CMV driven Renilla luciferase (transfection efficiency control). Each sample well was transfected with 1 &#x000b5;g total plasmid DNA complexed to lipofectin, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003367-Felgner1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Control transfections were carried out under identical conditions with a Nrf-1 driven firefly luciferase expression plasmid.

After 3 hours transfection media is removed, cells are washed, and fresh growth media is added. Two days following Transfection, cells are lysed, cell debris are centrifuged, and supernatants are assayed by dual luciferase assay. Expression levels are expressed as the ratio of Firefly to Renilla luciferase activity, normalized to non-CF controls. For studies of the effect of the overexpression of Nrf-2, we transfected cells with a Nrf-2 mammalian expression plasmid (pCI vector backbone) that was gifted us by Dr. Mark Hannink.
