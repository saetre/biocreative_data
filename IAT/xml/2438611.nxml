Myxoma virus (MV) is a cytoplasmic DNA poxvirus that in nature infects only rabbits. Our previous studies have shown that MV infection of primary mouse cells is restricted by virus-induced type I interferon (IFN). However, little is known about the innate sensor(s) involved in activating signaling pathways leading to cellular defense responses in primary human immune cells. Here, we show that the complete restriction of MV infection in the primary human fibroblasts requires both tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and type I IFN. We also demonstrate that MV infection of primary human macrophages (pHMs) activates the cytoplasmic RNA sensor called retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), which coordinately induces the production of both TNF and type I IFN. Of note, RIG-I sensing of MV infection in pHMs initiates a sustained TNF induction through the sequential involvement of the downstream IFN-regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF3 and IRF7). Thus, RIG-I-mediated co-induction of TNF and type I IFN by virus-infected pHMs represents a novel innate defense mechanism to restrict viral infection in human cells. These results also reveal a new regulatory mechanism for TNF induction following viral infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Myxoma virus, a member of the cytoplasmic DNA poxvirus family, causes a lethal disease called myxomatosis in the European rabbit. It has been known for over a half-century that other vertebrates, including humans, are highly resistant to myxoma virus infection, even following direct injections of live myxoma virus. Interestingly, myxoma virus has been recently shown to potently infect and kill malignant human tumors xenografted in mice. However, little is known about how normal human immune cells sense and suppress myxoma virus multiplication at the cellular level. Here, we show that the cytoplasmic RNA helicase RIG-I is the major sensor that detects invading myxoma virus in primary human macrophages and triggers the co-induction of both tumor necrosis factor and type I interferon. Together, tumor necrosis factor and type I interferon inhibit myxoma virus in otherwise permissive cells, such as human fibroblasts. Conceptually, our study thus demonstrates that intracellular RNA sensors may, in general, play a more important role than previously thought in the innate antiviral responses against DNA virus infections in human cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myxoma virus (MV), a member of the poxvirus family, is a large cytoplasmic DNA virus that infects only rabbits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Fenner1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Kerr1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. No other vertebrate species outside of lagomorphs, including humans, have ever been reported to contract a productive MV infection. This strict host specificity of MV provides an important avenue to study how cross-species virus infections can be manipulated, and how zoonotic infections might be regulated in humans. For instance, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Erk1/2-type I interferon (IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;)-STAT1 signaling cascade has been revealed as the principal antiviral defense pathway which restricts MV infection in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts. In fact, disruption of the STAT1 signaling cascade renders normally resistant mice highly susceptible to lethal MV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Wang1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Little is known, however, about the innate defense pathways that inhibit MV infection in normal primary human cells.</p><p>Innate cellular defenses can be triggered by a variety of mechanisms, including host recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Akira1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Janeway1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Although TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are known to recognize certain viral nucleic acids, these TLRs are exclusively localized in the endosomal compartments and therefore might be unable to sense cytoplasmic viral PAMPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Kawai1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Cellular surveillance of invading DNA viruses likely involves multiple viral PAMPs, particularly certain atypical RNAs. For example, many DNA viruses produce dsRNA and/or 5&#x02032;-triphosphate RNA, as viral by-products, during their replicative life cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Akira1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Jacobs1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Yoneyama1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast, certain other viral RNA moities are specifically detected by another cytoplasmic RNA sensor called melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Kato1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is highly plausible that infecting DNA viruses may generate various &#x0201c;accidental&#x0201d; RNA ligands which engage cytoplasmic RNA sensors. Current reported studies are focusing predominantly on the roles of RIG-I and MDA5 in triggering innate defenses against RNA viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Kato1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Johnson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, it remains to be determined how critical RIG-I and MDA5 might be in sensing DNA viruses.</p><p>Host recognition of viral infection normally activates multiple evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways, such as NF-&#x003ba;B and the IFN-regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF3 and IRF7) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Mogensen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Activation of these pathways often culminates in the induction of an array of antiviral cytokines, including type I IFN and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which are widely considered crucial components of innate antiviral immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Benedict1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Stetson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000099-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, exogenous IFN-&#x003b2; reduced MV yield by approximately one log. To characterize other potential host factors that might also inhibit MV infection in human fibroblasts, we then investigated the potential anti-MV effects of other antiviral cytokines. For example, TNF has been shown to possess antiviral activities under certain circumstances, particularly in collaboration with type I IFN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Wong1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. To this end, we infected CCD-922Sk fibroblasts with MV in the presence of TNF alone, or together with IFN-&#x003b2;. We observed that approximately one log reduction in MV yield was obtained with TNF treatment alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000099-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, this anti-MV effect of either cytokine alone was considerably enhanced when the two cytokines were combined, as that treatment inhibited MV replication by more than 4-log (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000099-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To further validate the anti-MV properties of TNF, we then constructed a recombinant MV that constitutively expresses human TNF (MV-hTNF, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000099.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Compared with the control MV, MV-hTNF yield was approximately a log lower in CCD-922Sk fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000099-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Of note, this reduction could be reversed by a TNF neutralizing antibody (data not shown). Significantly, the replication of MV-hTNF was now nearly abolished by IFN-&#x003b2; alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000099-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We further observed that, although the relative anti-MV potencies of TNF and type I IFN varied between individual infections, TNF in combination with either IFN-&#x003b2; or IFN-&#x003b1;A uniformly restricted MV replication in all primary human cells tested (data not shown). Taken in aggregate, these data demonstrate that TNF synergizes with type I IFN to achieve potent innate restriction of MV replication in primary human fibroblasts.</p><p>To further characterize the antiviral potencies of IFN-&#x003b2; and TNF in CCD-922Sk fibroblasts, we then infected the cells with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), an RNA virus from the picornaviridae family, in the presence of IFN-&#x003b2; or TNF. Unlike MV, EMCV yield could be inhibited by more than 5-log in CCD-922Sk fibroblasts by IFN-&#x003b2; alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000099-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). However, TNF alone exhibited no anti-EMCV efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000099-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), nor did it affect IFN-&#x003b2; inhibition of EMCV (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that, at least in human fibroblasts, whether TNF is needed to synergize with type I IFN to achieve the full antiviral state depends significantly upon the infecting virus.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>MV infection elicits robust induction of TNF and type I IFN in primary human macrophages</title><p>The involvement of TNF and type I IFN in restricting MV infection prompted us to explore macrophages as a model system to investigate the cytokine inducibility by MV infection because macrophages are generally considered as particularly potent TNF producers in response to a variety of stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Tracey1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. To this end, we infected monocyte-derived pHMs with MV and then measured TNF production in response to the viral infection.

Because type I IFN was shown to potentiate the anti-MV effects of TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000099-g001">Figures 1B and C</xref>), we therefore examined whether MV infection could also induce type I IFN expression.

No appreciable amounts of TNF or IFN-&#x003b2; mRNAs were detected in either MV-infected CCD-922Sk fibroblasts or primary human lymphocytes (data not shown).

Taken together with these previous studies, our data thus point to an emerging theme that RIG-I may play a more general role in innate recognition of various DNA viruses.</p><p>This is of importance considering the fact that information remains limited about the cytoplasmic DNA sensor(s). Presently, the only characterized cytoplasmic DNA sensor DAI, also known as DLM-1/ZBP1, was shown to mediate type I IFN induction following infection with herpes simplex virus-1 in L929 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Takaoka1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, it appears that the role of DAI in DNA sensing may be a cell type specific or functional status-related phenomenon. In the present study, we observed that DAI knockdown inflicted only a minor inhibitory effect on TNF and IFN-&#x003b2; induction in MV-infected pHMs (data not shown). This result seems to further emphasize the importance of RIG-I as an innate sensor for DNA virus infections.</p><p>Our previous study of MV tropism restriction showed that MV infection not only induced type I IFN in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts but MV replication was exquisitely sensitive to the induced IFN, demonstrating that the type I IFN response is a predominant tropism determinant for MV in mouse fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Wang1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Of note, a previous study using primary human neonatal foreskin fibroblasts reported that the early passage (P1&#x02013;3) fibroblasts were permissive for MV infection, while late passage cells (P5&#x02013;10) became resistant at a time that paralleled the acquisition of constitutive IFN-&#x003b2; secretion, thus indicating a major role for type I IFN in inhibiting MV infection in those cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Johnston1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, however, we found that adult breast skin fibroblasts (CCD-922Sk), adult abdomen skin, fetal lung and fetal conjunctival fibroblasts uniformly supported permissive MV infection, regardless of the passage status, and all required both TNF and type I IFN to fully inhibit MV proliferation (data not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest that both TNF and type I IFN are necessary for a full-fledged inhibition of MV infection in a wide variety of the primary human fibroblasts tested although type I IFN itself might still be able to act as a potent inhibitor in certain cells.</p><p>We also report here that MV infection co-induced TNF and type I IFN only in pHMs, but not in primary fibroblasts or lymphocytes, in a RIG-I-dependent fashion. Hence, these data imply either that certain MV gene products act as RIG-I signaling pathway inhibitor(s) only in fibroblasts and lymphocytes or else there exist unique signaling elements of the RIG-I pathway that are restricted to pHMs. In either event, MV immunosubversion effectors may well be inherently involved in the determination of MV tropisms in primary human cells in a cell type-dependent manner.</p><p>Although disruption of RIG-I signaling is conducive for MV replication in pHMs, high titers of MV progeny are not achieved because of premature death of MV-infected pHMs (data not shown). This appears to lend support to an emerging notion that the major function of pHMs in combating MV infection is to provide an altruistic source of TNF and type I IFN.

In this regard, future clinical trials of MV as a new oncolytic virus to treat human cancers may provide a unique opportunity to determine the actual physiological relevance of leukocyte-based TNF and type I IFN responses in humans at the whole organism level.</p><p>Like IFN, TNF can also cause significant harm to the host when over-expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Baud1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, a tight control over both TNF and type I IFN induction and shut-off is a key to homeostasis. Here, we show that IRF3 activation alone triggered only a transient upregulation of TNF and type I IFN. In most cell types, IRF3 is constitutively expressed, whereas IRF7 must usually be induced <italic>de novo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Honda1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Sato1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the sequential involvement of IRF3 and IRF7 in the early and later phase of TNF production allows us to postulate that, if the early phase production of TNF and type I IFN is sufficient to block viral infection, then the later phase production of both cytokines will be coordinately curtailed. Taken collectively, sustaining TNF induction through IRF3 and IRF7 thus provides the host with a fine-tuned regulatory mechanism to allow for only needed TNF expression in parallel with type I IFN. In particular, the identification of IRF7 as a key regulator for sustained production of both TNF and type I IFN may offer useful clues for designing new therapeutic strategies for disorders in which over-expression of either cytokine is suspected as a major culprit.</p><p>Of relevance, recent work shows that in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse macrophages, TLR4 interacts initially with MyD88 to mediate the early phase TNF expression and then with the newly induced 4-1BBL to sustain longer term TNF production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Kang1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, sustained induction of TNF may be an intrinsic feature that can take place through distinct signaling pathways in a stimulus-specific fashion.</p><p>A pivotal step in sustaining the MV-elicited co-induction of TNF and type I IFN in pHMs is the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of IRF7. Our ChIP data reveal that MV-stimulated MAVS signaling caused the direct binding of both IRF3 and IRF7 to the ISRE and IRFE sites in the IRF7 promoter, and that this is unaffected by STAT1 or NF-&#x003ba;B p65 knockdown. Notably, previous studies show that type I IFN and TNF each potently stimulate IRF7 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Honda1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Lu1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000099-Marie1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, we observed that, in addition to TNF, MV infection co-induced type I IFN in pHMs. We further observed that IRF7 was strongly induced in pHMs by either exogenous type I IFN or TNF (data not shown), thus indicating that MV-elicited type I IFN and TNF also likely contribute to IRF7 upregulation in pHMs. Taken together, these data suggest that IFN-STAT1, TNF-NF-&#x003ba;B and MAVS-IRF3/IRF7 signaling cascades are mobilized independently following MV infection to induce IRF7 expression in pHMs. Because the protein synthesis of both type I IFN and TNF requires that IRF3/IRF7 be activated first, the direct binding of virally activated IRF3 and IRF7 to the ISRE and IRFE in the IRF7 promoter thus provides a rapid shortcut to trigger IRF7 transcription, whereby an initial weak signal serves as the positive feedforward/feedback platform for a strong IRF7 expression at the later times through robust secondary response pathways of IFN-STAT1 and TNF-NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p>In summary, our study shows that RIG-I sensing of a DNA poxvirus infection in pHMs is critically linked to co-regulated TNF and type I IFN responses that control viral tropism in primary human cells in general. These data indicate that cytoplasmic RNA sensors may play a more important role than previously envisaged in triggering the innate antiviral cellular defenses against DNA virus infections in human cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Human fibroblasts, macrophages and lymphocytes</title><p>Primary human skin fibroblasts CCD-922Sk (kindly provided by Dr. Scot Roberts) were maintained in MEM with 10&#x00025; FBS, penicillin (100 u/ml) and streptomycin (100 &#x000b5;g/ml).
