Here, we report the structure of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin, the core of which is a five-helix bundle linked to a C-terminal helix responsible for dimerisation. The NMR structure of the bundle reveals a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups. We have mapped the actin-binding site to this surface and shown that helix 1 on the opposite side of the bundle negatively regulates actin binding. The crystal structure of the dimerisation helix reveals an antiparallel coiled-coil with conserved residues clustered on the solvent-exposed face. Mutagenesis shows that dimerisation is essential for filamentous actin (F-actin) binding and indicates that the dimerisation helix itself contributes to binding. We have used these structures together with small angle X-ray scattering to derive a model of the entire domain. Electron microscopy provides direct evidence for binding of the dimer to F-actin and indicates that it binds to three monomers along the long-pitch helix of the actin filament.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>structure</kwd><kwd>talin</kwd><kwd>THATCH domain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Talin is one of a number of cytoskeletal proteins, including &#x003b1;-actinin, filamin, tensin and ILK, implicated in linking members of the integrin family of &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules to filamentous actin (F-actin). Talin (2541 amino acids) is composed of a globular head (residues 1&#x02013;400), containing a FERM domain, connected to a flexible rod (residues 482&#x02013;2541) by a short linker sequence containing a calpain-II cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Critchley, 2004</xref>). The FERM F3 subdomain contains a binding site for the &#x003b2;-integrin cytoplasmic domain, and recent structural studies have provided a detailed understanding of how F3 recognises both the NPxY motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Garcia-Alvarez <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) and membrane proximal sequences within the &#x003b2;-integrin cytodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Wegener <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). The talin rod is made up of a series of amphipathic helical bundles, a number of which contain binding sites for the cytoskeletal protein vinculin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Papagrigoriou <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Gingras <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), which is thought to stabilise focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Saunders <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), possibly by crosslinking talin to F-actin. Vinculin recognises a series of hydrophobic residues on one side of a helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Gingras <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>); both X-ray and NMR structures show that these residues are buried in the core of the helical bundle, which must unfold to allow vinculin binding. Indeed, intact talin binds vinculin with low affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Patel <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>); the mechanisms for activating the vinculin-binding sites in the talin rod remain to be determined. The talin rod also contains a second integrin-binding site (residues 1984&#x02013;2113) that appears to be essential for focal adhesion assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Moes <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), although it is unclear how &#x003b2;-integrin interacts with this site. Finally, the C-terminal region of talin (residues 2300&#x02013;2541) contains a binding site for F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hemmings <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>) that is homologous to that in the yeast protein Sla2p, the huntingtin-interacting protein HIP1, and the related protein HIP1R. This highly conserved domain has been referred to as an I/LWEQ motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">McCann and Craig, 1997</xref>) or more recently the THATCH (talin/HIP1R/Sla2p actin tethering C-terminal homology) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Brett <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). This region of talin is predicted to contain six helices; the N-terminal is the least conserved and appears to negatively regulate actin binding, while the C-terminal helix is required for talin dimerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Senetar <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the NMR structure of talin residues 2300&#x02013;2482, a five-helix bundle, which has a similar structure to the HIP1R THATCH core domain, and the crystal structure of helix 6 that forms an antiparallel dimer. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) together with these two structures allows us to propose a model for the entire talin 2300&#x02013;2541 dimer, which is elongated in solution. We have mapped the residues involved in actin binding in the five-helix bundle to one face of the domain. Binding requires dimerisation, and is negatively regulated by helix 1, which is on the opposite face to the actin-binding site. Electron microscopy, interpreted with the help of the overall shape of the dimer determined by SAXS, establishes how the dimer interacts with actin filaments and positions the N termini accessible and on opposite sides of the filaments.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Structure of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin</title><p>Initially, we used secondary structure prediction and NMR spectroscopy of a range of constructs to identify a talin polypeptide containing the C-terminal actin-binding site suitable for NMR structure determination (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Results and Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). These studies demonstrated the presence of a stable globular domain (residues 2300&#x02013;2482) connected by a flexible linker to a helical dimerisation domain (residues 2496&#x02013;2529). The structure of talin 2300&#x02013;2482 comprises five antiparallel &#x003b1;-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Results and Supplementary Figure S2D</xref>), as described for the homologous HIP1R actin-binding domain (referred to as the THATCH core) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Brett <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The helical bundle is stabilised by hydrophobic interactions. There are hydrophobic cores at each end of the bundle separated by a set of small hydrophilic side chains (Thr 2356, 2404, 2435 and Ser 2467) reminiscent of the &#x02018;threonine belt' observed in the structure of talin 782&#x02013;889 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Fillingham <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). The hydrophobic core at the N-terminal end of the bundle is arranged around the aromatic ring of Trp 2389 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>) and incorporates the side chain of the conserved Gln 2367, which points into the bundle. The core at the C-terminal end is made up of the hydrophobic side chains of Leu, Ile and Val residues, and is capped by the aromatic ring of Phe 2341. Helices 2 and 3 are the longest (32 residues), while the other three are approximately two turns shorter (22&#x02013;27 residues). Helix 2 is connected to the neighbouring helices by long loops (14 and 9 residues), while the other two loops are relatively short (4&#x02013;5 residues). The long loop between helices 1 and 2 is unstructured and highly dynamic, as indicated by sharp NMR resonances and the lack of NOEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). The loop between helices 2 and 3 has restricted mobility due to the hydrophobic contacts made by the Val 2376 side chain and the presence of Pro 2380.</p><p>As predicted from sequence homology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>), the structure most similar to the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin is that of the HIP1R THATCH core domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Brett <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), which shows 35&#x00025; sequence identity. For the whole structure, a relatively high r.m.s.d. was obtained (main-chain atoms 4.77 &#x000c5;; all heavy atoms 5.12 &#x000c5;), but the r.m.s.d. was much lower for the helical regions (main-chain atoms 2.92 &#x000c5;; all heavy atoms 3.37 &#x000c5;) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). Many structural features are conserved between the two helical bundles, and the majority of the conserved residues occupy similar positions. In particular, the side chain of Trp 2389 has the same orientation in both structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>), highlighting its role as a key residue in the hydrophobic core. However, there are also significant differences between the two structures. Helices 1, 2 and 5 are substantially shorter at the C-terminal end of the bundle than the equivalent helices in HIP1R, leading to a less elongated structure and the formation of the large unstructured loop between helices 1 and 2. The shortness of helix 1 can be attributed to the presence of Pro 2328 at the end of the helix, followed by a group of charged residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). The proline side chain makes contacts with the hydrophobic core and is positioned level with the ends of the other helices. The main difference at the N-terminal end of the bundle is the absence of the short capping helix &#x003b1;3&#x02032; that is present in the HIP1R structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>). Instead, there is an extra helical turn in helix 3, followed by a largely immobilised loop. It appears that the key residues for the formation and packing of the HIP1R capping helix are Phe 861 and Tyr 862, which are absent in talin. In addition, Pro 2380 occupies a position corresponding to the middle of helix &#x003b1;3&#x02032; in HIP1R. The absence of the &#x003b1;3&#x02032; helix in talin affects the position of the N-terminal end of the helices. In the HIP1R structure, the &#x003b1;3&#x02032; helix is wedged between the ends of helices 1 and 2, pushing helix 1 out. In talin, the absence of the capping helix allows helix 1 to move closer to helix 2, resulting in a structure that looks more closed at the N-terminal end of the bundle than in HIP1R.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Structure of the talin dimerisation domain</title><p>Using secondary structure prediction and NMR, the optimal domain boundaries of the talin dimerisation domain were shown to be residues 2494&#x02013;2541 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Results and Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Large crystals that diffracted X-rays to 2.2-&#x000c5; resolution were readily obtained using sparse matrix screening, and the crystal structure was determined using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction from a selenomethionine derivative (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table SII</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Results</xref>). The two monomers in the asymmetric unit superimpose well onto one another (average r.m.s.d. for main-chain atoms 0.34 &#x000c5;, and for all heavy atoms 1.08 &#x000c5;), the main differences between the monomers being the orientations of long side chains of solvent-exposed residues. Each monomer is composed of a long straight helix approximately 48 &#x000c5; in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). The helices form an antiparallel coiled-coil dimer with a small angle between the helices. The formation of the dimer buries approximately 30&#x00025; (1539 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>) of the total surface area. Both ends of the dimer are nonpolar with a highly charged belt in the middle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). There is a salt bridge cluster in the centre of the dimer formed by the side chains of K2511 and E2514 from each monomer, with the four side chains making intra- and intermolecular contacts within the cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). Additionally, intramolecular salt bridges are observed for E2516/R2519 in both monomers, stabilising the helix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4C</xref>). Interestingly, E2507 from one of the monomers forms an intermolecular salt bridge with K2521, while in the other monomer this residue forms an intramolecular salt bridge with R2510 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). In all other cases, the charged groups are too far apart to make a salt bridge and some of the side chains are hydrogen-bonded to nearby solvent molecules.</p><p>No density was observed for the first three residues at the N terminus of both monomers where a pair of glycines (G2496/G2497) destabilise the helix. The last 12 residues at the C-terminus (2530&#x02013;2541) are also disordered and no density was observed in the crystal structure&#x02014;this is consistent with [<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N]HSQC NMR spectra where a dozen sharp peaks are observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>). The dimer is stabilised by nonpolar interactions involving side chains of I2501, A2504, M2508, L2515, A2518, L2522 and I2525 located on the same face of the helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>). The aliphatic part of the side chain of K2511 also contributes to the hydrophobic core and the amino group is stabilised away from the core by a salt bridge with E2514 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). Most of these residues are conserved in the THATCH domains identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Brett <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, the solvent-exposed residues Q2505, L2509, E2512, L2515, R2519, R2526 and Y2530 are even more conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C and D</xref>) and are clustered on one face of the dimer, resulting in a conserved surface made up of both charged and hydrophobic residues. These characteristics suggest that this surface may be involved in actin binding.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of residues involved in actin binding</title><p>The five-helix bundle that comprises the core of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin contains a number of conserved surface-exposed residues that are predominantly clustered on the face made up of helices 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). This part of the surface consists of an extensive hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>), characteristics that make it a good candidate for a region involved in F-actin binding. Indeed, the actin-binding site in the HIP1R THATCH domain has been mapped to the equivalent surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Brett <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, this surface is on the face of the domain opposite helix 1, which has been shown to negatively regulate actin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Senetar <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). In addition, actin binding depends on the presence of the C-terminal dimerisation helix (see below). To map the residues in talin 2300&#x02013;2541 directly or indirectly involved in actin binding, we tested the effects of a series of mutations on its affinity for F-actin. In the presence of a six-fold molar excess of F-actin, &#x0223c;30&#x00025; of wild-type talin 2300&#x02013;2541 co-sedimented with F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>), a result similar to that previously observed for talin and HIP1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Senetar <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). The single mutations Q2388D, Q2437E, K2443D, V2444D and K2445D (equivalent to those analysed in the HIP1R THATCH domain; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Brett <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) all caused a significant reduction in F-actin binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>), and the triple mutant K2443D/V2444D/K2445D reduced binding to 27&#x00025; of wild type. Interestingly, although the Q2437E mutant reduced binding affinity, the equivalent mutation in HIP1R (Q916E) increased binding. While this difference is puzzling, our results clearly demonstrate that incorporating acidic amino acids into the actin-binding surface of talin reduces binding. Both the Q2388D mutation in talin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>) and the equivalent R867D mutation in HIP1R reduce binding to F-actin; interestingly, substituting talin Q2388 with arginine had no effect on binding, indicating that either a basic or an uncharged residue at this position can be tolerated. Talin D2447, located close to the conserved basic residues K2443 and K2445, is homologous to N926 in HIP1R and a talin D2447N mutant increased F-actin binding to 144&#x00025; that of wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). Thus, reducing the acidic charge in the proximity of the conserved basic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C and D</xref>) increases the ability of talin to bind F-actin.</p><p>One of the key structural differences between the THATCH cores of talin and HIP1R is in the region between helices 2 and 3, where a loop is observed in talin and a short &#x003b1;3&#x02032; helix in HIP1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). Valine 2376 in the loop contacts W2389 in the centre of the actin-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3A</xref>), and we therefore made a V2376D mutant to study the effects on binding of destabilising this loop. The [<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N]HSQC NMR spectrum of this mutant showed few changes in comparison with the wild-type protein, indicating that the protein adopted the correct fold, and its ability to bind F-actin was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). We conclude that this poorly conserved loop, which is located on the opposite side of the bundle, is probably not involved in F-actin binding, and that V2376 is not important for maintaining the hydrophobic core near W2389.</p><p>At the N terminus of helix 3, there are two aspartate residues (D2385 and D2386) that are near the conserved basic residues within the actin-binding site, and we therefore mutated these to the equivalent residues in HIP1R, that is, D2385K and D2386N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, the double mutation produced only a small increase in binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). Since we had already shown that a D2447N mutation increased binding significantly (144&#x00025;), we made a triple mutant (D2385K/D2386N/D2447N) but this bound no better than the D2447N mutant alone. The sequence conservation around D2385 and D2386 is low and the structural features of talin and HIP1R are very different in this region, suggesting that it is not critical for F-actin binding. As described above, Q2388 on the adjacent helical turn of helix 3 could be mutated to arginine without any effect on F-actin binding, but a mutation to an acidic residue did reduce binding to 59&#x00025; of wild type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). Overall, the mutagenesis data show that exposed residues on two adjacent helical turns have very different effects on F-actin binding, indicating that the talin&#x02013;actin contact site is a well-defined hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged residues.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The talin dimerisation domain is important for F-actin binding</title><p>Complete removal of the dimerisation domain reduced F-actin binding to 22&#x00025; of the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). To check whether this effect is due to conversion of the dimer to the monomer, or to loss of additional contacts between the dimerisation domain itself and F-actin, we made a series of mutants designed to inhibit dimer formation with minimum effect on the properties of the helices. Three point mutants (R2526G, L2515D and A2518D) were all monomeric as determined by gel filtration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>) and NMR, as was the double mutant L2515D/A2518D (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). For these mutants, we observed a large increase in the number of sharp intense signals in the [<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N]HSQC spectra and an overall reduction in the resonance line-widths. The positions of the majority of the resonances corresponding to the five-helix bundle remain unchanged. We conclude that the above mutations lead to the complete unfolding of the dimerisation domain, while the five-helix bundle remains unperturbed. These mutants showed much reduced actin binding, although they did bind to actin significantly better than the polypeptide lacking the entire dimerisation domain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>), suggesting that the dimerisation domain may also interact with actin.</p><p>Analysis of the sequence of the dimerisation domain shows that all the invariant residues cluster on one face of the domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). We have mutated two invariant basic residues, R2519 and R2526, to alanine to reduce the overall positive charge of this surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). Surprisingly, these two mutants are monomeric (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>) and as a result their F-actin-binding capacity was substantially reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). The core of this antiparallel dimer is not a typical leucine zipper and is not highly hydrophobic. Indeed, the crystal structure shows many salt bridges between the two helices, and our mutational analysis suggests that they are critical to maintain a stable fold. We therefore mutated two conserved though not invariant residues (R2510 and R2513) to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). R2510 is on the opposite face of the dimer and makes salt bridges to neighbouring residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>), while R2513 is at the edge of the dimer and is not involved in any salt bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). Gel filtration and NMR data show that both mutants are dimeric (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>), but both showed a significant decrease in F-actin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary S7C</xref>). Taken together, the data show that the dimerisation of the actin-binding domain is essential for F-actin binding, in agreement with the recent work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Smith and McCann (2007)</xref>, and also suggest that the dimerisation domain itself might contribute to binding through electrostatic interactions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Effects of mutating the upstream helix on actin binding</title><p>The N-terminal helix 1 of the actin-binding domain, also termed the upstream helix (USH), was identified as a conserved structural element that decreases the actin-binding capacity of this family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Senetar <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Removal of this helix in talin led to a 2.6-fold increase relative to the full domain in the fraction of talin (2334&#x02013;2541) bound to actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>), in agreement with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Senetar <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). However, there was also a slight increase in the amount of this polypeptide that pelleted in the absence of F-actin; NMR shows that removal of the USH alters the conformation of the domain, which may decrease stability and lead to a tendency to aggregate with time. The USH is anchored to the rest of the domain through nonpolar interactions involving L2309, I2316 and L2323 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>), and the effect of mutating these residues on F-actin binding is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>. The L2309A or L2323A mutations led to a small but reproducible increase in binding, while the double mutant (L2309A/L2323A) showed a larger increase in binding (154&#x00025; that of wild type; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>). An increase in binding was also observed for the double mutant I2316A/L2323A (135&#x00025;), while no change was observed for the I2316A single mutant. Although none of the mutations increased binding to the same degree as removing the entire USH (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>), they had little effect on the solubility of the protein compared to removal of the entire USH. These results support previous conclusions that the USH negatively regulates actin binding, through a conformational mechanism, details of which remain unclear.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>SAXS analysis of the C-terminal actin-binding domain of talin shows an extended dimeric protein</title><p>To investigate the overall shape of the talin 2300&#x02013;2541 dimer, we carried out SAXS experiments. From the scattering profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>), the maximum linear dimension (<italic>D</italic><sub>max</sub>) for the talin dimer is 124 (&#x000b1;6) &#x000c5;, suggesting that the dimer is elongated.

These observations clearly demonstrate that the dimer is characterised by an extended non-globular arrangement of the THATCH domain, consistent with the results from analytical gel filtration (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Results</xref>).</p><p><italic>Ab initio</italic> shape reconstructions from the experimental SAXS profile alone using GASBOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Svergun <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) highlight the elongated shape of the dimeric talin 2300&#x02013;2541 polypeptide; the calculated molecular envelope is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>. The high-resolution structures of the dimerisation helix and the five-helix bundle were used as rigid bodies to model the dimeric talin polypeptide using BUNCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Petoukhov and Svergun, 2005</xref>). The BUNCH model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref> superimposed on the model-independent shape reconstruction (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary movie</xref>). The <italic>ab initio</italic> shape and the rigid body model reconstructions were evaluated against the experimental scattering profiles assuming a two-fold symmetry constraint; both reproduce the features of the experimental scattering profiles well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>The arrangement of the two five-helix bundles in the dimer seems to be conserved, since all rigid body models yielded an angle of approximately 130&#x000b0; between their long axes. Interestingly, the angle between the two antiparallel helices in the dimerisation domain is approximately 120&#x000b0;. This may indicate an interaction between the bottom of the five-helix bundle and one face of the dimerisation domain (possibly the conserved face described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>); the twist in the dimerisation domain would determine the arrangement of the two five-helix bundles. A number of residues might be involved in stabilising the observed domain arrangement within the dimer. These include a loop of 15 amino-acid residues between helices 1 and 2 that could contact the dimerisation domain, a segment of &#x0223c;20 amino-acid residues between helix 5 and the dimerisation domain and a stretch of 14 residues at the C terminus of the dimerisation domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2D</xref>), totalling 49 residues (98 residues in the dimer).</p><p>Comparison of the [<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N]HSQC spectra of (i) talin 2294&#x02013;2541, containing both the core five-helix bundle and the dimerisation domain, (ii) the five-helix bundle alone and (iii) two different polypeptides spanning the dimerisation domain (residues 2494&#x02013;2541 and 2481&#x02013;2541) confirms that the two domains interact. For example, G2496 and G2497 are mobile in the isolated dimerisation domain but become immobilised in talin 2294&#x02013;2541, as shown by severe broadening of the resonances. Similarly, residues 2532&#x02013;2538, which are C-terminal to the structured part of the dimerisation domain are highly dynamic in the isolated domain, but become immobilised in talin 2294&#x02013;2541. The changes in dynamic properties indicate a direct interaction between the THATCH core domain and the N- and C-terminal ends of the dimerisation domain. However, the core domain retains a significant degree of independent mobility within talin 2294&#x02013;2541, as indicated by the relatively modest increase in line widths of the NMR resonances relative to the isolated five-helix bundle. This suggests that the area of contact with the core domain is relatively small, and is probably at the C-terminal end of the domain.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Electron microscopy of the C-terminal domain of talin bound to actin filaments</title><p>To determine where the C-terminal domain of talin binds on the actin filament, we used the talin 2334&#x02013;2541 construct lacking the USH, since it has a higher affinity for F-actin. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that this construct is properly folded and stable under the conditions used, and formation of a complex with F-actin was verified by co-sedimentation and DSC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). Using electron microscopy, extra density was visible decorating the actin filaments at both pH 7.0 and 7.5 in the presence of the talin construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref> arrows), clearly indicating binding. Two complementary image-reconstruction approaches for helically symmetric structures were applied to two independent data sets. The analysis of the resulting three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions shows that the helical symmetry is consistent with the values reported for decorated actin filaments by us and others. However, difference mapping of reconstructions of F-actin with and without talin 2334&#x02013;2541 did not provide any clear difference peaks that might correspond to the talin domain.</p><p>Consequently, we used an image analysis approach that does not rely on helical symmetry. The resulting 3D reconstruction shows two distinct but connected densities attached to the filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). These densities are fully consistent in shape and size with the helical bundle of the talin C-terminal domain. In fact, the SAXS-based dimer model fits nicely into the extra density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating that the conformation of actin-bound dimers and dimers in solution are similar. A minor twist (20&#x000b0;) around the dimerisation domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>) improves the fit dramatically and also increases contact area with the actin filament. The docking indicates that the talin domain binds to three monomers along the filament. Thus, it cannot support helical symmetry, explaining why the helical reconstructions did not show additional density that can be attributed to talin.</p><p>The model places the two helical bundles towards two opposite sides of the filament. The upper bundle is placed close to subdomain 2 of the central actin monomer and is also close to the back (C-terminal region) of subdomain 1 of the upper actin monomer and the top of subdomain 1 of the central actin monomer. The lower talin helical bundle is close to the lowest actin monomer of the three-monomer interaction site. The dimerisation domain is close to the N terminus (subdomain 1) of the central actin monomer. In this configuration, residues implicated in actin binding by the mutagenesis experiments are placed close to the surface of F-actin.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have determined the solution structure of the talin C-terminal actin-binding domain, a five-helix bundle that has a similar fold to the HIP1R THATCH core domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Brett <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Using mutagenesis, we have defined the actin-binding surface on the bundle as a region of highly conserved residues forming a hydrophobic patch lined by basic residues. Binding to F-actin is negatively regulated by helix 1 (the USH), on the opposite face of the bundle to this site, although the physiological significance of this remains to be determined. In the full-length protein, this domain is C-terminal to a series of helical bundles that make up the talin rod, and the mechanical force exerted on talin might weaken the interaction between the USH and the core of the bundle, thereby increasing its affinity for F-actin.</p><p>An intriguing feature of proteins containing a THATCH domain is the C-terminal helix that seems to enhance actin binding by supporting dimer formation. Here, we describe for the first time the structure of one of these domains, the talin dimerisation domain, which forms an antiparallel dimer. NMR indicates that additional intramolecular interactions between the unstructured regions N- and C-terminal to the dimerisation helix may also help to stabilise the antiparallel dimer. The structure suggests that full-length talin might adopt a wide variety of conformations, including an extended tail-to-tail dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). This notion is supported by data showing that HIP1R is a rod-shaped dimer with globular heads at either end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Engqvist-Goldstein <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Talin has previously been reported to form an antiparallel dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Goldmann <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>), which is difficult to reconcile with our results on the C-terminal domain. Mutagenesis of the dimerisation domain clearly demonstrates the importance of this domain in supporting high-affinity actin binding. Intriguingly, most mutations in the dimerisation helix rendered the domain monomeric, and F-actin binding was markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). However, we were able to identify two mutants (R2510A and R2513A) that retained the ability to form dimers while showing a reduction in F-actin binding, suggesting that the dimerisation domain itself might contribute to actin binding.</p><p>Electron microscopy and image analysis studies together with DSC and co-sedimentation assays provide direct evidence for binding of the dimeric C-terminal domain of talin to filamentous actin. The 3D reconstruction indicates that the dimeric talin construct binds to three actin monomers along the long-pitch helix of the filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). This is surprising because most F-actin-binding proteins tend to bind two monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">McGough, 1998</xref>), often involving a prominent hydrophobic pocket in the filament primarily composed of subdomain 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Dominguez, 2004</xref>) with some contributions from subdomain 2 of the long-pitch neighbour below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Volkmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). In our model, the upper helical bundle of the talin dimer is indeed located close to this consensus binding site on F-actin, contacting two actin monomers along the long-pitch helix. This is consistent with the hydrophobic nature of the binding site determined by mutagenesis. The second talin helical bundle is mainly bound to the front of a single actin monomer right below these two, and the dimerisation domain is close enough to make contact with the negatively charged N-terminal region of subdomain 1 in the central actin monomer of the three.</p><p>One consequence of this mode of binding and the intrinsic symmetry of the dimer is that there must be two non-equivalent modes of actin binding. This is consistent with a study on an isolated monomeric THATCH core domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Galkin <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) where two different modes of binding were identified. However, in contrast to that study, we were not able to observe F-actin binding by the monomeric talin five-helix bundle (equivalent to the HIP1R THATCH core domain), indicating that both sets of contacts seen in our model are necessary to produce a stable complex. The model assumes that there are no major rearrangements between the domains in solution (as determined by SAXS) and the actin-bound form of the dimer. This assumption is fully consistent with the shape of the additional density, which can be accounted for well by docking the SAXS dimer structure into the density. A slight twist of the dimer bringing the helical bundles in a more parallel position results in an even better fit. The model for the actin-bound dimer places the residues implicated in actin binding close to the filament surface and the N termini on two opposite sides of the actin filament. However, this assignment is not unique and shows only that there is no contradiction between the dimer placement in the model and the other data.</p><p>The finding that the dimeric C-terminal actin-binding site of talin binds to a single actin filament explains why this domain fails to bundle actin filaments under the conditions used in this study. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Smith and McCann (2007)</xref> report that this domain has bundling activity, as determined by low-speed centrifugation and by negative stain electron microscopy. All our experiments using the construct lacking the USH were carried out within 24&#x02013;48 h of purification, and the integrity of the fold was confirmed by DSC. We found that the protein has a tendency to aggregate with time as detected by NMR, and this may explain the discrepancy between the two studies. It is well established that full-length talin has actin-bundling activity, as does the talin rod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Schmidt <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). However, it is important to note that talin contains at least two other regions that bind F-actin, namely the talin FERM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) and residues 951&#x02013;1327 in the centre of the talin rod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hemmings <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). It will be important to establish the role of each of these actin-binding sites in a cellular context. Initial studies using talin1 knockout cells have shown that the C-terminal region of talin is required to support coupling of surface-associated fibronectin to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), but further studies are required to establish whether this was due to loss of the C-terminal actin-binding site or to the fact that the protein was monomeric.

The orientation of the long axis is fixed by the symmetry but there is an &#x0223c;8 &#x000c5; uncertainty in translation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="N0x328fd80N0x3c7d520" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supplementary data</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="7601965s1.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="N0x328fd80N0x3c7d580" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>supplementary movie</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="mpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="7601965s2.mpg"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Peter Moody for substantial help with the crystallography and Andrey Bobkov for the DSC data.
