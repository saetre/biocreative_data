Pak kinases play important roles in regulating the filamentous actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we describe a function for the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Pak-related protein Pak1p/Orb2p in cytokinesis. Pak1p localizes to the actomyosin ring during mitosis and cytokinesis. Loss of Pak1p function leads to accelerated cytokinesis. Pak1p mediates phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain Rlc1p at serine residues 35 and 36 in vivo. Interestingly, loss of Pak1p function or substitution of serine 35 and serine 36 of Rlc1p with alanines, thereby mimicking a dephosphorylated state of Rlc1p, leads to defective coordination of mitosis and cytokinesis. This study reveals a new mechanism involving Pak1p kinase that helps ensure the fidelity of cytokinesis.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: F-actin, filamentous actin; MBP, myelin basic protein; MRLC, myosin regulatory light chain; Pak, p21-activated kinase; SPB, spindle pole body; YES, yeast extract plus supplements.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The family of conserved p21-activated kinase (Pak) serine/threonine kinases are key downstream effectors of the Cdc42 family of GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Manser et al., 1994</xref>). Pak kinases, like cdc42 GTPase, have been extensively studied and implicated in regulating filamentous actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton and cellular morphogenesis in several organisms. For example, Pak1 kinase activity is essential for cylindrical morphology of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ottilie et al., 1995</xref>), bud morphology in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Weiss et al., 2000</xref>), and hyphal morphology in <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Leberer et al., 1997</xref>). Pak kinases are also important for F-actin organization and turnover in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Manser et al., 1997</xref>) as well as axonal guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hing et al., 1999</xref>) and epithelial polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Conder et al., 2007</xref>) in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.

Pak kinase has also been implicated in cytokinesis in <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>, although the mechanism of regulation of cytokinesis by Pak kinase has not been clarified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de la Roche et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, the fission yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic> has become an attractive model organism for the study of the F-actin cytoskeleton, cellular morphogenesis, and cytokinesis. Two Pak kinase&#x02013;related proteins have been identified in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, of which Pak1p/Orb2p/Shk1p is essential for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ottilie et al., 1995</xref>) and localizes to the cell ends and to the cell division site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Qyang et al., 2002</xref>), whereas the second protein, Pak2p/Shk2p, has been shown to be dispensable for growth and colony formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sells et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Yang et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we uncover a novel role for Pak1p kinase in the regulation of cytokinesis in fission yeast. We provide evidence that, in addition to localizing to the cell ends, Pak1p localizes to the actomyosin ring at the cell division site.

A strain in which the <italic>pak1</italic> coding sequences were fused in frame with the gene encoding GFP was generated. As described previously in a fission yeast strain overexpressing <italic>pak1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Qyang et al., 2002</xref>), wild-type Pak1p was detected at the cell ends of interphase cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A, i</xref>). In cells undergoing mitosis and cytokinesis, Pak1p was detected at the cell division site. To precisely determine the temporal regulation of Pak1p localization to the cell division site, we characterized its localization in cells expressing Sid4p-GFP, a marker of the spindle pole body (SPB) that also served to monitor cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chang and Gould, 2000</xref>). In cells with two closely spaced SPBs, which is indicative of prometaphase, Pak1p signal was still detected at the cell ends (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A, ii</xref>). Interestingly, after prometaphase and before anaphase A, Pak1p relocated from the cell ends to the cell division site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A, iii</xref>). The intensity of the medial signal increased as the cell proceeded through anaphase B (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A, iv</xref>).

In fission yeast, the actomyosin ring is assembled before anaphase A, whereas its constriction occurs after completion of anaphase B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wu et al., 2003</xref>). This medial Pak1p-GFP signal colocalized with Rlc1p-Cherry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B, i</xref>). During actomyosin ring constriction, Pak1p-GFP was detected in the vicinity of the constricting actomyosin ring as well as with the developing septum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B, ii</xref>). In some tilted view, Pak1p-GFP was found to clearly organize into a ring structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B, iii</xref>).</p><p>To further determine whether Pak1p is associated with the actomyosin ring, we examined its localization in &#x003b2;-1,3 glucan synthase <italic>cps1</italic>-191 mutant that is defective in septum assembly at the nonpermissive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Liu et al., 1999</xref>). At 36&#x000b0;C, most cells arrested with an actomyosin ring (Rlc1p-Cherry signal) and Pak1p-GFP were observed to localize at the division site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Similarly, in &#x003b2;-tubulin <italic>nda3</italic>-KM311 mutant at the nonpermissive temperature, Pak1p-GFP was localized at the division site in these prometaphase-arrested cells (42% of the cell population arrested in prometaphase, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 200; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>).

The kinase activity of Pak1p-M460G relative to that of wild-type Pak1p was measured with myelin basic protein (MBP) phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>).

Interestingly, Pak1p-M460G was capable of localizing to the growing zones and to the cell division site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>, 180'), suggesting that maximal kinase activity of Pak1p is not essential for its cellular localizations. Pak1p-M460G was present at the division site in 37% of cell populations (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 200) that represented the prometaphase-arrested cells under these conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>).</p><p>To understand the role of Pak1p function in cytokinesis, we studied the dynamics of actomyosin ring assembly and constriction in wild-type and <italic>pak1</italic>-M460G cells expressing Rlc1p-GFP (actomyosin ring marker) and Sid4p-GFP (SPB marker) by time-lapse microscopy.

First, it was possible that actomyosin ring constriction was accelerated in <italic>pak1-</italic>M460G cells. Second, it was possible that actomyosin ring constriction was initiated earlier than normal in <italic>pak1-</italic>M460G cells. Kymographic analyses revealed that the mean time of ring constriction was similar in wild-type and <italic>pak1-</italic>M460G cells, but the initiation of ring constriction seemed to be earlier in <italic>pak1-</italic>M460G cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, arrows).</p><p>To confirm our analysis that the actomyosin ring constriction was initiated earlier in <italic>pak1-</italic>M460G cells, we synchronized cells in prometaphase using the cold-sensitive <italic>nda3</italic>-KM311 mutant. Under these conditions, <italic>nda3</italic>-KM311 and the <italic>nda3</italic>-KM311 <italic>pak1-</italic>M460G mutants arrested in prometaphase with stable actomyosin rings. Return of the arrested cells to the permissive temperature led to spindle assembly and a synchronous resumption of downstream events of mitosis, such as chromosome segregation and cytokinesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). In <italic>nda3</italic>-KM311 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>), as in wild-type cells, actomyosin ring constriction was largely initiated upon dissolution of the mitotic spindle. In contrast, actomyosin ring constriction in the majority of <italic>nda3</italic>-KM311 <italic>pak1-</italic>M460G cells was initiated when the mitotic spindle was still present (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). Collectively, these experiments established that compromise of Pak1p kinase function led to premature constriction of the actomyosin ring in anaphase cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Coregulation of Pak1p and Rlc1p</title><p>To understand the molecular mechanism underlying <italic>pak1</italic> kinase regulation of cytokinesis, we took a candidate approach to identify potential substrates whose phosphorylation might regulate actomyosin ring dynamics. Mammalian pak1 inhibits myosin II activity by inhibiting myosin light chain kinase and thereby reducing the activating phosphorylation of its myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sanders et al., 1999</xref>). Conversely, a previous study has also shown that mammalian Pak can directly phosphorylate MRLC and activates myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chew et al., 1998</xref>). The amino acids in <italic>S. pombe</italic> Rlc1p that are equivalent to the phosphorylation sites in mammalian MRLC are shown in Fig. S2 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806127/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806127/DC1</ext-link>). The codons for the serine residues 35 and 36 in <italic>S. pombe rlc1</italic> were substituted with those for alanine (<italic>rlc1</italic>-S35AS356A [SA]). <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pak1p kinase, Rlc1p, and Rlc1p-SA were expressed in bacteria and purified. In vitro kinase assays revealed that Pak1p kinase phosphorylated wild-type Rlc1p but not Rlc1p-SA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). We further analyzed Rlc1p phosphorylation in vivo in synchronized early anaphase cells. By isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE analyses, Rlc1p from wild-type cells was resolved into two spots (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, arrowheads) with the smaller spot (nearer to pH 3), possibly a phosphorylated form (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, top). Interestingly, Rlc1p from <italic>pak1-</italic>M460G cells was resolved as one spot indicating lack of protein modification (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, bottom). Thus, Rlc1p is directly phosphorylated either by Pak1 kinase or by another kinase downstream of Pak1 in vivo.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Pak1p phosphorylates Rlc1p in vitro and in vivo, and Pak1p localization to the actomyosin ring is dependent on Rlc1p.</bold> (A) Recombinant Pak1p (GST-Pak1p 98 kD) was incubated with MBP, Rlc1p (GST-Rlc1p 47 kD), or Rlc1p-S35AS36A in the presence of &#x003b3;-[<sup>32</sup>P]ATP.

In <italic>ase1</italic>&#x00394; cells, actomyosin ring constriction (followed using Rlc1p-GFP as a marker) was initiated at least 20 min after ring assembly and nuclear segregation. However, in the double mutant, ring constriction was initiated earlier and before nuclear segregation, leading to a variety of aneuploidy events, including the formation of anucleate cells in several instances. The phenotype is classified into two major types: (a) septated cell with the nucleus displaced to one compartment and (b) septation through the segregating nuclei. Collectively, these experiments suggested that Pak1p by phosphorylating Rlc1p might function to delay actomyosin ring constriction and septum assembly until completion of chromosome segregation and spindle disassembly.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Pak1p kinase and Rlc1p phosphorylation are essential for inhibiting cytokinesis when mitotic progression is slowed down.</bold> (A) The <italic>nda3-</italic>KM311 <italic>nmt1-pak1</italic> strain was grown in YES (&#x0002b;15 &#x003bc;m thiamine to shut off <italic>pak1</italic> expression). After 6-h incubation at 18&#x000b0;C, some cells were fixed and stained with phalloidin Alexa Fluor 488. Actin patches were present at one cell end in interphase cells, indicative of monopolar growth. Other cells were arrested in prometaphase with an actomyosin ring (left).

Pak1p localization is similar to that of Rga8p, a Rho&#x02013;GTPase-activating protein that interacts with Pak1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yang et al., 2003</xref>). It is presently unclear whether the Rho&#x02013;GTPase-activating protein Rga8p might participate in the regulation of cytokinesis as well. Although compromising Pak1p function did not affect the timely assembly of actomyosin rings, actomyosin ring constriction was prematurely initiated in the <italic>pak1</italic>-M460G mutant. We have shown that Pak1p phosphorylates serine 35 and 36 of Rlc1p, the regulatory light chain of fission yeast myosin II. Compromising Pak1p function or Rlc1p function (by replacement of serine 35 and 36 with the nonphosphorylatable amino acid alanine) in cells that are slowed down in anaphase leads to aneuploidy caused by premature ring constriction. However, premature ring constriction was not observed upon compromise of Pak1p or Rlc1p function in prometaphase- and/or metaphase-arrested cells. These observations suggest that at least two mechanisms might exist to prevent actomyosin ring constriction until completion of chromosome segregation. The first mechanism might involve prevention of activation of the septation initiation network in metaphase by high levels of Cdk activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Guertin et al., 2000</xref>). Our current experiments reveal that Pak1p, via Rlc1p phosphorylation, might prevent actomyosin ring constriction in anaphase A and B cells, thereby contributing to genomic stability (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>).</p><p>In metazoans, phosphorylation of the major isoform MRLC at amino acids (equivalent to serine 35 and 36 of the fission yeast Rlc1p) leads to activation of myosin II function and appears to regulate cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yamakita et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Matsumura et al., 1998</xref>). In contrast, our experiments suggest the possibility that phosphorylation of Rlc1p at serine 35 and 36 leads to down-regulation of myosin II function. Although these observations appear to contradict each other, it is possible that other MRLC isoforms might exist in animal cells whose phosphorylation might prevent myosin II activation. Future studies should test this possibility.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title><italic>pak1</italic> plasmids and strains construction</title><p>Pak1p-GFP has its 5&#x02032; start codon replaced with a stop codon, and its 3&#x02032; stop codon is replaced with a six-glycine linker and two copies of Myc epitopes and is cloned in frame to GFP.
