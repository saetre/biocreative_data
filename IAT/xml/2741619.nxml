Genetic polymorphisms of <italic>MDR1</italic> can be associated with Sasang constitutions because Sasang constitutional medicine (SCM) prescribes different drugs according to different constitutions. A Questionnaire for Sasang Constitution Classification II (QSCC II) was used to diagnose Sasang constitutions. Two hundred and seven healthy people whose Sasang constitutions had been identified were tested. Genotype analyses, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and pyrosequencing were used in MDR1 C1236T, and in MDR1 G2677T/A and C3435T, respectively. Significant differences in <italic>MDR1 C1236T</italic> genotypes were found between So-yangin and So-eumin. <italic>MDR1 G2677T/A</italic> genotype also showed significant differences in allele distribution between So-yangin and Tae-eumin.

Diagnosis of Sasang constitutions utilize physical observational categories such as physical appearance and facial features as well as the way of speaking, mental characteristics such as temperament and talent and constant mind, symptomatic observation categories such as healthy state, disease-specific symptoms, major diseases, common symptoms, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>In addition, different drugs are applied according to the Sasang constitution of the individual, and sometimes constitution is diagnosed based on reaction to a specific drug. Differences in the process by which a drug works and produces its efficacy in the body is considered to determine the differences in sensitivity to the drug among the Sasang constitutions and may therefore play an important role in identifying the constitution.</p><p>For this reason, symptomatic observations are used in the form of inquiry or drug-based diagnosis, which evaluates the response after administration of herbal medication and is thought to be most crucial in diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Recently, active research has been conducted on the association of genes and Sasang constitutions for constitution diagnosis using genetic information. This is based on common points between genes and Sasang constitutions such as inherence, lifelong permanence and determination of body shapes and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In a study with 163 subjects from 37 families, to prove that the Sasang constitution was inherited, the correlation between the parents&#x02019; constitution and their children's constitution was examined through Fisher's exact test, kappa coefficient and correspondence analysis. It was reported that the parents&#x02019; constitution, in particular the mother's constitution, was inherited by their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Genes presumed to be associated with the Sasang constitution are angiotensin converting enzyme (<italic>ACE</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), human leukocyte antigen (<italic>HLA</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (<italic>IL-1Ra</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), interleukin-1 beta (<italic>IL-1&#x000df;</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), cholecystokinin (<italic>CCK</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), cytochrome P450 (<italic>CYP450</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), among others. It was reported that the <italic>ACE</italic> gene Type II was associated with So-eumin and Type DD with Tae-eumin. In obese women, the <italic>IL-1&#x000df;</italic> gene was associated with body mass index (BMI), and with Tae-eumin. It was also reported that in the <italic>CCK</italic> gene, the C/T type, one of the variations of promoter 1421, was significantly different among the Sasang constitution groups. Some studies have reported that cytochrome P450, a functional gene associated with the metabolism of various drugs, has different distribution patterns based on the Sasang constitution of the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The multiplex DNA amplification and detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on microarrays are ideal for SNP or mutation detection analysis and can also be applied to Sasang diagnostics in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>The multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene, which is involved in drug transportation, was first identified in 1976 by Juliano and Ling, who showed that P-gp was expressed as an MDR1 phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). P-gp plays a role in protecting the body by discharging toxic foreign substances and metabolic products through bile juice, urine or intestinal lumen and preventing them from accumulating in the brain, testicle or fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The expression of P-gp in the gastrointestinal tract controls the absorption of drugs, and this restricts the transportation of the drug to its acting locus. Consequently the expression of P-gp has a direct effect on <italic>in vivo</italic> drug concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In addition, <italic>MDR1</italic> genetic polymorphism has a considerable effect on the expression and activity of P-gp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>It was reported that <italic>MDR1</italic> genetic polymorphism varies among races. The distribution of MDR1 genetic polymorphism in Asians is different from that of Caucasians or Africans; even among Asians, Koreans show a different distribution of this genetic polymorphism compared with Malaysians or Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Thus, within Koreans, the distribution of polymorphism is likely to be different according to the characteristic of localities or the nature of groups. That is, the distribution may be different among the groups of Sasang constitution, which is an overall expression of mental and physical characteristics.</p><p>The possible reasons for variations in efficacy of drugs based on Sasang constitution are as follows. Genetic variations in drug metabolism may exist among patients. Thus, drug-metabolizing enzymes such as CYP450 may function differently in each constitution. Differences in genes regulating drug transporters such as <italic>MDR1</italic> may also be involved, as this would affect the transport of a metabolized drug to the acting locus. Variations in effects of the same drug due to polymorphism of target receptors or genes involved in signal transduction should also be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>MDR1</italic> gene has around 100 SNPs. Here, we investigated the three major SNPs: C1236T is located in exon 12, G2677T/A in exon 21 and C3435T in exon 26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The present study examined the association of the main polymorphisms of C1236T located in exon 12, G2677T/A in exon 21 and C3435T in exon 26 among some 100 SNPs of the <italic>MDR1</italic> gene with Sasang constitutions. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The locations of the identified polymorphisms (arrows) are indicated in relation to the exon structure of the human <italic>MDR-1</italic> gene and the predicted topology of P-gp.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nep118f1"/></fig></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects and DNA Extraction</title><p>This study was conducted with young and healthy volunteers from March 2004 to December 2006.

To diagnose the Sasang constitution of the volunteers, we used the objective questionnaire, QSCC&#x003b1;. The accuracy of the results of QSCC&#x003b1;, compared with the diagnosis of the SCM specialists, was 70.08% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Although there are some questions regarding the low discrimination accuracy, it is the most standardized and widely used tool for SCM diagnosis until now (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>Because we thought the most crucial part of the differences can be the drug response, we targeted <italic>MDR1</italic>, the drug transporter. We investigated the SNPs and haplotypes of the <italic>MDR1</italic> gene, and examined their association with the Sasang constitutions. There was a report that the first factor determining the expression and activity of P-gp was not SNPs but the haplotype of <italic>MDR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). A haplotype is a set of SNPs, and is inherited in each chromosome. As large-scale experiments became feasible, researchers are introducing the concept of haplotype as a group obtained by analyzing multiple SNPs from many experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Among the SNPs of the <italic>MDR1</italic> gene, this study was conducted on C3435T, G2677T/A and C1236T, which cause important variations in the activity of P-gp and show high frequency among Koreans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>It was reported that, for C1236T genetic polymorphism, the C/C type was more frequent than the T/T type in Caucasians, whereas the T/T type was more frequent than C/C type in Asians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Among the Asian population, the T/T type was shown to be more frequent than the C/C type in Koreans, but then the Koreans showed a relatively higher frequency of the C/T type than the Chinese and Japanese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The results of the present study were similar to other studies on the general distribution of Sasang constitutions in Koreans.</p><p>According to the distribution pattern of the C1236T gene among the Sasang constitutions, the percentage of homozygous C/C type or T/T type was low and that of heterozygous C/T type was high in Tae-eumin and So-eumin. In So-yangin, however, the percentage of C/C type or T/T type was high and that of C/T type was low. In particular, So-eumin showed a far higher percentage of C/T type than that of C/C type or T/T type, and was therefore significantly different from So-yangin, which showed a relatively low percentage of C/T type. This indicated that an individual, whose <italic>MDR1</italic> C1236T genotype was C/T, was more likely to be So-eumin than So-yangin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>The genotypes of G2677T/A SNP are more diverse because guanine can be changed to either thymine or adenine. In particular, the frequency of G/A type changing to adenine was 3% in Caucasians, 6% in Asians, almost 0% in blacks, but as high as around 20% in Japanese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Similar to the report showing that the distribution of G2677T/A was not very different between Koreans and Japanese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), the percentage of the G/A type was as high as over 16% in this study. In addition, when the distribution of the G2677T/A allele was compared with other races, the frequency of the A allele was high in Asians, but lower in Caucasians and Blacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The distribution of the G2677T/A genotype was not significantly different among the Sasang constitution, probably because there were as many as six genotypes. On the contrary, the distribution of the G2677T/A allele was significantly different among the Sasang constitutions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). In particular, Tae-eumin showed a high frequency of the G allele, a wild-type, and low frequency of T and A allele, which are mutant types. Thus Tae-eumin was significantly different from So-yangin, which showed a higher frequency of the T and A alleles. This result was not significant with regards to the genotype, but the frequency of the homozygous G/G type was almost two times higher in Tae-eumin than in So-yangin or So-eumin.</p><p>C3435T polymorphism is known to change the expression of P-gp and its ability to transport drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The activity of P-gp is highest in the homozygous C/C type, moderate in the heterozygous C/T type, and lowest in the homozygous T/T type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). It was reported that the homozygous T/T type showed a lower expression of P-gp and as a result, patients of this type showed a high blood digoxin level after oral administration of digoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The distribution pattern of C3435T reported in the present study was also similar to another report showing that the distribution of C3435T in Koreans was different from that of Caucasian and Blacks and similar to that of the Japanese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The distribution of the C3435T genotype was not significantly different among the Sasang constitutions. Moreover, the distribution of alleles did not show any significant difference among the Sasang constitutions. However, the frequency of the homozygous C/C type was higher in Tae-eumin than in So-eumin or So-yangin.</p><p>When three SNPs were examined at the same time, a total of 11 <italic>MDR1</italic> gene haplotypes were identified. The results of the percentage of haplotypes was supported by another report demonstrating that the percentage in Koreans was different from that of Caucasians and similar to that of Chinese (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Particularly as in Sai <italic>et al.</italic>, haplotype 1236T-2677T-3435T showed the highest frequency in Japanese and Koreans. However, haplotype 1236T-2677T-3435T is quite rare in Blacks and haplotype 1236C-2677G-3435C is found in 43% of the Black population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). It was reported that, in patients with haplotype 1236T-2677T-3435T, the metabolism of irinotecan, an anticancer drug, was relatively slow and as a result renal clearance was low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). When digoxin was administered, haplotype 2677G/3435C including the second most frequent 1236C-2677G-3435C and 1236T-2677G-3435C showed low digoxin concentration. On the contrary, haplotype 2677G/3435T, which was observed rarely in this study, shows higher digoxin concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). <table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>Table 6.</label><caption><p>Frequencies of MDR1 haplotypes in Korean compared with other populations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th colspan="3" rowspan="1">Haplotypes of MDR1 gene<hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">German Caucasian %</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chinese Han %</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Korean %</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">T1236C</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">G2677T/A</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">C3435T</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<italic>n</italic> = 461)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<italic>n</italic> = 165)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<italic>n</italic> = 207)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">41.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">33.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">G</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">G</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">G</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">G</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Reference</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">19</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">This study</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>The haplotype is not only dependent on racial characteristics but is also associated with the activity of the <italic>MDR1</italic> gene. The present study confirmed the existence of significant differences in the distribution of haplotypes between So-yangin and other constitutions. The frequency of the 1236C-2677G-3435C type, which is one of the major haplotypes, was lower in So-yangin than in Tae-eumin and So-eumin, and the difference was particularly significant between So-yangin and So-eumin. Furthermore, the frequency of the 1236T-2677G-3435T type was significantly lower in So-eumin than in So-yangin. Besides, haplotypes 1236T-2677A-3435C and 1236C-2677T-3435T showed a significant difference between So-yangin and other constitutions, but the frequency was too low (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>). In haplotype analysis, as the number of each group was small, the statistical significance was low. Thus, it is necessary to increase the number of subjects and confirm whether the frequency was actually high in So-yangin.</p><p>The results of the present study suggested that the polymorphism of the <italic>MDR1</italic> gene was not an indicator usable in diagnosis of all the constitutions but could be used to specifically distinguish So-yangin from the other constitutions. The <italic>MDR1</italic> C1236T genotype and haplotypes 1236C-2677G-3435C and 1236T-2677G-3435T might be considered beneficial indicators to distinguish between So-yangin and So-eumin among the Sasang constitutions. The <italic>MDR1</italic> G2677T/A gene allele could be used to distinguish between So-yangin and Tae-eumin.</p><p>On the basis of the results of this study, we need to explore the metabolism of medicinal herbs used differently according to Sasang constitution. Recently, a study was conducted on the relationship between the <italic>MDR1</italic> genotype and the incidence of femoral head necrosis as a serious side effect of steroids, which are used as immunosuppressive agents in preventing transplantation rejection in patients who had renal transplantation. Patients with 3435T/T genotype showed high P-gp activity and consequently, low incidence of femoral head necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). In addition, there was a report showing that because the <italic>MDR1</italic> 2677 homozygous variant type showed a low incidence of femoral head necrosis, examination of C3435T and G2677T/A polymorphism before the administration of steroids might be beneficial in predicting the incidence of femoral head necrosis as a side effect of the medication. It is considered necessary to determine the association between the metabolism of medicinal herbs and <italic>MDR1</italic> by applying these methodologies to Sasang medicine, and to increase the sample size and determine whether there are any differences in reaction to or concentration of the drug metabolized by <italic>MDR1</italic> based on the constitution of the individual.</p><p>The present study examined the association between C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T among <italic>MDR1</italic> gene polymorphisms and Sasang constitutions with 207 subjects who were in their 20&#x02013;30s and whose Sasang constitutions were diagnosed. There were statistically significant differences in the distribution of the <italic>MDR1</italic> C1236T genotype between So-yangin and So-eumin. Also, the distribution of the <italic>MDR1</italic> G2677T/A allele was significantly different between So-yangin and Tae-eumin. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the distribution of 1236C-2677G-3435C, which is a major haplotype of <italic>MDR1</italic>, as well as 1236T-2677G-3435T between So-yangin and So-eumin.</p><sec><title>Perspectives</title><p>Although diagnosis of Sasang constitutions is very critical for SCM disease treatment, many of them fail to achieve accordance of diagnosis. The diagnosis need many characteristics of the patient, but surely the final decision is made by the drug response. For consistent diagnosis, we are required to know or expect the response to the main drugs in SCM.</p><p>These results suggest that polymorphisms of the gene <italic>MDR1</italic> affecting drug transporters in the body can be evidence that constitutional differentiation may arise due to genetic differences. It showed a different distribution between the three constitution types and can be considered to have some diagnostic value in constitutional typing. Furthermore, it is necessary to investigate the association between the metabolism of medicinal herbs and the <italic>MDR1</italic> gene, and to increase the sample size and determine whether there are any differences in reaction to or concentration of drug metabolized by <italic>MDR1</italic> according to constitution of the individual.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Korea Science
