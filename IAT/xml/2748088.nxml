Although aerobic growth has its obvious advantages (e. g. high energy efficiency, abundance of oxygen in the atmosphere, etc), bacteria must deal with the undesired consequences from exposure to oxygen and oxidative environments. Oxygen and its derivatives, such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, are often highly reactive and pose a threat to many macromolecules, such as enzymes with iron-sulfur centers, nucleic acids, and lipids. Therefore, bacteria undergoing aerobic growth must be able to sense, respond to, and detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS), and maintain their structural and functional integrities.</p><p>The principle mechanism through which bacteria respond to environmental signals is through two-component and other regulatory systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. At least four global regulatory systems -OxyRS, SoxRS, Fnr and ArcAB &#x02013; are identified to respond to oxygen and its derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. OxyRS and SoxRS systems control the response of bacteria to hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Fnr (fumarate and nitrate reduction) controls the transition from aerobic growth to anaerobic growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Fnr is believed to directly sense oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and regulate at least 100 operons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition to Fnr, the two-component regulatory system ArcAB also regulates the transition of bacteria from aerobic to anaerobic growth and is active under microaerobic conditions. It controls at least 100 operons that are involved in the TCA cycle and energy metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The sensor kinase ArcB undergoes auto-phosphorylation at His292 under anaerobic conditions, and this activation is negatively regulated by the oxidized quinones under aerobic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Activated ArcB undergoes a phosphorelay of His292 to Asp576 to His717, and subsequently activates its cognate transcriptional regulator ArcA by phosphorylating ArcA at Asp54 to repress genes contributing to aerobic metabolism (e.g. citrate synthase and isocitrate lyase) and activates genes necessary for anaerobic metabolism (e.g. pyruvate formate lyase and hydrogenase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Although the function of the ArcAB system in the anaerobic growth of <italic>E. coli </italic>has been well characterized, its function is unlikely to be limited to those required for the anaerobic growth of bacteria. For example, the ArcAB system has been reported to be involved in chromosomal replication, stress responses and aging of bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We have previously reported that ArcA of <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>is necessary for its resistance to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. More recently, ArcA is implicated in the ROS stress response of <italic>Haemophilus influenzae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In this report, we analyzed the role of ArcAB in reactive oxygen resistance of <italic>E. coli </italic>and investigated the mechanism of ROS resistance mediated by the ArcAB two-component system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>ArcAB system is necessary for <italic>E. coli </italic>to resist hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)</title><p>To determine if the ArcAB global regulatory system plays a role in the survival of <italic>E. coli </italic>under stress by reactive oxygen species (ROS), we generated deletion mutants of ArcA (the global regulator) and ArcB (the cognate sensor-kinase of ArcA) in <italic>E. coli </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

The <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>and <italic>&#x00394;arcB </italic>mutant <italic>E. coli </italic>were tested for their growth properties in complete (Luria Bertani broth) or minimal (M9) medium with glucose as carbon source. Overnight culture of each bacterial strain was diluted 1:100 in LB or M9 medium, and the growth of bacteria was measured by the optical density of the culture at 550 nm (OD<sub>550 nm</sub>) every 2 hours for 8 hours and then at 24 hours. This incubation period includes both log phase of growth and stationary phase of bacteria. We found that OD<sub>550 nm </sub>of both <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>and <italic>&#x00394;arcB </italic>mutants appeared to be lower than that of the wild type <italic>E. coli </italic>during the log phase of growth.

Therefore, no gross defect was observed in <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>and <italic>&#x00394;arcB </italic>mutants in spite of lower OD<sub>550 nm </sub>of their cultures.

We have also noticed that the wild type ArcA expressed from a plasmid confers a stronger H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>resistance phenotype than the phosphorylation-defective ArcA. The <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>mutant <italic>E. coli </italic>complemented <italic>in trans </italic>with a wild type <italic>arcA </italic>allele demonstrated higher H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>resistance than the wild type <italic>E. coli </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), while the same mutant <italic>E. coli </italic>complemented with a phosphorylation-defective <italic>arcA </italic>allele has the same H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>resistance as the wild type <italic>E. coli </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>In addition to novel signals and signaling pathways that may mediate the function of the ArcAB system in the ROS resistance, the ArcAB system may also regulate a distinct set of genes under aerobic conditions. Under anaerobic conditions ArcA mostly negatively regulates genes involved in the TCA cycle and electron transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Under aerobic conditions, a microarray study by Oshima <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that expression of a large number of genes in the <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>or <italic>&#x00394;arcB </italic>mutant <italic>E. coli </italic>was altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our results suggest that levels of at least three proteins (flagellin, GltI and OppA) were altered in the <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>mutant <italic>E. coli </italic>both constitutively and in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Our further analysis on the messenger RNA level of <italic>fliC </italic>indicates that the RNA levels are higher in the <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>mutant <italic>E. coli </italic>and corresponded to the protein levels, suggesting that the regulation is likely on the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Oshima <italic>et al</italic>. did not detect a significant alteration in the expression of <italic>fliC </italic>in their microarray analysis, although flagellar synthesis was identified as a system that was affected in the <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>mutant but not the <italic>&#x00394;arcB </italic>mutant <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The discrepancy is possibly due to the differences in experimental conditions (shaking bacterial cultures at 120 rpm vs. 225 rpm) and detection methods (microarray vs. Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase PCR and 2-D gel electrophoresis). Since we detected an elevation of both mRNA and protein levels of flagellin in the <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>mutant <italic>E. coli </italic>(Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), we believe that our observation is valid. The regulation of ArcA on flagellin is likely to be indirect, as we did not detect specific binding of recombinant ArcA protein to the upstream sequence of <italic>fliC </italic>(data not shown).</p><p>Given that the ArcAB system regulates a large number of genes in <italic>E. coli</italic>, its role in the ROS resistance is likely to be complex. We have demonstrated that mutation of ArcA or ArcB did not alter the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>scavenging ability of <italic>E. coli </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), however, the precise molecular mechanism on how ArcA regulates ROS resistance in <italic>E. coli </italic>is yet to be elucidated. ArcA was reported to be necessary for the ROS resistance of <italic>Haemophilus influenzae </italic>due to its regulation of Dps, a ferritin-like small protein that was previously reported to be involved in ROS resistance of <italic>Salmonella </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The mechanism of the ROS resistance mediated by ArcA is likely to be different in <italic>E. coli</italic>, since <italic>dps </italic>is expressed close to the wild type level in the <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>or <italic>&#x00394;arcB </italic>mutant (84% and 99% respectively), and our preliminary microarray analysis with <italic>Salmonella &#x00394;arcA </italic>mutant indicated that <italic>dps </italic>responded normally to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in the <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>mutant (unpublished results). One possible clue on the mechanism of how ArcAB contributes to the ROS resistance of <italic>E. coli </italic>came from our proteomic analysis that showed altered expression of flagellin, GltI and OppA between the wild type and <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>mutant <italic>E. coli </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The constitutive GltI and OppA levels are higher in the <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>mutant than in the wild type <italic>E. coli</italic>, suggesting that the mutant may have a higher need for amino acid transport. In contrast to the GltI and OppA levels in the wild type <italic>E. coli </italic>that increased 6- and 24-fold respectively in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>exposure (possibly due to a higher need for amino acid transport under ROS stress), the level of neither protein in the <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>mutant increased under the same condition (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). A higher level of flagellin in the <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>mutant likely put further constraint on the protein synthesis, and as a result the <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>mutant <italic>E. coli </italic>might have become less fit under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>stress. Our genetic study demonstrating that deletion of <italic>fliC </italic>"rescued" the survival defect of the <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>mutant <italic>E. coli </italic>under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) supports the hypothesis.</p><p>ROS stress conditions induce growth arrest in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Chang <italic>et al</italic>. has reported that in growth arrest induced by either glucose-lactose diauxie, entry into stationary phase, or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment, genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis pathways are down-regulated except those of histidine and arginine biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Recently, Jang and Imlay have shown that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>damages enzymes with iron-sulfur and impairs bacterial metabolism, especially the biosynthesis of leucine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. This down regulation of amino acid synthesis may cause a strain on the protein synthesis of bacteria. Our results indicate that protein synthesis is important for <italic>E. coli </italic>to survive H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment. Chloramphenicol, an antibiotic inhibiting protein synthesis, reduced the survival of both the wild type and <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>mutant <italic>E. coli </italic>after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment, while ampicillin did not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Consistently, amino acid supplementation enhanced the survival of <italic>E. coli </italic>after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This is in agreement with the report by Calioz and Touati that amino acid supplementation facilitates the survival of superoxide dismutase-deficient <italic>E. coli </italic>under aerobic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>Although our results and results from other investigators suggest that protein synthesis and amino acid availability are important for <italic>E. coli </italic>to survive ROS stress and the global regulatory system ArcAB plays a role this aspect of ROS stress resistance, protein synthesis and amino acid availability may be only one aspect of the pleiotropic effect of ArcAB system on <italic>E. coli</italic>, since chloramphenicol-treated <italic>&#x00394;arcA </italic>mutant was still more susceptible than the similarly treated wild type <italic>E. coli</italic>. Further studies are necessary to elucidate more molecular mechanisms that control the ROS resistance mediated by the ArcAB global regulatory system.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The global regulatory system ArcAB of <italic>E. coli </italic>regulate many important functions of bacteria including anaerobic growth, motility, and cell division. Here we demonstrate that ArcAB regulates ROS resistance under aerobic condition, and the signalling pathway of this regulation is distinct from that under anaerobic conditions.

Mutant bacterial strains and sequences of oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.
