We show that enhanced CD45 expression on bone marrow (BM) leukocytes correlates with increased cell motility in response to stress signals. Moreover, immature CD45 knockout (KO) cells showed defective motility, including reduced homing (both steady state and in response to stromal-derived factor 1) and reduced granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilization. These defects were associated with increased cell adhesion mediated by reduced matrix metalloproteinase 9 secretion and imbalanced Src kinase activity. Poor mobilization of CD45KO progenitors by the receptor activator of nuclear factor &#x003ba;B ligand, and impaired modulation of the endosteal components osteopontin and stem cell factor, suggested defective osteoclast function. Indeed, CD45KO osteoclasts exhibited impaired bone remodeling and abnormal morphology, which we attributed to defective cell fusion and Src function. This led to irregular distribution of metaphyseal bone trabecules, a region enriched with stem cell niches. Consequently, CD45KO mice had less primitive cells in the BM and increased numbers of these cells in the spleen, yet with reduced homing and repopulation potential. Uncoupling environmental and intrinsic defects in chimeric mice, we demonstrated that CD45 regulates progenitor movement and retention by influencing both the hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic compartments.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: CFC, colony-forming cell; DC-STAMP, DC-specific transmembrane protein; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FN, fibronectin; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MNC, mononuclear cell; PB, peripheral blood; PYD, pyridinoline; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-&#x003ba;B ligand; SCF, stem cell factor; SDF-1, stromal-derived factor 1; SKL, Sca-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>; Tb.N, trabecular number; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; WBC, white blood cell.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Hematopoiesis is associated with primitive stem cell proliferation and differentiation leading to the production of maturing cells in the BM, followed by their continuous release to the circulation. One of the basic characteristics of immature and maturing hematopoietic cells is their unique ability to migrate between different organs, particularly in and out of the BM, as manifested during both homeostasis and stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>).</p><p>Egress of progenitors and maturing cells from the BM is accelerated during alarm situations that are associated with urgent needs to rapidly cope with physiological demands, such as host defense and repair. This process is termed &#x0201c;mobilization,&#x0201d; and it is induced by different stimulations, including cytokines and inflammatory and chemotherapeutic agents. The cytokine G-CSF is clinically used to induce stem cell mobilization as a source harvested for BM transplantation protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). The migration of circulating progenitor cells back to their BM is termed &#x0201c;homing,&#x0201d; a multistep process in which the immature cells actively cross the endothelium barrier between the circulation and the BM compartment. Homing has physiological roles in adult BM homeostasis and in the course of BM repopulation during stem cell transplantations in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).</p><p>Both mobilization and homing require active navigation and use partially overlapping mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). These complex processes involve an interplay between cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and proteolytic enzymes. Adhesion molecules, including members of the &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 integrins, are crucial for undifferentiated cell retention in their BM niches, maintaining the stem cell pool and function. Breakdown of this anchorage is essential for progenitor cell release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Proliferation and migration of primitive cells are regulated by various cytokines and chemokines such as stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF 1; also termed CXCL12), its receptor CXCR4, and the cytokine stem cell factor (SCF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Proteolytic enzymes, especially metalloproteinases (MMPs), play central roles in various steps of stem cell mobilization and homing. These enzymes cleave different adhesion interactions, extracellular matrix components, and cytokines, which further facilitate cell egress through the mechanical and endothelial barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Recently, we suggested a new regulator of progenitor cell mobilization by demonstrating that bone-degrading osteoclasts play a major role in homeostatic release and selective stress-induced progenitor cell mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). These hematopoietic-derived multinucleated, fused giant cells are involved in bone remodeling processes. Different players regulate osteoclast development, recruitment, and function in their bone resorbing sites. The seven-transmembrane-region receptor DC-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP) was shown to mediate cell&#x02013;cell fusion of osteoclast precursors and the assembly of multinucleated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). In addition, Src kinases were shown to be involved in sealing zone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), and osteoclast motility is regulated by MMP expression and secretion (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). The role of osteoclasts in progenitor cell mobilization involves cleavage of endosteal components such as SDF-1, SCF, and osteopontin, which are regulators of stem cell anchorage and retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Previous studies have introduced the linkage between bone remodeling, regulation of hematopoiesis, and the dynamic nature of BM stem cell niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). However, in spite of extensive experiments, the exact mechanisms and regulators underlying the migration, localization, and retention of hematopoietic progenitor cells have not been fully elucidated.</p><p>All leukocytes, including hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell populations, are characterized by unique cell surface expression of CD45. CD45 is a transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase. It dephosphorylates different sites on Src family kinases, and can serve as both a positive and negative regulator in a cell type&#x02013; and context-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). CD45 was shown to regulate different stages of lymphocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), especially their activation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). However, its potential role in the function of earlier, undifferentiated hematopoietic progenitor cells was not identified. The distinctive expression of CD45 led us to postulate that this phosphatase may regulate fundamental processes of immature hematopoietic cells. Our results show that CD45 has multiple roles in regulating the cell autonomous motility of progenitor cells and retention of these cells in the BM, as well as osteoclast-mediated remodeling of the metaphyseal bone trabecules.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>CD45 expression is dynamically modulated by stress signals</title><p>To evaluate the potential involvement of the panleukocyte CD45 phosphatase in the mobilization and recruitment of immature cells, we tested its expression levels in response to stress signals. G-CSF stimulations significantly increased expression of CD45 by mononuclear cells (MNCs) in the BM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). CD45 up-regulation in the BM was observed in mature leukocytes such as lymphoid CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and myeloid CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells and, moreover, in immature hematopoietic c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> progenitors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Similar results were obtained when mice were stimulated with LPS, mimicking bacterial-induced inflammation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). This increase in CD45 expression on BM leukocytes correlated with their release to the circulation during G-CSF mobilization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). CD45 expression was elevated by 1.3-fold on day 1 and by 1.5-fold on day 3, reaching 1.6-fold on day 5, when both cell mobilization and CD45 levels gained their peak values. Hence, G-CSF treatment led to a gradual increase in the expression of CD45 on BM cells before their egress. Interestingly, we observed in the circulation a reduction in CD45 expression on mobilized cells compared with untreated blood cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). These results reveal that CD45 expression is modulated during cell mobilization, suggesting that dynamic CD45 expression participates in egress from the BM in response to different stress signals.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>CD45 expression is modulated and essential for cell mobilization.</bold> (A&#x02013;D) CD45 expression.

We tested the potential of CD45KO cells to egress from the BM under steady-state conditions and in response to G-CSF stimulations. Importantly, differential BM cell count demonstrated no major differences in the composition of mature cells obtained from WT versus CD45KO mice (unpublished data). As shown by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), we also did not detect substantial differences in the total numbers of circulating white blood cells (WBCs) in untreated CD45KO and WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). However, G-CSF stimulations in CD45KO mice resulted in a delayed and reduced response. A suboptimal protocol of G-CSF, administrated for 3 d only compared with the optimal protocol of 5 d, was tested. After 3 d of injections, we documented a significant reduction (&#x0223c;50%) in the number of mobilized WBCs in the circulation of CD45KO mice compared with their WT counterparts. Of note, in this suboptimal protocol the numbers of mobilized WT cells were already very high, near their peak levels, as documented after 5 d of stimulations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Notably, mobilization of immature CD45KO progenitor cells was also significantly impaired, which is reflected by the frequency of circulating colony-forming cells (CFCs) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Moreover, we found in the peripheral blood (PB) of CD45KO mice lower numbers of primitive Sca-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (SKL) cells (a rare population shown to contain most of the stem cell activity) after 3 d of G-CSF injections (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, G and I</xref>). Progenitor cell proliferation within the BM reservoir is a prerequisite process for cell egress and G-CSF&#x02013;induced mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). We therefore examined the ability of primitive BM cells to expand in vivo in response to G-CSF stimulations. After 3 d of G-CSF treatment, CFCs in the WT BM increased their numbers by 1.5-fold (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>). However, in the CD45KO mice, we first observed that untreated mice have a priori lower numbers of CFCs in the BM. Of note, CD45KO CFCs expanded to a lower extent in response to G-CSF stimulation for 3 d, a time frame in which the number of immature progenitors in the WT BM has already reached a plateau (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>). Importantly, reduced numbers of primitive CD45KO SKL cells were also documented in the BM after G-CSF stimulation compared with their WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 I</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced motility and response to SDF-1 are associated with impaired homing of CD45KO progenitors</title><p>The lower numbers of progenitors in the CD45KO BM may lead to their reduced appearance in the PB after G-CSF treatment. To examine if CD45 is directly involved in progenitor cell motility, we isolated BM subpopulations from CD45KO mice and evaluated their spontaneous and SDF-1&#x02013;induced migration potential. The migration of CD45KO MNCs was significantly reduced compared with WT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), including both spontaneous as well as SDF-1&#x02013;directional migration. Of note, no differences were observed in the expression of CXCR4, the receptor for SDF-1 (unpublished data). MNCs isolated from the BM of G-CSF&#x02013;treated mice exhibited higher motility compared with untreated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). This high motility of G-CSF&#x02013;treated WT cells correlated with their increased CD45 expression levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). However, reduced migration was observed in cells obtained from CD45KO mice despite G-CSF treatment. Importantly, although normal mobilization levels were observed after 5 d of G-CSF administration, CD45KO BM MNCs still demonstrated reduced spontaneous and SDF-1 migration compared with their WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). When CD45KO BM MNCs were allowed to migrate through a fibronectin (FN)-coated barrier, stronger reductions in their migration were observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). These results suggest that together with their intrinsic defects in cell motility, CD45KO cells predominantly have an impaired ability to cross extracellular matrix barriers. This notion was further evident in vivo, as CD45KO MNCs showed reduced homing compared with their WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Next, we examined the motility potential of sorted representative subpopulations that strongly respond to G-CSF: CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes and c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> enriched progenitor cells. These cell fractions were isolated from the BM of WT and CD45KO mice untreated or treated with G-CSF for 5 d. As observed with the MNC population, CD45KO CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes showed reduced spontaneous and SDF-1&#x02013;mediated migration compared with WT CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Similarly, CD45KO CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells demonstrated reduced homing to the BM of the recipient mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Live cell images show that immature WT c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells responded to SDF-1 chemotactic signals by cell spreading and the formation of elongated protrusions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>, left). In contrast, immature CD45KO c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells remained mostly round, forming only short cell protrusions in response to SDF-1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>, right). In vivo homing assays demonstrated the inferior homing of CD45KO c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> progenitors to the BM and spleen, in comparison to their WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>). Interestingly, CD45KO spleen-derived colony-forming progenitor cells also exhibited poor homing potential to the BM and spleen of recipient mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 H</xref>). Additionally, in a functional repopulation assay, CD45KO spleen-derived cells showed a reduced potential to engraft the BM of WT recipients, also showing defects in primitive repopulating cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 I</xref>). These results demonstrate systemic cell autonomous defects in CD45KO cell motility.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Impaired migration and reduced response to SDF-1 by CD45KO progenitors.</bold> (A and B) In vitro migration of MNCs from the BM of CD45KO or WT mice either untreated or treated with G-CSF for 3 or 5 d.

This hyperadhesion of CD45KO cells may further explain their poor motility both in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>CD45 deficiency leads to hyperactivation of the Src signaling pathway</title><p>Several papers have demonstrated the importance of Src kinases, the natural substrate of CD45, in integrin-mediated adhesion in various mature lymphoid and myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). We thus examined the Src phosphorylation status and activity during steady state and in response to G-CSF administration. G-CSF stimulations of WT mice led to a reduction in Src phosphorylation and activity in BM MNCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>). Notably, these modulations in Src were inversely correlated with CD45 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Interestingly, MNCs derived from the BM of untreated CD45KO mice displayed enhanced Src phosphorylation and activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>), and G-CSF stimulations only slightly reduced it in these CD45KO cells. Src family kinases were shown to negatively regulate the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, particularly extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). As <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref> shows, G-CSF treatment activated Erk protein in WT-derived BM cells, suggesting that Src kinase activity is indeed reduced. Interestingly, in the CD45KO BM, where Src kinases are hyperactive, Erk proteins are inhibited, as demonstrated by the low phosphorylation of Erk both in untreated and in G-CSF&#x02013;treated mice. Finally, inhibition of Src proteins in CD45KO BM-derived cells using the PP2 inhibitor, which down-regulates the hyperactivity of Src proteins, increased migration of these CD45KO cells to a gradient of SDF-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 H</xref>). These results ultimately demonstrate the link between CD45, Src kinase activity, and the regulation of motility properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Impaired receptor activator of NF-&#x003ba;B ligand (RANKL)&#x02013;induced progenitor mobilization in CD45KO mice</title><p>Next, we chose to specifically stimulate CD45KO mice in vivo by injecting RANKL, which was shown to activate osteoclasts leading to preferential expansion and mobilization of immature cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). RANKL stimulation in WT mice increased the development of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase&#x02013;positive (TRAP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) osteoclasts along the endosteum of the trabecular bone, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). However, no increase in TRAP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> osteoclasts was observed in the CD45KO bones (unpublished data). We next tested progenitor cell levels in response to RANKL stimulations for 3 and 5 d. Immature WT progenitors and primitive SKL cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>, respectively) were expanded in the BM in response to RANKL stimulation, which was contrary to CD45KO cells. Levels of progenitors in the periphery of WT mice, such as the spleen (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>) or PB (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>), were increased, indicating progenitor mobilization. In contrast, CD45KO progenitors were not mobilized by RANKL stimulation for 3 d, and only at moderate levels after 5 d. Next, deeper investigations concerning the degradation of niche components were taken. We found only minor accumulation of soluble SCF in the PB of CD45KO mice in contrast to their WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>). Close examination of the trabecular endosteum, enriched with stem cell niches, demonstrated that in comparison to the WT BM, the niche component osteopontin was poorly degraded in CD45KO bone-lining osteoblasts after RANKL administration for both 3 and 5 d (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). A broader examination of the entire BM showed a clear osteopontin-degraded product in the fluids of the WT BM after both 3 and 5 d of RANKL treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 G</xref>). However, degradation products were below the detection levels in CD45KO BM fluids, suggesting impaired osteopontin degradation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 G</xref>). These results indicate possible defects in CD45KO osteoclasts, resulting in their impaired response to RANKL and poor release of immature cells from the BM.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>CD45KO mice show impaired progenitor mobilization and endosteal modulation induced by RANKL.</bold> (A) Colony-forming progenitor cells in the BM of WT and CD45KO mice after RANKL treatment for 3 d.

First, we confirmed that mature multinucleated osteoclasts derived from the BM of WT mice express CD45 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, top left), whereas, as expected, CD45KO osteoclasts did not express this molecule (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, bottom left). Next, we observed that CD45KO osteoclasts cultured and developed in vitro demonstrated abnormal morphology (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Appearance of the phosphatase TRAP indicates the maturation status and functional stage of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. TRAP staining of CD45KO osteoclasts grown in vitro showed their inability to acquire the flattened, spread morphology and assemble the typical sealing zone that can be seen as a purple ring in the perimeter of WT osteoclasts. In addition, these CD45KO osteoclasts appeared smaller, with a reduced ability to form multinucleated cells. Transcriptional assessment of DC-STAMP mRNA expression revealed that CD45KO BM cells exhibited reduced expression of this receptor (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>), which may lead to defects in cell fusion and maturation. We tested additional factors involved in osteoclast development and function, and examined expression of MMP-9 and MT1-MMP expressed by CD45KO osteoclasts. Notably, these cells secreted lower amounts of MMP-9 compared with their WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>), implying reduced osteoclast motility and activity. Moreover, G-CSF, which was shown to activate osteoclast development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), induced up-regulation of MT1-MMP in WT osteoclasts, whereas expression of this enzyme in CD45KO osteoclasts remained low, as in the steady state (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>). CD45 deficiency is associated with hyperphosphorylation and activation of its substrate, Src, leading to impaired cell movement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). We therefore assessed osteoclast development in the presence of the Src inhibitor PP2. Src inhibition impaired the development and organization of WT osteoclasts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G</xref>, top), resembling the Src<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Conversely, PP2 treatment restored the normal morphology and sealing zone assembly of CD45KO osteoclasts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G</xref>, bottom). Src activity assay confirmed that treating CD45KO osteoclast precursors with PP2 reduced their hyperactive Src to levels equivalent to WT cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 H</xref>), enabling the formation of CD45KO osteoclasts exhibiting a normal phenotype. These results suggest that the expression and function of CD45 and its downstream target Src in monocyte-derived osteoclasts are required for the regulation of normal osteoclast development.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Defective maturation of CD45KO osteoclasts in vitro involving impaired expression of MMPs, DC-STAMP, and Src kinase.</bold> (A) BM-derived osteoclasts from WT (top) and CD45KO (bottom) mice immunolabeled for CD45 expression (green), and stained for polymerized actin (red) and nuclear DNA (blue).

Accumulation of pyridinoline (PYD) in the mouse plasma reflects an ongoing bone resorption process as a result of osteoclast function. We found lower levels of PYD in the plasma of CD45KO mice, indicating impaired osteoclast resorbing activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). In addition, we tested the levels of plasma osteocalcin as a marker for bone turnover. CD45KO mice demonstrated reduced amounts of osteocalcin in the plasma in comparison to their WT controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). Hence, these findings suggested that bone-remodeling processes are impaired in CD45KO mice, resembling mild osteopetrosis. A three-dimensional &#x003bc;CT scanning of WT and CD45KO mice femurs was applied to analyze the trabecular and cortical microarchitecture. Based on a previous paper showing preferred localization of stem cells close to the bone edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), two regions of interest were determined: the first included 2 mm from the distal metaphysis (region 1), and the second was 1 mm ahead toward the diaphysis (region 2). Various bone morphometric and steorologic parameters, including bone volume and bone mineral mass; trabecular volume, trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular thickness; and the gaps between the trabecules were measured. The most prominent difference was the distribution of femoral trabecules. In WT mice, most of the femoral trabecules were found near the growing plates of the bone edge, in region 1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>, red frame). However, an abnormal pattern of trabecular distribution was observed in the femurs of CD45KO mice, demonstrating a substantially higher number of trabecules in region 2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>, yellow frame). Accordingly, stereological analyses of CD45KO bones showed lower Tb.Ns at region 1 (red frame, 75 &#x000b1; 1.5%) and higher numbers at region 2 (yellow frame, 122 &#x000b1; 11%) compared with the femurs of WT mice. Interestingly, in vivo TRAP staining of bone sections demonstrated higher numbers of CD45KO TRAP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells along the trabecular endosteum, in comparison to their WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Similarly, a significantly larger portion of the CD45KO bone surface was covered with TRAP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>), apparently compensating for their impaired function, as previously suggested in other osteoclast-defective models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Of note, previous studies showed that osteopetrosis and other defects associated with changes in the architecture of the bone are accompanied by alterations in the hematopoietic stem cell pool size and location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). We therefore anticipated that the abnormal bone microenvironment in CD45KO mice is related to altered hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell retention. Despite the regular cellularity of mature BM leukocytes and normal differential counts of circulating mature cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), we identified lower numbers of immature Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 F</xref>) and the primitive SKL subset (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, G and H</xref>) in the BM of CD45KO mice.

To directly dissect these options, we established two sets of chimera models in which CD45KO mice were tested either as recipients or donors compared with WT mice. In the first set of experiments, WT and CD45KO mice were used as recipients for WT donor cells. In this setting, we observed lower engraftment levels of WT donor cells in CD45KO recipients compared with WT recipients (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). This suggested an impaired ability of the CD45KO BM environment to support stem cell maintenance. Next, we studied rapid mobilization by injecting the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, which was shown to induce mobilization without mediating cell expansion in the BM. Our results showed that after AMD3100 administration, WT (normal) donor cells have impaired mobilization in CD45KO compared with WT hosts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>). These findings demonstrated that the CD45KO BM environment failed to facilitate normal mobilization. In the second set of experiments, high cell doses of WT and CD45KO cells were used as donor cells to repopulate WT recipients. In this set the mobilization potential of CD45KO cells in a normal environment was further assessed. In highly engrafted mice, AMD3100 stimulation resulted in only a minor cell mobilization when CD45KO cells served as donors, compared with their WT counterparts, although their BM environment was normal (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>). These experiments suggested that CD45 deficiency results in multiple defects, combining both cell autonomous and environmental mechanisms.</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Defective engraftment and reduced rapid mobilization in CD45KO chimeras.</bold> (A) Percentage of donor-derived WT cells in the BM of WT and CD45KO recipients.

By using the CD45KO mouse model, we investigated two major parameters involved in progenitor motility and location, including intrinsic properties and environmental regulation. First, we revealed autonomous defects in CD45KO cell motility into and out of the BM compartment, including reduced mobilization and homing of mature leukocytes and immature progenitor cell populations derived from different organs. We suggest that CD45 regulates two cellular processes that have key roles in the migration and retention of leukocytes in general, and progenitors in particular: proteolytic enzyme secretion and adhesion interactions. Lower secretion of MMP-9 by CD45KO BM MNCs after G-CSF stimulation implies that CD45 regulates MMP activation, and may thus further explain the reduced egress of CD45KO leukocytes. Corroborating our findings, mouse multiple myeloma CD45KO cells also secrete lower levels of MMP-9, correlating with their reduced invasive capacities compared with CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>).</p><p>BM-derived cells lacking CD45 have increased activation of &#x003b2;1 integrins and hyperinduction of adhesion properties, demonstrating that CD45 is a negative regulator of signaling cascades, inducing cell detachment and release. We found that Src kinase, the CD45 substrate, is a potential target by which CD45 regulates the migration of hematopoietic cells. Indeed, Src kinase inhibition enhanced CD45KO cell motility, demonstrating that Src activity is unbalanced in these cells. Several studies support the involvement of Src kinases in adhesion and motility properties. Src kinases were shown to regulate &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 integrins in different cells and cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Moreover, in mice deficient in members of the Src family, immature, hematopoietic Sca-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells demonstrated increased homing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), and primitive, BM-derived SKL cells showed enhanced G-CSF&#x02013;induced mobilization that was associated with elevated MMP-9 and accelerated breakdown of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). In line with these studies, our results demonstrate the opposite effects when Src is hyperactive because of CD45 deficiency. Still, such fundamental defects in the motility of both CD45KO progenitors and maturing leukocytes strongly suggest that additional pathways are also imbalanced by the lack of CD45 function. This is especially apparent in the defective cell polarization in response to chemotactic signals of CD45KO c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> progenitors. Moreover, SDF-1 is considered as a survival factor for stem and progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Thus, the impaired ability of immature CD45KO c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells to normally respond to SDF-1 stimulation may further explain their inferior retention in the BM.</p><p>Previously, we suggested that interactions between hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with their BM microenvironment are mutual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). We further reveal that CD45 also plays a role in progenitor mobilization by regulating components of the BM microenvironment. Reduced progenitor expansion and release in response to RANKL activation in CD45KO mice was associated with impaired modulation of the stem cell niche regulating components osteopontin and SCF. Osteopontin was shown to negatively regulate and limit the number of endosteal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). The impaired degradation of osteopontin in the endosteum of RANKL-treated CD45KO mice may explain the low numbers and reduced expansion of progenitors and stem cells in their BM. In addition, it was previously shown that shedding of membrane-bound SCF by MMP-9 shifts stem cells from a quiescent to a proliferative state, enabling their release from the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). The impaired resorption activity and the low secretion of MMP-9 by CD45KO osteoclasts may also contribute to the reduced progenitor expansion in the CD45KO BM, a prerequisite step for immature cell mobilization.</p><p>Osteoclasts derived from hematopoietic precursors in the BM of CD45KO mice show abnormal morphology and function both in vitro and in vivo, reflecting mild osteopetrosis. Of note, osteoclasts derived from precursors in the spleen exhibited the same defective phenotype (unpublished data), although the numbers of hematopoietic progenitors were higher in the CD45KO spleens. This demonstrates that the decreased osteoclast numbers are not caused by the lack of progenitor cells but rather an intrinsic defect in osteoclast differentiation. Our investigations further showed that CD45 regulates osteoclast formation via controlling Src kinase activity and DC-STAMP expression. In support of our findings, previous reports showed that osteoclasts derived from DC-STAMP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were TRAP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MNCs exhibiting a reduced bone-resorbing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Interestingly, DC-STAMP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> osteoclasts demonstrated enhanced Src expression, suggesting a link between these two regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Thus, our data propose a role for the CD45&#x02013;Src axis in osteoclast fusion and maturation. In addition, low expression of MMPs in CD45KO osteoclasts showed that by regulating MMP-9 and MT1-MMP expression, CD45 is eventually involved in osteoclast motility and bone degradation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). These defects in osteoclasts may thus explain the poor mobilization observed in CD45KO mice. However, distinguishing between the environmental versus hematopoietic effects using chimera models revealed a parallel and perhaps additive impact of both compartments on progenitor retention and mobilization potentials.</p><p>The abnormal phenotype and activity of CD45KO osteoclasts are associated with lower numbers of trabecules in the femoral metaphysis, a region known to harbor stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Mouse models of severe osteopetrosis exhibit extramedular hematopoiesis, demonstrating lower levels of stem and progenitors cells in the BM caused by several bone structure defects, and higher levels of progenitor cells in the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). CD45KO mice demonstrated a similar phenotype of the primitive SKL pool size and location driven by multiple defects of both the CD45KO primitive cells and their osteoclast progeny. The reduction in CD45KO primitive cells in the BM is complementary to previous findings showing that Lyn<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (members of the Src kinase family) display higher numbers of primitive SKL cells in the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>), demonstrating the central role of the CD45&#x02013;Src cascade in stem cell retention. Our findings indicate that stem and progenitor cells can modulate their CD45 expression and signaling via Src kinase, influencing their retention, survival, and motility. Moreover, CD45KO spleen progenitors, which are not directly influenced by osteoclasts, exhibited poor mobility and repopulation potentials, and an unusual distribution of these progenitors was observed between the spleen and the PB. However, previous studies showed that in normal settings, spleen progenitors reside in equilibrium with the blood, suggesting no barrier between these organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>), as opposed to the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Hence, progenitor accumulation in the spleen may also be affected by the impaired intrinsic ability of CD45KO spleen progenitors to traffic to the circulation. Additional factors may also be involved, including increased survival and/or proliferation of these progenitor cells in extramedullary locations such as the spleen.</p><p>Our results suggest that hematopoietic stem cells and their leukocyte progeny have dual CD45-mediated self-regulation modes: their motility, proliferation, and adhesion are autonomously and dynamically regulated. In addition to stem cell regulation by the niche, functional CD45 is needed for osteoclast development and activity, which indirectly affect hematopoiesis and the progenitor pool size via interactions with the bone and BM stromal cells. This notion of a dynamic cross talk between all components of the system is also supported by a recent study, which shows that primitive signaling lymphocyte activation molecule stem and progenitor cells can directly regulate osteoblast development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). Collectively, our results reveal that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are involved in regulating their own levels and the dynamic BM microenvironment via their osteoclast progeny, which require modulated CD45 activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>All experiments were approved by the animal care committee of the Weizmann Institute.
