We hypothesize that epigenetic misregulation of cancer-related genes could partially account for this predisposition. We have performed methylation microarray analysis of peripheral blood DNA from 14 women with bilateral breast cancer compared with 14 unaffected matched controls throughout 17 candidate breast cancer susceptibility genes including <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic>, <italic>CHEK2, ATM, ESR1</italic>, <italic>SFN</italic>, <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>GSTP1</italic>, <italic>CDH1</italic>, <italic>CDH13</italic>, <italic>HIC1</italic>, <italic>PGR</italic>, <italic>SFRP1, MLH1, RARB</italic> and <italic>HSD17B4</italic>. We show that the majority of methylation variability is associated with intragenic repetitive elements. Detailed validation of the tiled region around <italic>ATM</italic> was performed by bisulphite modification and pyrosequencing of the same samples and in a second set of peripheral blood DNA from 190 bilateral breast cancer patients compared with 190 controls. We show significant hypermethylation of one intragenic repetitive element in breast cancer cases compared with controls (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0017), with the highest quartile of methylation associated with a 3-fold increased risk of breast cancer (OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.78&#x02013;5.86, <italic>P</italic> = 0.000083). Increased methylation of this locus is associated with lower steady-state <italic>ATM</italic> mRNA level and correlates with age of cancer patients but not controls, suggesting a combined age&#x02013;phenotype-related association. This research demonstrates the potential for gene-body epigenetic misregulation of <italic>ATM</italic> and other cancer-related genes in peripheral blood DNA that may be useful as a novel marker to estimate breast cancer risk.</p><p>Accession numbers: The microarray data and associated .BED and .WIG files can be accessed through Gene Expression Omnibus accession number: GSE14603.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the Western world affecting one in 10 women during their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C1">1</xref>). Mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes, <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic>, and, to a lesser extent, <italic>CHEK2</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>ATM</italic>, account for &#x0223c;25% of familial breast tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C2">2</xref>). The remaining 75% of familial breast cancers (BRCAx tumours) and the majority of sporadic tumours are not attributable to known mutations in any of these genes. In bilateral cases of breast cancer (a second primary tumour in the contra-lateral breast), it is believed that the underlying &#x02018;mutation&#x02019; is not limited to the epithelial cells of one breast, but rather is systemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C3">3</xref>). The importance of epigenetic changes in cancer development is now well established; however, the role of epigenetic changes as a mechanism for increased cancer risk is yet to be fully explored. Therefore, we hypothesized that some of the systemic epigenetic changes are either inherited or acquired in the early developmental stages and therefore should be detectable in the tissues other than breast, such as peripheral blood DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C5">5</xref>). Since carcinogenesis induces numerous genetic and epigenetic changes, the study of tumour cells alone cannot distinguish whether epigenetic inactivation of tumour suppressor genes is a cause or a consequence of the neoplastic process in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C6">6</xref>). Identification of epimutations in the tissues and cells that are not affected by the disease process would favour causal association. Therefore, we aimed to identify epigenetic misregulation of candidate genes in the normal peripheral blood cells of cancer patients compared with controls.</p><p>Epigenetics is the investigation of &#x02018;any information that is carried by the genome that is not coded by DNA&#x02019; and includes DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin structure and non-coding RNA-mediated regulation of gene expression and various other genomic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C7">7</xref>). DNA methylation studies in cancer revealed two main types of changes: hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands and hypomethylation of repetitive DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C8">8</xref>). DNA methylation is heritable through mitosis and is copied to the new strand by DNA methylatransferase 1 during DNA replication. Meiotic heritability of DNA methylation states, particularly transposon-associated methylation, has been shown in mice and in plants; however, it is not yet clear whether DNA methylation is heritable through meiosis in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C10">10</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that epimutations are likely to arise somatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C11">11</xref>). Apart from trans-generational inheritance of epigenetic states, single-generation germline epigenetic effects are also possible. During germ cell development, the epigenome is reprogrammed with two waves of demethylation and re-establishment of DNA methylation marks allowing the possibility of errors that could persist in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C12">12</xref>). We have previously shown that the male germline exhibits locus-, cell- and age-dependent DNA methylation differences and that DNA methylation variation is significant across unrelated individuals, at a level that, by far, exceeds DNA sequence variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C13">13</xref>). This has allowed us to hypothesize that epigenetic variation in normal somatic cells, which need not be transgenerational, could be a predisposing factor for cancer.</p><p>DNA methylation alterations have been studied extensively in breast tumour tissues most recently with genome wide analyses revealing hypermethylated as well as hypomethylated loci compared with matched adjacent tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C14">14</xref>). Approximately 100 candidate genes have been reported throughout the literature as promoters hypermethylated at varying frequencies in breast cancers (Pubmeth <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://matrix.ugent.be/pubmeth/">http://matrix.ugent.be/pubmeth/</uri>search.html). For our study, we have selected genes that have either previously been identified as breast cancer susceptibility genes with known mutations in familial cases (<italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2, TP53</italic>) or genes that are frequently hypermethylated in sporadic breast cancers (<italic>ESR1</italic>, <italic>SFN</italic>, <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, <italic>GSTP1</italic>, <italic>CDH1</italic>, <italic>CDH13</italic>, <italic>HIC1</italic>, <italic>PGR</italic>, <italic>SFRP1, MLH1, RARB</italic> and <italic>HSD17B4</italic>). We have used a two-stage design to firstly identify methylation variable positions (MVPs) in peripheral blood DNA and then secondly to test selected sites for an association with breast cancer in a larger sample set.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Microarray analysis</title><p>We performed differential DNA methylation analysis using a methylation-sensitive enzyme-based approach to compare the methylation status of peripheral blood DNA of 14 bilateral breast cancer cases with 14 matched controls. We have designed a custom-tiled microarray covering a total of 4 Mb to completely cover 17 breast cancer susceptibility genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp033/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1A</ext-link>) and an additional 34 genes also captured in the flanking regions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp033/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>). Using the Model-based Analysis of 2-Color Arrays (MA2C) algorithm, we were able to detect 181 significantly variable regions (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) across the 28 individuals, which we have termed inter-individual MVPs. These included 143 intragenic, or gene-body, MVPs and 38 intergenic regions not associated with known gene promoters (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp033/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S2</ext-link>).

To confirm the association of MVPs with repetitive elements, we have calculated the distance from the middle of each peak to the nearest repetitive element for each of the 181 identified loci. This analysis identified 80/181 (44%) of MVPs within 100 bp of the nearest repetitive element and 60% within 200 bp. This distribution is significantly closer to repetitive elements than can be expected by random chance (<italic>P</italic> = 7.39e&#x02013;07, Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP033F1">1</xref>A). The distribution of repeat element type is not significantly different to the distribution throughout the genome. By aligning each gene at the transcription start sites (TSSs) and averaging the MATScores, we were able to generate a general picture of methylation variability over the first 10 kb of genes longer than 10 kb or across the first 5 kb of shorter genes. This reveals very low methylation variability over all gene promoters up to the TSS and a sharp increase in variability over the first 1 kb of intragenic sequence followed by periodic increase and decrease in variability every 2 kb (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP033F1">1</xref>B).</p><fig id="DDP033F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Methylation microarray analysis of 17 genes reveals methylation variability in repetitive elements.

We used bisulphite modification coupled with pyrosequencing assays to map methylated cytosines in the repetitive elements nearest to six MVPs in the targeted region surrounding <italic>ATM</italic>. We first analysed the 14 matched case&#x02013;control paired samples that we performed the microarray analysis on. Pair-wise comparison of methylation percentages confirmed the significant inter-individual variability in each of the loci identified by the microarray as exemplified by ATMmvp2a with 8/14 pairs significantly different (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank sum test) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP033F2">2</xref>B). Combined data from all of the 14 cases and controls revealed no statistically significant differences overall between patients and controls; however, the highest range of methylation across individuals were observed in the intragenic regions nearest the TSSs. The two most variable loci, ATMmvp1 and ATMmvp2, are both 4 kb downstream of the start sites of the genes <italic>NPAT</italic> and <italic>ATM</italic>, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP033F2">2</xref>C). We detected no significant difference in genome-wide methylation as assessed by the pyrosequencing assay for LINE1; therefore, any differences detected are unlikely to be due to overall genome-wide methylation differences. Furthermore, in each of the 14 cases and controls, we detected no methylation of the <italic>ATM</italic> promoter CpG island in the peripheral blood DNA.</p><fig id="DDP033F2" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2.</label><caption><p>Investigation of <italic>ATM</italic> gene methylation.

The LINE1 assay did, however, show inter-individual variability with genome-wide methylation values ranging from the lowest individual at 48% to the highest at 74% (median 56%). We did detect a significant increase in methylation of ATMmvp2b in the bilateral breast cancer patients (range 72.8&#x02013;98.4%, mean 91.4%) compared with control individuals (range 53&#x02013;98%, mean 89.8%) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001686, Wilcoxon rank sum test) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp033/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S3</ext-link>).

methylation particularly between different peripheral blood cell types (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared with B cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C15">15</xref>). Therefore, the small effect (increase in methylation at ATM mvp2b) in patients compared with controls could be due to a larger effect in a small subpopulation of cells within the heterogeneous peripheral blood cell population. We have addressed this question by isolation of B cells, T cells and monocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from two healthy controls and investigating the methylation status of this locus. We show that the methylation of ATMmvp2b does not show cell-specific methylation differences between these three blood cell fractions, and all fractions have similar methylation levels to the whole PBMCs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp033/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S5</ext-link>).</p><p>In order to investigate the relationship between methylation at ATM mvp2b and expression of <italic>ATM</italic>, we screened a large panel of cancer cell lines and observed a similar methylation range as seen in peripheral blood (77&#x02013;99%); however, the distribution of methylation percentages is significantly higher in the cancer cell lines than in the peripheral blood DNA of the patients and controls (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 1e&#x02013;14, Wilcoxon signed rank test) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP033F4">4</xref>A).

It is well established that identification of high-risk patients guiding the use of preventative treatment such as intensive surveillance (e.g. mammography), chemoprevention (e.g. tamoxifen) or prophylactic surgery (e.g. radical mastectomy) can significantly reduce the burden of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C17">17</xref>). Therefore, all additional tools with which we can predict a patient&#x02019;s risk of cancer, such as DNA methylation markers, would improve our ability to identify those at high risk. The difficulty in finding genetic markers of common breast cancer risk has been recently exemplified by a number of extraordinarily large case&#x02013;control studies that have identified only minor increases in breast cancer risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C19">19</xref>). The overall goal of this current study was to screen candidate genes for epigenetic differences in peripheral blood DNA to identify markers of common breast cancer risk. We believe that DNA methylation markers could be more informative, as they are more stable than other candidate biomarkers such as RNA or protein-based markers, and can act as a surrogate for environmental exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C20">20</xref>). The extent to which epigenetic markers can be used for risk assessment is yet to be fully explored.</p><p>&#x02018;Gene body methylation&#x02019; is a recent term describing the DNA methylation that occurs throughout the gene from the TSS, through exons and introns, to the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C23">23</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the level of gene-body methylation has been linked to the level of gene transcription such that gene-body methylation was absent in genes that were not transcribed, was low in genes that were transcribed at low levels, higher levels of methylation in the highest transcribed genes but even higher methylation levels in genes that had intermediate levels of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C22">22</xref>). Gene-body methylation is also more associated with genes on the active X chromosome rather than on the inactive X-chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C21">21</xref>). The association with the transcription of individual genes and gene-body methylation has not yet been investigated in cancer. We have recently suggested that gene-body methylation in the human genome may be associated with intragenic repetitive elements and that altered methylation in the gene-body may be a mechanism of modulating the level of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C24">24</xref>). In the present study, we show for the first time that the methylation of one intragenic repetitive element inversely correlates with the expression of the gene which supports this hypothesis. Although there are numerous examples in the literature showing that active genes have more gene-body methylation levels than inactive genes, all of these studies compare the gene body methylation levels of one gene with another and compare the expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C22">22</xref>). These studies make a distinction between &#x02018;On&#x02019; expression and gene-body methylation compared with &#x02018;Off&#x02019; expression and no gene-body methylation. We suggest from our data that the level of gene-body methylation may be modulating or fine-tuning the level of expression of the active genes. To date, there has been no report looking at the subtle differences in gene-body methylation across samples and associating that with the expression of the same gene in those samples. Therefore, our study is the first report of an association between different levels of gene-body methylation and expression of the same gene.</p><p>How gene-body methylation may alter the gene expression, or alternatively how expression level may affect the methylation level, is still not clear. The mvp within <italic>ATM</italic> that we have identified could be a reporter of a more extended regulatory epigenetic profile at <italic>ATM</italic>, similar to a tag SNP for a region of linkage disequilibrium in DNA sequence variation. Alternatively, this region could be involved in the regulation of unannotated non-coding transcript(s) or antisense transcripts that regulate the sense gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C22">22</xref>). Recent reports have shown a high level of antisense transcription throughout the genome which could be involved in gene regulation, which suggests new levels of understanding of the process of transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C26">26</xref>).</p><p>Our study of the breast cancer susceptibility genes has provided evidence that the regions of inter-individual methylation variability are located within repetitive elements, particularly SINEs (Alu sequences), and that the variability is highest at &#x0223c;1 kb downstream of the TSSs and increases periodically along the gene. We interpret this increased variability as the point in the genome where the methylation along the chromatin is changing from unmethylated at the promoters to fully methylated in the gene-body. We have identified one repetitive element, ATM mvp2b, which is significantly more methylated in the peripheral blood DNA of women affected with bilateral breast cancer compared with matched control individuals. On its own, this is not sufficient to be considered a potential diagnostic test, as there is considerable overlap between cases and controls and the receiver operating curve area under the curve of 0.59 supports this lack of specificity as a diagnostic. However, this may improve in combination with similar markers from the other genes that we have identified, if such markers provide an additive effect. Interestingly, not all genes showed signs of inter-individual methylation variability. For some of the genes, this could be explained by the short length (e.g. <italic>SFN</italic>, <italic>GSTP1</italic> and <italic>HIC1</italic>); however, this is not the case for other longer genes which could represent genes with conserved methylation patterns (e.g. <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic>) compared with other long genes that show high levels of methylation variability (e.g. <italic>CDH13</italic>).</p><p>The ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) mutated (<italic>ATM</italic>) gene is considered a breast cancer susceptibility gene, as female heterozygotes from A-T families have an increased risk of breast cancer and a number of breast cancer families have been identified with germline <italic>ATM</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C28">28</xref>). Although one small study by Vo <italic>et al</italic>. identified increased <italic>ATM</italic> promoter methylation associated with decreased expression in locally advanced sporadic breast cancers, numerous other reports suggest no evidence of promoter methylation of this gene in breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C32">32</xref>). One finding that is consistent is that <italic>ATM</italic> expression is often reduced in breast tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C34">34</xref>). This could be explained by genetic haploinsufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C35">35</xref>); however, our data in peripheral blood DNA and cancer cell lines suggest a novel mechanism of decreased expression mediated by aberrant gene-body methylation, which warrants further investigation in tumour tissues. We propose that if normal tissues of the individual, including mammary epithelial cells, express lower levels of <italic>ATM</italic> owing to aberrantly increased gene-body methylation, then these individuals may be more susceptible to DNA mutations in those cells.</p><p>The biggest risk factor for breast cancer and indeed most cancers is increasing age. The incidence of breast cancer in women doubles for every 10 years until menopause with a relative risk of &#x0003e;10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C36">36</xref>). An association between DNA methylation and increasing age has also been reported, for example increased DNA methylation variability in older twins compared with younger twins and increasing variability with increasing age in familial clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP033C38">38</xref>). However, we have found that the association between the level of methylation at ATM mvp2b and increasing age is only associated in the bilateral breast cancer patients and not in controls. This suggests that the relationship between age and DNA methylation may be more dependent on the phenotype of the individuals, in this case cancer, and may be due to other predisposing environmental exposures that accumulate with age.</p><p>One of the confounding factors which we cannot rule out in this study is the long-term effects of previous therapy in the patients that are not present in the controls. Future studies will need to investigate peripheral blood samples taken before the initiation of treatment preferably in prospectively collected cohort studies to rule out this possibility. However, if therapy accounted for an overall difference in genome-wide DNA methylation, the LINE1 assay for genome-wide methylation and the other unique sites tested (ATM mvp2a) would have detected this, which it did not. Another confounding factor is the effect of tissue-specific methylation. Although we have shown that in two healthy controls there is no evidence for cell-type-specific methylation of this locus, we cannot rule out this possibility in cancer patients. Therefore, this needs to be addressed in cancer patients.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that inter-individual variability in gene-body methylation is associated with repetitive elements and that it is possible to identify regions of significant differences between bilateral breast cancer patients and controls that may be useful as additional surrogate markers for breast cancer risk. This research also demonstrates the correlation between the level of gene-body methylation and mRNA level of a single gene and highlights the potential for gene-body epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. Finally, this work also supports the need to interrogate whole epigenomes, including repetitive elements, using tiling arrays or unbiased next-generation sequencing approaches to investigate the full complement of methylation variability across the genome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Clinical sample</title><p>For the microarray analysis, peripheral blood DNA samples from 14 women with bilateral breast cancer were compared with the DNA samples from 14 age- and ethnicity-matched controls.
