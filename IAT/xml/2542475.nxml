Here, we show that the GTPase-activating protein Gyp7 inactivates the yeast vacuole Rab Ypt7 in vivo. To efficiently terminate Ypt7 signaling, Gyp7 requires downstream assistance from an inhibitory casein kinase I, Yck3. Yck3 mediates phosphorylation of at least two Ypt7 signaling targets: a tether, the Vps-C/homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) subunit Vps41, and a SNARE, Vam3. Phosphorylation of both substrates is opposed by Ypt7-guanosine triphosphate (GTP). We further demonstrate that Ypt7 binds not one but two Vps-C/HOPS subunits: Vps39, a putative Ypt7 nucleotide exchange factor, and Vps41. Gyp7-stimulated GTP hydrolysis on Ypt7 therefore appears to trigger both passive termination of Ypt7 signaling and active kinase-mediated inhibition of Ypt7's downstream targets. We propose that signal propagation through the Ypt7 pathway is controlled by integrated feedback and feed-forward loops. In this model, Yck3 enforces a requirement for the activated Rab in docking and fusion.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: CIP, calf intestinal phosphatase; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; HOPS, homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting; rGdi1, recombinant GDI1; SC, synthetic complete; TBC, Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Ypt/Rab proteins are small GTP-binding proteins that localize to distinct membrane domains where they coordinate vesicle motility, cargo sorting, and SNARE-mediated fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Segev, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zerial and McBride, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pfeffer and Aivazian, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grosshans et al., 2006</xref>).

Nevertheless, only a few Rab GAPs are known to operate on specific Rabs in vivo (as opposed to in vitro), and almost nothing is known about what happens to targets downstream when Rabs are inactivated by their cognate GAPs.</p><p>Important insights into the role of Rabs in membrane fusion have been obtained from cell-free assays of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> homotypic vacuole fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wickner and Haas, 2000</xref>). The vacuole is the terminal endocytic compartment equivalent to the metazoan lysosome. Vacuole fusion in vitro entails four operationally defined subreactions: priming, tethering, docking, and fusion. Priming involves ATP hydrolysis by Sec18 to activate SNAREs for docking and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sollner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mayer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ungermann et al., 1998</xref>). Tethering is defined by formation of adhesive contacts between the participating membranes and is promoted by the vacuolar Rab GTPase Ypt7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haas et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). Docking entails a complex set of subreactions that occur between tethering and fusion. These subreactions require active Ypt7-GTP and its Vps-C/HOPS effector complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rieder and Emr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wurmser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins et al., 2005</xref>). Docking culminates with formation of a trans-SNARE complex, an essential event that probably energizes membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nichols et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jahn et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Assays of purified proteins reveal that the Rab GAP Gyp7 exhibits an in vitro preference for the vacuolar Rab Ypt7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wichmann et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vollmer et al., 1999</xref>). Purified Gyp7, its TBC domain, or the TBC domain of another GAP, Gyp1, inhibit in vitro homotypic vacuole fusion by arresting docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eitzen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). However, it is unclear whether Gyp1, Gyp7, or other GAPs influence Ypt7 function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). We now show that Gyp7 targets Ypt7 in vivo but that Gyp7 cannot efficiently terminate Ypt7 signaling without downstream assistance from Yck3, the vacuolar casein kinase I. Moreover, we find that activated Ypt7 opposes Yck3-dependent phosphorylation of at least two Ypt7 signaling targets. We also show that one of these targets, the Vps-C/HOPS subunit Vps41, interacts directly with Ypt7 and that this interaction is essential for the stable association of the HOPS-tethering complex with Ypt7. Together with previous experiments, our results delineate a signaling pathway that renders the membrane fusion machinery highly responsive to the activation state of an upstream Rab GTPase.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Endogenous Gyp7 regulates vacuole fusion in vivo and in vitro</title><p>Extensive in vitro characterization of the eight <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Rab GAPs has revealed biochemical preferences for specific Rab substrates (Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801001/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801001/DC1</ext-link>), but the in vivo functions of these GAPs are largely undefined. Yeast cells are viable when <italic>GYP</italic> genes are deleted individually, and only a fraction of the knockout mutants exhibit detectable vesicle-trafficking defects, probably because of functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bos et al., 2007</xref>). As an alternative approach, we overproduced each of nine Gyp or Gyp-like proteins in cells. We then performed pulse-chase labeling with the styryl dye FM4-64 to examine vacuole morphology, a common indicator of endocytic trafficking defects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>). Overproduction of Gyp1, Gyp5, or Gyl1 did not cause overt changes in vacuole morphology. Overproduction of Gyp2 and Gyp8 caused enlargement of the vacuole. In vitro, Gyp2 and Gyp8 stimulate GTP hydrolysis on Ypt6, which controls endosomal retrograde traffic, and on Sec4, which controls exocytosis of secretory vesicles. Thus, Gyp2 and Gyp8 may coordinate the inhibition of multiple Rabs within the cell to oppose secretion and retrograde endosomal traffic, shunting membrane to the vacuole. Gyp6, like Gyp2 and Gyp8, has an in vitro preference for Ypt6, but, unlike Gyp2 and Gyp8, it does not stimulate GTP hydrolysis on Sec4. Overproduction of Gyp6 caused accumulation of additional endosomal structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>), suggesting that Gyp6 more selectively opposes endosomal retrograde transport or endosome&#x02013;vacuole fusion, as suggested by previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2004</xref>). Overproduction of three Gyps, Gyp3/Msb3, Gyp4/Msb4, and Gyp7, caused vacuoles to fragment, consistent with reduced vacuole fusion. Gyp3 and Gyp4 are implicated in polarized exocytosis and appear to be functionally redundant, although they have divergent in vitro Rab specificities (Table S1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2003</xref>). In vitro, both Gyp1 and Gyp7 inactivate Ypt7 and inhibit homotypic vacuole fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eitzen et al., 2000</xref>). However, Gyp7 overexpression in vivo caused vacuoles to fragment, whereas Gyp1 overexpression did not (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>). Thus, the in vitro selectivity of a Rab GAP is often, but not always, a reliable indicator of its in vivo functions. Our data suggest that Gyp7, and possibly Gyp3 and Gyp4, are bona fide negative regulators of Ypt7.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Gyp7 regulates vacuole morphology in vivo and in vitro.</bold> (a) BY4742 wild-type <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>&#x02013;harboring plasmids expressing each of eight <italic>GYP</italic> paralogues, one <italic>GYP</italic>-like gene (Gyl1), or two catalytically inactive Gyp7 mutants (<italic>GYP7-&#x00394;TBC</italic> or <italic>GYP7-R458K</italic>) behind a tetracycline-repressible promotor was grown in SC medium with (repressed) or without (expressed) 5 &#x003bc;M doxycycline.

We therefore assessed the in vivo consequences of <italic>GYP7</italic> overexpression or deletion on vacuole morphology in cells grown under various osmotic conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref>). The <italic>gyp7</italic>&#x00394; deletion allele decreased fragmentation slightly but significantly under standard conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref>), whereas overexpression of <italic>GYP7</italic> from a high copy plasmid resulted in severely fragmented or multilobed vacuoles under all conditions, consistent with the idea that Gyp7 negatively regulates vacuole fusion in vivo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>GYP7</italic> in <italic>gyp7</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells also increased vacuole fragmentation compared with wild-type cells. This fragmentation required Gyp7 with an intact catalytic TBC domain. Overexpression of Gyp7 lacking the TBC domain or with a mutated catalytic arginyl residue within the TBC domain (R458K) was without effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>, bottom). These results support the hypothesis that Gyp7 opposes Ypt7 action in vivo.</p><p>To further evaluate the role of Gyp7, we assayed the in vitro homotypic fusion of vacuoles isolated from <italic>gyp7</italic>&#x00394; mutant and <italic>GYP7</italic> overexpressor cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref>). In the standard assay of homotypic fusion, vacuoles are isolated from two yeast strains by equilibrium floatation: vacuoles from <italic>pep4</italic>&#x00394; <italic>PHO8</italic> cells contain inactive alkaline phosphatase, proPho8, whereas vacuoles from <italic>PEP4 pho8</italic>&#x00394; cells lack proPho8 but contain a maturase needed for Pho8 activation. Membrane fusion between the two types of vacuoles results in lumenal content mixing and Pho8 activation, which is then quantified with a colorimetric assay to obtain an index of fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wickner and Haas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Merz and Wickner, 2004a</xref>). Ypt7 inactivation occurs when vacuoles are exposed to hypertonic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brett and Merz, 2008</xref>). Vacuoles isolated from <italic>gyp7</italic>&#x00394; cells were reduced in sensitivity to hypertonic stress; conversely, vacuoles isolated from <italic>GYP7</italic> overexpressors exhibited enhanced sensitivity to hypertonic stress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref>). Together, our results indicate that Gyp7 opposes Ypt7-dependent homotypic vacuole fusion both in vivo and in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Gyp7 inactivates Ypt7p in vivo</title><p>If Gyp7 modulates Ypt7 activity in vivo<italic>,</italic> we would expect that vacuoles isolated from <italic>gyp7&#x00394;</italic> mutant or <italic>GYP7</italic> overexpressor cells should bear different amounts of active Ypt7, and fusion of these vacuoles should exhibit modified sensitivity to Ypt7 inhibitors. To test these predictions, we performed dose-inhibition studies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>) with recombinant GDI1 (rGdi1), a Rab chaperone that inhibits fusion by preferentially extracting inactive Rab&#x02013;GDP complexes from membranes. As predicted, vacuoles isolated from <italic>gyp7</italic>&#x00394; cells were less sensitive to rGdi1 than vacuoles from wild-type cells, whereas vacuoles isolated from <italic>GYP7</italic> overexpressors were more sensitive to rGdi1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>). Similarly, vacuoles lacking Gyp7 were reduced in sensitivity to the recombinant catalytic domain of Rab-GAP Gyp1 (rGyp1<sub>TBC</sub>). In contrast, removal of endogenous Gyp7 did not alter dosage sensitivity to three inhibitors of fusion that do not target Ypt7: anti-Sec17 antibody, which blocks the early priming stage; anti-Vam3 antibody, which blocks SNARE function during docking; and MARCKS effector domain peptide, a late-stage inhibitor that chelates acidic lipid headgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thorngren et al., 2004</xref>). To verify that rGyp1<sub>TBC</sub> inhibits fusion by inhibiting Ypt7 and not some other target (e.g., another Rab) on the vacuole, we used a GTP-&#x0201c;locked&#x0201d; Ypt7 mutant, Ypt7<sub>Q68L</sub>, which exhibits an 85% reduction in both intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vollmer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pan et al., 2006</xref>). In agreement with this result, in vitro fusion of vacuoles bearing Ypt7<sub>Q68L</sub> was 80% less sensitive to rGyp1<sub>TBC</sub> compared with vacuoles from wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 b</xref>). Similarly, we found that the in vivo vacuole fragmentation caused by Gyp7 overproduction was suppressed by the <italic>YPT7</italic><sub>Q68L</sub> allele (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 c</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that endogenous Gyp7 decreases the amount of functionally active Ypt7 on the vacuole.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Gyp7 prevents vacuole fusion by inactivating Ypt7.</bold> (a and b) Homotypic fusion was measured with vacuoles isolated from BJ3505 and DKY2168 wild-type (wt), <italic>gyp7</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>YPT7</italic><sub>Q68L</sub>, or <italic>GYP7</italic>-overexpressing cells (&#x0002b;<italic>GYP7</italic> 2&#x003bc;).

Endogenous Gyp7 therefore modulates the sensitivity of Ypt7 extraction to changes in osmotic strength.</p><p>Three observations indicate that Ypt7 stabilization on vacuoles lacking Gyp7 results from decreased GTP hydrolysis, not from increased nucleotide exchange or an intrinsic resistance of Ypt7 to Gdi1-mediated extraction. First, GTP was not normally added to our cell-free reactions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, a and b</xref>, lanes 1); thus, stabilization of active Ypt7 does not require nucleotide exchange. Second, addition of rGyp1<sub>TBC</sub> resulted in almost complete extraction of Ypt7 under all conditions, indicating that unextracted Ypt7 is not intrinsically resistant to rGdi1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 b</xref>, lanes 2). Third, and most importantly, preincubation of the vacuoles with GTP&#x003b3;S, a poorly hydrolyzable analogue of GTP, almost completely blocked Ypt7 extraction by rGdi1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 b</xref>, lanes 3), indicating that Gdi1 is, as expected, preferentially extracting inactivated Ypt7. These findings were further supported by fusion experiments with rGdi1, rGyp1<sub>TBC</sub>, and GTP&#x003b3;S (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801001/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801001/DC1</ext-link>).

Yck3 localizes mainly to the vacuole, but it could oppose vacuole fusion either directly or indirectly (for example, by altering membrane recycling pathways). The latter possibility was a significant concern because Vps41, the only protein so far reported to be a target of Yck3, has been proposed to have roles in membrane budding as well as fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rehling et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Price et al., 2000</xref>). Yck3 requires ATP to function as a protein kinase, so we reasoned that removal of ATP should mimic the effects of Yck3 deletion. To test this idea, we exploited our finding that the recombinant SNARE rVam7 drives on pathway Rab- and SNARE-dependent fusion, bypassing the usual requirement for ATP and the Sec18 ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Merz and Wickner, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thorngren et al., 2004</xref>).

Comparable results were obtained using rGyp1<sub>TBC</sub> instead of rGdi1 (unpublished data). Together, these results show that under conditions in which vacuolar Yck3 cannot operate, vacuoles from <italic>YCK3</italic> and <italic>yck3</italic>&#x00394; strains have indistinguishable sensitivity to Rab inhibitors. With purified vacuoles, the effect of Yck3 manifests only under conditions in which the kinase can function, indicating that Yck3 must oppose Ypt7-stimulated fusion through immediate action on the vacuole, not through an indirect effect on membrane traffic.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Yck3 functions downstream of Ypt7 on the vacuole.</bold> Vacuoles isolated from BY4742 <italic>pep4</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>pho8</italic>&#x00394; wild- type cells (<italic>YCK3</italic>) or <italic>yck3</italic>&#x00394; cells were incubated with either ATP (a) or rVam7 (b) for 90 min in the presence of increasing concentrations of rGdi1.

The 30-fold greater resistance of in vitro fusion to Ypt7 inhibitors when Yck3 is absent raised the possibility that the main function of Ypt7-GTP is to counteract an inhibitory effect of Yck3. This model predicts that if Yck3 is removed, Ypt7 should not be needed for fusion. Conversely, if other functions of Ypt7 (such as propagating a positive signal through the Vps-C/HOPS complex) are essential, both Ypt7 and its effectors should be needed for fusion in both the presence and absence of Yck3. To test these predictions, we constructed double mutant cells lacking Yck3 and Ypt7, Vps39, or Vps41. We then examined vacuole morphology using FM4-64 dye loading (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 c</xref>). In the absence of Ypt7, the FM4-64&#x02013;labeled vacuolar compartment was fragmented in every cell examined, whether Yck3 was present or absent. We found a similar epistasis relationship in growth assays (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801001/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801001/DC1</ext-link>).

Because the Rab and its binding partners are needed for fusion in both the presence and absence of Yck3, Yck3 appears to function as a modulator of the Ypt7 signaling pathway.</p><p>To test Yck3 function under conditions in which Ypt7 function is compromised but not eliminated, we performed an in vivo version of the in vitro experiment shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 a</xref> by overexpressing <italic>GYP7</italic> in a <italic>yck3</italic>&#x00394; mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 c</xref>).

This can be assayed by immunoblotting because phospho-Vps41 migrates slowly through SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gels. Under standard in vitro vacuole fusion conditions, Vps41 phosphorylation was rapid and quantitative. Vps41 phosphorylation was inhibited, however, under conditions that activate or stabilize Ypt7, an effect readily observed when Gyp7 was absent (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 a</xref>). Under standard reaction conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 a</xref>, 200 mM sorbitol, lane 1), most membrane-associated Vps41 was found in a slow-migrating band (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 a</xref>, &#x0002a;). However, the faster-migrating, nonphosphorylated form (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 a</xref>, o) became more abundant when Ypt7 was further stabilized, either by preincubating the vacuoles with GTP&#x003b3;S (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 a</xref>, compare 200 mM sorbitol, lanes 1 and 3) or by lowering the buffer osmotic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brett and Merz, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 a</xref>, compare 200 mM with 100 mM sorbitol, lanes 1).

The present experiments delineate a pathway that enforces the tight coupling of a membrane docking and fusion machinery to the activation state of its cognate Rab GTPase (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). First, we show that the Rab7 paralogue Ypt7, which controls fusion at the lysosomal vacuole of budding yeast, is inactivated in vivo by a cognate GAP, Gyp7, confirming a relationship previously implied by in vitro assays with purified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vollmer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eitzen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pan et al., 2006</xref>).

Third, we show that the Gyp7 GAP cannot efficiently terminate Ypt7 signaling in the absence of Yck3 in vivo. Fourth, we show that activated Ypt7-GTP acts to block Yck3-dependent phosphorylation of at least two of its own functional targets: the HOPS subunit Vps41 and the Vam3 SNARE.

Moreover, the activated Ypt7 Rab itself opposes Yck3-mediated phosphorylation of Rab signaling targets. When the Rab is inactive, downstream functions are inhibited; when the Rab is active, it prevents inhibitory phosphorylation, and downstream functions are not inhibited. In the absence of the kinase, the Rab's downstream effectors are uninhibited, and even residual Rab signaling is sufficient to promote fusion.</p><p>Obviously, aspects of this working model are tentative. For example, the functional consequences of Yck3-dependent Vam3 phosphorylation are not yet characterized. However, Ungermann and colleagues have identified the site of Yck3-mediated phosphorylation within Vps41 and have confirmed that modification of this site inhibits Vps41 function (Ungermann, C., personal communication). At present, activated Ypt7-GTP is the only signal transducer known to regulate Yck3-dependent phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Ypt7-GTP could oppose Yck3-dependent phosphorylation by directly or indirectly inhibiting the intrinsic activity of Yck3 or by activating or localizing a phosphatase. Alternatively, Ypt7 could shield substrates from the Yck3 kinase through direct binding interactions, a possibility supported by our discovery that Vps41, a Yck3 target, also contains a Ypt7-binding site (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).</p><p>Our data further suggest that a positive feedback loop controls activation of Ypt7 in a manner similar to that described for Rab5, its GEF Rabex-5, and its effector Rabaptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lippe et al., 2001</xref>). Vps39, the Ypt7 GEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wurmser et al., 2000</xref>), and Vps41 are physically associated as subunits of the Vps-C/HOPS tethering complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seals et al., 2000</xref>), and both subunits are necessary for specific binding of the HOPS holocomplex to Ypt7 in the presence of GTP&#x003b3;S (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 c</xref>). Vps39-mediated activation of Ypt7 would generate additional binding sites for HOPS, thereby further stabilizing HOPS at the membrane and allowing Vps39 to engage in multiple cycles of Ypt7 activation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 b</xref>). Studies of Ypt7-regulated protein localization at vacuole-docking junctions provide additional support for the existence of a Vps39-mediated positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). Because Vps41 is needed for stable HOPS binding to Ypt7, we predict that inactivation of Vps41 by Yck3 will terminate this positive feedback, reducing the efficacy of Vps39-mediated Ypt7 activation. Experimental tests of these predictions are underway in our laboratory.</p><p>There are several examples of phosphorylation regulating Rab signaling pathways. The Rab GAP AS160 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sano et al., 2003</xref>) regulates insulin-stimulated exocytosis of glucose transporters. When phosphorylated by Akt, AS160 is inhibited, permitting activation of its target, Rab10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roach et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sano et al., 2007</xref>). Phosphorylation also regulates downstream targets of Rabs, including SNARE proteins, in both yeast and mammals. For example, casein kinase II phosphorylates the synaptic Q<sub>a</sub>-SNARE syntaxin 1A in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirling and Scheller, 1996</xref>). Phosphorylation often inversely correlates with fusion. Yeast cells expressing a Golgi Q<sub>a</sub>-SNARE Sed5 phosphomimetic mutant have fragmented Golgi compartments, whereas cells expressing a phosphorylation-resistant Sed5 mutant have ordered Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gurunathan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weinberger et al., 2005</xref>). Rab effectors are also phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lonart and Sudhof, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lonart et al., 2003</xref>). For example, phosphorylation of the Rab11 effector Rip11 controls its localization on apical recycling endosomes within epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Prekeris et al., 2000</xref>). Finally, the Ypt31/32 Rab GTPases regulate phosphorylation of the yeast R-SNARE Snc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, interactions between Rab signaling and phosphorylation are pervasive.</p><p>A general problem in biological signal transduction is the maintenance of fidelity in circuits that, because they rely on small populations of molecules, operate in a noisy analogue mode. In these systems, negative feedbacks are used to maintain homeostatic equilibria, whereas positive feedbacks can amplify small signals or generate switchlike behaviors. We propose that the Ypt7 signaling pathway incorporates both a positive feedback loop that reinforces Ypt7 activation and a positive feed-forward loop (which uses two negative elements in series) that enforces the requirement for Ypt7 activation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). We propose that this circuit topology increases the fidelity of Ypt7-mediated signaling by suppressing spurious downstream signaling when an upstream signal falls below a specific threshold. This in turn renders the overall pathway more responsive to signals that impinge on Ypt7 by increasing the pathway's signal to noise ratio. Given the commonality of other strategies in small GTPase signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grosshans et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bos et al., 2007</xref>), it is likely that such an arrangement will not be unique to the vacuolar Rab.</p><sec disp-level="3"><title>Note added in proof.</title><p>We have identified conditions under which purified Vps41 binds selectively to Ypt7-GTP&#x003b3;S.
