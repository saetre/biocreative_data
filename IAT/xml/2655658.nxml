The DNA to be sampled is generated as a discrete fragment within cells by the yeast I-SceI meganuclease, and is purified using FLAG-tagged LacI repressor and beads carrying anti-FLAG antibody.

The latest estimate suggests that the genome of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K-12 contains over 1800 promoters that are regulated by nearly 300 different proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Over 800 of these promoters have now been studied by the well-established combination of genetics, bioinformatics and biochemistry, using purified proteins, and it is clear that most regulatory regions are complex with many different proteins interacting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Until recently, rapid identification of all the protein factors binding at a particular regulatory region has been problematic. However, methods that use target DNA molecules to trap specific proteins from crude cell extracts have now been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">4&#x02013;8</xref>). Most of these exploit advances in mass spectrometry that enable identification of subfemtomole amounts of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Our aim in this work was to develop an alternative protocol that would enable rapid isolation, direct from <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 cells, of specific DNA fragments together with attached proteins. We reasoned that this would reduce potential artefacts that might arise when crude cell extracts are incubated with DNA fragments, and would also provide a simple way of detecting changes in protein binding at a particular locus as cell growth conditions change. Hence we describe &#x02018;DNA sampling&#x02019;, in which the target DNA segment is cloned into a low copy number plasmid at a site that is adjacent to multiple operator binding sites for the LacI repressor and between two target sites for the yeast I-SceI meganuclease. Induction of I-SceI expression leads to the liberation of a DNA fragment carrying the region to be sampled, together with LacI repressor-binding sites, and co-induction of bacteriophage lambda Gam protein ensures its stability. We explain how a host-encoded tagged LacI facilitates purification of the fragment together with accompanying proteins that can be identified by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. We describe an experiment in which proteins binding to the promoter that regulates expression of the <italic>E. coli</italic> colicin K gene (<italic>cka</italic>) were sampled either before or after induction with nalidixic acid.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>A derivative of <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strain MG1655 (CGS7740) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) that had been engineered, by the gene gorging method of Herring <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) to express a 3xFLAG-tagged <italic>lacI</italic> gene product was used in this work (D.J.L., unpublished results).

First, the <italic>cka</italic> promoter region from plasmid pKCT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) was amplified by PCR using primers SceI_up and Cka_down, the product was cut with MfeI and HindIII and cloned between the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pRW50, to give an intermediate plasmid carrying an I-SceI site upstream of the <italic>cka</italic> promoter region on an EcoRI-HindIII fragment. Second, PCR, with primers Lac_up and Lac_down and a template given by Peter McGlynn (University of Aberdeen), was used to generate an MfeI-EcoRI fragment carrying five wild-type LacI operators. This fragment was cloned into the EcoRI site of the intermediate plasmid, resulting in a derivative carrying an I-SceI site and five LacI operators upstream of the <italic>cka</italic> promoter region on an EcoRI-HindIII fragment. Third, an I-SceI site was inserted downstream of the HindIII site in this derivative by cloning a HindIII-SacI fragment that had been generated following a PCR reaction with pRW50 as a template and primers SacI_up and SacI_down. The base sequence of all new constructs was checked using the University of Birmingham Functional Genomics Unit.

When cells reached an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6, 0.4% <sc>l</sc>-arabinose was added to induce expression of the I-SceI meganuclease and the bacteriophage lambda Gam protein. After 20 min, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (15 min, 8000 r.p.m., room temperature). Cell pellets were re-suspended in 20 ml of extraction buffer [50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10% sucrose, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 200 &#x003bc;g/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 &#x003bc;g/ml pepstatin] and a Roche Diagnostics protease inhibitor cocktail tablet was added. RNase A (300 &#x003bc;g/ml) and lysozyme (400 &#x003bc;g/ml) were than added and, after incubation at room temperature for 10 min, each mixture was cooled on ice and sonicated for three periods of 30 s.

Dynabeads were collected with a magnet and washed five times with 1 ml of wash buffer [20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20] in 2 ml unsiliconized tubes (Eppendorf). The sampled protein&#x02013;DNA complexes were eluted from the anti-FLAG antibody with 500 &#x003bc;l of elution buffer (0.3 M NH<sub>4</sub>OH, 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0), mixing on a rotating wheel for 5 min, and supernatant was removed from the beads and transferred to a fresh unsiliconized tube. DNA in the supernatant was purified by phenol&#x02013;chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitated and analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels. Proteins in the supernatant were vacuum dried and dissolved in SDS&#x02013;PAGE loading buffer containing 10 mM <italic>tris</italic>(2-carboxymethyl)phosphine&#x02013;HCl (Sigma) at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min.

Quantities and relative stoichiometries of DNA and proteins in the complexes were determined after scanning agarose gels and SDS&#x02013;PAGE gels, that had been calibrated with the NEB 100-bp DNA ladder and Invitrogen SeeBlue Plus 2 protein markers respectively. Bio-Rad Quantity One software was used for quantification of different bands and the presence of LacI repressor in each sample was exploited as an internal reference.

Plasmid pRW902, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, carries a 330-bp fragment with the promoter region of the <italic>E. coli</italic> colicin K (<italic>cka</italic>) gene between the EcoRI and HindIII sites. Our goal was to identify the different proteins that bind to the <italic>cka</italic> regulatory region. To do this, pRW902 was transformed into a derivative of <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strain MG1655 in which the <italic>lacI</italic> gene had been modified to encode a 3&#x000d7; FLAG-tagged LacI repressor. We also introduced plasmid pACBSR-DL1 that encodes I-SceI and the bacteriophage lambda Gam protein, under the control of an arabinose inducible promoter. We reasoned that, after induction by arabinose, a discrete DNA fragment carrying the <italic>cka</italic> promoter adjacent to five LacI repressor targets would be generated, and that it would be stable due to inhibition of RecBCD by the Gam protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Our strategy, outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, was then to use immunoaffinity methods to isolate the DNA fragment together with accompanying proteins, which we would identify using gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Outline of DNA sampling.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp043f2"/></fig></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;C illustrates experiments in which the DNA content of lysates was analyzed after growing cells either in minimal media or in nutrient rich broth. Since the <italic>cka</italic> promoter is known to be repressed by the LexA repressor, and, thus, induced by the SOS response, the experiment was performed either before or after induction by nalidixic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>). Arabinose was added to cells to induce expression of I-SceI and Gam and cells were harvested after different times. The results show that, in each case, after 20 min induction, a linear DNA fragment is generated. The time courses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> suggest that 20 min may be the optimal time for fragment generation by this protocol. In a parallel experiment, the efficiency of DNA cleavage by I-SceI was assayed by comparing cell counts after plating on solid media either with or without tetracycline (recall that pRW902 encodes resistance to tetracycline). These measurements showed that, after addition of arabinose, less than 1% of colonies carry functional pRW902.</p><p>DNA&#x02013;protein complexes were purified using anti-FLAG antibody as described in Materials and Methods section, and DNA in the complexes was analyzed by electrophoresis. The result, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, confirms that the procedure resulted in purification of the 600-bp DNA fragment with five LacI operators and the <italic>cka</italic> promoter region. We estimate that 200 ml of bacterial culture yields &#x0223c;0.2 &#x003bc;g of DNA fragment. SDS&#x02013;PAGE combined with mass spectrometry was used to analyze the proteins in the complexes and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows stained gels of the proteins from samples isolated both before and after the addition of nalidixic acid. As expected, the complexes contain a major band corresponding to the FLAG-tagged LacI and a band corresponding to the LexA repressor. Quantification of the relative levels of protein and DNA in the complex isolated from cells before nalidixic acid treatment suggests stoichiometries of 10&#x02013;11 LacI molecules and four to six LexA molecules per DNA fragment. The analysis also reveals the presence of RNA polymerase in the complex. Addition of nalidixic acid results in a decrease in the relative level of LexA repressor and an increase in the level of RNA polymerase. The complexes contain other proteins at lower levels, including the small nucleoid-associated proteins, H-NS, FIS and HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), Lon protease (87 kDa) and the different subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase (99 kDa, 66 kDa and 56 kDa). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Analysis of proteins in purified complexes.

Recently, chromatin immunoprecipitation has been exploited to identify all the different DNA targets that are bound by any particular protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Here we have developed a complementary approach to attempt to identify all the different proteins that bind at any particular DNA target. The method, DNA sampling, develops a previous study in which a target DNA fragment was inserted into a plasmid, and proteins bound to this target were identified following the purification of plasmid&#x02013;protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In DNA sampling, we exploit a yeast meganuclease to liberate specific DNA fragments, the bacteriophage lambda Gam protein to stabilize the fragments, an epitope-tagged LacI to facilitate the rapid purification of DNA&#x02013;protein complexes, and state of the art mass spectroscopy to identify the proteins. In the experiment described here, we focused on the promoter of the colicin K gene (<italic>cka</italic>) that is known to be strongly repressed by global regulator LexA that sterically occludes RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>). The promoter can be induced by DNA damage and we show that DNA sampling can be used to follow this induction.</p><p>Most of the recently developed methods to identify specific DNA-binding proteins in bacteria use crude cell extracts and immobilized DNA fragments to reconstitute protein&#x02013;DNA fragments, and attempt to mimic the conditions inside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">4&#x02013;8</xref>). Here we used an alternative approach in which we attempt to purify DNA&#x02013;protein complexes that had already formed inside the cell. As a control, we also purified complexes after mixing cells carrying epitope-tagged LacI and pRW902 with an equal quantity of MG1655 cells carrying unmodified LacI. We were unable to detect any unmodified LacI in the purified complexes, and this argues that most of the purified complex-bound protein must be bound to the DNA fragment before cell lysis.</p><p>In principle, the DNA sampling method outlined here could be used to investigate any DNA segment, and should also be applicable to bacteria other than <italic>E. coli</italic>. The pRW902 plasmid derives from the broad host range RK2 plasmid and it is present in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 at six to eight copies per cell. Our experiments show that the 10&#x02013;20 LacI repressor tetramers present per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) ensure a sufficient yield of complexes. We have now run this protocol with a dozen different <italic>E. coli</italic> genome DNA fragments, including coding regions from within genes and have identified two shortcomings. First, samples are systematically &#x02018;contaminated&#x02019; with Lon protease and pyruvate dehydrogenase which appear to bind directly to the affinity labeled beads. Second, gene regulatory proteins whose binding at targets is contingent on small ligands may escape detection. Future refinements exploiting cross-linking and competitor DNA may succeed in improving our protocol. Interestingly, a very recent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) describes the purification of proteins associated with specific genomic loci in HeLa cell chromatin, exploiting hybridization rather than immunoaffinity, and including formaldehyde cross-linking and decross-linking steps.
