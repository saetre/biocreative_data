Cellular responses may not only depend on the chemical composition or molecular properties of the amyloid fibrils, but their physical attributes such as length, width, or surface area may also play important roles. Here, we report a systematic investigation of the effect of fragmentation on the structural and biological properties of amyloid fibrils. In addition to the expected relationship between fragmentation and the ability to seed, we show a striking finding that fibril length correlates with the ability to disrupt membranes and to reduce cell viability. Thus, despite otherwise unchanged molecular architecture, shorter fibrillar samples show enhanced cytotoxic potential than their longer counterparts. The results highlight the importance of fibril length in amyloid disease, with fragmentation not only providing a mechanism by which fibril load can be rapidly increased but also creating fibrillar species of different dimensions that can endow new or enhanced biological properties such as amyloid cytotoxicity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyloid fibril deposits are associated with numerous disorders, including type II diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). These proteinaceous fibrillar aggregates are commonly regarded as the self-assembly end products of peptides or proteins that form by nucleated polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Despite sharing a common cross-&#x003b2; molecular architecture, fibrils of different morphologies and/or superstructural features can be formed, even from the same starting material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Other types of aggregates, including oligomeric species of different sizes (<italic>e.g.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>)), typically accumulate during fibril formation. It has also been shown that mechanical stress can affect the products of fibril assembly, producing fibrils of different dimensions and/or molecular structure even under otherwise identical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>Because of the enormous complexity and heterogeneity in the dynamic equilibrium between different species populated during amyloid formation, the identity of the culprits of cytotoxicity associated with amyloid disease remains far from clear despite a plethora of studies in recent years (for example, Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13 B14">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The species involved in mediating the cytotoxicity associated with many amyloid disorders were initially assumed to be fibrils and fibril plaques that are abundant in diseased tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, numerous recent reports have focused on soluble prefibrillar oligomers as the primary cytotoxic species (for example, Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Despite significant evidence supporting prefibrillar oligomeric species as toxic agents, examples of toxicity associated with fibrils persist (<italic>e.g.</italic> Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This raises the possibility that the determinants of cytotoxicity may not always be associated with the same type of species, and for some amyloidogenic proteins, fibrils themselves or fibril-associated species may possess cytotoxic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Recent studies have shown that A&#x003b2;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN5"><sup>3</sup></xref> fibrils interacting with sphingolipids, gangliosides, or cholesterol, all of which have been shown to associate with amyloid plaques <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), result in the release of cytotoxic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), whereas the assembly process of islet amyloid polypeptide (also known as amylin) fibrils on lipid membranes results in liposome disruption, suggesting fibril-associated toxicity during the fibril growth process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest that fibrils should perhaps not be dismissed as the inert products of amyloid assembly but might provide a further source of toxicity, either directly by interacting with membranes or indirectly by acting as a source of cytotoxic entities.</p><p>How fibrils elicit a biological response may not only depend on their chemical composition or molecular properties, but their physical attributes such as length, width, or surface area may also play important roles, as found for other nanoscale materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). To investigate this possibility, we report here a detailed analysis of the relation between fibril length, quantified using tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM), and the structural and biological properties of amyloid fibrils. Using long straight (LS) fibrils formed from human &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), we show that samples containing these fibrils can disrupt model liposome membranes and reduce cell viability, whereas prefibrillar oligomeric species formed in the lag phase of assembly and fibrillar aggregates with different structural properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) do not. Strikingly, we show that the cytotoxicity displayed by the LS fibril samples is enhanced by reducing fibril length, supporting the idea that the physical dimensions of fibrils can also modulate their cytotoxic potential. The same length-dependent effect is also observed with fibrils formed from lysozyme and &#x003b1;-synuclein, suggesting that reduction of fibril length by fragmentation presents a generic mechanism by which fibril-associated cytotoxicity, <italic>i.e.</italic> cytotoxicity caused by fibrils themselves or by species dynamically associated with fibrils through direct exchange, could be enhanced. These results not only demonstrate the cytotoxic potential associated with fibrillar samples, but more importantly, reveal that fibril breakage can enhance toxic responses in cells, even for fibrils that have identical molecular architecture. Fibril fragmentation therefore poses a double threat in amyloid disease, providing a mechanism by which fibril load can be rapidly increased, as well as a route by which amyloid cytotoxicity may be enhanced. The results may provide a rationale of the varied cellular responses to fibrils of apparently identical chemical composition and suggest that targeting amyloid fibril stability against breakage may be a powerful strategy for developing therapies against amyloid disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Fibril Sample Preparations</title><p>All mechanical agitation experiments were performed by stirring 500 &#x003bc;l of fibril samples in 1.5-ml glass vials, each containing a 3 &#x000d7; 8-mm polytetrafluoroethylene-coated magnetic stirring bar.

For each image, fibril contours were picked out automatically by the scripts to ensure objective analysis. The length of the individual fibrils, as well as the height information of each pixel along the highest ridge of each fibril, was extracted for fibrils that could be unambiguously recognized by the scripts. The resulting distribution of lengths was biased toward shorter fibrils, because longer fibrils are cut off more frequently by image boundaries, by overlap with other fibrils, and by length-dependent differences in surface deposition efficiency of fibrils with different length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). To correct for this bias, the length distribution was adjusted by factoring in an empirical power function obtained by assuming that the average total length of fibrils recognized on each image should be constant (described in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), as expected from the fact that all images are collected on surfaces treated with samples formed from an identical protein monomer concentration, using an identical protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>From the bias-corrected length distributions, weight average lengths (referred to as the average length throughout this report) were calculated.

The kinetic traces of dye release show that the fluorescence signal approaches a plateau after 10 min, which showed less than 100% dye release when compared with liposomes incubated with Triton X-100. Why less than complete dye release occurs is not clear and could be due to a subpopulation of liposomes that are particularly susceptible to dye release, or dye release may be caused by fusion and/or aggregation of liposomes. The fluorescence intensities at 10 min were subsequently chosen as the reporter parameter value for dye release and were recorded and normalized to the signal when liposomes are disintegrated by the addition of 5 &#x003bc;l of a solution containing 20% (v/v) Triton X-100.

In parallel, liposome dye release assays were performed on the same samples to explore the ability of fibrils of different length to disrupt membrane bilayer integrity.</p><p>To assay the ability of the fibril samples to seed fibril growth, fresh protein solutions containing 12 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m monomers were seeded by the addition of 2% (w/w) of each fibril sample from the agitation series, and the initial rate of fibril growth was monitored by measuring the fluorescence of the amyloid-specific dye ThT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>). Previous studies have shown that ThT provides an accurate measure of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m fibril formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The results showed, as expected, that samples subjected to extensive fragmentation are significantly more efficient in seeding new fibril growth than their less fragmented counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>). This response is entirely consistent with an assembly mechanism involving slow nucleation and rapid elongation, as demonstrated for &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m fibril growth under the conditions employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>Because membrane disruption is a potential generic mechanism associated with the cytotoxicity of amyloid aggregates (see review, Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), including aggregates formed from &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), the ability of the fibril samples to disrupt membranes was also assayed by monitoring dye release from LUV formed from 80% phosphatidylcholine and 20% phosphatidylglycerol, within which the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein was encapsulated at pH 7.4 (&#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;). When these liposomes were incubated with each fibrillar sample for 10 min, the fluorescence intensity increased considerably (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.049809/DC1">supplemental Fig. 1</ext-link>), indicating that a substantial proportion of the liposomes was disrupted by the presence of the fibrillar material, releasing the encapsulated dye to the bulk solvent and thereby decreasing the self-quenching of fluorescence of the dye in liposome-encapsulated environment. The efficiency by which the fibril samples cause dye release was found to be increased in samples that have experienced most agitation and consequently have a decreased average length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>D</italic>). Although the initial fibril sample that measures 1.4 &#x003bc;m in average length released only &#x0223c;10% of encapsulated dye, the sample with a measured average length of 366 nm formed by fragmentation for 1,800 min caused a 3-fold increase in dye release over its unagitated counterpart. Thus, despite being indistinguishable in fibril architecture and identical in protein (monomer equivalent) concentration, the samples containing shorter fibrils are better able to disrupt liposome membranes. To further demonstrate the enhanced capability of shorter fibrils to disrupt LUV membranes, an additional experiment was performed in which the dye release caused by a newly fragmented fibril sample agitated for 1,800 min was compared with the dye release capability of the supernatant of exactly the same sample centrifuged at 16,300 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 30 min. Although the majority of the material in the form of longer fibrils was pelleted by this procedure (21% of total protein material remained in the supernatant after centrifugation), the dye release efficiency of the supernatant was only reduced to 51 &#x000b1; 2% of the initial sample. This result is consistent with the long fibrils pelleted by centrifugation being less capable of disrupting the liposome membranes than their shorter counterparts remaining in suspension after centrifugation.</p><p>Taking all the above data into account, the remarkable picture that emerges is that fibril fragmentation not only increases the efficiency of new fibril growth by seeding, but it also enhances the ability of fibril samples to disrupt liposome membranes. Thus, potentially important new or enhanced biological properties can emerge by shortening amyloid fibrils through fragmentation without other detectable changes to their structural organization.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell Viability Reduction in the Presence of Fragmented Fibrils</title><p>To determine whether the enhanced ability to disrupt liposome membranes associated with short fibrils is mirrored in a cellular response, the viability of different cell types to the presence of fibril samples formed with or without fragmentation was determined using MTT assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Three different cell lines, human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), mouse macrophage (RAW 264.7), and human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells, were each incubated with &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m fibrils (12 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> initial monomer concentration) formed under quiescent conditions (LS<sub>Ln</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>) or with precisely the same fibril sample fragmented by vigorously stirring for 3 days (LS<sub>Sh</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>).

All fibrillar samples were bound by the WO1 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>), which recognizes a generic structural epitope in amyloid fibrils, confirming the presence of fibrillar material. By contrast, no binding by the amyloid oligomer-specific antibody A11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) was observed for any of the samples under the protein (monomer equivalent) concentration employed in the MTT assays (12 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) when compared with strong binding to the A11-positive A&#x003b2; oligomers at &#x0003e;5 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>). The exact same samples used for MTT assays were also used in liposome dye release experiments for direct comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). The results of MTT cell viability assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>D&#x02013;F</italic>), from data collected on at least three different days with five replicates within each day show that the cell lines respond differently to the presence of fibril samples in the growth medium, with SH-SY5Y cells showing most sensitivity to the fragmented LS<sub>Sh</sub> fibril sample, whereas the RAW264.7 cells also showed the largest reduction in cell viability in the presence of LS<sub>Sh</sub> fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic>). The viability of HeLa cells was not affected by any fibril sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>F</italic>). Importantly however, for both RAW264.7 and SH-SY5Y cells, cell viability is diminished most markedly when the cells are incubated in the presence of the LS<sub>Sh</sub> fibril sample, whereas considerably less cytotoxicity is associated with its longer counterparts LS<sub>Ln</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic>).

Prefibrillar oligomeric species, up to tetramers in size, have been shown to be populated during the lag phase of the assembly of LS &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m fibrils under the conditions employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). It thus remains possible that the residual presence of such oligomeric species in solution at the end of fibril growth that is undetectable by the oligomer-specific antibody A11 may contribute to the observed effects of fibril samples on bilayer integrity. To investigate this possibility, dye release assays were performed during the course of unseeded fibril growth. In parallel, to determine whether fibril depolymerization can generate species capable of membrane disruption, LS<sub>Sh</sub> fibrils were placed under conditions in which they are unstable, and dye release assays were performed as function of the depolymerization time course.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic> shows the kinetics of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m fibril formation at pH 2.0 monitored by ThT fluorescence. As expected for a fibril growth reaction under agitated conditions wherein fibril fragmentation is a significant secondary process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), a sigmoidal kinetic trace results that has an extended lag phase and a high apparent rate of elongation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic> shows the liposome dye release efficiency during the same fibril growth. The data show that the dye release efficiency closely mirrors that of the ThT trace, with significant membrane disruption occurring only when fibrils are formed as judged by WO1 binding, ThT fluorescence, and negative stain EM. Most importantly, no significant membrane disruption is detected during the lag phase where oligomers are most populated (up to 25% mass of the initial monomers), as demonstrated using analytical ultracentrifugation, mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), and mechanistic modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Further experiments showed that no fibrils are present during the lag phase, when samples were probed with the amyloid-specific antibody WO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>) and imaged using negative stain EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>D</italic>), and no A11 immunoreactivity was observed at any stage during fibril growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>). This excludes the possibility that prefibrillar oligomers are the cause of dye release in this case and instead attribute the presence of species capable of membrane disruption to the time at which LS fibrils first appear. To further confirm that the presence of LS fibrils is responsible for membrane disruption, dye release was also measured during the depolymerization of the LS<sub>Sh</sub> fibrils induced by altering the pH from the acidic pH of fibril growth to neutral pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>E&#x02013;H</italic>). The experiments revealed that the dye release efficiency decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>F</italic>) during fibril depolymerization in a manner that closely mirrors the decrease in the amount of fibrils remaining as monitored by ThT fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>E</italic>), WO1 immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>G</italic>), and negative stain EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>H</italic>). No observable A11 immunoreactivity was detected during the time course, demonstrating that fibril depolymerization does not release oligomeric species that are recognized by the A11 antibody. To rule out the presence of persistent species that are not detected by the A11 antibody as the cause of membrane disruption, size exclusion chromatography was performed on samples containing monomeric &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m, LS<sub>Sh</sub> fibrils, and LS<sub>Sh</sub> fibrils depolymerized for 2 h. None of the samples showed any detectable peaks between the void volume and the peak of monomeric &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m and, more importantly, none of the fractions collected between the void volume and the peak of monomeric &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m were able to cause any dye release (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.049809/DC1">supplemental Fig. 2</ext-link>). Additional control experiments also showed that the presence of liposomes does not affect the rate of fibril depolymerization. Overall, therefore, the data suggest that the disruption of membrane bilayers is caused by the presence of the short fragmented LS fibrils, either directed by fibrils themselves or through species in direct exchange with fibrils that are distinct from prefibrillar oligomers populated in the lag phase of assembly. Because no persistent oligomers were observed during fibril depolymerization, such species are also unlikely culprits of the membrane disruption effects observed.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Fibril formation and depolymerization time course.</bold><italic>A&#x02013;C</italic>, ThT fluorescence (<italic>A</italic>), dye release assay (<italic>B</italic>), dot blot analysis using the WO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and A11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) antibodies (<italic>C</italic>); and negative stain EM of samples taken during agitated fibril growth at 25 &#x000b0;C, pH 2.0, and 1,000 rpm stirring (<italic>D</italic>). <italic>E&#x02013;G</italic>, ThT fluorescence (<italic>E</italic>), dye release assay (<italic>F</italic>), dot blot analysis using the WO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and A11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) antibodies (<italic>G</italic>), and negative stain EM of samples taken during fibril depolymerization at 25 &#x000b0;C, pH 7.4, under quiescent conditions (<italic>H</italic>).

Furthermore, similar to man-made nanomaterials that have been shown to adsorb proteins onto their surfaces (<italic>e.g.</italic> Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), amyloid fibrils may perturb biological functions through unintended surface-mediated interactions with membranes, proteins, or other macromolecules. Because the type and the strength of surface-mediated interactions are dependent on the dimensions of the aggregates, amyloid species of different size may give rise to aberrant interactions of different type or biological responses of different magnitude. This size-dependent complexity may contribute to the variability in pathogenic properties of seemingly identical amyloid aggregates formed by the same polypeptide sequence when assessed <italic>in vitro</italic> and in disease associated with the aggregation of the same protein sequence in different individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of Fibril Surfaces in Determining Their Biological Properties</title><p>We have demonstrated in the present study that LS fibrils of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m formed <italic>in vitro</italic> are associated with cytotoxicity in certain cell types in a manner that is dependent on their average length. The fibril samples were further found to be able to disrupt model membrane bilayers in LUVs in a manner that is also dependent on their average length. Through detailed kinetic analysis, the possibility that toxicity results from residual populations of prefibrillar oligomers that are formed during the lag phase of assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) or from persistent oligomers generated during fibril depolymerization could be ruled out. The combined results therefore suggest that the observed cytotoxicity of the fibril samples is fibril-associated, <italic>i.e.</italic> the fibrils themselves, or species in direct dynamic exchange with fibrils, are toxic to cells. The observed enhancement in cytotoxic response for fibrils of short average length could result from a decrease in fibril-fibril interactions and/or an increase in fibril-membrane interactions.</p><p>The physical consequences of fibril fragmentation are to decrease the length of individual fibrils and to increase the number of fibrillar particles. These changes lead to a decrease in the surface area parallel to long axis of each fibril and an increase in the total surface area of fibril ends. To decouple the contributions of these different features on the biological effects observed, the scaling relationship between the ability of fibril samples to seed fibril growth or to disrupt liposome integrity and the average fibril length was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). <italic>Solid black lines</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> show the total least squares fits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) of a power law function (<italic>y</italic> = <italic>ax<sup>b</sup></italic>) to the initial fibril extension rate or the dye release efficiency <italic>versus</italic> the average fibril length (proportional to the surface area parallel to the fibril axis per fibril). In the case of initial fibril extension rate <italic>versus</italic> average fibril length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>A</italic>, <italic>C</italic>, and <italic>E</italic>), the fit resulted in a scaling exponent, <italic>b</italic> = &#x02212;0.95 &#x000b1; 0.23. Fitting with the exponent fixed at &#x02212;1 did not result in large changes in the quality of the fit. This analysis shows quantitatively that the observed rate of fibril extension is proportional to 1/average fibril length (characterizing the relative number of fibrils, proportional to the total surface area presented by fibril ends). Fibril extension therefore depends on the number of specific extension sites located on fibril ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>E</italic>), precisely as predicted by the nucleated assembly model with monomer addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The same type of analysis with the dye release efficiency data yielded a scaling exponent of &#x02212;0.57 &#x000b1; 0.08, and fitting with the exponent fixed at &#x02212;1 resulted in large systematic deviations between the fit and the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>B</italic>, <italic>D</italic>, and <italic>F</italic>). This result indicates a more complex relationship between dye release efficiency and average fibril length than can be described solely by the increase in the number of fibrils as fragmentation proceeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>F</italic>). The complexity of the relationship between dye release and the number of fibrils is evident, for example, in that the fibril particle concentration of the LS<sub>Ln</sub> sample is less than 10 times lower than the LS<sub>Sh</sub> sample because the average length of LS<sub>Ln</sub> is less than 10 times longer than LS<sub>Sh</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>), yet a 10-fold decrease in LS<sub>Sh</sub> concentration (<italic>i.e.</italic> 1.2 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> instead of 12 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> monomer equivalent of LS<sub>Sh</sub>) does not lead to a corresponding decrease in membrane disruption efficiency, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>. Thus, a sample with long fibrils produces a lower level of membrane disruption under the conditions employed than a sample containing the same number of short fibrils. The data suggest therefore that the surface presented by fibril ends, increased by fibril fragmentation, is responsible for promoting fibril extension and may also affect membrane disruption, whereas the surface along the fibril long axis, which is decreased within each fibril particle by fragmentation, does not notably influence fibril extension but may be involved in membrane disruption.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Analyses of the scaling relationships between the ability of the fibril samples agitated for different length of time to seed fibril growth or to disrupt liposome membranes and the average fibril length.</bold> The weight average length is plotted against the initial fibril extension rate (<italic>A</italic>) or the efficiency of the sample to cause membrane disruption measured by release of carboxyfluorescein from LUVs formed from 80% (w/w) phosphatidylcholine and 20% (w/w) phosphatidylglycerol encapsulated with 50 m<sc>m</sc> carboxyfluorescein (<italic>B</italic>).

This hypothesis was originally pursued because the amount of A&#x003b2; deposits in Alzheimer patients does not fully correlate with cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). This has since been supported by the correlation found between cognitive and memory decline in Alzheimer disease sufferers and the amount of oligomers present and the demonstration of oligomer-linked cytotoxicity in various cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). However, by contrast with these observations, other studies have shown that fibrils may yet cause cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Recent reports have suggested several different mechanisms of fibril-associated cytotoxicity: by fibrils being cytotoxic themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>); by the growth process of fibrillation causing toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>); by fibrils being a source of cytotoxic species that are in dynamic equilibrium with fibril ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>); or by fibrils being a source of cytotoxic species as a consequence of their depolymerization caused by interaction with lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). For all these possible modes of fibril-associated cytotoxicity, fibril fragmentation could represent an important aspect of amyloid disease, with the average length of fibrils presenting an important parameter, in defining the extent of cytotoxicity observed (schematic illustration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). Thus, by enhancing fibril-membrane surface interactions and/or reducing fibril-fibril interactions that may decrease the biological availability and surface activity of fibrils, shorter fibrils could display enhanced fibril cytotoxicity when compared with longer fibrils. In addition, reducing the overall fibril size could increase the internalization of fibrils by cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) and enhance diffusion, resulting in increased biological availability. Similarly, fragmentation increases the quantity of extension-competent surfaces at fibril ends, leading to an increase in the fibril extension rate, as well as increasing the frequency of exchange with soluble species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). In all of these scenarios, decreasing fibril length by fragmentation would have the ultimate response of enhancing the capacity to increase fibril load by seed extension, as well as opening the door to new or enhanced biological responses through alteration of the physical properties of fibril particles.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic illustration of the landscape of fibril assembly and fragmentation (<italic>A</italic>) in relation to the mechanism of fibril-associated cytotoxicity (<italic>B</italic>).</bold> In <italic>A</italic>, an assembly landscape is illustrated by fibril load plotted against fibril length. The intensity of the <italic>red background color</italic> represents the cytotoxic potential. The <italic>thick red arrow</italic> in <italic>A</italic> illustrates a representative fibril assembly pathway that would occur in the presence of fibril fragmentation or where nucleation is rapid relative to elongation, resulting in a rapid formation of fibrils with short length distributions. The presence of these short fibrils could lead to enhanced cytotoxicity through decreased fibril-fibril interactions (<italic>B-1</italic> and <italic>B-6</italic>) and increased fibril-membrane interaction (<italic>B-2</italic>). The increased interaction between short fibrils and membrane surfaces could result in membrane damage and a cytotoxic response by fibrils going through the membrane (<italic>B-3</italic>), growing on the membrane surface (<italic>B-4</italic>), or releasing cytotoxic species (<italic>B-5</italic>). The <italic>thin blue arrow</italic> in <italic>A</italic> illustrates a representative fibril assembly pathway when little fibril fragmentation occurs and where nucleation is slow relative to elongation, which results in slow increase of fibril load and the formation of long fibrils. These long fibrils are likely to be less biologically available through increased fibril-fibril interactions (<italic>B-6</italic>), decreased interaction with membranes (<italic>B-7</italic>), and decreased amount of fibrils passing through the membrane (<italic>B-8</italic>) when compared with their short counterparts. Fragmentation after assembly (either mechanical or via chaperones) shortens the average fibril length and thereby enhances the cytotoxic potential without changes to fibril structure (<italic>blue</italic> to <italic>red horizontal arrows</italic> in <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0520997650008"/></fig><p>Because physical characteristics such as the average length of fibrils influence the cytotoxicity of amyloid assemblies, understanding the mechanistic factors that cause amyloid fragmentation <italic>in vivo</italic> becomes key to understanding amyloidogenicity itself. We have shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) that fragmentation is the primary effect of agitation, which subsequently influences the rate of fibrillation reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) and can affect the morphology of the fibrils formed from monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). It has also been reported that the phenotype strength of prion strains is dependent on the brittleness of amyloid fibrils in yeast, further supporting the biological importance of fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, fragmentation could be caused by direct mechanical stress, thermal motion, or the activity of chaperones such as Hsp104, which has a known ability to fragment fibril samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Because the stability toward fragmentation may depend critically on the cellular environment, chemically identical amyloid fibrils could provide an array of possibilities <italic>in vivo</italic> for varied phenotypic, toxic, and/or pathogenic properties.</p><p>As we have portrayed here using fibrils formed from three different proteins as models of intracellular or extracellular amyloid deposits in disease, fragmentation has a marked effect on the progress of amyloidogenesis. First, fibril fragmentation increases the number of fibril extension sites, hastening the rate of amyloid deposition. Secondly, fragmentation increases the biological availability of fibrillar material and/or increases its interaction with cellular membranes, leading to new/enhanced, deleterious, biological responses. Fibril fragmentation could therefore be a significant generic factor for amyloidosis, providing a double-edged sword by both increasing the fibril load and enhancing the potential for cytotoxicity in parallel. Understanding the changes in biological response invoked by fibril fragmentation will thus become critical in designing therapeutic agents targeting amyloid disease.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by grants from the Wellcome Trust (Grant 075675) and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (Grant BB/526502/1).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="FN2"><label>&#x02666;</label><p>This article was selected as a Paper of the Week.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material" id="FN3"><label><inline-graphic xlink:href="sbox.jpg"/></label><p>The on-line version of this article (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org">http://www.jbc.org</ext-link>) contains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.049809/DC1">supplemental Figs. 1 and 2</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="FN5"><label>3</label><p>The abbreviations used are: <def-list><def-item><term id="G1">A&#x003b2;</term><def><p>&#x003b2;-amyloid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2">&#x003b1;Syn</term><def><p>&#x003b1;-synuclein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G3">&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m</term><def><p>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G4">EM</term><def><p>electron microscopy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G5">FTIR</term><def><p>Fourier transform infrared</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G6">LS</term><def><p>long-straight &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m fibrils</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G7">Lyz</term><def><p>lysozyme</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G8">RL</term><def><p>rod-like &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m fibrils</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G9">WL</term><def><p>worm-like &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m fibrils</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G10">Sh</term><def><p>short form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G11">Ln</term><def><p>long form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G12">MTT</term><def><p>3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G13">ThT</term><def><p>thioflavin T</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G14">TM-AFM</term><def><p>tapping mode atomic force microscopy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G15">LUV</term><def><p>large unilamellar vesicles.</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the members of the Radford and the Homans groups for helpful comments.
