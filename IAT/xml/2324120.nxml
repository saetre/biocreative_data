With an incidence of 1 in 3,500 of the population, inheritance may be X-linked, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive. In many cases, the disease gene encodes a component of phototransduction or allied processes with expression confined to the retina, for example the rod visual pigment (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]), or peripherin-RDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>], but not all RP genes show such a restricted pattern of expression. In particular, mutations in four RNA splicing factor genes underlie some autosomal dominant forms of RP, namely RP9 (<italic>RP9</italic>, OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=607331">607331</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]), RP11 (<italic>PRPF31,</italic> OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=600138">600138</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]), RP13 (<italic>PRPF8,</italic> OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=600059">600059</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]), and RP18 (<italic>PRPF3</italic>, OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=607301">607301</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]). An intriguing aspect to the association of these genes with retinal disease is that splicing occurs in every cell of the body so the genes must have a general housekeeping function, yet the disease pathology is restricted to the rod photoreceptors of the retina.</p><p>Mutations in <italic>PRPF31</italic> are one of the most common causes of autosomal dominant RP, with over 30 mutations reported, including missense, deletion, insertion and splice site alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Whereas mutations in <italic>RP9, PRPF3,</italic> and <italic>PRPF8</italic> are fully penetrant, mutations in <italic>PRPF31</italic> are not, with several heterozygous carriers showing no deleterious visual symptoms and only slightly abnormal electroretinograms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Studies conducted on <italic>PRPF31</italic> mRNA levels in lymphoblast cell lines isolated from family members with either deletion or splice site mutations indicate that penetrance requires the co-inheritance of a low expressing wild-type (WT) allele alongside the mutant allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>], whereas the presence of a high expressing WT allele is protective. The disease phenotype would appear to arise therefore only when the level of WT splicing factor falls below a critical threshold in rod photoreceptors.</p><p>Our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>] has investigated the functional consequences of missense mutations in <italic>PRPF31</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. With missense mutations, the mutant protein is almost certainly produced so the simple answer that the disease arises solely from a haploinsufficiency of splicing factor protein may not provide a full explanation for the disease mechanism. Using a yeast complementation assay, we have previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>] that the introduction of the human A216P mutation into the yeast ortholog <italic>PRP31p</italic> results in reduced growth; the effect of the mutation would appear to be therefore to modify or reduce the activity of the protein rather than to abolish it completely. In addition, the mutant protein appears to be nontoxic in yeast even when highly expressed. Protein localization studies in mammalian cells expressing His-tagged PRPF31 showed mislocalization of the mutant proteins, with a substantial proportion remaining in the cytoplasm rather than translocated to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Further investigations revealed that this mislocalization was unlikely to arise from a deficiency in trafficking of the mutant proteins to the nucleus, but arose rather from an increased tendency for the mutant proteins to form aggregates in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. The consequence of this is a reduction in the levels of PRPF31in the nucleus: an insufficiency of functional protein in the nucleus may be therefore the primary cause of the disease.</p><p>Our original in vivo assays of splicing function in HEK 293 cells using a bovine rod opsin splicing template failed to detect any effect of missense mutations on splicing efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. However, Yuan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>] and Mordes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>] have shown a specific negative effect of two deletion mutations of <italic>PRPF31</italic> on the efficiency of splicing of certain introns in artificial human minigenes, in particular intron 3 of human rod opsin (<italic>RHO</italic>), intron 1 of <italic>RDS</italic> and intron 3 of <italic>FSCN2</italic>. Another study by Rivolta et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>] failed however to find any evidence for a generalized RNA splicing defect caused by various null-type mutations.</p><p>All four splicing genes linked to autosomal dominant RP encode protein factors required for the formation of stable U4/U6 snRNPs and for assembly of the U4/U6+U5 tri-snRNP. Binding of this tri-snRNP to the presplicing complex represents a key step in the formation of the spliceosome proper. PRPF31 binds to the U4 snRNP in the U4/U6 di-snRNP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>] and is thought to form a bridge between the U4/U6 di-snRNP and U5 by binding to the U5-specific PRPF6 (also known as U5&#x02013;102 kD protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. This was confirmed by RNAi studies in which it was shown that knock-down of either PRPF31 or PRPF6 inhibited tri-snRNP formation and led to the accumulation of U5 and U4/U6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we have refined our splicing assay system to examine the effects of the A216P missense mutation in <italic>PRPF31</italic> on several splicing templates that include <italic>RHO</italic> intron 3 in a minigene construct plus two templates that more accurately reflect the real life situation, a full-length human <italic>RHO</italic> gene that includes introns 1&#x02013;4, and a partial rod &#x003b1;-transducin (<italic>GNAT1</italic>) gene with introns 2&#x02013;5. Since any direct effect of splicing factor mutations on splicing efficiency would most likely act via interactions with other components of the spliceosome, we have examined the interaction via pull-down assays of WT and mutant PRPF31 with PRPF6, the other protein component of the tri-snRNP not yet implicated in RP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs for splicing assays</title><p>For the rod opsin minigene assays, an exon 3 to exon 4 fragment (E3-E4) from the human <italic>RHO</italic> was amplified from human genomic DNA using <italic>Nhe</italic>I- and <italic>Cla</italic>I-tagged forward and reverse primers (5&#x02032;-GCC GGC TAG CAT GTA CAT CCC CGA GGG CCT G-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CGG CAT CGA TTC ACT TGT TCA TCA TGA TAT AGA TGA C-3&#x02032;, respectively) and KOD (Thermococcus kodakaraensis) polymerase (Novagen, Nottingham, UK).

These cells also express WT PRPF31 (as well as all the other components of the spliceosome) endogenously. The rationale of the experiment is that the high level of expression of the exogenous splicing factor will compete with the endogenous splicing factor for incorporation into the spliceosome and thus reveal any deleterious effects of the mutations. However, this means that the assays can detect only dominant effects of the mutations and not effects due to insufficiency.</p><p>Assays were conducted by transiently expressing PRPF31 protein (WT or mutant) plus a splicing template in HEK 293T cells, extracting total RNA from the cells, and performing RT&#x02013;PCR to determine the relative quantities of spliced and unspliced RNA products derived from the exogenous splicing template. Previous assays of PRPF31 splicing activity have relied on cotransfection of the cells with two plasmids: one expressing the splicing template and the other PRPF31 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. This has the drawback that an undefined proportion of the transfected cells will have taken up the splicing template plasmid alone, giving rise to a background of RNA products that have been spliced using only endogenous WT PRPF31. To ensure that all cells expressing the splicing template were also expressing the exogenous PRPF31, plasmid constructs were generated in the pTandem-1 mammalian dual expression vector, which is designed for the coexpression of two open reading frames from a single bicistronic RNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Splicing assays using a human rod opsin RHO intron 3 minigene</title><p>A minigene similar to that described by Yuan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>] was constructed that contained a 522 bp sequence amplified across <italic>RHO</italic> exon 3 to exon 4 of human genomic DNA. When pTandem constructs containing this minigene were used to transfect HEK 293T cells, both spliced (406 bp) and unspliced (522 bp) products were generated, indicating inefficient splicing of intron 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 4). The splicing efficiency was estimated as the ratio of band fluorescence (after staining with ethidium bromide) for spliced versus total (spliced + unspliced) transcript, with a correction for the relative fluorescence of different size fragments. Splicing efficiency measured in control cells expressing the minigene only, where only the endogenous splicing factor is present, was not affected by addition of exogenous WT PRPF31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 2), but splicing efficiency was reduced by the presence of A216P mutant PRPF31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 3). The means&#x000b1;standard error of measurements obtained from four replicate transfections for each experiment with either untagged and His-tagged PRPF31 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>. For untagged and tagged PRPF31, therefore, the overall levels of splicing efficiency are similar, indicating that the presence of a His-tag on the exogenous PRPF31 does not affect its splicing function.

Asterisks (*) indicate the size of full-length GST-PRPF6N, GST-PRPF6M, and GST-PRPF6C respectively. Note that the faint band in the upper panel for the pull-down assay with GST-PRPF6N is too small for PRPF31-His. Negative controls show absence of nonspecific binding of His-tagged PRPF31 to the beads and to GST tag. Quantification of the WT and mutant PRPF31 bands gave ratios of mutant:WT of 4.2&#x000b1;1.4 (for PRPF6M) and 2.1&#x000b1;0.5 (for PRPF6C).

RT&#x02013;PCR was then performed on RNA from transfected cells using primer pairs designed to amplify each intron separately. In contrast to the result with the minigene, the efficiency of splicing of intron 3 with WT exogenous splicing factor was substantially greater, approaching a ratio of 1 for spliced template compared to total template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). When the A216P mutant PRPF31 was used, there was no reduction in splicing efficiency. Results for introns 1, 2, and 4 similarly showed that the cells were able to splice these introns completely even in the presence of mutant PRPF31.</p></sec><sec><title>Splicing efficiency of human rod opsin intron 3 in human retinal tissue</title><p>To assess whether the splicing of <italic>RHO</italic> intron 3 was a limiting factor in the production of fully processed <italic>RHO</italic> mRNA in photoreceptors, we generated PCR-amplified fragments using an exon 3 forward and exon 4 reverse primer pair from the <italic>RHO</italic> transcript in mRNA obtained from human retinal tissue. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>, no unspliced product was obtained, similar to our experiments with the full-length <italic>RHO</italic> template, indicating that the latter splicing assays may model the situation in rod photoreceptor cells more closely than assays with minigenes.</p></sec><sec><title>Splicing assays using partial GNAT1 template</title><p>It has been suggested that small introns may be spliced less efficiently than larger introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>].

We therefore generated splicing constructs containing a partial gene of <italic>GNAT1</italic> that comprised exons 2 to 6 and intervening introns, representing approximately one-third of the genomic sequence. Splicing assays using these constructs indicated that introns 3 and 5 are inefficiently spliced. However, no difference in splicing efficiency was detected when WT or A216P mutant PRPF31 was co-expressed (results for intron 3 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="f3" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Role of PRPF31 in pre-mRNA splicing. PRPF31 is a splicing factor specific to the U4/U6 snRNP, and its primary role is to recruit and physically tether U5 to U4/U6 to yield the U4/U6+U5 tri-snRNP. This involves an interaction between PRPF31 and the U5-specific splicing factor PRPF6. Once incorporated into the spliceosomal complex B, activation involves loss of U1 and U4 and all tri-snRNP associated proteins, including PRPF31 and PRPF6. The mutant PRPF31 proteins are predicted to inhibit this activation step (marked with crosses) and prevent recycling of spliceosomal components for future splicing events.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mv-v14-683-f3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Interaction of wild-type and mutant PRPF31 with PRPF6</title><p>Formation of the U4/U6+U5 tri-snRNP component of the spliceosome involves an interaction between PRPF31 (a component of U4/U6) and PRPF6 (a component of U5) as demonstrated by biochemical pull-down experiments and yeast two-hybrid studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. The PRPF6 protein contains an N-terminal domain followed by several repeat motifs of loose consensus classified as HAT domains, a feature present in many RNA binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Pfam analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>] identified 9 such motifs. The interaction of PRPF6 with PRPF31 was initially reported to involve the C-terminal HAT repeats only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>] but has more recently been shown to involve other HAT repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we expressed PRPF6 protein as three separate domains comprising residues 1&#x02013;307 (PRPF6N), 307&#x02013;607 (PRPF6M, HAT domains 1&#x02013;5 according to Pfam analysis) and 607&#x02013;941 (PRPF6C, HAT domains 6&#x02013;9 according to Pfam analysis), together with N-terminal GST tags. Pull-down experiments with His-tagged WT PRPF31 indicated interactions with PRPF6M as well as PRPF6C, but not with PRPF6N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>), confirming previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Quantitative experiments using equivalent quantities of purified WT and mutant PRPF31 proteins indicated that the interaction of both PRPF6M and PRPF6C was substantially stronger with mutant than with WT PRPF31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results presented in this study demonstrate that the A216P missense mutation in <italic>PRPF31</italic> has a dominant deleterious effect on the splicing of <italic>RHO</italic> intron 3 transcribed from a minigene in transfected mammalian cells. Using a similar minigene assay, Yuan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>] reported a comparable deleterious effect in cells expressing truncated PRPF31 proteins based on two pathogenic frameshift mutations (RP11 families SP117 and AD5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]). However, unlike the missense mutations, where mutant proteins will almost certainly be expressed in the cells of affected patients, such truncated proteins may either be rapidly degraded or not produced due to nonsense mediated decay (NMD). This latter process results in the rapid removal of mutant transcripts that contain a premature termination codon (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]).</p><p>The results of the pull-down assays described here provide a possible explanation for the dominant deleterious effect of the missense mutation on function. Our results show that the A216P mutation results in a stronger interaction between the PRPF31 and HAT-motifs in PRPF6. This will stabilize the U4/U6+U5 snRNP and should promote the formation of splicing complex B but could inhibit subsequent protein-RNA movements during the later stages of the splicing cycle. In particular, activation of the spliceosomal complex B is believed to involve extensive remodeling that includes the removal of U4 and all tri-snRNP proteins, including PRPF6 and PRPF31 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>, modified from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]). In effect, once incorporated into a spliceosomal complex, the mutant protein may inhibit its activation for that splicing event and the subsequent recycling of the spliceosomal components for future splicing events.</p><p>While the observation of a dominant deleterious effect of the A216P missense mutation in PRPF31 could account for the dominant nature of the RP11 form of disease, it fails to offer an explanation for the incomplete penetrance of the disorder in families with obligate carriers of the disease allele. Reduced splicing efficiency could only be detected with minigene transcripts, not full-length transcripts from a complete gene sequence; splicing from a full-length transcript appears to occur therefore with full efficiency in the presence of mutant splicing factor. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that greater splicing efficiency may be achieved with a full-length transcript, because some intrinsic feature in the RNA facilitates splicing or promotes binding of an extrinsic splicing enhancer. For example, splicing enhancers may show exonic binding (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]) and will not function in a minigene assay. Whatever the mechanism, the assays using the full-length gene construct are more likely to reflect conditions pertaining in photoreceptor cells than those using minigenes. This is not to say that the observed splicing deficiency using the minigene assays is an artifact, rather we suggest that the design of the assay is such as to reveal a rather mild effect of the mutation. Severe RP arises from haploinsufficiency but can be prevented if a high-expressing WT allele is present. Such unaffected carriers of RP11 mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>] may nevertheless show a mild retinal pathology that may be attributable to a residual haploinsufficiency. However, it may also arise from a reduction in the efficiency of splicing caused by the mutant PRPF31 protein.</p><p>Our results using the <italic>GNAT1</italic> splicing template support previous suggestions that splicing of small introns may be less efficient than splicing of larger ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Splicing of both introns 3 and 5 was inefficient, even with a transcript containing multiple exons and introns. However, even with these weak introns, our assays failed to detect any effect of the A216P mutation on splicing efficiency. This is consistent therefore with our result with the full-length <italic>RHO</italic> transcript.</p><p>Our previous work has shown that another effect of the missense mutations is to reduce protein solubility and cause protein mislocation when expressed in transfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. This will result in substantially reduced levels of functional PRPF31 in the nucleus, which may in turn lead to an accumulation of unspliced transcripts and aberrant proteins, eventually causing cell death. The pathological mechanism whereby <italic>PRPF31</italic> missense mutations result in RP is therefore protein insufficiency, and this may also underlie the disease pathology of other <italic>PRPF31</italic> mutations studied to date, including gene deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], where no mutant protein can be present, and mutations leading to premature termination where NMD of mutant transcripts occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Based on the results presented in this report, we have now found that the missense mutations have a direct effect on splicing efficiency in addition to the proposed more general effect on PRPF31 sufficiency, thereby creating a second mechanism for the pathology. However, it is probable that the specific effect on splicing makes only a minor contribution to the development of the disease, since it could not be detected using either a full-length <italic>RHO</italic> template or a partial <italic>GNAT1</italic> template. The major effect of these mutations remains therefore a reduction in the amount of PRPF31 protein entering the nucleus.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the British Retinitis Pigmentosa Society and Foundation Fighting Blindness, USA.
