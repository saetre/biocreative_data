The WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin and its three deamidated species were exposed to UV-A light (320&#x02013;400 nm) at intensities of 20 or 50 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. The UV-A-unexposed and UV-A-exposed preparations were examined for their chaperone activity, and their activities were correlated with the UV-A-induced structural changes. The structural properties studied included dimerization and degradation, intrinsic tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence, ANS (8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfate)-binding, far ultraviolet circular dichroism (UV-CD) spectral analysis, molecular sizes by dynamic light scattering, and oxidation of Trp and methionine (Met) residues.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin and its three deamidated mutant proteins showed enhanced dimerization to 40 kDa species and partial degradation with increasing doses during UV-A-exposure. Compared to the deamidation of asparagines (Asn) 78 residue to aspartic acid (Asp) or both Asn78 and Asn146 residues to Asp, the deamidation of Asn146 residue to Asp resulted in a greater loss of chaperone activity. The UV-A-induced loss of chaperone activity due to structural changes was studied. The ANS-binding data suggested that the &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp mutant protein had a relatively compact structure and an increase in surface hydrophobic patches compared to WT and two other deamidated proteins. Similarly, UV-A-exposure altered the Trp microenvironment in the deamidated mutant proteins compared to the WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin. Far-UV CD spectral analyses showed almost no changes among WT and deamidated species on UV-A-exposure except that the &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp mutant protein showed maximum changes in the random coil structure relative to WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin and two other deamidated proteins. The UV-A-exposure also resulted in the aggregation of WT and the three deamidated mutant proteins with species of greater mass compared to the non-UV-A exposed species. Among the four spots recovered after two-dimensional (2D)-gel electrophoresis from WT and the three deamidated species, the Met and Trp residues of &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp mutant showed maximum oxidation after UV-A exposure, which might account for its greater loss in chaperone activity compared to WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin and two other deamidated species.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>After UV-A-exposure, the deamidated &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp mutant protein showed a complete loss of chaperone activity compared to WT &#x003b1;B and &#x003b1;B-Asn78Asp and &#x003b1;B-Asn78/146Asp deamidated species. Apparently, this loss of chaperone activity was due to oxidative changes leading to its greater structural alteration compared to other &#x003b1;B-species.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>f7-style</meta-name><meta-value>two-thirds</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lens structural proteins (&#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, and &#x003b3;-crystallines) by virtue of their high concentration and unique interactions focus incoming light onto the retina and maintain lens transparency during the majority of our lifetime. Among the crystallines, &#x003b1;-crystallin is made of two subunits, &#x003b1;A (173 amino acid residues) and &#x003b1;B (175 amino acid residues), which apparently play a critical role in lens transparency because of their chaperone activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. The &#x003b1;A- and &#x003b1;B-crystallines show approximately 55% sequence homology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>], are composed of the highest percentage of total lens proteins (35%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>], exist as oligomers of approximately 800 kDa, and are members of the small heat shock protein (sHsp) superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>].</p><p>&#x003b1;A-crystallin is lens specific. However, &#x003b1;B-crystallin, although present at a high concentration in the lens, is also found in other tissues, including brain, the lung, and cardiac and skeletal muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Further, the expression of &#x003b1;B-crystallin is upregulated under stress such as the overexpression of &#x003b1;B-crystallin in the development of benign tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis, neuromuscular disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>], and other neurological diseases like Alexander&#x02019;s, Alzheimer, and Parkinson diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>].</p><p>The stress on cells could be intrinsic such as oxidation, phosphorylation, and deamidation of proteins or extrinsic such as heat or UV irradiation. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is one of the stress factors that are believed to cause age-related cataract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Sunlight consists of ultraviolet radiation, which is made up of UV-A (composed of longer wavelengths between 320 to 400 nm) and ultraviolet (UV)-B (composed of shorter wavelengths between 280 and 320 nm), and both have destructive properties that can cause cataract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. An association between cortical cataracts and UV-A radiation has been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. The human lens absorbs all the impinging UV-A radiation between 320 to 400 nm because of intrinsic UV filters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. It is believed that a cortical cataract begins at the inferonasal lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>] where the sunlight is most concentrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. An epidemiological correlation between high levels of the UV component of sunlight to higher incidence of cataracts in humans has been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. UV-A-induced oxidation of lens proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>], DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>], and membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>] has been shown as well as the formation of singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>].</p><p>Age-related cataract is believed to be a consequence of the aggregation of &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, and &#x003b3;-crystallines and the subsequent precipitation of the aggregates and cross-linked products. The precipitation of crystallines is thought to be initiated by posttranslational modifications, which change their structural and functional properties. Recent studies of water insoluble (WI) proteins from normal human lenses showed that crystallines undergo in vivo modifications, which included disulfide bonding, deamidation, oxidation, and backbone cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. However, additional modifications (i.e., glycation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>], oxidation of tryptophan (W) and histidine (H) residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>], deamidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>], transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>], and racemization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]) in crystallines are also believed to contribute to aggregation and cross-linking. Although the exact mechanism of UV-A-induced cataract with advancing age is not known, several pieces of evidence suggest that oxidation of specific amino acids such as Trp and Met might be the causative factor. How the oxidatively modified Met and Trp cause lens crystallins to aggregate and form cross-linked products is not known. Although the effects of UV-A-exposure on individual &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, or &#x003b3;-crystallins or on lens enzymes have been investigated in past studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>], its effects on the posttranslationally modified crystallines have not been studied.</p><p>Deamidation of crystallines is a nonenzymatic process. David et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>] have reported that deamidation is the most prevalent modification compared to other modifications found in crystallines. Both Asn and glutamine (Gln) residues undergo deamidation, which results in the introduction of a negative charge at the site of modification and may alter the protein&#x02019;s tertiary structure and affect its biologic properties. It is expected that deamidation changes the protein&#x02019;s three-dimensional structure. Lampi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>] recently reported that the deamidation and not truncation in human &#x003b2;B1-crystallin reduced its stability. Also, we showed the presence of Asn146 deamidated species of &#x003b1;B-crystallin in the normal and cataractous human lenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Recently, we showed that the deamidation of Asn146 but not of Asn78 had a profound effect on the structural and functional properties of human &#x003b1;B-crystallin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. Similarly, our study showed that both Asp residues (Asp101 and Asp123) of human &#x003b1;A-crystallin are required for the structural integrity and chaperone function of the crystallin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>].</p><p>Although the UV-A-irradiation is believed to be a major initiating and causative factor for age-related cataract, the effects of the irradiation on deamidated crystallines are presently unknown. In the present study, we determined comparative effects of UV-A irradiation on wild type (WT) &#x003b1;B-crystallin and its three deamidated mutant proteins (&#x003b1;B-Asn78Asp, &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp, and &#x003b1;B-Asn78/146Asp) on their structural and functional properties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Molecular biology grade chemicals were purchased from either Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) or Thermo-Fisher (Norcross, GA) unless stated otherwise.

The aggregation of insulin as a target protein in the presence of dithiothreitol was monitored at 360 nm (due to light scattering) as a function of time at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The aggregation of insulin (100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g in 10&#x000a0;mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100&#x000a0;mM NaCl) was initiated by 20&#x000a0;mM DTT at varying chaperone-to-target protein ratios.

For mass spectrometric analysis, the individual protein spots were excised from a SDS&#x02013;PAGE gel using pipette microtips. The polyacrylamide pieces containing individual bands were destained with three consecutive washes with a 50:50 mixture of 25&#x000a0;mM ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile for 30 min. Next, the samples were washed for 10 min with 25&#x000a0;mM ammonium bicarbonate before digestion with trypsin (12 ng/&#x003bc;l; sequencing grade from Roche, Pleasanton, CA) for 16 h at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Peptide solutions were then extracted using 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of a 50:50 mixture of 5% formic acid and acetonitrile for 30 min. Supernatants were collected and evaporated to dryness in a Savant SpeedVac (Thermoscientific, Waltham, MA). Samples were resuspended in 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 0.1% formic acid. C-18 ZipTips (Millipore, Billerica, MA) were used to desalt peptide mixtures before applying samples to the MALDI-TOF 96 well spot gold-coated target plates. Bound peptides were eluted from the ZipTips with 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l methanol. They were mixed (1/10 dilution) with a saturated solution of &#x003b1;-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) matrix in 50% aqueous acetonitrile. Samples were allowed to dry before performing MALDI-TOF MS using a Voyager DE-Pro (ABI, Foster City, CA) with a nitrogen laser (337 nm) operating in the positive mode. Spectra were the sum of 100 laser shots; they were then de-isotoped and analyzed using Voyager Explorer software, and peptide masses were submitted to the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.matrixscience.com">MASCOT search engine</ext-link> for protein identifications. The potential identity of the proteins was determined by using the NCBInr database. Tandem mass spectral analyses were performed with the Q-TOF 2 mass spectrometer (Waters-Micromass, Manchester, UK) using electrospray ionization to verify the identity of the proteins. The tryptic peptides used for the MALDI-TOF MS analysis were then analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Liquid chromatography was performed using a LC Packings Ultimate LC-Switchos microcolumn switching unit and Famos-autosampler (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA). The samples were concentrated on a 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m i.d. C<sub>8</sub> reverse-phase precolumn at a flow rate of 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/min with 0.1% formic acid and then flushed onto a 10 cm&#x000d7;75&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m i.d.

The nanoelectrospray ionization interface was used to transfer the LC eluent into the mass spectrometer. The Q-TOF was operated in the automatic switching mode where multiple-charged ions were subjected to MS/MS if their intensities rose above six counts.

Following UV-A-exposure, a high molecular weight (HMW) protein peak typically eluted first (at about 10 min) followed by the crystallin peak (at about 15 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>).

The HMW protein peak, although present in WT and &#x003b1;B-Asn78/146Asp but absent in &#x003b1;B-Asn78Asp and &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp, appeared in all proteins after UV-A-exposure.

The &#x003b1;B-crystallin contains two Met residues (at positions 1 and 68) and two Trp residues (at positions 9 and 60). Because both MALDI-TOF and ES-MS/MS analyses of the tryptic peptides from UV-A-exposed and unexposed WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin and its three deamidated mutants showed oxidation of Met and Trp residues, no conclusive results regarding their oxidation on UV-A exposure could be obtained. In these analyses, the UV-A-exposed and unexposed species that were recovered either after one-dimensional SDS&#x02013;PAGE or present in a solution after the exposure was used. In an alternative approach, both UV-A-exposed and unexposed preparations of WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin and the deamidated mutant proteins were resolved by 2D-gel electrophoresis, which typically showed four spots (identified as spots 1, 2, 3, and 4 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">8</xref>). Each individual spot was excised, trypsin-digested, and examined by MALDI-TOF MS and ES-MS/MS methods. The focus in the analyses was the Met and Trp residues of two tryptic peptides, peptide 1 with residues 1&#x02013;11 [MDIAIHHPWIR, <italic>m/z</italic> 1388] and peptide 2 with residues 57&#x02013;69 [APSWFDTGLSEMR, <italic>m/z</italic> 1496]. Typical MALDI-TOF MS tryptic mass fragment profiles of spot no. 1 from UV-A-unexposed and exposed WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9A and B</xref>. Similar profiles for spots 1, 2, 3, and 4 from the WT and its three deamidated proteins were also obtained. To obtain semi-quantitative data on the oxidation of Met and/or Trp residues during UV-A exposure, the relative differences in the ratios of peak heights between the oxidized tryptic peptide with <italic>m/z</italic> of 1404 (containing residue numbers 1&#x02013;11) and the unoxidized peptide with <italic>m/z</italic> of 1388 were determined in the MALDI-TOF MS profiles of spot numbers 1-4. Similarly, the peak ratios were also determined from the MALDI-TOF MS profiles of peptide 2 (containing residue numbers 59-69) with <italic>m/z</italic> of 1512 (oxidized) and 1496 (unoxidized) for spots 1-4 for each &#x003b1;B-crystallin species. These ratios are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>. A higher ratio of 1 or above in the UV-A-exposed versus unexposed species suggested that there was oxidation of the Met and/or Trp residues.

In some of these studies, latitude and sunlight exposure hours were positively correlated with cataract incidence. Although UV-B constitutes only solar 3% of UV radiation that reaches the earth, its effect varies with geographical, physical, and meteorological factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>]. However, because UV-B light is absorbed by the cornea and aqueous humor of the human eye, most of the UV-A light reaches the lens and is absorbed by it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>]. The corneal epithelium and Bowman&#x02019;s layer are the effective absorbers of UV-B radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>]. The in vivo action spectrum for UV-induced lens opacities in rabbits begins at 295 nm and extends to 320 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>]. Using a 6.6 nm full band pass, 300 nm radiation was found to be 30 times more effective than 315 nm radiation in producing lens opacities in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>]. The UV radiation above 300 nm is partially transmitted by cornea, 2%&#x02013;20% in the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>], 24% in rabbit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>], and 9% in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>]. Therefore, UVB is a minor component of the total energy that reaches to the surface of the human lens. Nevertheless, old human lens proteins absorb two times more UV-A and visible light than UVB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>]. Taken together, these reports show that the cornea protects the lens from damaging UVB radiation, which is very significant in view of the increasing depletion of the ozone in the stratosphere, which is resulting in increased levels of UV radiation reaching the Earth.</p><p>The mechanism of UV-A-induced lens opacification is presently not fully understood. UV exposure of proteins from older human lens with a yellow color were seen to cause several reactive oxygen species to form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>]. Reports have suggested that UV-A-induced lenticular damage occurs because of the accumulation of several UV-A-absorbing compounds in the lens with aging and cataract, and these compounds act as UV-A-responsive sensitizers and produce reactive oxygen species, mostly <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>]. It has been reported that in young lenses, UV light that reaches the lens is absorbed by UV filters, such as either Trp residues [UVB] or 3-hydroxy-kynurenine glycoside O-&#x003b2;-D-glucoside (UV-A) and related compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>]. In the older lenses, the levels of the filters significantly decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>] with simultaneous increase in the UV-A-absorbing protein-bound chromophores. These chromophores act as sensitizers and generate reactive oxygen species. In young lenses, the UV filters that are produced due to catabolism of Trp, 3-hydroxykynurenine O-&#x003b2;-D-glucoside, 4-(2-amino-3-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxabutanoic acid O-&#x003b2;-glucoiside, kynurenine, and 3-hydroxykynurenine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r60">60</xref>], absorb UV-A light and thus protect the lens and retina from UV damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r59">59</xref>]. Lens coloration has been shown to occur due to the interaction of crystallines with a UV filter compound, 3-hydroxykynurenine, yielding an unsaturated ketone that is susceptible to a nucleophilic attack by cysteine, histidine, and lysine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r60">60</xref>]. The modified amino acid containing proteins leads to lens coloration and might play a role in human nuclear cataractogenesis. Ortwerth et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>] have shown that these lens chromophores act as UV-A responsive sensitizers that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), mostly as singlet oxygen, which in turn oxidizes Trp, His, and Cys residues within the lens proteins. Additional studies have suggested that UV-A-responsive sensitizers exist in aging human lenses and might be causing age-dependent lens protein modifications. Together, these reports suggest a major role of UV filter compounds in the generation of ROS that could cause oxidative damage to specific amino acids of crystallines.</p><p>An intriguing finding of our study was that after UV-A exposure at 50&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup> of WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin and its three deamidated mutants, the &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp mutant showed a maximum loss of chaperone activity, whereas the activity of WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin and the &#x003b1;B-Asn78Asp and &#x003b1;B-Asn78/146Asp mutants remained almost unaffected. In our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>], the deamidation in Asn146 but not in Asn78 showed profound effects on structural and functional properties of human &#x003b1;B-crystallin. To determine the potential mechanism of the loss of chaperone activity in &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp mutant protein, we determined biophysical properties of UV-A-exposed and unexposed WT &#x003b1;B and its three deamidated mutant proteins (&#x003b1;B-Asn78Asp, &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp, and &#x003b1;B-Asn78/146Asp). The &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp mutant protein exhibited an unusual behavior of a blue shift and an increase in the fluorescence upon ANS binding, suggesting a relatively compact structure but an increase in surface hydrophobic patches after UV-A exposure. However, in spite of increased hydrophobic patches, this mutant protein lost its chaperone activity upon UV-A-exposure. Although both &#x003b1;B-Asn78Asp and &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp mutant proteins showed a decrease in Trp fluorescence with a blue shift in &#x003bb;<sub>max</sub> from 338 nm to 333 nm relative to unexposed controls, only the latter mutant protein lost chaperone activity. In contrast, WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin after UV-A-exposure showed a twofold increase in Trp fluorescence with a blue shift of 3 nm (a &#x003bb;<sub>max</sub> decrease from 335 nm to 332 nm) compared to the unexposed control, suggesting a UV-A-induced altered Trp microenvironment. However, the chaperone activity of the WT protein was relatively unaffected by the exposure compared to the &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp mutant protein. On far-UV CD spectral determination, the random coil structure showed maximum changes in &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp mutant protein in comparison to WT or the two other deamidated mutants. Furthermore, after UV-A-exposure, the &#x003b2;-sheet contents of WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin and the three mutants proteins (&#x003b1;B-Asn78Asp, &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp, and &#x003b1;B-Asn78/146Asp) increased, but the &#x003b2;-turn and random coil contents were unaffected following UV-A-exposure. The &#x003b1;-helix contents showed the most dramatic decrease in WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin and &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp mutant (27%&#x02013;29% to 3%), whereas this was unaffected in the &#x003b1;B-Asn78Asp and &#x003b1;B-Asn78/146Asp mutant proteins. Taken together, the structural changes as suggested by the changes in the contents of the &#x003b2;-sheets and &#x003b1;-helices, the ANS binding, and intrinsic Trp spectra in &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp mutant protein could account for the loss of chaperone activity. An increased oxidation of Met and Trp residues was also seen in Spot 1 of the UV-A-exposed &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp mutant protein compared to its unexposed species, and the absence of such oxidation in the other two deamidated mutant proteins and WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin might also explain the loss in the chaperone activity.</p><p>Our results also suggest that there were UV-A-induced oxidative changes in Trp residue of WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin and its three deamidated mutants. Several previous reports have shown photo-destruction of Trp residues in purified crystallines after UV-exposure in the absence of any added sensitizers or UV filters. Schauerte and Gafni [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r61">61</xref>] showed in 1995 that UV-B exposure of bovine &#x003b1;-crystallin (obtained from Sigma Chemical Company) resulted in the decline of Trp fluorescence, suggesting the occurrence of modifications in these residues. Similarly, Fujii and Saito [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r62">62</xref>] showed a concomitant decrease in the fluorescence of Trp and an increase in N-formylkynurenine in purified bovine &#x003b1;-crystallin with increasing UV-C irradiation (254 nm). The UV-C exposed &#x003b1;-crystallin also showed an altered secondary structure, and the authors speculated that the changes were due to the UV absorption by the Trp residue that resulted in the photo-oxidation of Trp to N-formylkynurenine (NFK). NFK then acts as an efficient photosensitizer. They proposed that the excited triplet state of NFK reacts either with the ground state molecular oxygen to form <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> or the protein amino acids to produce free radicals. It has been shown in past studies that <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and hydrogen peroxide can cause photo-damage to lens crystallines. We have also observed an UV-A-induced increase in NFK-fluorescence (excitation at 295 nm and emission at 330 nm) in WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin and its three deamidated mutant proteins (&#x003b1;B-Asn78Asp, &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp, and &#x003b1;B-Asn78/146Asp; data not shown). Another report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r63">63</xref>] showed that exposure of individual crystallines (bovine &#x003b1;-crystallin, &#x003b2;L-crystallin, recombinant &#x003b2;A3-crystallines, or &#x003b3;B-crystallines) to a 308 nm excimer laser resulted in each preparation exhibiting differential UV sensitivity in the form of light scattering, aggregation rate to dimers, and higher molecular weight species. A potential photo-oxidation mechanism, possibly involving Trp photoproducts (i.e., NFK), was speculated by the authors to account for the structural changes and aggregation of the crystallines. The exposure of the recombinant proteins to a 308 nm excimer laser was equivalent to irradiation of the proteins to a part of the UV-A-spectrum. The authors suggested that the effects on the recombinant proteins were possibly due to NFK that could act as a sensitizer during the UV exposure in the above described effects. We propose a similar mechanism for the UV-A irradiation effects on WT and the deamidated &#x003b1;B-crystallin.</p><table-wrap id="t3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Determination of oxidation of methionine (M) and tryptophan (W) residues in peptide 1 (residues 1&#x02013;11 [MDIAIHHPWIR, mass 1388]) and peptide 2 (residues 57&#x02013;69 [APSWFDTGLSEMR, mass 1496]).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col width="82" span="1"/><col width="78" span="1"/><col width="78" span="1"/><col width="78" span="1"/><col width="78" span="1"/><col width="45" span="1"/><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x003b1;B species</th><th valign="top" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spot 1</th><th valign="top" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spot 2</th><th valign="top" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spot 3</th><th valign="top" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spot 4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WT<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peptide 1<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.6<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.967<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.52<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.12<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peptide 2<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.97<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.9<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.46<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.4<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asn78Asp<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peptide 1<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.005<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.05<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.85<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peptide 2<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.87<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.001<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.003<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.94<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asn146Asp<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peptide 1<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.52<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.25<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.0<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.8<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peptide 2<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.02<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.142<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.75<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.06<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asn78/146Asp<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peptide 1<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.8<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.0<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.24<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ND<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peptide 2</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.0</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.5</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.69</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ND</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The ratio of oxidized versus unoxidized species in peptide 1 and 2 of the 2D-gel separated as spot number 1 to 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9</xref>) were calculated.

A similar potential mechanism might be operative during UV-A-exposure of the &#x003b1;B-crystallin species in the present study.</p><p>It was intriguing that the deamidation of Asn-146 resulted in a greater loss of chaperone activity compared to other &#x003b1;B-crystallin species used in this study. Based on similarities with the structures of other heat shock proteins (HSPs), it is believed that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region (residue numbers 1&#x02013;63 in &#x003b1;A-crystallin and numbers 1&#x02013;66 in &#x003b1;B-crystallines) of &#x003b1;-crystallin forms an independently folded NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain, whereas the COOH-terminal region (residue numbers 143&#x02013;173 in &#x003b1;A-crystallin and numbers 147&#x02013;175 in &#x003b1;B-crystallin) is flexible and unstructured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r64">64</xref>]. In addition, the middle conserved &#x003b1;-crystallin domain (residue numbers 64&#x02013;142 in &#x003b1;A-crystallin and residue numbers 67&#x02013;146 in &#x003b1;B-crystallin) plays a role in both substrate binding and chaperone activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r64">64</xref>]. Because Asn-146 belongs to the core region of the &#x003b1;B-crystallin domain and the importance of the core region of &#x003b1;B-crystallin in the chaperone activity is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r65">65</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r67">67</xref>], the Asn146 might be involved in the three major factors (surface hydrophobic patches, subunit exchange rate, and hetero-oligomer sizes) that affect the chaperone activity in &#x003b1;-crystallin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r69">69</xref>]. The hydrophobic patches seem to play an important role such as between human lens &#x003b1;A- and &#x003b1;B-crystallines; the residue numbers 42&#x02013;57, 60&#x02013;71, and 88&#x02013;123 of &#x003b1;B-crystallin interacted with &#x003b1;A-crystallin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r68">68</xref>]. Additionally, the &#x003b2;8 sequence (<sub>131</sub>LTITSSLS<sub>138</sub>) is an interactive domain in both &#x003b1;A- and &#x003b1;B-crystallines, and the surface exposed residues of &#x003b2;8 motif (Thr134, Ser 136, and Ser138) combined with surface-exposed residue of &#x003b2;3 motif (Asn78, Lys82, and His83) and the &#x003b2;9 motif (Gly141 and Thr14) form an interface for chaperone activity of &#x003b1;B-crystallin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r67">67</xref>]. Because the Asn146 is adjacent to Gly141 in the conserved &#x003b1;-domain region of &#x003b1;B-crystallin, the resulting negative charge due to its deamidation (&#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp) might affect the &#x003b2;9 motif of &#x003b1;B-crystallin. This could explain the greater loss in the chaperone activity in the &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp mutant protein. A missense mutation in the &#x003b1;B-crystallin (Arg120Gly) resulted in an inherited, adult onset desmin-related myopathy, a neuromuscular disorder where desmin (an intermediate filament protein) aggregated with &#x003b1;B-crystallin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r71">71</xref>].</p><p>The above discussion presents the critical location of Asn146 residue within the core domain structure of &#x003b1;B-crystallin. Based on the results of the changes in biophysical properties of WT &#x003b1;B-crystallin and its three deamidated mutant proteins, no single structural change seem to explain the loss of the chaperone activity in the &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp mutant protein. Apparently, the UV-A-induced oxidation and degradation of &#x003b1;B-Asn146Asp mutant protein show adverse effects on the chaperone activity of the mutant protein, which might be the most critical factor to explain the loss in the chaperone activity. Therefore, the effect of UV-A-induced oxidative insult is enhanced if the Asn146 residue is deamidated in &#x003b1;B-crystallin.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Support for these studies was provided by a grant to Purdue University&#x02013;University of Alabama at Birmingham Botanical Center for Age-Related Diseases from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements (P50 AT00477, Connie Weaver, PI).
