The endo/exonuclease Nuc1p, also termed &#x02018;yeast Endonuclease G (EndoG)&#x02019;, is a member of this class of enzymes that differs from mammalian homologs by the presence of a 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease activity in addition to its broad spectrum endonuclease activity. However, this exonuclease activity is thought to be essential for a function of the yeast enzyme in DNA recombination and repair. Here we show that higher eukaryotes in addition to EndoG contain its paralog &#x02018;EXOG&#x02019;, a novel EndoG-like mitochondrial endo/exonuclease. We find that during metazoan evolution duplication of an ancestral nuclease gene obviously generated the paralogous EndoG- and EXOG-protein subfamilies in higher eukaryotes, thereby maintaining the full endo/exonuclease activity found in mitochondria of lower eukaryotes. We demonstrate that human EXOG is a dimeric mitochondrial enzyme that displays 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease activity and further differs from EndoG in substrate specificity. We hypothesize that in higher eukaryotes the complementary enzymatic activities of EndoG and EXOG probably together account for both, the lethal and vital functions of conserved mitochondrial endo/exonucleases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Mitochondria contain at least one highly conserved sugar-non-specific nuclease that contributes to vital and lethal functions in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). One of the functionally best studied representatives of these mitochondrial enzymes from lower eukaryotes is the endo/exonuclease Nuc1p from budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Several investigations have clearly defined that besides to a lethal role during cell death Nuc1p is also required for normal cell proliferation and similar functions have been reported for its <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and mammalian homologs, CPS-6 and Endonuclease G (EndoG), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11">6&#x02013;11</xref>).</p><p>Whereas during programmed cell death yeast Nuc1p and <italic>C. elegans</italic> EndoG are activated in a caspase-independent manner, the role of mammalian EndoG in apoptosis apparently is of much higher complexity, as experimental results concerning its recruitment have disclosed a partially controversial situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). Moreover, the finding that a knock out of EndoG in mice apparently does not lead to any obvious abnormality in this organism has been quite perplexing and caused scepticism regarding a vital function of this endonuclease in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>).</p><p>To carry out its dual role in cell death and normal cell proliferation Nuc1p is endowed with two different enzymatic activities. Besides having a broad spectrum endonuclease activity towards DNA and RNA the enzyme also exerts 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease activity enabling it to induce single stranded gaps into double stranded DNA in the course of DNA recombination and repair events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Interestingly, this exonuclease activity is not found in known mammalian EndoG family members, which are pure endonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21">18&#x02013;21</xref>).</p><p>The controversial results concerning the cellular role of mammalian EndoG and its lack of 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease activity prompted us to search for similar enzymes that might back up or complement EndoG function in mammals. Interestingly, we found paralogous genes in higher eukaryotes, previously termed <italic>endonuclease G-like-1</italic>, that obviously result from duplication of an ancestral endo/exonuclease gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Though the human <italic>endonuclease G-like-1</italic> gene has been described twice previously, demonstrating ubiquitous expression on the mRNA level in all tissues tested, it has not been shown yet whether it encodes a functional enzyme and what the properties and functions of this enzyme would be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Here we show that the gene product of <italic>endonuclease G-like-1</italic> is a mitochondrial endo/exonuclease displaying both, endonuclease and 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease activity. Due to its complementary enzymatic activities and a common evolutionary origin with EndoG we termed this novel endo/exonuclease &#x02018;EXOG&#x02019;. Intriguingly, together EndoG and EXOG unite all enzymatic activities found in fungal single protein endo/exonucleases, suggesting that in higher eukaryotes the major mitochondrial nuclease activity and hence its vital and lethal cellular functions are probably distributed over these two enzymes. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Sequence and evolutionary analysis of EndoG and EXOG.

Alignments of these protein sequences revealed the presence of a distinct family of sugar non-specific nucleases in higher eukaryotes each encoded on a different chromosome than their paralogous EndoG counterparts. On the primary sequence level these paralogs can be clearly distinguished from the previously known EndoG-family members by the presence of an &#x02018;SRGH&#x02019; catalytic motif instead of &#x02018;DRGH&#x02019; and an additional C-terminal domain of approximately 70 amino acid residues length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and Supplementary Figure S1). In order to trace the evolutionary origin of these EndoG paralogs, 168 representative protein sequences were chosen for the construction of an evolutionary tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Among higher eukaryotes the tree reveals two branches of sugar non-specifc nucleases corresponding to orthologs of the previously studied EndoG-proteins and orthologs of the newly discovered EndoG-paralogs, which both are present e.g. in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (see Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). The tree suggests that a duplication of an ancestral endo/exonuclease gene leading to these nuclease subfamilies occurred after the separation of animalia and fungal lineages and at the latest in the common ancestors of deuterostomes. A more detailed subtree of EndoG- and EXOG-protein subfamilies is given in Supplementary Figure S2. In humans, a paralog&#x02014;we named &#x02018;EXOG&#x02019;&#x02014;was found which is encoded by a gene previously named &#x02018;<italic>endonuclease G-like-1</italic>&#x02019;. This gene is located on chromosome 3, whereas the human EndoG-gene locates to chromosome 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Given the differences in sequence composition and domain organization between EndoG and its paralog EXOG we next wanted to find out whether EXOG is a functional enzyme, where the enzyme is located in the cell and what the enzymatic properties of this enzyme would be.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Endonuclease G-like-1</italic> encodes a functional enzyme</title><p>In order to test whether <italic>endonuclease G-like-1</italic> encodes an active enzyme, we expressed 3 &#x000d7; FLAG fusion proteins of human EXOG, and, for comparison, of bovine EndoG in mammalian cell lines. Confocal imaging of transfected HeLa cells employing antibodies against the 3 &#x000d7; FLAG-tag revealed that EXOG, similarly to EndoG, localizes to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, left panel). To detect a putative endonuclease activity of mitochondrial EXOG we purified EXOG and EndoG from transiently transfected HEK 293-cells by immunoprecipitation and performed cleavage assays using various circular DNA substrates (supercoiled, open circular, and circular single stranded DNA from phage &#x003a6;X174). Of note, though being expressed in parallel from similar constructs, an approximately 25 times higher yield of immunoreactive EndoG compared to EXOG was obtained from the immunoprecipitation experiments. For the DNA cleavage assays, therefore, concentrations were adjusted and the same amount of immunoreactive material from EXOG and EndoG preparations was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, right panel). In contrast to EndoG, which cleaved all three substrates with nearly identical rates, EXOG only cleaved circular single stranded DNA efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). This demonstrates that EXOG indeed is a functional mitochondrial enzyme displaying endonuclease activity preferentially, but not exclusively (see below), on single stranded DNA and that EndoG and EXOG clearly differ in their substrate specificities. The question whether EXOG also displays exonuclease activity, as demonstrated earlier for yeast Nuc1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), had to be assessed by the cleavage of radioactively labeled oligonucleotide substrates as described below, since such an activity can hardly be seen from cleavage experiments using circular DNA molecules. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>EXOG is a functional enzyme preferring single stranded DNA.

The first 15 amino acid residues of the MLS are dispensable for mitochondrial uptake of EXOG (&#x00394;1-15-EXOG-EGFP), whereas amino acid residues 16&#x02013;41 comprising the putative helical transmembrane segment (&#x00394;1-41-EXOG-EGFP) are required for mitochondrial localization of EXOG.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm1169f3"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>An N-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane segment accounts for mitochondrial uptake of EXOG</title><p>To define the region responsible for association of EXOG with the inner mitochondrial membrane we reanalyzed the primary sequence of the protein and identified a hydrophobic N-terminal transmembrane segment (TMS, residues 16&#x02013;38) folding into a putative transmembrane helix within the potential signal peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).

However, upon prolonged incubation with recombinant EXOG, supercoiled and open circular DNA were also cleaved by the enzyme, resulting in the production of linear fragments of various sizes, as represented by a &#x02018;smear&#x02019; upon agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The addition of non-ionic detergents such as Tween-20 to the renaturation and reaction buffer further enhanced the overall activity of refolded EXOG but did not change the preference of the enzyme for single stranded DNA (data not shown). Interestingly, supercoiled DNA is readily relaxed to the open circular form upon incubation with recombinant EXOG, similarly as seen with the immunoprecipitated enzyme preparation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, confirming a robust nicking activity displayed by EXOG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). As seen with EndoG, a variety of divalent metal ions can act as a cofactor for EXOG, but these different metal ions do neither influence the preference of EXOG for cleavage of single stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C), nor induce significant changes in the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease activity of EXOG (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). It should be noted here, that without addition of metal ions the EXOG preparation does not show nuclease activity (data not shown). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Recombinant EXOG is a homodimer.

Since the amino acid composition of the catalytic motif of EXOG differs from that of most other mitochondrial sugar non-specific nucleases (SRGH- <italic>versus</italic> DRGH-motif) we produced by site-directed mutagenesis the single mutants S137D and H140A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B) and measured their activity using single stranded virion DNA as substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C and D). Prior to performing activity assays (see Materials and Methods section) the protein concentrations of the individual mutants were determined spectrophotometrically from the supernatant after renaturation by flash dilution and centrifugation as described under Materials and Methods, in order to account for possibly different levels of refolding of the mutant enzymes. As a result, reversion of Ser137 from the catalytic motif of EXOG to the more common aspartic acid residue did neither significantly change enzymatic activity nor substrate specificity of EXOG, suggesting that the serine residue is not responsible for the differences in enzymatic properties and the substrate specificity of EXOG compared to EndoG. In contrast, exchange of His140 to Ala abolished enzymatic activity. This is in line with our previous finding that the histidine residue from the catalytic DRGH-motif of related enzymes acts as a general base in the proposed mechanism of phosphodiester bond cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Mutational analysis of EXOG.

To investigate the effect of this SNP-related amino acid exchange on EXOG activity we produced by site directed mutagenesis the G277V variant. Intriguingly and unexpectedly, the mutation of Gly277 to Val had a similar effect on enzyme activity as the mutation of the conserved active site histidine residue His140 to Ala, indicating that the related SNP might play an important role in determining EXOG activity in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C and D).</p></sec><sec><title>Deletion of the C-terminal domain inactivates EXOG</title><p>In contrast to previously characterized mammalian EndoG proteins EXOG-proteins posses a C-terminal domain that is predicted to fold into a coiled-coil structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and Supplementary Figure S1).

In <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals the Nuc1p homolgs CPS-6 and EndoG exert similar functions, yet the pathways leading to their activation are different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). We find that rather than containing a single sugar non-specific nuclease, as found in lower eukaryotes, mitochondria of higher eukaryotes in addition to EndoG contain members of the paralogous EXOG-protein subfamily. Whereas mammalian EndoG is a pure endonuclease cleaving single and double stranded DNA and RNA with nearly identical rates, we find that human EXOG is a mitochondrial endo/exonuclease with nicking activity towards supercoiled DNA, a preference for single stranded DNA and 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease activity. Such differences in enzymatic activities and substrate specificities suggest a subdivision of cellular functions between these two paralogous enzymes in higher eukaryotes. Its activities in principle endow EXOG with the ability to generate single stranded gaps in double stranded DNA required for DNA recombination and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), pointing towards a role of EXOG in normal cell proliferation similarly as seen with yeast Nuc1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Though such functions have been previously reported for EndoG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), it seems more likely that this enzyme rather plays a major role in programmed cell death than DNA recombination and repair. Interestingly, several studies have previously described an enzymatic activity in mammalian mitochondria similar to yet clearly distinct from EndoG, whose enzymatic activities, e.g. preference for single stranded DNA, and whose biochemical properties, e.g. molecular weight, very much resemble those of EXOG proteins as described in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Whether these enzymatic activities correspond to EXOG currently is unknown and remains to be shown.</p><p>A combination of the results of mitochondrial subfractionation and electron microscopy experiments revealed that EXOG resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane. We assume that a predicted TMS, which very likely folds into a helix (TMH), serves to mediate association of EXOG with the inner mitochondrial membrane. Upon staurosporine induced apoptosis, EXOG remained clearly mitochondrial, whereas cytochrome <italic>c</italic> was increasingly released from mitochondria (Supplementary Figure S5).</p><p>The identification of EXOG as a novel mitochondrial endo/exonuclease provides an entirely new perspective for investigations on the role of mitochondrial nucleases during cell death and normal cell proliferation in eukaryotes. Our finding that EXOG and EndoG have complementary and partially overlapping enzymatic activities might explain why single knock-outs of EndoG in mice do not lead to an obvious phenotype, since EXOG could have simply stood in for at least some of the lost EndoG functions. Thus, it will be interesting to see the effects of double knock-out studies of EndoG and EXOG in mammals. Interestingly, we demonstrate that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) found in exon 6 of the EXOG gene inactivates the enzyme. As it has been shown that intronic SNPs in the EXOG gene are associated with type II diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) we hypothesize that this exonic SNP might also be associated with the development of this or other diseases, since it determines the availability of EXOG activity in humans. In conclusion, we propose integrating EXOG into future investigations on the cell death and cell proliferation scenario previously solely linked to EndoG, as our results establish the concept of a split mitochondrial endo/exonuclease function in higher eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm1169_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm1169_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Jan Kosinski for critically reading the manuscript, Heike B&#x000fc;ngen for technical assistance, Grzegorz Wilczynski and Adam Gorlewicz for advice and expertize in post embedding and electron microscopy, and Jacek Jaworski for the kind gift of pDsRed2-Mito.
