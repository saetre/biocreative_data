We used conditional deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic> to address how quiescence is associated with the function of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We demonstrate that <italic>Tsc1</italic> deletion in the HSCs drives them from quiescence into rapid cycling, with increased mitochondrial biogenesis and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, this deletion dramatically reduced both hematopoiesis and self-renewal of HSCs, as revealed by serial and competitive bone marrow transplantation. In vivo treatment with an ROS antagonist restored HSC numbers and functions. These data demonstrated that the TSC&#x02013;mTOR pathway maintains the quiescence and function of HSCs by repressing ROS production.

The molecular pathway that keeps them in quiescence is largely obscure, although recent studies have implicated stem cell niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) and cell-intrinsic functions of <italic>p21</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) and <italic>Pten</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) in this process. The significance of quiescence in stem cell function is bolstered as genetic disruption of its quiescence almost invariably inactivates the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Nevertheless, it is largely unclear how an active metabolism is incompatible with a normal HSC function.</p><p>In addition to cell-intrinsic factors, accumulating data demonstrated that residence of adult HSCs in the BM niches is essential for their quiescence and long-term functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Because exposure to high levels of oxygen damages the functions of HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), it has been proposed that hypoxia is important for HSC functions. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of how hypoxia maintains the stemness is unknown.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in vitro&#x02013;cultured mammalian cells, hypoxia activates tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which can inhibit the target of rapamycin (TOR), through REDD1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Whether this pathway operates in the HSCs has yet to be tested.</p><p>The mammalian TOR (mTOR) pathway has emerged as a key regulator for cellular metabolism. Accumulating data have demonstrated that mTOR regulates several important cellular functions, including protein synthesis, autophagy, endocytosis and nutrient uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). An increased mTOR activity results in increased cellular growth and nonmalignant growth of cells in solid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Recently, it has been demonstrated that mTOR controls the mitochondrial oxidative function through a YY1&#x02013;PGC-1&#x003b1; transcriptional complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Although systemic analysis of the mTOR pathway in the function of HSCs has not been performed, several lines of evidence are consistent with a critical role for the pathway in HSC function. First, two groups reported that the targeted mutation of <italic>Pten</italic>, a negative regulator of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT, which are inhibitors for TSC function, reduced long-term HSC (LT-HSC) function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Second, up-regulated mTOR activity is associated with a higher level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Nevertheless, because these regulators have multiple functions, the link between the mTOR pathway and HSCs remains tentative.</p><p>TSC was first defined by genetic mutations leading to nonmalignant growth in solid organs in patients with genetic lesions of two genes, now called <italic>TSC1</italic> and <italic>TSC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Genetic screening in <italic>Drosophila</italic> demonstrated that the TSC determined the size of solid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). More recently, TSC has emerged as the major negative regulator for the mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>) (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that the targeted mutation of <italic>TSC1</italic> disrupts quiescence and long-term functions of the HSCs. Moreover, we showed that the <italic>Tsc1</italic> defect leads to increased mitochondrion biogenesis and accumulation of ROS, and that the HSC defects can be largely restored by blocking ROS activity in vivo. Collectively, our data demonstrated that the TSC&#x02013;mTOR pathway controls quiescence and functions of HSCs by repressing ROS production.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>TSC1 controls quiescence of HSCs</title><p>To address the function of mTOR activation in the biology of HSCs, we generated mice that express both <italic>MX-Cre</italic> and floxed <italic>Tsc1</italic> locus and used polyinosine-polycytidine (pIpC) treatment to induce deletion of TSC in the HSCs.

Therefore, we tested the effect of mTOR activation on stem cell quiescence. First, we measured the total RNA/DNA contents in the LT-HSCs by pyronin/HOECHST staining. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref>, at 10 d after pIpC treatment &#x0223c;70% of the FLSKCD48<sup>&#x02212;</sup> LT-HSCs in the Ctrl mice are pyronin Y<sup>low</sup>, consistent with their quiescent status. In the pIpC-treated <italic>Tsc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>mx-1-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice, only &#x0003c;15% of the LT-HSCs were pyronin Y<sup>low</sup>, which indicated that most of the LT-HSCs had exited the G<sub>0</sub> phase. Judged by DNA contents, a significant increase in the proportion of S- and G2M-phase cells was also observed.</p><p>Second, we measured the rate of HSC proliferation by BrdU incorporation, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 d</xref>. At 10 d after pIpC treatment, nearly 60% of LT-HSCs in <italic>Tsc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>mx-1-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice incorporated BrdU after 24 h of labeling, which is nearly fourfold as high as those from the Ctrl mice (13%). Thus, the data in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 (a&#x02013;d)</xref> indicated that <italic>Tsc1</italic> deficiency drives HSCs from quiescence to rapid cell cycle.</p><p>By flow cytometry staining with Annexin V and 7&#x02013;aminoactinomycin D, we observed that the levels of apoptosis among Ctrl HSCs is low (1%), as compared with that of the whole BM (WBM; 7%; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 e</xref>). However, the apoptosis of <italic>Tsc1</italic> KO HSCs was increased by &#x0003e;10-fold (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 e</xref>). Overall, significant increases in both the frequency and number of HSCs were observed in the pIpC-treated <italic>Tsc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>mx-1-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 f</xref>). Therefore, the increase in proliferation appeared to dominate over apoptosis. The increase of apoptosis may explain the reduction in the frequency and absolute number of HSCs in <italic>Tsc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>mx-1-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice on day 30 when compared with those on day 10 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 f</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Targeted mutation of TSC1 causes HSC-intrinsic defects in hematopoiesis</title><p>Interestingly, despite the increase in HSC numbers, the pIpC-treated <italic>Tsc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>mx-1-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice have an &#x0223c;50% reduction in white blood cell counts (P &#x0003d; 0.001) at 30 d after the pIpC treatment, as measured by a complete blood count (CBC) test, most of which are contributed by reduced lymphocytes. The counts of monocytes and RBCs in the mutant mice appeared normal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>). To understand the hematopoiesis defects after the deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic>, we analyzed a representation of multiple lineages of hematopoietic cells in the BM. We found that in <italic>Tsc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>mx-1-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice, the BM cellularity is significantly reduced on day 10 of the pIpC treatments. The BM hypocellularity is more severe on day 30 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 b</xref>). Differentiated blood cells, such as B lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and erythroid cells, are also significantly reduced in the WBM compared with those in the Ctrl BM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Conditional deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic> results in abnormal hematopoiesis.</bold> The 6-wk-old <italic>Tsc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>mx-1-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice and the <italic>Tsc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>mx-1-cre<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> littermates were treated with pIpC, as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.

(f) Radioprotection by the Tsc1 mutant splenic HSCs. 20 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> spleen cells were injected into lethally irradiated recipients. The survival rates were compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052397f02"></graphic></fig><p>The BM hypocellularity could in theory be caused by increased apoptosis and/or defective proliferation. To evaluate the rate of proliferation of WT and KO BM in vivo, we pulsed the WT and KO mice with BrdU on day 10 after pIpC treatment and measured BrdU incorporation on total and Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> BM cells 24 h after the pulse. As shown in Fig. S1 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081297/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081297/DC1</ext-link>), the rate of BrdU incorporation was similar in WT and KO BM, regardless of whether the WBM or Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells were compared. To determine whether TSC1 deletion impaired the colony formation activity of progenitor cells, we compared the WT and KO BM for the number and types of colonies formed in a standard CFU assay. As shown in Table S1, an increase of total colonies, including that of granulocyte erythroid macrophage and megakaryocyte, and macrophage colonies was observed. The size of colonies from the KO BM was also actually somewhat larger (not depicted). In contrast, the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis (Annexin V<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>7&#x02013;aminoactinomycin D<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) was increased by almost fivefold in the KO BM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 e</xref>). Therefore, the paradoxical BM hypocellularity in the KO mice is likely caused by apoptosis. In the spleen of <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant mice, the B lymphocytes are reduced to half of those in Ctrl mice, whereas the erythroid cells are dramatically increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 d</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the numbers of megakaryocytes also increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 e</xref>), which suggested extramedullary hematopoiesis. Consistent with this notion, a significant numbers of HSCs was found in the <italic>Tsc1</italic>-deficient spleen but not in Ctrl spleen. The increase in the number of spleen HSCs persisted on day 30 after pIpC treatment, although this was decreased compared with that on day 10 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 e</xref>). The HSCs in the Tsc1-deficient spleen rescued the lethally irradiated recipients for &#x0003e;9 mo (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 f</xref>). However, because the HSCs have reduced self-renewal when their niche in BM is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), it is unlikely that the HSCs in the spleen are fully functional. Furthermore, the KO splenocytes gave rise to more CFUs, including granulocyte erythroid macrophage and megakaryocyte colonies (Table S1).</p><p>We performed BM transplantation (BMT) to test the functions of <italic>Tsc1</italic>-deficient HSCs. In serial BMT rescue experiments, we transplanted 10<sup>6</sup> WBM cells from either <italic>Tsc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>mx-1-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> or <italic>Tsc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>mx-1-cre<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice without pIpC treatment into lethally irradiated congenic CD45.1 recipients. Then we treated the recipients with pIpC every other day for 2 wk. After 12 more weeks, we killed the recipients and transplanted 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> WBM cells from the recipients into a second group of lethally irradiated CD45.1 recipients.

Using pS6 protein as a marker for mTOR activation, our data demonstrated a dramatic elevation of mTOR activity in the HSCs after the <italic>Tsc1</italic> deletion.</p><p>In conjunction with mTOR activation, we observed a massive increase in HSC proliferation, RNA synthesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and the production of ROS. Although it has been well established that adult HSCs divide slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), the pathway that keeps them in the G0 phase has been largely unclear. Our data demonstrate that the TSC&#x02013;mTOR pathway plays an essential role in keeping HSC in G0 phase. Increased proliferation of the HSCs has also been observed after a targeted mutation of the <italic>Pten</italic> gene in the HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Because Pten is a negative regulator of the PI3K&#x02013;AKT pathway, which in turn stimulates mTOR by inactivating the TSC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), it is likely that the inactivation of TSC1 is at least in part responsible for Pten-induced hyperproliferation of HSCs. On the other hand, a targeted mutation of <italic>p21</italic> is also known to induce hyperproliferation of HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Because the <italic>Tsc1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> HSCs actually had slightly higher levels of p21 transcript (unpublished data), a lack of quiescence of <italic>Tsc1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> HSCs cannot be caused by a reduction in <italic>p21</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Overactivation of mTOR alone is insufficient to cause hematological malignancies in the mice</title><p>Part of the phenotypes we presented in this paper, including the increased proliferation and lost functions, are consistent with those reported in the <italic>Pten</italic>-deficient HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Thus, even though it has been argued that the PI3K&#x02013;Akt pathway regulates the HSCs mainly through FOXOs instead of mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), our data are consistent with the notion that in HSCs, <italic>Pten</italic> is also an upstream regulator of the TSC&#x02013;mTOR pathway, as revealed in other models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). However, there are significant differences between <italic>Tsc1</italic>-deficient HSCs and <italic>Pten</italic>-deficient HSCs. Although <italic>Pten</italic> deletion promotes severe myeloproliferative disease within days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), we did not observe leukemia or other malignancies in mice with <italic>Tsc1</italic> deletion in HSCs.

Flow cytometry analysis also found no myeloid dysplasia, as reported in mice with a conditional deletion of the <italic>Pten</italic> gene (unpublished data). The inability of <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutation to cause cancer is supported by a general lack of cancer among TSC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). However, our data did not rule out the possibility that <italic>Tsc1</italic> deletion can provide one of several genetic changes necessary for tumorigenesis in the <italic>Pten</italic>-deficient BM.</p><p>It should be noted that the Pten protein resides in distinct cellular pools and can mediate functions other than regulating the TSC&#x02013;mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>).
