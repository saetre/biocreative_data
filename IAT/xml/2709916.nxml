Adult-generated OB interneurons are selected to survive in an experience-dependent way but the mechanisms that mediate the effects of experience on OB neurogenesis are unknown. Here we focus on the new-generated PGC population which is composed by multiple subtypes. Using paradigms of olfactory enrichment and/or deprivation combined to BrdU injections and quantitative confocal immunohistochemical analyses, we studied the effects of olfactory experience on adult-generated PGCs at different survival time and compared PGC to GC modulation. We show that olfactory enrichment similarly influences PGCs and GCs, increasing survival of newborn cells and transiently modulating GAD67 and plasticity-related molecules expression. However, PGC maturation appears to be delayed compared to GCs, reflecting a different temporal dynamic of adult generated olfactory interneuron integration. Moreover, olfactory enrichment or deprivation do not selectively modulate the survival of specific PGC phenotypes, supporting the idea that the integration rate of distinct PGC subtypes is independent from olfactory experience.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Different forms of plasticity, ranging from molecular, synaptic or morphological changes in individual cells to neurogenesis persist in the adult mammalian brain. The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb (OB) represent the two main regions in which new neurons are continuously generated and integrated in adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Luskin1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Cameron1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Neurogenesis in these systems has been demonstrated to be modulated by experience and correlated to learning and memory functions, suggesting that continual addition of new neurons in adult might be crucial for the processing of new informations in response to a complex changing environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Zhao1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In the adult brain, neuroblasts generated from the subventricular zone (SVZ) migrate tangentially in chains up to the core of the OB, where single cells detach from chains and start to migrate radially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Luskin1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Lois1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Among the thousands of neuroblasts that every day reach the adult OB, the large majority (about 90&#x00025;) stops in the granule cell layer (GCL), differentiating into granule cells (GCs), whereas the remaining 10&#x00025; reaches the glomerular layer (GL) and contributes to periglomerular cells (PGCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Luskin1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. GCs and PGCs are represented by multiple subtypes of inhibitory interneurons, mainly GABAergic, that modulate the activity of mitral and tufted output neurons by mediating the spatial and temporal coding of olfactory inputs and outputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Lledo1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, experience influences the survival of newborn neurons in the OB, and a critical period when their survival is determined in an experience-dependent manner has been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Yamaguchi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, but the mechanisms underlying this process are still largely unknown.</p><p>In this study, we focused on the PGC population which is highly heterogeneous in term of morphological, neurochemical and functional properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-ParrishAungst1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Puopolo1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, and analyzed the effect of olfactory enrichment on adult generated PGCs at different cellular ages following BrdU injection. We show that animals reared in enriched conditions, in parallel to increased survival of 3 weeks old PGCs, display decreased percentage of BrdU/GAD67 double-labelled cells and enhanced proportion of newborn cells expressing the plasticity-related molecules PSA-NCAM and doublecortin (DCX). Similar effects were found on newborn GCs, but at earlier ages compared to PGCs, reflecting a different temporal dynamic of GC integration. Consistently, while GC selection appears to be completed within few weeks after cell birth, continuous olfactory enrichment is necessary to sustain new-generated PGC survival at 6 weeks, and its removal during late phase of PGC maturation (3&#x02013;6 weeks) cancel the pro-survival effect. Finally, by using paradigms of olfactory enrichment or deprivation we show that olfactory experience does not influence the recruitment of specific PGC subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Continuous olfactory enrichment is critical to sustain survival of adult-born periglomerular cells</title><p>Integration of adult-born interneurons into existing olfactory circuits is modulated by olfactory enrichment, learning or deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Mandairon1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Mouret1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Mandairon2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, our results indicate that at longer survival time (6 weeks) the two populations behave differently: mice enriched for 3 weeks after BrdU injection and placed back to standard conditions for 3 more weeks retain enhanced survival of GCs, whereas the effect is not long-lasting on PGCs. Noteworthy, continuous olfactory enrichment for the whole survival period after BrdU injection (6 weeks) sustains higher survival rate of PGCs, having no effect on GC survival.

Our results support that once out from the &#x0201c;critical period&#x0201d;, survival of newborn GCs is no longer susceptible to olfactory experience. In contrast with these results, previous reports by Rochefort and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Rochefort2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> indicated that increased GC survival following olfactory enrichment is transitory and returns to basal level once animals are placed back to standard conditions, suggesting that GC survival can still be modulated by sensory experience. However, the study performed by Rochefort was based on a different time course (keeping animals in standard housing conditions for a longer period of time) and sample size.</p><p>We hypothesize that similarly to GCs the integration of PGCs into olfactory circuits undergoes a &#x0201c;critical period&#x0201d;, during which their fate between survival and death is regulated by sensory experience. The selection of adult born olfactory interneurons has been suggested to depend on their maturation stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Petreanu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and based on morphological and electrophysiological analysis PGCs differentiate more slowly than GCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Whitman1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Belluzzi1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Grubb1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistently, as shown by our time course analysis in standard conditions, adult generated PGCs and GCs follow a different temporal dynamic in cell selection: while the density of BrdU-immunopositive GCs declines from 10 days to 6 weeks post injection, the density of BrdU-positive cells in the GL increases from 10 days to 3 weeks after injection, declining at 6 weeks. According to the observed sensibility of newborn PGCs to sensory experience at longer survival time, their &#x0201c;critical period&#x0201d; appears to be either shifted or prolonged compared to GCs, possibly as a consequence of their different maturation time course.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Olfactory enrichment modulates GAD67 expression in new-generated olfactory interneurons and enhances expression of cell plasticity-related molecules</title><p>The majority of SVZ-progenitors mature into GABAergic interneurons in the olfactory bulb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-ParrishAungst1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Kohwi1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our results reveal that GAD67 expression in periglomerular and granule cells correlates with their maturation process. Indeed, the percentage of new-generated cells immunopositive for GAD67 progressively increases while maturation proceeds reaching 22.5&#x00025; of PGCs and 54.3&#x00025; of GCs 42 days after cell birth. These values are consistent to the estimated proportion of GAD67 immunopositive cells on the overall neuronal population in the GL and GCL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-ParrishAungst1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We show that olfactory enrichment, besides influencing survival of newborn interneurons, also modulates GAD67 expression in these cells. The most striking effect was observed at 3 weeks post-BrdU injection in the GL, where the percentage of BrdU/GAD67 double-positive PGCs is drastically lowered in enriched compared to control animals, returning to control value at 6 weeks. We thus infer that the observed transient reduction reflects a modulation of GAD67 expression in newborn PGCs. Accordingly, in other sensory systems, the GABAergic network has been demonstrated to be dynamically modulated by external inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Chang1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Sale1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, a reduction by 35&#x00025; was also observed in the percentage of double-labelled BrdU/GAD67 cells in the GCL of enriched mice, indicating that olfactory enrichment influences GAD67 expression in both populations of olfactory interneurons. However, the modulation of GAD67 expression in GCs occurs earlier (at 10 days post-BrdU injection) compared to PGCs, coherently to the different maturation profile of the two populations.</p><p>Based on these results we hypothesize that the decreased percentage of BrdU/GAD67 double-labelled cells corresponds to a delayed expression of GAD67 which, in turn, might reflect a retard in the maturation of newborn OB interneurons. We thus analyzed PSA-NCAM and DCX, two cell plasticity-related molecules known to be expressed by neuroblasts and down-regulated once cells become mature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Brown1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Giachino1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In standard conditions, the percentage of PGCs double-labelled for BrdU and DCX sharply decreases from 10 to 21 days post-BrdU injection reaching almost undetectable levels at 42 days. Down-regulation of PSA-NCAM in newborn PGCs appears to be slower and levels of PSA-NCAM expression remain higher at both 21 and 42 days post-BrdU injection, compared to DCX. These findings are consistent to data obtained in the hippocampus showing that PSA-NCAM expression in newborn cells persists longer compared to DCX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Seki1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our results show that olfactory enrichment modulates both PSA-NCAM and DCX expression in adult born PGCs, enhancing the percentage of 3 weeks old BrdU/PSA-NCAM or DCX double-labelled cells. Similarly, newborn GCs display higher percentage of PSA-NCAM labelled cells; however, according to GCs temporal dynamic and GAD67 regulation, PSA-NCAM up-regulation in enriched animals was detected earlier, on 10 days old BrdU-positive cells. A trend to increase in the percentage of BrdU/DCX double-positive GCs was also observed, but the values did not reach a statistically significant difference. In general, both in the GL and GCL, the effect of olfactory enrichment is more evident on PSA-NCAM modulation. This is possibly a consequence of different temporal dynamics in PSA-NCAM and DCX expression in newborn cells and/or of the wider involvement of PSA-NCAM in structural plasticity processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Brown1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>No difference in DCX and PSA-NCAM expression has been detected in 42 days old PGCs suggesting that olfactory enrichment enhances newborn PGCs plasticity possibly delaying their maturation that is however reached within 6 weeks after cell birth.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Environmental inputs influence survival of adult-generated OB cells without altering the balance between specific interneuron populations</title><p>Periglomerular and granule cells are subdivided into several subtypes, differing in their functions within the OB circuit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006359-Shepherd1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although we can not exclude that following different protocols of olfactory deprivation (i.e. analysis of cells at different survival time) an effect could be found, these findings straighten the specific role played by olfactory enrichment on GAD67 expression modulation and its possible implication in plasticity mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>In the OB, newborn neurons integrate in pre-existing circuits, where they play a role in brain plasticity and underlie some forms of olfactory learning and memory. While cell autonomous mechanisms appear to govern much of the final identity of new-generated cells, we show that sensory enrichment can modulate survival and enhance plasticity of adult-generated olfactory interneurons likely retarding their maturation. The enhancement of cell plasticity might represent a strategy allowing the establishment of fine-tuned neuronal circuits in response to increased sensory inputs; the formation of proper connections will possibly allow augmented survival of newborn cells according to an activity-dependent selection process.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals and housing conditions</title><p>Experiments were performed on 59 male C57BL/6J strain mice (8 weeks; Charles River, Calco, Italy; Charles River).
