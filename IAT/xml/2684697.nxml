Here, we show that GATA-1, the master transcription factor of erythropoiesis, forms a tricomplex with the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and E2F-2. This interaction requires a LXCXE motif that is evolutionary conserved among GATA-1 orthologs yet absent from the other GATA family members. GATA-1/pRb/E2F-2 complex formation stalls cell proliferation and steers erythroid precursors towards terminal differentiation. This process can be disrupted in vitro by FOG-1, which displaces pRb/E2F-2 from GATA-1. A GATA-1 mutant unable to bind pRb fails to inhibit cell proliferation and results in mouse embryonic lethality by anemia.

The earliest erythroid progenitor identifiable possesses remnant stem cell characteristics as it both self-renews and differentiates. Each progenitor gives rise to more than 10,000 cells, including secondary progenitors. Yet, during the next stage of differentiation, much of this renewal capability is lost, and terminal erythroid differentiation progresses in a stepwise manner through several stages separated by a single mitosis. The transcription factor GATA-1 is essential for erythroid differentiation because it induces the expression of all the known erythroid-specific genes. Here, we show that GATA-1 directly interacts with proteins that are central to the process of cell division: the retinoblastoma protein pRb and the transcription factor E2F. Specifically, E2F becomes inactivate after engaging in a GATA-1/pRb/E2F tricomplex. Another erythroid transcription factor, termed FOG-1, is able to displace pRb/E2F from this complex in vitro upon binding to GATA-1. We hypothesize that the liberated pRb/E2F can then be the target of subsequent regulation to ultimately release free E2F, which triggers cell division. The physiological role of this new pathway is evidenced by transgenic mouse experiments with GATA-1 mutants unable to bind pRb/E2F, which result in embryonic lethality by anemia.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>With more than 100 billion red blood cells generated every day, the erythroid lineage has the largest quantitative output of cell production in adult mammals.

Serine is structurally similar to cysteine but contains a hydroxyl (-OH) group in place of the thiol (-SH) group. Neither of these two motifs (LXCXE and LXSXE) is present in any of the other members of the GATA family (i.e., GATA-2 to -6; unpublished data). To probe for the functionality of this putative Rb-binding domain in hGATA-1 in vivo, NIH-3T3 cells, which do not express GATA-1, were transduced with retroviral vectors that encode either mGATA-1 or hGATA1. Cross coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) analysis with GATA-1 and pRb (p110) specific antibodies (Abs) confirmed the hypothesis that pRb is associated with h/mGATA-1 in this reconstituted model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000123.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), thus suggesting that both LXCXE and LXSXE motifs are functional within the GATA-1 proteins for pRb binding. To demonstrate that pRb/hGATA-1 interaction is specifically dependent upon the LNCME motif, NIH-3T3 cells were transduced with retroviral vectors that express either (1) hGATA-1, (2) a naturally occurring N-terminally truncated form of hGATA-1, referred to as hGATA-1s (&#x0201c;s&#x0201d; for &#x0201c;short&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000123-Wechsler1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>), which is initiated at methionine 84 within the LNCM<sup>84</sup>E motif, or (3) hGATA-1 bearing two amino acid substitutions within the LNCME motif (LNCME to LNGMK; referred to as hGATA-1Rb<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000123-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

There are 16 possible CDK phosphorylation sites (Ser/Thr-Pro motifs) in pRB. By western blot analysis, Rb proteins segregate into two distinctly clustered groups of migrating bands: the more slowly migrating correspond to the so-called &#x0201c;hyperphosphorylated&#x0201d; forms, whereas the faster migrating are the &#x0201c;hypophosphorylated&#x0201d; forms, without defined species phosphorylated on specific residues among the 16 always present. Co-IP with an anti&#x02013;GATA-1 Ab followed by western blot analysis with an anti-pRb Ab indicated that only the hypophosphorylated (&#x0201c;p&#x0201d;) forms of pRb were involved in the GATA-1/pRb complex, while one could detect both hypophosphorylated and (&#x0201c;pp&#x0201d;) hyperphosphorylated forms of pRb by IP of the original sample with an anti-pRb antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000123-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Because available pRb antibodies are notoriously fastidious at differentiating hypo- from hyperphosphorylated pRb with optimal clarity, an additional experiment was performed by means of antibodies to phospho-pRb. Co-IP was first performed with specific phospho-pRb antibodies (Pser<sup>780</sup>, Pser<sup>807/811</sup>, or Pser<sup>795</sup>) before resolution by western blot analysis reacted with a GATA-1 antibody. We found that GATA-1 was not precipitated under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000123-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Because hypophosphorylated pRb is known to bind members of the E2F family and actively suppress their transcriptional activity, whereas it has been recently reported that only E2F-2&#x02014;among all the E2F members present in end-stage (CD71<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, TER119<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) fetal liver erythroid cells&#x02014;directly interacts with pRb (p110) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000123-Dirlam1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, we investigated whether E2F-2 is present within the GATA-1/pRb complex. To this end, we purified CD71<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> erythroid cells (&#x0003e;90&#x00025; TER119<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) from embryonic day (E)12.5 mouse fetal liver. We first established that all Abs used were efficient and specific by immunoprecipitation (IP) and western blot analysis and that signals were not Ig artifacts (IgG isotype controls), especially for GATA-1 proteins that migrate at levels similar to heavy Ig chains (50 kDa) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000123.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Results of co-IP experiments demonstrated that GATA-1, pRb, and E2F-2 do exist as a tricomplex in nuclear extracts from purified E12.5 mouse fetal liver erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000123.s002">Figure S2C and S2D</xref>).</p><p>To further characterize the molecular composition of the GATA-1/pRb/E2F-2 tricomplex, we performed a co-IP assay with an Ab specific for E2F-2 followed by western blot analysis reacted with Abs specific for either pRb, GATA-1, or FOG-1, the known partner of GATA-1. Whereas GATA-1 and pRb proteins could be identified within the E2F-2 immunoprecipitate, FOG-1 was not found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000123-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). As we previously demonstrated that GATA-1 is directly associated with pRb and that GATA-1 is not known to bind directly to E2F-2, we can thus surmise that two pRb complexes can possibly coexist in nuclear extracts from fetal liver erythroid cells: pRb/E2F-2 and GATA-1/pRb/E2F-2. To probe whether the presence of E2F-2 is required for GATA-1/pRb complex formation, we first performed an immunodepletion of E2F-2 followed by western blot analysis of the unbound fraction with GATA-1 or pRb specific Abs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000123.s002">Figure S2E</xref>).

To this end, we generated pure populations of NIH3T3 cells that express hGATA-1 after retroviral transfer, in which we subsequently transiently transfected various amounts of a plasmid that expresses human FOG-1 (hFOG-1). We chose NIH3T3 cells because they constitutively express E2F proteins, including E2F-2, although they do not naturally express GATA-1 or FOG-1 in the absence of transfection. Co-IP assays showed that hFOG-1 was able, in a dose-dependant manner, to prevent hGATA-1 from forming a complex with pRb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000123-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). To assess whether a direct protein&#x02013;protein interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is required to dissociate pRb from GATA-1, we expressed relevant mutants of hGATA-1 and hFOG-1 in NIH3T3 cells following an identical experimental approach. We made use of the hGATA-1<sup>V205G</sup> mutant, which comprises a point mutation that substitutes a glycine for a valine at codon 205.

In parallel, the GATA-1/FOG-1 complex exerts its transcriptional effects as part of the program of erythroid differentiation, as exemplified by the extinction of c-Kit expression.

NIH-3T3 cells were transduced with the &#x0201c;empty&#x0201d; retroviral vector (Migr) or with retroviral vectors encoding either human (h) or murine (m) GATA-1. We verified that &#x0003e;90&#x00025; cells were successfully transduced by each of the retroviral vectors on the basis of coexpression of eGFP from an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). IPs of GATA-1 (5 &#x000b5;g, &#x003b1;-GATA-1: M-20, sc-1234; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or pRb (5 &#x000b5;g, &#x003b1;-pRb, n&#x000b0; 554136; BD Pharmingen) were performed with 500 &#x000b5;g of nuclear extract. IPs using 5 &#x000b5;g of nonimmune IgG isotype of the corresponding species (normal goat IgG sc-2028 for GATA-1 and normal mouse IgG sc-2025 for pRb; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for each transfection as negative controls for the specificity of the precipitation and coprecipitation obtained with each immune antibody used in the IP and co-IP experiments. Nuclear extracts before IP (input 5&#x00025;) and bound proteins were resolved by western blot analysis using the antibody against GATA-1 (&#x003b1;-GATA-1 M-20, sc-1234; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or pRb (&#x003b1;-pRb, n&#x000b0; 554136; BD Pharmingen) as indicated. The horseradish peroxydase-conjugated secondary Ab used (Affinipure goat anti-rat IgG light chain specific, 112-035-175; Affinipure goat anti-mouse IgG light chain specific, 115-035-175) was provided from Jackson Immunoresearch and did not recognize reduced denaturated IgG heavy chains that comigrate at 50 kDa near GATA-1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacksonimmuno.com/catalog/CatPages/rblc.asp">http://www.jacksonimmuno.com/catalog/CatPages/rblc.asp</ext-link>). These secondary Abs were used in all the blotting assays of this paper. This experiment indicates that both human and murine GATA-1 interact with endogenous murine pRb with the same efficiency. (B) Control of the specificity of the Abs utilized. NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with the &#x0201c;empty&#x0201d; retroviral vector (Migr) or with retroviral vectors encoding for either hGATA-1, hGATA-1Rb<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, or hGATA-1s. IP of GATA-1 (&#x003b1;-GATA-1 M-20, sc-1234; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or pRb (&#x003b1;-pRb; BD Pharmingen) were performed on 500 &#x000b5;g of nuclear extract. Nonimmune IgG (mouse for pRb and goat for GATA-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as controls for each transfection (lanes 2, 7 12, 17, and 4, 9, 14, 19, respectively). Nuclear extracts before IP (input 5&#x00025;, lane 1, 6, 11, and 16) and bound proteins were resolved by western blot analysis using the Ab against GATA-1 (&#x003b1;-GATA-1 N-1 sc-266; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or pRb (phospho-specific pRbs: pRbPser780, pRbPser870/811, and pRbPser795 PhosphoPlus Rb antibody Kit Cat. N&#x000b0; 9300; Cell Signaling Technology) as indicated. We thus conclude that only wt GATA-1 can interact with pRb as shown by the complex coprecipitated by GATA-1 antibody as well as the pRb antibody. This interaction is specific as no complex was found in the IgG control lane. Neither GATA-1Rb<sup>&#x02212;</sup> nor GATA-1s can interact with pRb (even with a large amount of protein), indicating that the LNCME motif is required for the interaction.</p><p>(2.13 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1000123.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1000123.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p><bold>GATA-1 forms a complex with pRb and E2F-2 in primary erythroid cells.</bold> (A) Experimental procedures used for (B&#x02013;D). Fetal livers were dissected from C57BL/6 embryos at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and disaggregated in &#x003b1;-MEM supplemented with phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>; Sigma), phosphoserine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors (20 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mM &#x003b2;-glycerophosphate; Sigma), and proteinase inhibitors (Roche) to a single-cell suspension by serial passage through a 23-ga needle, followed by a 27-ga needle. Viability of cells was assessed by Trypan blue staining (&#x0003c;0.5&#x00025; of positive cells), and erythroid differentiation stages were checked by cell surface labeling using the following Abs: phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse TER119 (TER119-PE; BD Pharmingen, cat N&#x000b0;553673), APC-conjugated anti-mouse CD117 (c-Kit; BD Pharmingen, cat N&#x000b0;553356), biotin-conjugated anti-mouse CD71 (BD Pharmingen, cat N&#x000b0;557416), and streptavidin-PEPC5 secondary antibodies (BD Pharmingen). Flow cytometry was performed on an aliquot of 10<sup>5</sup> cells using FACScan, and data were analyzed with the DIVA software. Eighty-five percent to 90&#x00025; of fetal liver cells were CD71<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TER119<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> c-Kit<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, showing a majority of cells at the late stage of erythroid differentiation. Nuclear extract were prepared as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> except that the glycerol concentration was 10&#x00025; instead of 5&#x00025; to allow for an improved recovery of nuclear pellets. IPs were then performed on equal amounts of nuclear extract (500 &#x000b5;g per point) using specific Abs or nonimmune-related (control) Abs. Immunoprecipitated proteins (bound, lanes 2 and 4) were analyzed by western blot (WB) as well as a 5&#x00025; fraction of nuclear extract before (input, lane 1) and after (supernatant, lane 3 and 5) each IP. Nucleophosmin (Nph), which does not bind to GATA-1 or pRb complexes, was used as a negative control of the specificity of coprecipitation (lane 6). (B) Efficiency and specificity of immunoprecipitating Abs. IPs were performed using nuclear lysates from E12.5 fetal livers using specific Abs against GATA-1 (sc-1233; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), pRb (554136; BD Pharmingen), E2F-2 (sc-633; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FOG-1 (sc-9361; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Nph (sc-6013R; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or with nonimmune corresponding (control) Abs, respectively, normal goat IgG (sc-2028), normal mouse IgG (sc-2025), and normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were analyzed by western blot using the same Abs (except for GATA-1, where the sc-266 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology was used). As expected, all the proteins were totally immunodepleted from the nuclear extracts, and no signal was detected in the supernatants after each IP (lane 4 versus 5). This depletion thus demonstrates specific antigen&#x02013;Ab interactions, since no protein is immunoprecipitated by the related control Ab (lane 2) or by a nonspecific Ab (Nph, lane 6). (C) Identification of GATA-1 complexes in fetal liver erythroid cells and relevant Ab controls in co-IP assays. Co-IPs were performed using nuclear lysates from E12.5 fetal livers, as described in (A). The first step of IP was performed with either a specific Ab directed against GATA-1 (sc-1233; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a nonimmune corresponding Ab (control Ab: normal goat IgG sc-2028), or nonspecific anti-Nph Ab. Coprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by western blot using the same Abs as in (B), referred at the left-hand side of the figure. None of the proteins studied is unspecifically coprecipitated with the nonimmune idiotype (lane 2) or a nonspecific antibody (lane 6) even in the presence of a large amount of proteins. As expected, FOG-1, a known partner of GATA-1, is coprecipitated and serves as a positive control (lane 4). Endogenous pRb and E2F2 are also copurified with GATA-1 in a specific manner (lanes 4b and 4c). Note that a small portion of each fraction remains unassociated with GATA-1, corresponding to free proteins or to distinct complexes that exclude GATA-1 (lane 5). (D) Identification of E2F2 complexes in fetal liver erythroid cells and relevant Ab controls in co-IP assays. Same as in (C), except that the first step of IP was performed with either a specific Ab directed against E2F-2 (sc-633; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a nonimmune corresponding Ab (control Ab: normal rabbit IgG sc-2027), or nonspecific anti-Nph Ab. As obtained in (C), pRb, the E2F-2 known partner, is copurified by E2F-2 immunodepletion (lane 4b), and we show that GATA-1 is also coprecipitated (lane 4a). These observations allow us to propose the existence of a ternary complex containing pRb, GATA-1, and E2F-2. This complex excludes FOG-1: no FOG-1 protein is observed in lane 4d, and the totality of FOG-1 is recovered in the supernatant (lane 5d versus lane 3d). As a faint amount of GATA-1 and pRb remain in the supernatant (lane 5a), this experiment cannot in and of itself exclude the possibility that GATA-1 and pRb can form a binary complex without E2F-2. The convincing evidence that GATA-1 and pRb do not form a bicomplex in the absence of E2F-2 is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000123-g001">Figure 1D</xref>.

Firefly luciferase activity was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System; Promega), and individual transfections were normalized by quantification of Renilla luciferase activity (pRL-TK; Promega). The total amount of DNA was kept constant at 700 ng in each transfection (500 ng of expression plasmid, 100 ng of reporter plasmid, and 100 ng of pRL-TK plasmid per well of a 24-well plate).
