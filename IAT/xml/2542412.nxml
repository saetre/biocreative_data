We have investigated the molecular basis for how EBV latent infection promotes the development of NPC. We show that the viral EBNA1 protein, previously known to be required to maintain the EBV episomes, also causes the disruption of the cellular PML (promyelocytic leukemia) nuclear bodies (or ND10s). This disruption occurs both in the context of a native latent infection and when exogenously expressed in EBV-negative NPC cells and involves loss of the PML proteins. We also show that EBNA1 is partially localized to PML nuclear bodies in NPC cells and interacts with a specific PML isoform. PML disruption by EBNA1 requires binding to the cellular ubiquitin specific protease, USP7 or HAUSP, but is independent of p53. We further observed that p53 activation, DNA repair and apoptosis, all of which depend on PML nuclear bodies, were impaired by EBNA1 expression and that cells expressing EBNA1 were more likely to survive after induction of DNA damage. The results point to an important role for EBNA1 in the development of NPC, in which EBNA1-mediated disruption of PML nuclear bodies promotes the survival of cells with DNA damage.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects most people worldwide and is associated with several types of cancer due to its ability to induce cell proliferation. Only one viral protein, EBNA1, is expressed in all forms of EBV-associated tumors. Here, we have investigated whether EBNA1 directly contributes to the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), the most common EBV-associated tumor. We found that EBNA1 disrupts structures in the cell nucleus, called PML bodies, that are known to inhibit malignant transformation and to be important for cells to repair DNA that has been damaged due to exposure to carcinogenic agents. We show that EBNA1 interacts with and degrades the principal component of PML bodies. As a result, cells expressing EBNA1 are less able to repair their DNA and more likely to survive with DNA damage that could result in malignant transformation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is widely recognized as a causative agent of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), as most NPC tumors are monoclonal proliferations of latently EBV-infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-RaabTraub1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

EBNA1 enables the expression of the other EBV latency proteins, however, whether or not EBNA1 directly contributes to the development of tumors has not been clear.</p><p>A number of observations in the literature are consistent with a role for EBNA1 in the proliferation of EBV-positive cells. For example, interference with EBNA1 function in EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma cells, by overexpression of a dominant-negative EBNA1 mutant, increased cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Kennedy1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, down-regulation of EBNA1 in Raji Burkitt's lymphoma or EBV-positive epithelial cells by RNA interference decreased cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Hong1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Yin1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, since EBNA1 is needed to maintain the EBV episomes and to enhance expression of other latency proteins, it is not clear from the above observations whether EBNA1 is directly affecting cell proliferation or is functioning indirectly by enabling expression of other EBV gene products.</p><p>Other studies have investigated whether expressing EBNA1 in various EBV-negative cancer cells affects tumorgenicity. EBNA1 expression in HONE-1 NPC cells was found to increase primary tumor formation as well as metastases in nude mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Sheu1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, Kaul et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Kaul1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> found that expression of EBNA1 in a breast carcinoma cell line promoted the rate of tumor growth in nude mice, reversed the growth inhibitory effect of the cellular Nm23-H1 protein and increased lung metastases.</p><p>The molecular basis for the observed effects of EBNA1 on cell proliferation are largely unknown, although an interaction between EBNA1 and the cellular ubiquitin specific protease, USP7 or HAUSP, has been proposed to be partially responsible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Holowaty1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. USP7 binds and stabilizes p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Li1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, and EBNA1 was found to block the USP7-p53 interaction <italic>in vitro</italic> by competing for the same binding pocket on USP7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Holowaty2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Sheng1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In keeping with these findings, expression of EBNA1 (but not a USP7-binding mutant of EBNA1) in U2OS cells was shown to protect these cells from apoptosis in response to DNA damage by interfering with p53 stabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Saridakis1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. However, USP7 is likely to have multiple cellular roles and the functional significance of the EBNA1-USP7 interaction remains to be determined in the context of latent EBV infection.</p><p>Few studies have investigated the role of EBNA1 in NPC. Studies on the contribution of EBV proteins to NPC in general have been hampered by the lack of EBV-positive NPC cell lines, since NPC cells tend to rapidly lose the EBV genomes when propagated in culture. The isolation of a NPC cell line (C666-1) that stably maintains EBV episomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Cheung1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> has greatly facilitated NPC studies, enabling a comparison to EBV-negative NPC cell lines. We have compared C666-1 cells to the EBV-negative NPC cell lines CNE2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Sun1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and HK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Huang1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> in order to better understand cellular alterations caused by EBV infection that may contribute to cell transformation. Here we show that EBV latent infection in NPC cells is associated with the disruption of host PML nuclear bodies (NBs) and that EBNA1 is entirely responsible for this effect. Consistent with the known importance of PML NBs in p53 activation and DNA damage responses, we also show that EBNA1 expression in NPC impairs both of these processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>EBNA1 disrupts PML NBs in NPC cells</title><p>In initial studies comparing EBV-positive and EBV-negative NPC cell lines, we examined the host PML NBs, which have the PML protein as the main constituent and have been implicated in many important cellular processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Bernardi1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

EBNA1 expression in both cell lines resulted in a notable decrease in the number of PML NBs per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000170-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To further verify that this effect was caused by EBNA1, CNE2E cells were treated with siRNA to down-regulate EBNA1 expression. EBNA1 silencing restored the number of PML NBs to the level seen in the parent CNE2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000170-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We also examined whether transient expression of EBNA1 was sufficient to cause PML disruption.

To address the mechanism by which EBNA1 expression disrupts PML NBs, we compared the levels of PML isoforms in CNE2 before and after stable (CNE2E) or transient expression of EBNA1 by Western blotting. PML is known to exist as several isoforms (comprised of alternative spliced and modified forms), resulting in multiple bands migrating between 60 and 200 Kda on PML immunoblots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Everett2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Condemine1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Down-regulation of EBNA1 expression in C666 cells resulted in increased expression of all PML isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000170-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Similarly, EBNA1 expression in CNE2E resulted in a dramatic decrease in all PML isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000170-g003">Figure 3B</xref> compare lanes 1 and 2), which was restored by silencing EBNA1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000170-g003">Figure 3B</xref> lanes 3 and 4). In addition, transient EBNA1 expression in CNE2 decreased the level of all PML isoforms in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000170-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore EBNA1 expression results in the loss of PML protein, as opposed to dispersal of PML from the foci. However the level of another PML NB component, Sp100, was unaffected by EBNA1 demonstrating the specificity of this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000170-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Effects of EBNA1 expression on the level of PML mRNA was also examined by RT-PCR to rule out potential effects on PML transcription.

This ability of EBNA1 to disrupt PML NBs in cells of the nasopharnyx could be part of the reason that these cells are particularly susceptible to malignant transformation by EBV.</p><p>We found that EBNA1 is partly associated with PML NBs in a native latent infection in NPC cells and can physically associate with at least one PML isoform that appears to be PML IV. We have also shown that disruption of the PML NBs by EBNA1 is due to loss of multiple isoforms of the PML protein and that this effect is proteasome-dependent. This suggests that EBNA1 is targeted to PML bodies through an interaction with PML IV but, once there, can promote the degradation of all PML isoforms.</p><p>The disruption of PML NBs by EBNA1 requires EBNA1 binding to USP7, a cellular ubiquitin specific protease that is known to associate with PML NBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Meredith1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. There are several possible scenarios of the role of the EBNA1-USP7 interaction in PML-disruption as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000170-g009">Figure 9</xref>. In scenario I, EBNA1 mediates the interaction between a specific PML isoform (ie. PML IV) and USP7 thereby increasing recruitment of USP7 to PML NBs. USP7 could then promote PML degradation either through its catalytic activity or through recruitment of additional cellular proteins. It is not intuitively obvious why deubiquitination would lead to PML destabilization, however approximately three quarters of USP7 is comprised of protein interaction domains, so recruitment of additional cellular enzymes to PML is a viable possibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Holowaty2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Sheng1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-vanderKnaap1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Hu1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. In scenarios II and III, the interaction of EBNA1 with PML NBs depends entirely (scenario II) or partly (scenario III) on USP7. In these cases, loss of PML may require the recruitment of additional cellular proteins by EBNA1, since EBNA1 itself is not known to have any enzymatic activities. For example, we have previously shown that EBNA1 forms a stable complex with casein kinase 2 (CK2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Holowaty1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and Scaglioni et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000170-Scaglioni1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> showed that phosphorylation of PML by CK2 targets PML proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.
