Recombination between two S232-like sequences flanking the steroid sulfatase locus has been shown to cause frequent deletions in the X chromosome short arm, resulting in steroid sulfatase deficiency. We now report the characterization of several S232-like sequences. Restriction mapping and sequence analysis show that each S232 unit contains 5 kb of unique sequence in addition to two elements, RU1 and RU2, composed of a variable number of tandem repeats. RU1 consists of 30 bp repeating units and its length shows minimal variation between individuals. The RU2 elements in the hypervariable S232 loci on the X chromosome consist of repeating sequences which are highly asymmetric, with about 90% purines and no C's on one strand. The X-derived RU2 elements range from 0.6 kb to over 23 kb among different individuals, accounting entirely for the observed polymorphism at the S232 loci. Although the repeating units of the RU2 elements in the nonpolymorphic S232 loci on the Y chromosome share high sequence homology with those on the X chromosome, they exhibit much higher intrarepeat sequence variation. S232 homologous sequences are found in great apes, old world and new world monkeys. In chimpanzees and gorillas the S232-like sequences are polymorphic in length.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00079-0162-a" xlink:role="1118"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00079-0164-a" xlink:role="1120"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00079-0165-a" xlink:role="1121"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00079-0161.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1117"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00079-0162.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1118"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00079-0163.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1119"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00079-0164.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1120"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00079-0165.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1121"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00079-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1122"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
