Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) due to impaired aqueous humor drainage can cause optic nerve damage and death of retinal ganglion cells, leading to blindness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Therefore, there is a great need for understanding the regulation of aqueous humor drainage and finding the molecular targets for novel treatment of increased IOP in glaucoma patients. IOP depends on a balance between aqueous humor secretion from the ciliary body (CB) epithelium and aqueous humor outflow in the trabecular meshwork (TM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. In open angle glaucoma patients, it is generally believed that the production of aqueous humor is not increased, but that drainage is impaired due to increased resistance at a level in the outflow pathway close to the inner wall of Schlemm&#x02019;s canal (SC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Aqueous humor is drained predominantly through conventional route, consisting of the TM, juxtacanalicular area, and SC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>].</p><p>Cellular contraction and relaxation properties of both TM and ciliary muscle (CM) have been reported to influence aqueous humor outflow, and thus IOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Both TM and CM exhibit smooth muscle-like properties and contain functional muscarinic, &#x003b1;-adrenergic, and &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Interestingly, the contractile status of TM and CM has been demonstrated to exert antagonistic effects on aqueous humor outflow, with contraction of the TM leading to decreased aqueous humor outflow, and CM contraction causing increases in aqueous humor drainage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Moreover, several studies have demonstrated the influence of the Rho GTPase/Rho kinase pathway, myosin II, myosin light chain kinase, and actin polymerization on aqueous humor drainage via the TM outflow pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. The Rho/Rho kinase pathway regulates smooth muscle contraction in a calcium-independent manner via myosin II phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Agonists of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), including angiotensin II, thromboxane A2, lysophosphatidic acid, endothelin-1, and thrombin, induce Rho GTPase activation and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation in TM cells. Perfusion with some of these agonists has been observed to decrease aqueous humor outflow in enucleated eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>], yet inhibition of Rho/Rho kinase and myosin II phosphorylation in the trabecular outflow pathway increases aqueous humor outflow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Taken together, though, these different observations strongly support a potential role for several signaling mechanisms (e.g., GPCR and Rho/Rho kinase-dependent pathways) in the regulation of aqueous humor outflow, the role of these different signaling pathways in mediating the effects of TM and CM contractility on IOP homeostasis is yet to be delineated.</p><p>Because TM and CM are smooth muscle-like, we hypothesized that regulator of G-protein signaling 2 (RGS2), a regulatory protein that promotes vascular smooth muscle relaxation and blood pressure homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>], might control IOP. RGS2 is one of more than 20 RGS proteins that regulate signaling via GPCRs in part by accelerating the deactivation rates of G&#x003b1; subunits via GTP hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. RGS2 preferentially deactivates G&#x003b1;q [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>], which mediates signaling by GPCRs for many important vasoconstrictors including angiotensin II, endothelin-1, and vasopressin signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Activated G&#x003b1;q in turn triggers smooth muscle contraction via phospholipase C-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and subsequent increase in MLC phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin-dependent MLC kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. G&#x003b1;q can also trigger Rho GTPase signaling by certain Rho exchange factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. Homozygous deletion of RGS2 in mice increases blood pressure by impairing the ability of the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway to promote vascular relaxation because inhibition of vasoconstrictor-triggered G&#x003b1;q signaling is abrogated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>].</p><p>To explore a potential role of RGS2 and G&#x003b1;q-coupled GPCR signaling in IOP homeostasis, we examined RGS2 knockout mice (RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) for changes in IOP in this study. Here we report decreased IOP and increased retinal ganglion cell survival in RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, possibly a result of increased CM contraction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>We used the well characterized homozygous RGS2 knockout (RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mouse strain along with the littermate wild-type mice obtained from the Blumer laboratory, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. The genetic background of this mouse strain was C57BL/6. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genotyping was performed using tail DNA to select the RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Male RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice 12 to 15 months old and littermate wild-type mice were used in this study. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research, under an approved Duke University institutional animal protocol. Animals were maintained under a standard 12 h:12 h light-dark cycle.

Briefly, the wild-type and RGS2<italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were gently restrained in a clear, cone-shaped plastic bag with their heads facing out, and they were tied to the flat plastic stand as described by Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Prior to IOP measurements, 0.5% proparacaine anesthetic solution (Bausch &#x00026; Lomb, Tampa, FL) was applied to the eyes. IOP was measured in both left and right eyes between 11 AM and 4 PM (12 h day light cycle is from 7 AM to 7 PM), and each value was based on an average of five independent tonometer readings. IOP measurements were performed once a week for five weeks on the same animals. Changes in IOP values between the RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and littermate wild-type mice were compared at weekly intervals as well as based on the average value of five independent weekly measurements. IOP was expressed per eye, and the sample number was 10 in each group.</p></sec><sec><title>Histology</title><p>The mice were euthanized with intraperitoneal injection (150&#x000a0;mg/kg bodyweight) of sodium pentobarbital solution (obtained from Ovation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Deerfield, IL) and followed by a heart puncture.

Then the eyes were dissected into anterior and posterior segments and rinsed twice for 15 min with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. These tissue specimens were postfixed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer containing 1% osmium tetroxide for 1.5 h at room temperature and rinsed twice for 15 min with cacodylate buffer.

The tissue specimens were then shifted to 30% sucrose and incubated overnight before embedding in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (Tissue-Tek obtained from Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and cryosectioning by cryotome (Microm HM550, Microm, Germany). The tissue cryosections derived from the anterior segment (8&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m) and posterior segment (10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m) were air dried, washed three times in PBS, and incubated with Image-iT FX Signal Enhancer (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min. The anterior sections were washed three times in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 2 min, and blocked with 3% fetal bovine serum for 2 h at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The blocked sections were incubated with phalloidin conjugated with tetra rhodamine isothiocyanate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 20 min at room temperature. Retinal sections (posterior segments) for ganglion cell staining were washed three times in PBS for 2 min each and incubated in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min.

Increased IOP linked to impaired aqueous humor drainage has been considered a major risk factor for glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Although various agonists and antagonists of GPCRs have been documented to influence aqueous humor outflow and IOP, very little is known about the identity of predominant GPCR signaling pathways regulating aqueous humor outflow and IOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. To explore the involvement of G&#x003b1;q-coupled GPCR signaling in IOP homeostasis, we evaluated IOP changes in RGS2 null mice (RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) in this study. G&#x003b1;q is a GPCR-coupled G-protein that stimulates the contractile activity of smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. RGS2 serves as a negative regulator of G&#x003b1;q by accelerating its GTPase activity and thereby terminating the signal response of G&#x003b1;q [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed a decrease in IOP in repeated measurements, and this effect appeared to be associated with an increase in the width of the SC, likely due to increased actomyosin assembly and the resultant increase in tissue contractility in the ciliary muscle.</p><p>The mean value of diurnal IOP in the RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was found to be 17.98&#x000b1;1.34&#x000a0;mmHg compared to 21.39&#x000b1;2.88&#x000a0;mmHg in littermate wild-type mice. Based on several published reports on the rodent glaucoma model, the difference of roughly 3.4&#x000a0;mmHg IOP observed in the RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is considered to be physiologically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. Moreover, this decreased IOP in the RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is likely a chronic response stemming from the deletion of RGS2. In this study, the nocturnal IOP was not monitored; however, since nocturnal IOP is higher relative to the diurnal/sleep period in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>], it is possible that the lowered IOP (diurnal) observed in RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is indicative of a much more significant drop in the IOP associated with the nocturnal period.</p><p>Interestingly, the lowered IOP in the RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was found to be associated with an increase in the SC area, owing to a widening of the SC. Although the specific mechanisms responsible for the observed widening of the SC in the RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are not known (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>), this observation suggests a possible mechanical deformation of SC. Agonists, such as pilocarpine and other miotics, have been shown to cause mechanical deformation of TM and SC due to increased CM contraction, resulting in increased aqueous humor outflow and decreased IOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. The tendons arising from the anterior tips of the ciliary muscle insert into the TM and well into the subendothelial region adjacent to the inner wall of the SC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. Due to this intimate anatomic relationship between the TM and the CM, when CM contraction is induced by pilocarpine and other miotics, it has been shown to cause TM expansion and widening of the SC and ultimately decreasing outflow resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. The muscarinic receptors (M1 and M3) that are coupled to G&#x003b1;q have been reported to be expressed in the CM and TM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Therefore, we speculate that the increased SC area in the RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice might potentially be due to altered geometry of the aqueous outflow pathway in response to increased CM contraction. For SC morphology we used six individual eyes from each group (RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and control), and these animals were euthanized in three different batches on different days. We saw distinct and consistent changes in the RGS2 <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice as compared to wild-type mice, thus it is unlikely that these observations represent the result of fixation artifact.</p><p>In support of the hypothesis of increased contraction of the CM in RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we also noted an increased staining for actin filaments in the CM, indicating induced contractile actomyosin assembly. The TM tissue also exhibited an increase in actin filament assembly based on phalloidin staining; however, F-actin staining in the CM was much higher relative to that noted in the TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Increased myosin II phosphorylation via sustained activation of G&#x003b1;q signaling in the RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was expected to induce actomyosin assembly, leading to enhanced contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>], and our results of increased actin filament staining in the CM of RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice supported this possibility. Additionally, impaired nitric oxide-cGMP mediated relaxation which is known to occur in RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice might also have contributed significantly to observed increase in CM actomyosin assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. Though additional biochemical studies are necessary to support this contention, the RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have been reported to develop systemic hypertension due to impaired vascular smooth muscle relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported that the expression and regulation of RGS2 activity plays a critical role in regulation of vascular endothelial contraction and blood pressure homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. Therefore, changes in RGS2 expression in the outflow pathway and ciliary body might also influence IOP.</p><p>IOP values obtained in this study were noted to be slightly higher than reported values for the mouse species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>], This discrepancy might have stemmed from the lack of use of general anesthesia in this study. The use of anesthetics has been shown to lower IOP significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>]. However, it also important to note that, unlike the studies reported by Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>], the rebound tonometer was not steadied and fixed during the course of acquiring IOP measurements in our studies. Since agitation of mice has been shown to cause elevated IOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>], any stress or agitation caused by routine physical handling might also be a contributory factor in the higher IOP values obtained in our study.</p><p>Both RGS2 and G&#x003b1;q were confirmed to be expressed in the TM and CM tissues, however, regulation of RGS2 expression in these tissues is not known. Importantly, RGS2 expression has been shown to be influenced by various pharmacological and physiologic agents in different tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>]. Therefore, in future studies, analysis of RGS2 expression in the CM and TM tissues of glaucomatous and age-matched normal eyes might provide significant insight into the role of RGS2 in the pathophysiology of glaucoma. Since IOP is determined by the balance between aqueous outflow and inflow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>], it is also necessary to exercise caution while interpreting the results of lowered IOP in RGS2 <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, particularly with regard to whether this response is solely due to increased aqueous outflow through the TM or also partly owing to decreased secretion of aqueous humor by the ciliary epithelium. Episcleral venous pressure is recognized to potentially influence IOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>]. However, we did not monitor changes in episcleral venous pressure in the RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Thus, it remains to be determined whether there was any influence of episcleral venous pressure on the observed changes in IOP in the RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>Since elevated IOP has been shown to influence retinal ganglion cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>], we also evaluated changes in the retinal ganglion cell count in the RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice by immunofluorescence analysis using Brn-3 antibody. The ganglion cell count in the central retina was found to be significantly higher in the RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared to the littermate wild-type mice. One plausible explanation for the increased ganglion cell survival in the RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice may relate to the decreased IOP in these mice. The RGS2 <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice used in this study were 12 to 15 months of age, and aging alone decreases retinal ganglion cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>]. Moreover, aging is a major risk factor for glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Aging of C57BL/6 mice has been reported to alter gene expression profiles and to be associated with increased oxidative stress in different ocular tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>] Therefore, additional studies are required to also resolve the issue of whether the increased RGC count observed in the RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is specific to aging animals or whether a similar response can be elicited in young animals as well. Decreased IOP in glaucoma patients has been shown to protect ganglion cells, contributing to their survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>]. However, it is also important to be aware that one cannot rule out the direct influence of G&#x003b1;q/RGS2 signaling on ganglion cell survival, independent of the effects on IOP. Indeed, the G&#x003b1;q-coupled M1 muscarinic receptors and their agonists have been shown to increase retinal ganglion cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r59">59</xref>]. In contrast to central retina, the retinal ganglion cell count in the peripheral retina was found to be unaltered in RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and the reasons for this difference between these two regions of the retina is not clear at present. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of any developmental changes in the retina of RGS2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse, based on histological examination of the retina in these mice compared to wild-type mice, we did not notice any distinction between these two groups of mice. Additionally, in the published work, although these mice have been shown to exhibit abnormalities in T-cell activation, anxiety, aggression, and blood pressure, there are no known developmental changes associated with the deficiency of RGS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, this pilot study reveals the potential importance of RGS2, a negative regulator of G&#x003b1;q-coupled GPCR signaling, in IOP homeostasis. Decreased IOP, together with the morphological changes noted in the SC and the increased actin filament staining in the CM of RGS2-deficient mice, indicates a critical role for G&#x003b1;q-mediated signaling in the regulation of contractile activity of the CM and TM, thereby influencing IOP homeostasis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to Dr. Sandra Stinnett for help with statistical analysis of IOP and Dr. Nomingerel Tserentsoodol for assistance with immunostaining assays.
