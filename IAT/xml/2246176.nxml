Many breast cancer risk factors have been identified but a positive family history remains among the most important, with first-degree relatives of patients having an approximately twofold elevated risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Several genes are known to confer increased susceptibility to breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], including <italic>BRCA1 </italic>and <italic>BRCA2</italic>, but it has been estimated that they explain only about 25% of the familial risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and less than 5% of the total breast cancer incidence. This is because even though the risks conferred by mutations in <italic>BRCA1 </italic>and <italic>BRCA2 </italic>are substantial, the frequencies of these mutations in the population are very rare.</p><p>In contrast, twin studies and studies of the incidence of contralateral breast cancer have suggested that the proportion of breast cancer that can be attributed to genetic factors may be as high as 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], implying that there are still breast cancer susceptibility genes to be identified. Linkage studies in multiple case families, however, have failed to identify further major breast cancer genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>This failure has strengthened the idea that a large proportion of the familial risk of breast cancer is due to multiple loci, each conferring a small risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Variants in <italic>CHEK2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], <italic>BRIP1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and <italic>PALB2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] fall into this category, but their population frequencies are very low, and thus so is their overall contribution to breast cancer incidence.</p><p>A recent large-scale, genome-wide scan for associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] has identified five new loci, each containing one or two SNPs that are very strongly associated with breast cancer in several populations of diverse ethnicity. Four of these contain plausible causative genes (<italic>FGFR2</italic>, <italic>TNRC9</italic>, <italic>MAP3K1 </italic>and <italic>LSP1</italic>). The per-allele odds ratios conferred by these variants ranged from 1.07 to 1.26, with minor allele frequencies ranging from 28% to 46%. These risks are too low to be useful in genetic predictive testing, but substantial proportions of breast cancer patients are heterozygous or are homozygous for these variants.</p><p>It is therefore interesting to investigate whether the identified variants in these loci are associated with particular disease characteristics, such as tumour grade and stage. Breast tumours arising in carriers of <italic>BRCA1 </italic>mutations have been shown to have a distinct phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and patients carrying the 1100delC mutation in <italic>CHEK2 </italic>are at higher risk of developing secondary disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In a prospective hospital-based series of 1,267 incident breast cancer cases in the southwest of The Netherlands, we compared, in a case-only design, the genotypes at seven SNPs in the five newly identified low-risk loci with tumour and disease characteristics and other breast cancer risk factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>During the period October 1996&#x02013;December 2005, patients who were diagnosed with a primary breast tumour were consecutively recruited from two academic hospitals (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden and the Erasmus MC&#x02013;Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam) in the southwest of The Netherlands, irrespective of their family history. Patients over the age of 70 years at the time of diagnosis were excluded from the Erasmus MC&#x02013;Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center cohort to enrich their population for hereditary factors. One hundred and three patients who were invited to join this study declined to participate. The final Dutch hospital-based ORIGO cohort of breast cancer patients consisted of 1,359 patients, of which 1,207 were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and 152 with carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic>.</p><p>After giving informed consent, patients filled in a questionnaire on breast cancer risk factors (age at menarche and age at first pregnancy, total number of pregnancies and duration of breastfeeding, age at menopause, use of oral contraceptives, alcohol use) and on family cancer history. Questionnaires were not returned by 90 of the 1,359 patients (6.6%). A further two patients were excluded from the analysis because of poor genotyping quality, so that for a total number of 1,267 patients in the ORIGO cohort both genotyping information and information on personal breast cancer risk factors were known. This final cohort consisted of 549 patients from the Leiden University Medical Center and 718 patients from the Erasmus MC&#x02013;Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center.</p><p>Age at diagnosis and body mass index were recorded from the hospital records, and information on tumour histology, including tumour size and lymph node status, and on oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2/<italic>neu </italic>status, was retrieved from the pathology reports. Because of the small number of patients for whom HER2/<italic>neu </italic>status was known (<italic>n </italic>= 76), this characteristic was excluded from our statistical analysis. A blood sample was collected from each patient and DNA was isolated. During the ongoing follow-up, local, locoregional and distant recurrence of disease and death were recorded.</p><p>To assess allele frequencies in the general population, we genotyped 378 healthy blood donors from the southwest region of The Netherlands (93 females, 285 males), and 234 healthy spouses of family members of families with multiple breast cancer cases (169 males and 65 females) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The Medical Ethical Review Boards of the involved centres approved the study protocol, under the condition that written informed consent was obtained from the patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Genotyping</title><p>With the ORIGO cohort we participated in the third stage of the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) genome-wide association study, in which 30 of the most significant SNPs from stage 2 were genotyped in 22 case&#x02013;control studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In total these studies comprised 21,668 cases of invasive breast cancer, 967 cases of carcinoma <italic>in situ </italic>and 20,973 control cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A 31st SNP was added later as a result of fine-scale mapping of the <italic>TNRC9 </italic>locus. Details on the genotyping methods can be found in the article by Easton and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In the ORIGO cohort, genotypes were successfully called in at least 95% of the samples for all SNPs &#x02013; except for SNP rs8051542, for which successful genotype calling was present in 89.5% of all samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The prevalence of the minor allele of each SNP in the ORIGO population was compared with the prevalence in the control population using chi-square tests. The odds ratios were calculated using regression analysis.</p><p>The combined effect of SNP rs2981582 and each one of the other six SNPs was explored pairwise in the ORIGO cohort. Patients were stratified into nine groups according to their genotype at rs2981582 and at the other SNP, and the odds ratios of each subgroup were calculated using regression analysis &#x02013; the group of patients being homozygous for the major alleles of both SNPs serving as reference category (odds ratio = 1.0). Analysis of three or more SNPs at the same time resulted in subgroups too small for statistical analysis.</p><p>In the BCAC study, the odds ratios for heterozygous and homozygous carriers of the rare allele of each SNP were in agreement with a codominant model. We therefore analysed the effect of each SNP on disease characteristics by classifying the patients from our ORIGO cohort into three groups: patients homozygous for the major allele (wt/wt), patients heterozygous for the wildtype and mutated or minor allele (wt/mt), and patients homozygous for the minor allele (mt/mt). Since the group of patients homozygous for the minor allele was often small, associations between the SNP status and the disease characteristics were also studied comparing the group of patients homozygous for the major allele with those carrying one or two minor alleles.</p><p>Disease characteristics were compared between the three patient groups using logistic regression for dichotomous variables, chi-square tests for categorical variables, and one-way analyses of variance for continuous variables. For the analyses comparing two patient groups, Pearson's correction was applied to the chi-square tests and continuous variables were compared using the Student <italic>t </italic>test.</p><p><italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.1 was considered a possible trend that could be explored further in larger study groups.</p><p>All analyses on the ORIGO cohort and its control group were performed with SPSS version 11.0.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The characteristics of the 1,267 patients in the ORIGO cohort are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The average age at diagnosis was 54.0 years, which is several years younger than the average for all Dutch patients (61.3 years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This younger diagnosis age is due to the fact that in one accrual hospital only patients diagnosed before the age of 70 years were included. All other disease characteristics are not significantly different from population-based data.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of the Dutch hospital-based ORIGO cohort of breast cancer patients (<italic>n </italic>= 1267)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Variable</td><td align="left">Value</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Age at diagnosis (years) (<italic>n </italic>= 1,254)</td><td align="left">54 &#x000b1; 11.2 (21&#x02013;88)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Follow-up time (months) (<italic>n </italic>= 476)</td><td align="left">64 &#x000b1; 31 (3&#x02013;126)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Body mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (<italic>n </italic>= 1,203)</td><td align="left">25 &#x000b1; 4 (16&#x02013;45)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sex (<italic>n </italic>= 1,267)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Female</td><td align="left">1262 (99.6%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Male</td><td align="left">5 (0.4%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Bilaterality of breast cancer<sup>a </sup>(<italic>n </italic>= 1,265)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Bilateral</td><td align="left">79 (6.2%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Unilateral</td><td align="left">1186 (93.8%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Tumour characteristics</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Bloom&#x02013;Richardson grade (<italic>n </italic>= 964)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Grade I</td><td align="left">175 (18.2%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Grade II</td><td align="left">399 (41.4%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Grade III</td><td align="left">390 (40.5%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Clinical staging of cancer (UICC)<sup>b </sup>(<italic>n </italic>= 1,230)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Stage 0 (<italic>in situ</italic>)</td><td align="left">144 (11.7%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Stage 1</td><td align="left">479 (38.9%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Stage 2</td><td align="left">526 (42.8%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Stage 3</td><td align="left">81 (6.6%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Receptor status</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Oestrogen receptor (<italic>n </italic>= 831)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Positive</td><td align="left">597 (71.8%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Negative</td><td align="left">234 (28.2%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Progesterone receptor (<italic>n </italic>= 683)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Positive</td><td align="left">399 (58.4%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Negative</td><td align="left">284 (41.6%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/<italic>neu</italic>) (<italic>n </italic>= 76)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Positive</td><td align="left">14 (18.4%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Negative</td><td align="left">62 (81.6%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Risk factors</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Family history<sup>c </sup>(<italic>n </italic>= 1,253)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Negative</td><td align="left">753 (60.1%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Positive</td><td align="left">500 (39.9%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Pregnancy (<italic>n </italic>= 1,179)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Ever</td><td align="left">968 (82.1%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Never</td><td align="left">211 (17.9%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Breastfeeding (<italic>n </italic>= 1,215)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Ever</td><td align="left">693 (57%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;Never</td><td align="left">522 (43%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Breastfeeding duration (months)</td><td align="left">5.21 &#x000b1; 9.8 (0&#x02013;121)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data presented as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (range) or number (% of total number). <sup>a</sup>Within 6 months of first diagnosis. <sup>b</sup>International Union Against Cancer (UICC) stages, based on T classification and N classification, known in 1,230 patients. <sup>c</sup>Family history is considered positive when at least one first-degree or second-degree relative also had breast cancer, irrespective of age at onset.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The ORIGO cohort took part in a large three-phase, genome-wide study conducted by the BCAC, which identified seven SNPs to be significantly associated with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

The percentage of patients with a positive family history for breast cancer is not different from other breast cancer populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In the ORIGO cohort, we first studied the association between seven recently identified low-risk breast cancer susceptibility alleles in five genomic regions and breast cancer risk in general.</p><p>It is interesting to note that, although the ORIGO cohort consists of only 1,359 cases, the per-allele odds ratios calculated for the seven SNPs in the BCAC study and in the ORIGO cohort are similar. Although the increase in breast cancer risk inferred by the minor allele of each of these SNPs is only small, the attributable risks are high due to the high frequency of the minor allele in the population.</p><p>To investigate the combined effects of these SNPs on breast cancer risk, we calculated the odds ratios of the combination of the most important SNP (rs2981582 in <italic>FGFR2</italic>) with one other SNP. We found significantly higher odds ratios when genotypes at SNP rs2981582 (<italic>FGFR2</italic>) and at SNP rs3803662 (<italic>TNRC9</italic>) were combined, with magnitudes in keeping with a simple multiplicative model. If confirmed in larger cohorts, this statistical interaction could provide clues about the biological functions of the involved proteins in breast cancer development.</p><p>In the present study, we proceeded by focusing on the associations between patient characteristics and histopathological characteristics and genotypes at the seven SNPs in our ORIGO cohort. Although this cohort is relatively small, it is also homogeneous and extensively characterized, allowing an elaborate first exploration of the possible associations between the SNPs and disease characteristics.</p><p>In the BCAC study, SNP rs2981582 in <italic>FGFR2 </italic>was most strongly associated with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], an association that was replicated in three independent postmenopausal breast cancer cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the ORIGO cohort, rs2981582 genotypes correlated with a positive family history of breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer, although this was significant only when the ratio of the number of relatives with breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer relative to the total number of female relatives was compared. The BCAC study also found an association between this SNP and women with a first-degree relative with breast cancer. Our results thus suggest that this association may also include relatives with ovarian cancer. Expression of <italic>FGFR2 </italic>subtype IIIb has been implicated to be upregulated in up to 80% of epithelial ovarian cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Although the functionality of rs2981582 with regard to an increased cancer risk is as yet unresolved, it has been speculated that it is mediated through regulation of <italic>FGFR2 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Two other SNPs (rs3803662 and rs13281615) were also linked to family history in the BCAC study, and this was also noted for rs3803662 in the ORIGO cohort, although not significantly (<italic>P </italic>= 0.072). This effect was observed only for breast cancer family history, and was lost when adding ovarian cancer cases to the analysis. The association between rs13281615 and family history was not observed in the ORIGO cohort.</p><p>We did not confirm the association between rs3803662 in <italic>TNRC9</italic>, the second most significant SNP in the BCAC study, and breast cancer risk in our cohort. However, we did observe that heterozygote carriers and minor allele homozygote carriers for this SNP had a higher probability of being diagnosed with a breast tumour before age 60 years than major allele homozygote carriers. This effect is to be expected for susceptibility loci, although it was not seen for other SNPs in our cohort, and only a trend was observed in the BCAC study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>It is possible that a low-risk allele not only influences the chance of developing breast cancer but also influences tumour characteristics such as invasiveness. In our cohort we found that patients carrying one or two minor alleles of rs889312 in <italic>MAP3K1 </italic>were less likely to have lymph-node-positive breast cancer, suggesting that the invasive potential of the tumour in these patients might be lower. A trend for an opposite effect was observed for rs3817198 in <italic>LSP1</italic>. There was, however, no significant effect of either one of these SNPs on overall survival or disease-free survival, but this may be due to the relatively small sample size and the short period of follow-up.</p><p>A prolonged period of breastfeeding is a known protective factor against breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Carriers of one or two minor alleles of SNPs rs2981582 and rs3803662 breastfed for a longer period of time, but developed breast cancer nonetheless, suggesting that the protective effect of breastfeeding might have been counteracted by the presence of the minor allele of either SNP.</p><p>We have shown previously that the <italic>CHEK2</italic>*1100delC germline mutation was more prevalent among patients with a positive oestrogen receptor status in the ORIGO cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A similar finding was made for SNP rs3803662, in that the risk of this allele was strongly confined to patients with oestrogen-receptor-positive tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We examined this association for the seven SNPs in our cohort but did not find any effect with oestrogen receptor status for any, and only a few weak associations were found with progesterone receptor status. It is conceivable that the risks conferred by these alleles are expressed only in receptor-positive or receptor-negative subgroups of patients, but these differences in risk are probably too small to be detected in our cohort. With the current cohort of 831 patients with known oestrogen receptor status, we had only a statistical power of 59% to detect a difference in oestrogen receptor status of 10%.</p><p>We did not observe any association between genotypes at the seven SNPs and a variety of other clinical parameters, including the bilateral occurrence of breast cancer, the Bloom&#x02013;Richardson grade, the clinical International Union Against Cancer stage, age at first pregnancy or the total number of pregnancies and duration of pregnancies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, several of the seven recently identified common genetic variants that predispose to breast cancer are associated with certain clinical characteristics, such as family history, nodal involvement, and age at diagnosis, in a Dutch cohort of breast cancer patients. These findings should be regarded with caution, given the relatively small size of the ORIGO cohort. The clinical implications of these findings are at present therefore undetermined. These results do, however, provide interesting new clues for further association studies in larger patient cohorts as well as for further research aimed at elucidating the causal relationship of the SNPs with breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BCAC = Breast Cancer Association Consortium; ORIGO = Dutch hospital-based cohort of breast cancer patients; SNP = single nucleotide polymorphism.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PEAH carried out data curation and statistical analyses, and drafted the manuscript.
