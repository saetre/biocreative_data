LIMK1 promotes actin polymerization by phosphorylation and inactivation of the actin depolymerization factor &#x02013; cofilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. It also negatively regulates microtubule dynamics and assembly via phosphorylation of p25/TPPP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. LIMK1 is activated via phosphorylation by downstream effectors of small GTPases: Rho kinase (ROCK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]; p21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase (PAK1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]; and PAK4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>].</p><p>Transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;), a family of cytokines, is known to be a key mediator of fibrotic responses such as fibronectin deposition and cell migration to wounding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. This factor has been implicated in a variety of conditions that include proliferative vitreoretinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], cataract formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], corneal opacities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>], and subconjunctival scarring, a complication of filtration surgery in glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>].</p><p>There have been reports of cross-talk between LIMK1 and TGF-&#x003b2; receptor superfamilies. A direct association between LIMK1 and bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR-II), a member of the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily, mediated actin cytoskeleton dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. It has also been shown that TGF-&#x003b2; type I receptor can indirectly activate LIMK2, a member of the LIMK family, through Rho and its downstream effector ROCK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>] to regulate actin assembly.</p><p>In the glaucoma filtration surgery, postoperative fibrosis or scarring at the wound site is a critical determinant of the surgical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Although anti-scarring agents such as mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil can prevent post-operative scarring and improve surgical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>], they cause widespread fibroblast cell death and are often associated with severe and potentially blinding complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. Therefore targeting one of the pro-inflammatory pathways via siRNA-dependent protein downregulation might be an effective strategy to reduce ocular inflammation and fibrosis.</p><p>We have recently determined that LIMK1 plays a pro-inflammatory role in mouse lungs via disruption of endothelial barrier function and promotion of leukocyte diapedesis through regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics (unpublished data). The important role of LIMK1 during inflammatory response and its possible cross-talk with TGF-&#x003b2; have led us to hypothesize that LIMK1 may be involved in inflammation through TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, and that downregulation of <italic>LIMK1</italic> might be an effective strategy to suppress ocular inflammation and fibrosis.</p><p>In the current study, the RNA interference and genetic deletion approaches were employed to test our hypothesis. We showed here that downregulation of <italic>LIMK1</italic> in human corneal fibroblasts led to a significant decrease in fibronectin deposition. The actin stress fibers and focal adhesions were diminished and the fibroblast migration was retarded. Moreover, downregulation of <italic>LIMK1</italic> in a mouse model via both genetic deletion and direct application of <italic>LIMK1</italic>-targeted siRNA in the eyes markedly reduced ocular inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>Normal human corneas from donors aged 13, 29, 34, 45, and 47 years were obtained from the Illinois Eye Bank (Chicago, IL).

The endothelium-Descemet&#x02019;s membrane was stripped off under a dissecting microscope. The stroma was then mechanically separated from the epithelium-stroma and used as an explant to initiate corneal fibroblast cultures. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 5% calf serum, nonessential and essential amino acids, and antibiotics as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>].

The cells were transfected the next day and were fixed in cold methanol without permeabilization to examine the fibronectin network 48 or 72 h after transfection. For actin and paxillin staining, cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde-lysine-phosphate buffer and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100. To carry out immunostaining, corneal fibroblasts were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-human fibronectin (1:100; BD Biosciences, Lexington, KY) or monoclonal anti-paxillin (1:100; Millipore, Billercia, MA). FITC-goat anti-rabbit (1:200) or Cy3-goat anti-mouse (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) IgG was used as the secondary antibody. The actin structure was visualized after incubation for 40 min with Alexa 488-phalloidin (1:40; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The nuclei of the cells were counterstained with 4&#x02019;,6&#x02019;-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI).

Proteins in cell lysates were quantified by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL) with BSA as a standard. Equal amounts of proteins (20&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/lane) were resolved on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for probing with rabbit anti-LIMK1 antibody (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000; Jackson ImmunoReseach). As a protein loading control, the membranes were also probed with anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (anti-GAPDH; Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Signals were detected by chemiluminescence. The gel image captured with Gel Doc 2000 image analyzer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was analyzed by densitometry using Image station 440 (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY). Band intensities were determined and the ratios of LIMK1 intensity to that of GAPDH were calculated.</p><p>For secreted fibronectin, 72 h following transfection, cells were incubated with serum-free media for 24 h.

Total area of the wound in each 10X field and the area covered by the migrating cells within the wound were measured using the Image Processing Tool Kit (Version 3.0; Reindeer Graphics, Ashville, NC).

The number of round and large inflammatory cells (as opposed to the long and thin resident fibroblasts) in subconjunctival areas of the sections was counted. The value was normalized to number of inflammatory cells per 10,000&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> area underneath the conjunctival epithelium. Tissue sections were also deparaffinized and stained with anti-CD45 antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) to detect leukocytes.

By contrast, mice treated with <italic>LIMK1</italic>-targeted siRNA exhibited reduced inflammatory response as compared to the mice injected with scrambled siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>To analyze the nature of inflammatory cells observed upon injection with PBS/beads, tissue sections from <italic>limk1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>limk1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were stained with an antibody for CD45, a leukocyte marker. Consistent with that presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>, the data showed that the number of leukocytes upon the injection of PBS/beads in <italic>limk1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice was significantly fewer than in the <italic>limk1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D,E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study demonstrates that siRNA specific to human <italic>LIMK1</italic> downregulated the protein expression in cultured human corneal fibroblasts. <italic>LIMK1</italic>-targeted siRNA application decreased the fibronectin deposition, reduced actin polymerization and focal adhesion formation, and retarded migration of the cells. Corneal fibroblasts constitutively express TGF-&#x003b2;, which is known to induce the expression of matrix molecules such as fibronectin and collagen type I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>] and facilitate migration of corneal fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. Both of these are crucial steps in the wound repair process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. Therefore, our data suggests that <italic>LIMK1</italic> might be involved in the wound repair, regulating both transcriptional and migratory signaling pathways associated with TGF-&#x003b2;.</p><p>Several reports demonstrated the interaction between LIMK and TGF-&#x003b2; superfamilies. A direct association between LIMK1 and BMPR-II, a member of the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily, was documented to result in influences on actin cytoskeleton dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Also, LIMK2, a member of the LIMK family, can be indirectly activated by TGF-&#x003b2; type I receptor through Rho and ROCK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>] to regulate actin assembly. In this report, we demonstrated another possible cross-talk between LIMK and TGF-&#x003b2;, notably in the wound repair signaling.</p><p>We observed that LIMK1 may be involved in the regulation of both migratory and transcriptional signaling pathways mediated by TGF-&#x003b2;. The influence of <italic>LIMK1</italic> downregulation on TGF-&#x003b2;-dependent cell migration may be explained by the impairment of effective actin cytoskeleton dynamics since <italic>LIMK1</italic> downregulation resulted in reduced actin polymerization, fibronectin deposition, and focal adhesion formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]). The links between LIMK1 and transcriptional pathways regulated by TGF-&#x003b2; however are less clear. The reduced production of fibronectin could be a result of diminished actin polymerization as it is known that ECM signaling is largely connected to actin cytoskeleton dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Alternatively, LIMK1 could also act directly on transcriptional pathways given the facts that LIMK1 possesses two LIM domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>], which may bind DNA; and that there have been reports describing LIMK1 nuclear localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>] and its direct effects on the protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>].</p><p>We demonstrate that downregulation of <italic>LIMK1</italic> via genetic deletion or direct application of mouse <italic>LIMK1</italic>-targeted siRNA in the eyes of a mouse model significantly decreased ocular inflammatory response. As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>], we injected PBS mixed with latex beads into mouse eyes to induce inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. We observed in 2 days that both <italic>limk1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice and wild type mice treated with <italic>LIMK1</italic>-targeted siRNA had much lessened inflammatory response, as evidenced by decreased infiltration of inflammatory cells such as leukocytes. The fibrosis response presumably was also reduced as it is related to the reduced inflammation (unpublished data), impeded fibroblast migration, and declined matrix deposition.</p><p>The siRNA injected into mouse eyes most likely targeted fibroblasts in the subconjunctival region. The precise mechanism of how siRNA was entering the cells is not known. The siRNA treatment reduced the inflammation, possibly in association with the attenuation of chemotaxis. As is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>, <italic>LIMK1</italic> siRNA treatment retarded the migration and altered actin dynamics of corneal fibroblasts in culture. Downregulation of <italic>LIMK1</italic> in leukocytes was also observed to decrease leukocyte chemotaxis in Transwell assay, presumably via impairment of actin polymerization (unpublished data).</p><p>It is noteworthy that while adenovirus and other vectors may be employed for long-term inhibition of inflammation, transient knockdown by synthetic siRNA allows a better dosage control to minimize potential side effects. In our model a one-time administration of siRNA at a very early phase was sufficient to reduce the pathway of inflammation.</p><p>Ocular fibrotic wound response is a major cause of vision handicap and blindness, especially following surgical treatment for glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Excessive post-operative scarring often leads to failure of filtration surgery. While the use of antimetabolites such as mitomycin C and 5-fluorourcil as conjunctival anti-fibrosis or anti-scarring treatments benefits some patients, these agents are associated with potentially blinding complications including hypotony, maculopathy, and infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. Therefore downregulation of <italic>LIMK1</italic> might be an effective strategy in suppression and prevention of ocular inflammation and fibrosis.</p><p>To summarize, we report that <italic>LIMK1</italic>-targeted siRNA application in vitro resulted in decreased fibrosis, reduced actin polymerization, and retarded migration of fibroblasts, disclosing a possibility that LIMK1 may mediate TGF-&#x003b2;-dependent signaling during ocular inflammation. Also, downregulation of <italic>LIMK1</italic> via genetic deletion or direct application of <italic>LIMK1</italic>-targeted siRNA in the eyes of a mouse model markedly decreased ocular inflammatory response. The in vitro and in vivo results underscore the potential of a novel therapy for preventing the inflammatory response and fibrosis or scarring in ocular diseases and after glaucoma filtration surgery. This approach may also have applications for other surface tissues, including the skin.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by grants GM56159, P01 HL60678, EY05638, and P30 EY01792 from the National Institutes of Health.
