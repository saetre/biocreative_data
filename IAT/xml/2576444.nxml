However, the roles played by cellular factors are only partially understood. To identify cellular processes that participate in these critical steps, we employed a high volume screening of insertionally mutagenized somatic cells using a murine leukemia virus (MLV) vector. This approach identified a role for 3&#x02032;-phosphoadenosine 5&#x02032;-phosphosulfate synthase 1 (PAPSS1), one of two enzymes that synthesize PAPS, the high energy sulfate donor used in all sulfonation reactions catalyzed by cellular sulfotransferases. The role of the cellular sulfonation pathway was confirmed using chemical inhibitors of PAPS synthases and cellular sulfotransferases. The requirement for sulfonation was mapped to a stage during or shortly after MLV provirus establishment and influenced subsequent gene expression from the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. Infection of cells by an HIV vector was also shown to be highly dependent on the cellular sulfonation pathway. These studies have uncovered a heretofore unknown regulatory step of retroviral replication, have defined a new biological function for sulfonation in nuclear gene expression, and provide a potentially valuable new target for HIV/AIDS therapy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>A genetic screen was used to identify host cell functions important for the replication of retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency viruses. These studies have uncovered a heretofore unexpected role for the cellular sulfonation pathway in an intracellular step of retroviral replication. Through the addition of sulfate groups, this pathway is responsible for modifying and regulating different types of cellular factors including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and hormones. The role of this pathway was further confirmed by using specific chemical inhibitors. The sulfonation requirement was mapped to a step during viral DNA integration into the host genome that has a subsequent effect upon the level of expression of viral genes. These studies have uncovered a new regulatory mechanism of retroviral replication and suggest that components of the host cell sulfonation pathway might represent attractive targets for antiviral development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>Retroviridae</italic> are a large viral family that includes the human pathogens Human Immunodeficiency Viruses 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2), the causative agents of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Due to their small coding capacity and requirement for integration into the host cell genome, retroviruses are heavily dependent upon host cell machinery for efficient replication. The retroviral lifecycle can be divided into two distinct phases. The early stage consist of virus binding to a cellular receptor, fusion of viral and cellular membranes leading to delivery of the viral core into the cytoplasm, reverse transcription of the positive strand RNA genome to generate a dsDNA product, translocation of viral nucleoprotein complexes to the nucleus, and provirus establishment through integration of the viral DNA into the host cell genome. The late stage consists of transcription of the viral genome by host RNA pol II, RNA processing and export to the cytoplasm, translation of viral proteins, viral assembly, egress and maturation.</p><p>While progress has been made on the identification of many of the cellular proteins involved in the late stage of the retroviral lifecycle, particularly in transcription, RNA processing and egress, less is known about the contribution of cellular factors to the early stage of the retroviral lifecycle. In particular, the contribution of cellular factors to steps subsequent to virus:cell membrane fusion and that lead to proviral DNA establishment are only partially understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000207-Goff1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

First, insertional mutagenesis and genetic complementation studies identified PAPSS1 as a cellular gene that is important for MLV infection. Second, a similar defect was seen with cells treated with the PAPS synthetase inhibitor, chlorate, or with the sulfotransferase inhibitor, guaiacol. Third, inhibition of the sulfonation pathway had no impact on the levels of integrated MLV DNA but influenced downstream MLV LTR-driven gene expression from newly formed proviruses. Fourth, MLV was sensitive to inhibitors of the sulfonation pathway at time points up to that associated with maximal levels of viral DNA integration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000207-Roe1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, the observations made with MLV held true for HIV-1, the causative agent of AIDS, since the sulfonation pathway also influenced LTR-driven transcription from that virus. These data suggest that sulfonation may play an important role in the regulation of nuclear gene expression. Consistent with this, PAPSS1 localizes to the nucleus, which implies there is a requirement for high levels of PAPS, and by extension sulfonation, in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000207-Besset1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, these studies have uncovered a heretofore unknown regulatory step of retroviral replication, one that is potentially important for HIV/AIDS therapy.</p><p>The data in this report are consistent with either one of two models. In the first model, the sulfonation pathway might influence viral DNA integration site specificity so that when this pathway is impaired, the virus is targeted to regions where the provirus is less transcriptionally competent. This model is consistent with the observation that viruses sensitive to the sulfonation pathway, HIV and MLV, both share a strong preference for integration into genes, although MLV shows a much stronger preference for integration near the viral promoter regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000207-Lewinski1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000207-Wu1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>.
