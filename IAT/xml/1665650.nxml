A BALB/c congenic mouse strain lacking all endogenous <italic>Mtv</italic>s (<italic>Mtv</italic>-null) was resistant to MMTV oral and intraperitoneal infection and tumorigenesis compared to wild-type BALB/c mice. Infection of <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice with an MMTV-related retrovirus, type B leukemogenic virus, also resulted in severely reduced viral loads and failure to induce T-cell lymphomas, indicating that resistance is not dependent on expression of a superantigen (Sag) encoded by exogenous MMTV. Resistance to MMTV in <italic>Mtv</italic>-null animals was not due to neutralizing antibodies. Further, <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice were resistant to rapid mortality induced by intragastric inoculation of the Gram-negative bacterium, <italic>Vibrio cholerae,</italic> but susceptibility to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Salmonella typhimurium</named-content> was not significantly different from BALB/c mice. Susceptibility to both MMTV and <named-content content-type="genus-species">V. cholerae</named-content> was reconstituted by the presence of any one of three endogenous <italic>Mtv</italic>s located on different chromosomes and was associated with increased pathogen load. One of these endogenous proviruses is known to encode only Sag. Therefore, <italic>Mtv</italic>-encoded Sag appears to provide a unique genetic susceptibility to specific viruses and bacteria.

MMTV-induced breast cancers represent a well-established model for human breast cancer research. Mice become infected by virus particles in mother's milk (exogenous MMTV), and insertion of exogenous MMTV into somatic cell DNA sporadically leads to genetic damage and cancer. Alternatively, if exogenous MMTVs infect germline cells, the viral genome becomes a stable part of the mouse genome and may be inherited from either parent (endogenous MMTV). In this report, the authors demonstrate that mice carrying endogenous MMTV in their genomes are more susceptible to disparate infectious agents, such as exogenous MMTV and the cholera-producing bacteria, <italic>Vibrio cholerae.</italic> However, this effect was selective since disease induced by another related bacteria, <italic>Salmonella typhimurium,</italic> was not affected. Genetic evidence suggests that a viral protein produced by endogenous MMTVs enhances pathogen-induced disease and death. Further, the human genome contains many human endogenous virus type Ks, which highly resemble MMTVs and also may influence disease. Therefore, this study suggests that endogenous retroviruses found in the mouse and human genomes alter the course of disease induced by multiple pathogenic organisms.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Bhadra S, Lozano MM, Payne SM, Dudley JP (2006) Endogenous MMTV proviruses induce susceptibility to both viral and bacterial pathogens.

Unlike conventional antigens, these APC interactions allow activation of 5&#x00025; to 35&#x00025; of na&#x000ef;ve CD4&#x0002b; T cells, which then release cytokines to induce rapid proliferation of bystander cells that are susceptible to MMTV infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020128-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

This strategy was continued for ten generations to obtain the <italic>Mtv</italic>-null strain (H-2<sup>d</sup>), which has been maintained by brother-sister matings for more than 3 y.</p><p>The absence of endogenous <italic>Mtv</italic>s was verified by PCR analysis of mouse genomic DNA using primers specific for each of the three endogenous MMTV proviruses of BALB/c mice, <italic>Mtv6, 8,</italic> and <italic>9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020128-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).

However, significant populations of these same T-cell subsets were detected in <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice, consistent with the absence of the corresponding endogenous MMTV proviruses. Further, Southern blotting of genomic DNA from <italic>Mtv</italic>-null animals and hybridization with MMTV long terminal repeat-specific probes confirmed the absence of proviruses (unpublished data).

This method allows the natural milk-borne transmission of MMTV from mothers to offspring. As anticipated, milk-borne MMTV infection of wild-type BALB/c mice gave a 100&#x00025; incidence of mammary tumors with an average latency of 5.8 &#x000b1; 0.4 mo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020128-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, milk-borne infection of <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice only gave a 10&#x00025; incidence of mammary tumors (one of ten animals) with the only tumor appearing at 15 mo.</p><p>Mice were also infected by inoculation with rat XC fibroblasts stably expressing an infectious cloned MMTV provirus, HYB-MTV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020128-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.

Wild-type mice developed mammary tumors with an incidence of 90&#x00025; and an average latency of 8.9 &#x000b1; 2.2 mo, whereas <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice had a 10&#x00025; mammary tumor incidence (three of 29 animals inoculated) with an average latency of 12.7 &#x000b1; 3.2 mo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020128-t001">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, the difference between <italic>Mtv</italic>-null and BALB/c animals in disease susceptibility was not influenced by the route of viral infection.</p><p>One explanation for these results is that MMTV infection is limited in <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice and reduced replication of the virus leads to a decreased frequency of proviral integration into the cellular genome.

Since deletion of superantigen-reactive T cells is a sensitive indicator of MMTV infection, MMTV-infected animals were analyzed for Sag-specific T-cell deletion.</p><p>As anticipated, wild-type BALB/c animals inoculated with MMTV-infected rat cells showed statistically significant (69&#x00025;) deletion of C3H MMTV Sag-reactive (CD4&#x0002b;V&#x003b2;14&#x0002b;) T cells compared to uninfected BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020128-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, left panel). In contrast, <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice inoculated with the same infected cells showed no detectable C3H Sag-specific T-cell deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020128-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, left panel). T-cell deletion was specific since there was no observable deletion in a T-cell subset that is non-reactive with C3H MMTV Sag protein (CD4&#x0002b;V&#x003b2;8&#x0002b;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020128-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020128-g001">1</xref>D, right panels). These results are consistent with the idea that MMTV replication is restricted in <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice, thus reducing proviral loads and mammary tumorigenesis. Deletion of Sag-specific T cells was also not detectable in progeny of MMTV-infected <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mothers (unpublished data).</p><p>To determine whether there was a difference in viral loads between MMTV-inoculated BALB/c and <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice, spleen RNA was obtained from multiple infected animals and subjected to semi-quantitative RT-PCR using long terminal repeat primers that were specific for C3H MMTV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020128-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Exogenous MMTV RNA levels were consistently higher in BALB/c mice than in <italic>Mtv</italic>-null animals inoculated with HYB-MTV infected cells. Similar data were obtained using tissues from mice infected with MMTV by foster nursing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020128-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Also, note that MMTV RNA was barely detectable in <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mammary tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020128-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 18, and unpublished data), but was easily detected in the BALB/c tumors (lanes 19 and 20).

Therefore, resistance of <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice to MMTV-induced disease could be attributed to reduced Sag function in these animals. To test this possibility, we analyzed infection by an MMTV variant, TBLV, which induces T-cell tumors rather than mammary cancers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020128-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020128-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, by a Sag-independent mechanism &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020128-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Injection of TBLV-infected cells intraperitoneally into weanling BALB/c mice gave a 50&#x00025; incidence of T-cell lymphomas with an average latency of 5.7 mo. In contrast, BALB/<italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice inoculated in the same manner failed to develop lymphomas within the 10-mo observation period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020128-t001">Table 1</xref>). Similarly, BALB/<italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice did not develop lymphomas after injection with a TBLV mutant that encodes only 17 amino acids of Sag, whereas this same mutant was lymphomagenic in BALB/c mice (unpublished data) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020128-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, both Sag-dependent and Sag-independent MMTV strains have reduced tumorigenicity in <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice.</p><p>To test whether resistance of <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice affects viral replication, we performed RT-PCR analyses on RNA extracted from tissues of TBLV-inoculated mice. TBLV transcripts were detected by RT-PCR in splenic RNA from 10-mo-old infected animals, and the identity of PCR products was confirmed by sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020128-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and unpublished data). Viral loads were greatly reduced in the infected <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice compared to those from infected BALB/c animals. Since viral RNA was detected only sporadically, our results suggest that <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice are less susceptible to MMTV and TBLV infection. Nevertheless, viral RNA cannot be demonstrated in every organ of MMTV or TBLV-infected wild-type BALB/c mice (unpublished data), a result that might be expected from the negative regulation of MMTV transcription in most tissues except lactating mammary gland &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020128-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020128-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

First, these mice are resistant to TBLV-induced lymphomas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020128-t001">Table 1</xref>). TBLV encodes a truncated Sag protein that lacks the C-terminal domain necessary for interaction with the V&#x003b2; region of the TCR and does not induce Sag-mediated deletion after infection, yet induces T-cell lymphomas in susceptible BALB/c mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020128-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020128-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;.

Failure of TBLV or TBLV <italic>sag</italic> frameshift viruses to induce tumors in <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice suggests that resistance is linked to a host immune response at a step upstream of the Sag response, but common to both MMTV and TBLV infections.</p><p>Production of a neutralizing antibody response has been shown to prevent induction of MMTV-induced mammary tumors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020128-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020128-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. The I/LnJ mouse strain, which contains endogenous <italic>Mtv</italic>s, produces IgG2a MMTV-specific neutralizing antibodies that block viral transmission from lymphoid to mammary gland cells.

The experiments in BALB.D2 mice appeared to involve incomplete backcrossing between the BALB.D2 and 38CH strains, which may account for some of the differences with our results. Further, the BALB.D2 results were obtained with SW MMTV, which is known to induce a strong Sag response in adult mice, but causes mammary tumors at a low incidence &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020128-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice appear to demonstrate a unique genetic mechanism of resistance to MMTV.</p><p>To our knowledge, our data represent the first report that a retroviral susceptibility mechanism may extend to bacteria.

This observation resulted from the absence of a TCR V&#x003b2;6&#x0002b; population of polyoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In contrast, our studies show that any one of three BALB/c endogenous MMTVs with different Sag specificities was necessary and sufficient to confer susceptibility to completely disparate pathogens. Since the resistance to both MMTV and <named-content content-type="genus-species">V. cholerae</named-content> is observed in the very early stages of primary infection (within 24 h for <named-content content-type="genus-species">V. cholerae</named-content>), it is unlikely that Sag-mediated removal of CTLs is the primary reason for susceptibility to infection in the presence of endogenous MMTVs. Our results also raise interesting questions regarding the evolution and maintenance of endogenous <italic>Mtv</italic>s in mouse populations. The dynamic compromise for mutual survival of both MMTV and the mouse will be influenced by complex interactions between the MMTV-modulated murine immune system and numerous environmental pathogens.</p><p>Although the exact process leading to MMTV disease susceptibility in BALB/<italic>Mtv</italic>-null animals remains to be determined, several clues are available.

Thus, Sag or an unknown MMTV-encoded product may manipulate novel aspects of innate or intrinsic immunity. Our studies suggest that many mouse models of human disease may be affected by the presence of endogenous MMTV proviruses. Furthermore, the ability of the related HERV-K proviruses to encode superantigens raises the possibility that human retroviruses alter the innate or intrinsic immune responses to pathogens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice.</title><p>BALB/cJ (H-2<sup>d</sup>, <italic>Mtv6, 8,</italic> and <italic>9</italic>-positive) and PERA/Ei (H-2<sup>k</sup>, <italic>Mtv</italic>-free) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020128-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d; mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jax.org">http://www.jax.org</ext-link>).

Genomic DNA samples from three <italic>Mtv-</italic>null mice were analyzed (lanes 5&#x02013;7). PCR with no added DNA template was the negative control (lane 8).</p><p>(B) Flow cytometry of endogenous <italic>Mtv</italic> Sag-reactive T-cell subsets in PBLs. PBLs from 6-mo-old BALB/c and <italic>Mtv</italic>-null mice were dually stained with mouse specific CD4-phycoerythrin and mouse-specific TCR V&#x003b2;3, 5, 7, or 12-FITC antibodies followed by FACS and software analysis. Three individual animals of each strain were tested, and the average proportion of T-cell subsets (&#x000b1; standard deviation) is shown. Flow cytometry also was performed on PBLs isolated after MMTV infection of BALB/c J (C) or <italic>Mtv</italic>-null (D) mice. The numbers inside the bars indicate the numbers of animals tested. At 11 mo post-infection of BALB/c animals, only two animals were tested for T-cell deletion because the other animals had died from mammary tumors. Cells were stained with mouse-specific CD4-PE and mouse-specific V&#x003b2;8 or V&#x003b2;14-FITC antibodies.
