Most eukaryotes express at least three isoforms of HP1 with similar domain architecture. However, despite the common specificity for methylated histone H3, the three HP1 isoforms bind to different regions of the genome. Most of the studies so far focused on the HP1a isoform and its role in transcriptional regulation. As HP1a requires additional factors to bind methylated chromatin <italic>in vitro</italic>, we wondered whether another isoform might also require additional targeting factors. Indeed, we found that HP1c interacts with the DNA binding factors Woc and Row and requires Woc to become targeted to chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, we show that the interaction between HP1c and Woc constitutes a transcriptional feedback loop that operates to balance the concentration of HP1c within the cell. This regulation may prevent HP1c from binding to methylated heterochromatin.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most eukaryotes have at least three HP1 isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Lomberk1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, which are conserved in overall structure but bind to different regions within the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Greil1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

As this modification is mostly found in transcriptionally inactive or repressed regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Peters1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Schotta1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, HP1a is mostly considered to have a repressive function. This is further substantiated by experiments in which HP1 has artificially been targeted to an integrated promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Danzer1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this view of HP1a acting merely as a repressor has been challenged by the fact that some heterochromatic genes require HP1 for active transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Lu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Clegg1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Knock down experiments targeting HP1a revealed that a considerable fraction of genes were down-regulated by HP1a arguing for an activating rather than a repressing role of this protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-DeLucia1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Even more strikingly HP1a gets targeted to highly expressed genes such as hsp70 thereby regulating its expression after heat shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Fanti1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Besides its ambiguous function in gene regulation, the role of histone methylation as the primary targeting function has been challenged recently. RNA does for example also play an important targeting function via its binding to the hinge region of the mammalian isoform of HP1a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Muchardt1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact when the hinge region is mutated, HP1 can no longer bind to chromatin in an <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Meehan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The involvement of RNA in targeting HP1 to its binding-site within the genome is also evident in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, where the recruitment of the yeast HP1 orthologue SWI6 is dependent on the generation of short double stranded RNAs from heterochromatic loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Volpe1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Hall1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Another important factor of targeting HP1 to its cognate binding site is the interaction with known chromatin associated factors such as Su(var)3&#x02013;9 or ACF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Eskeland1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The hypothesis that multiple interactors mediate HP1 binding to chromatin is further substantiated by experiments that show the importance of the hinge and the chromo shadow domain for the differential targeting of specific isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Kato1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Smothers1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The canonical HP1a isoform has been shown to interact with a multitude of different interactors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Hiragami1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> explaining many of the functions that HP1 fulfills <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>HP1 variants</title><p>Despite the wealth of information that has been accumulated for HP1a, the information on the other HP1 variants is sparse. In case of the mammalian HP1 beta and gamma, only few specific interactors have been reported. It has been suggested that HP1 beta and gamma can exchange at a given binding site depending on the physiological status of the cell or the activity state of the promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Mateescu1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Like for HP1a the other HP1 isoforms can act as transcriptional repressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Yahi1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-duChene1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> or activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Vakoc1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-FontBurgada1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> depending on promoter architecture. Considering the fact that all isoforms contain a chromo domain and have the ability to bind methylated histone H3, it is surprising that the different isoforms bind to vastly different regions of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Greil1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Smothers1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore wondered whether the differential targeting is dependent on the interaction of different HP1 isoforms with various cofactors. By performing an affinity purification using epitope-tagged HP1c we indeed found the euchromatic isoform of HP1 in Drosophila, HP1c, binds to two Zn-finger containing DNA binding factors, Woc and Row <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-FontBurgada1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, which is in marked contrast to HP1a, which does not interact with these proteins. This finding led us to speculate that the levels of HP1 isoforms have to be tightly balanced with that of their binding partners in order to prevent an interference, which could severely disturb chromatin structure. In fact it has been recently shown that a proper balance of the two HP1 isoforms in <italic>S. pombe</italic> is strictly required for the establishment and maintenance of pericentric heterochromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Sadaie1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, when we analysed the effect of Woc on targeting and expression of HP1c we found a strong interdependence. Woc acts as a transcriptional activator for HP1c's expression. HP1c in contrast impairs the ability of Woc to stimulate transcription from the endogenous HP1c locus, thereby generating a negative feedback loop that ensures a balanced level of Woc and HP1c <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>HP1a requires additional factors to get targeted to H3K9methylated chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Eskeland1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>; we thus wondered which factors interact with the highly related HP1c protein. We immunoprecipitated FLAG tagged HP1c (fHP1c) from Drosophila SL2 cells and purified a protein complex containing fHP1c and two cofactors Woc and Row (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005089-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), which is in agreement of the results from Font-Burgada and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-FontBurgada1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. All three proteins were indentified by GeLC MS/MS mass spectrometry and LC MS/MS analysis of the eluted protein complex in at least two independent protein purifications. Besides the three major stoichiometric components HP1c, Row and Woc that were identified with MOWSE scores of (274, 335 and 119) we also found varying amounts of Ubiquilin, HP1b and eIF4a, the functional significance of which has not been further studied. Both major HP1c associated proteins (Woc and Row) contain several Zn-finger domains and two or three HMG-I/Y domains, respectively. In the case of Woc three mammalian orthologues (ZNF198, ZNF261 and ZNF 262) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Kulkarni1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Smedley1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> have been reported that are mutated in myeloproliferative diseases (ZNF198) or X-linked mental retardation (ZNF 261).

To determine whether HP1a and HP1c form two different complexes with exclusive partners, we expressed HP1a and HP1c as GST fusion proteins and performed GST-pull down experiments using <italic>in vitro</italic> translated Su(var)3&#x02013;9 or ACF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005089-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Whereas HP1a efficiently precipitated these proteins, HP1c did not. In order to test whether the binding of Row or Woc to HP1c is as exclusive as the binding of ACF1 and Su(var)3&#x02013;9 to HP1a, we tested the <italic>in vitro</italic> translated Woc and Row proteins in a pull down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005089-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and data not shown). The pull down assay demonstrates that Row specifically interacts with HP1c but not with HP1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005089-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting a possible role for Row and/or Woc for the specific targeting of HP1c to eukaryotic regions. Interestingly we could not observe an interaction between Woc and HP1c <italic>in vitro</italic> neither when it was expressed separately or together with Row (data not shown). This may be due to an improper folding of <italic>in vitro</italic> translated Woc or a requirement for specific posttranslational modifications that do not occur during in vitro translation and bacterial expression. Alternatively, Woc may require a specific structural arrangement of the complex similarly to the human orthologue of Woc (ZNF198), which has recently been shown to interact with more stably with a trimeric CoRest complex than with the individual subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Gocke1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>HP1c interacts with Woc <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>In order to confirm the specificity of the Woc/HP1c interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>, we developed an HP1c specific monoclonal antibody. This antibody recognizes a protein of the expected molecular weight in extracts from wild-type flies, that is absent in extracts prepared from HP1c&#x02212;/&#x02212; strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005089-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and does not recognize any of the other HP1 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005089-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Using this antibody we could co-immunoprecipitate Woc from a nuclear extract prepared from 0&#x02013;12 hr old <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005089-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). We also used an anti-Woc antibody for immunoprecipitation, which resulted in the co-purification of HP1c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005089-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Based on these experiments we concluded that most HP1c is associated with two Zn-finger proteins Woc and Row, which do not interact with HP1a.</p><p>Using the highly specific antibody we investigated the distribution of HP1c within chromatin. In agreement with previous reports for the mammalian isoforms and for Drosophila Kc cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Smothers1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, we found that HP1c is excluded from DAPI dense regions within the nuclei of SL2 cells (data not shown), To map the sites of HP1c binding more precisely we used polytene chromosomes prepared from <italic>Drosophila</italic> third instar larvae. Staining of polytenes showed a strong localization of HP1c to interbands, which are considered to be sites of actively transcribed chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005089-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This is in marked contrast to known heterochromatic proteins such as HP1a or HP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005089-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), which are highly enriched in pericentric heterochromatin. This is of particular interest as Woc has also been shown to bind to interbands of polytene chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Raffa1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, when we performed a co staining of HP1c and Woc we found an almost perfect overlap of the two signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005089-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, merge and details) suggesting that the two proteins indeed form a complex on chromatin. We next tested whether the binding of HP1c to chromatin is dependent on the presence of Woc and vice versa. In order to do this, we prepared polytene chromosomes from HP1c&#x02212;/&#x02212; third instar larvae and from a fly strain carrying a heteroallelic combination of <italic>woc</italic> alleles that result in greatly reduced Woc levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005089-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Raffa1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>). Whereas HP1c mutations did not have a strong effect on Woc binding, mutations in <italic>woc</italic> almost completely abolished HP1c binding. However, this is only in part due to a lack of targeting as the reduction of Woc levels also results in decreased HP1c (but not HP1a) levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005089-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and data not shown). As it has been observed that the reduction of one component of a multi-protein complex destabilizes the other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Bonaldi1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, we wondered whether the reduction is indeed due to a decrease in HP1c stability or if the transcription of HP1c is reduced. Thus we performed RT-PCR analysis using total RNA isolated from salivary glands of 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae. We observed a strong reduction of HP1c mRNA in two different <italic>woc</italic> heteroallelic mutant backgrounds, suggesting that besides being a binding partner for Woc, HP1c is also transcriptionally regulated by Woc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005089-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We can not exclude the possibility that the observed effect is indirect but based on the extensive co-localization of HP1c and Woc and the mapping of HP1c to its own genomic locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Greil1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> this seems to be very unlikely.</p><fig id="pone-0005089-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005089.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>HP1c colocalizes with Woc on polytene chromosomes.</title><p>(A) Salivary gland polytene chromosomes from wild type larvae stained with &#x003b1;-HP1c and &#x003b1;-woc (upper panel).

This repression can also be observed on the transcriptional level as exogenous HP1c expression leads to a considerable reduction of the levels of endogenous HP1c mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005089-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Based on these observations, we argue that woc and HP1c can act as antagonistic factors regulating transcription, leading to a simple way of regulating HP1c levels within a cell by a negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005089-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Unfortunately the anti Woc antiserum did not allow us to perform ChIp experiments to show a direct binding of woc to the HP1c promoter. Therefore we do not know whether the effect we see is direct or indirect. However, as Greil and colleagues showed a binding of HP1c to the HP1c locus by Dam-ID <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Greil1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and we observe an almost full overlap of Woc and HP1 binding in polytene chromosomes, we would suggest that HP1c as well as its binding partner Woc play a direct role on this locus.</p><p>The mechanism by which HP1c inhibits the ability of Woc to activate transcription from the HP1c promoter is unclear. In theory, it could either interfere with the interaction between Woc and DNA or between Woc and transcriptional co-activators. As HP1c and Woc co-localize on polytene chromosomes and we do not observe an effect of HP1c deletion on Woc localization we consider the first model as improbable. As the human orthologue of Woc, ZNF198, interacts with a series of transcriptional regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005089-Gocke1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> we would suggest that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Woc protein can also bind to such transcriptional cofactors in an HP1c regulated manner. However, additional experiments will be required to dissect the precise molecular function of transcriptional regulation mediated by Woc and HP1c.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Plasmids and cloning</title><p>pFLC-1 ROW, pFLC-1 Woc and HP1c pOT2 were obtained from the Berkeley Drosphila Genome Project (BDGP).
