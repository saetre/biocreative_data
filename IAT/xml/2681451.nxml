Changes in extracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>) are sensed by the parathyroid G-protein coupled calcium receptor (CaR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The CaR determines the response of the parathyroid to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>at the levels of PTH secretion, PTH gene expression and parathyroid cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>activates the CaR, resulting in a G-protein-dependent activation of PLC, PLA2 and PLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This results in decreased PTH secretion and parathyroid cell proliferation. Calcimimetics bind transmembrane (TM) 6 and TM7 of the CaR to allosterically alter the conformation of the CaR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The calcimimetic R568 decreases PTH secretion, PTH mRNA levels and parathyroid cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Genetic deletion of G<sub>q/11 </sub>specifically in the parathyroid leads to severe hyperparathyroidism (HPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>CaR</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice are not viable due to the severe HPT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and can be rescued by mating with <italic>PTH</italic><sup>-/- </sup>or <italic>GCM2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice, where PTH is either absent or markedly reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, the CaR and its signal transduction are central to parathyroid physiology and the maintenance of a normal serum PTH and intact Ca<sup>2+ </sup>homeostasis.</p><p>Low serum Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and chronic kidney disease lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism which is characterized by increased PTH mRNA levels in experimental models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The increased PTH mRNA <italic>in vivo </italic>is post-transcriptional and is mediated by the interaction of <italic>trans</italic>-acting proteins to a defined <italic>cis</italic>-acting AU-rich element (ARE) in the PTH mRNA 3'-untranslated region (UTR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A 26-nucleotide sequence within the ARE is conserved among species and is both necessary and sufficient for protein binding and the regulation of PTH mRNA stability by dietary calcium or phosphorus depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. AU-rich binding factor 1 (AUF1) and Upstream of N-<italic>ras </italic>(Unr) are PTH mRNA <italic>trans</italic>-acting proteins that stabilize PTH mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The binding of these proteins to the PTH mRNA 3'-UTR is regulated in the parathyroid by chronic hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and experimental kidney failure as well as by the calcimimetic R568 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We have recently identified the decay-promoting protein KSRP (KH domain splicing regulatory protein) as an additional PTH mRNA 3'-UTR binding protein that determines PTH mRNA stability in transfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. KSRP-PTH mRNA interaction is increased in parathyroids from hypophosphatemic rats, where PTH mRNA is unstable, and decreased in parathyroids from hypocalcemic and experimental renal failure rats, where the PTH mRNA is more stable. The balanced interaction of PTH mRNA with AUF1 and KSRP determines PTH mRNA half-life and levels and hence serum PTH levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>There is no parathyroid cell line and the signal transduction pathway whereby [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>regulates PTH secretion has been characterized by using bovine parathyroid cells in suspension and rat parathyroid organ cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Parathyroid hormone gene expression and its regulation in cells <italic>in vitro </italic>have been studied in primary cultures of bovine parathyroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. HEK293 cells transfected with the CaR faithfully maintain an intact signal transduction after the stimulus of a high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We have now utilized this transfected heterologous cell system to study the mechanisms whereby the CaR regulates PTH gene expression. As the regulation of PTH gene expression by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>is predominantly post-transcriptional, we studied PTH mRNA stability in a system that was independent of any effect on PTH transcription through the PTH promoter. To do this we expressed PTH mRNA driven by a viral promoter to express large amounts of PTH mRNA in HEK293 cells. Differences in PTH mRNA levels would therefore represent only post-transcriptional regulation. Expression of the CaR markedly decreased PTH mRNA levels and stability and conferred responsiveness to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>and the calcimimetic R568 in these cells. This was mediated by the PTH mRNA 3'-UTR ARE. Moreover, expression of the CaR in the HEK293 cells led to a shift from the interaction of the PTH mRNA with the stabilizing protein, AUF1, to the destabilizing protein, KSRP. Furthermore, the expression of CaR modified AUF1 post-translationally as previously shown <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Therefore, the expression of the CaR in this heterologous cell system reproduces the signal transduction that determines PTH gene expression in the parathyroid.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The calcium receptor decreases parathyroid hormone mRNA levels post-transcriptionally in HEK293 cells</title><p>PTH gene expression is regulated post-transcriptionally by Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and calcimimetics affecting PTH mRNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To focus on the effect of the CaR on PTH mRNA stability in a cell system we constructed an expression vector containing the full-length human PTH gene including its three exons and two introns (hPTH) driven by a viral SV40 (not shown) or CMV promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

The transcribed PTH mRNA was correctly spliced resulting in PTH mRNA of the expected size (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The PTH mRNA was translated into mature human PTH that was measured in the medium by radioimmunoassay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). We then studied the effect of the CaR on PTH mRNA levels in HEK293 cells expressing the PTH gene by transient transfection.

Co-transfection of the human (h) CaR together with the hPTH plasmid resulted in a marked decrease in PTH mRNA levels by Northern blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) and real time RT PCR (qPCR) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>) corrected for co-transfected control genes GH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>) or endogenous HPRT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). The decrease in PTH mRNA by the CaR was reflected in a decrease in secreted PTH at 48 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Transfection with another G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), the PTH receptor (PTH1R) had no effect on PTH mRNA levels, confirming the specificity of the CaR effect on PTH mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The calcium receptor decreases parathyroid hormone mRNA levels through the parathyroid hormone mRNA 3'-UTR AU-rich element</title><p>We have previously reported that the regulation of PTH mRNA levels is dependent upon a <italic>cis-</italic>acting instability ARE in the PTH mRNA 3'-UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

To determine whether the effect of the CaR on PTH mRNA stability in the engineered cells involves post-translational modifications of AUF1 as it does in the parathyroid, we performed 2D gels on extracts from HEK293 cells transfected with the CaR expression plasmid or an empty vector as control. AUF1 has four isoforms of p37, p40, p42 and p45. There was no difference in AUF1 protein levels in the 1D gels between cells with and without the CaR, apart from a small decrease in p45 in the CaR-expressing cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). However, 2D gels showed that endogenous AUF1 isoforms p37, p40 and p42 had a different distribution of the spots between extracts of cells with and without the CaR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for myc- p37, p40, p42 or p45 isoforms of AUF1 together with the CaR or control plasmids. Cell extracts were analyzed on 2D gels with an anti-myc antibody. CaR expression led to changes in mobility of myc-AUF1 p37, p40 and also p45 but not p42 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Unlike the changes in myc-AUF1 p45, endogenous AUF1 p45 was only slightly modified by CaR signaling. The change in endogenous p42 was not reflected in the myc-tagged transfected p42. The reasons for these discrepancies are not clear. AUF1 p40 undergoes reversible phosphorylation which may regulate ARE-directed mRNA turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We therefore added a non-specific phosphatase to extracts from cells expressing myc-p40 with or without the CaR. Calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) treatment of control extracts modified AUF1 to the form present in CaR-expressing extracts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Treatment with CIP had no further effect on the CaR-expressing extracts. These results indicate that the CaR modifies AUF1 post-translationally and suggests that at least part of this change involves phosphorylation of isoform p40.</p></sec><sec><title>Parathyroid hormone mRNA levels are regulated by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>and the calcimimetic R568 through the calcium receptor</title><p>We then studied the effect of a low-calcium medium on the regulation of PTH gene expression by the CaR in the transfected cells.

We then performed the same experiments with and without the calcimimetic, R568 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The CaR decreased PTH mRNA levels as before at 1.2 mM Ca<sup>2+ </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Activation of the CaR by R568 decreased PTH mRNA levels at 1.2 mM Ca<sup>2+ </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) and also at 0.2 mM Ca<sup>2+ </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). 0.2 mM Ca<sup>2+ </sup>prevented the decrease in PTH mRNA levels due to the CaR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). However, at 0.2 mM Ca<sup>2+ </sup>the addition of R568 still effectively decreased PTH mRNA levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). There was no effect of CaR expression on co-transfected GFP mRNA levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>) used as a control for transfection efficiency and loading.

The effect of R568 on PTH mRNA levels in the CaR-transfected cells at 0.2 mM Ca<sup>2+ </sup>indicates that the calcimimetic is effective at activating the CaR even when the CaR is in a relaxed configuration. Therefore, in these engineered cells, the CaR is permissive for the effect of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>and R568 on PTH mRNA levels.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Primary bovine parathyroid cells in culture have been successfully used for the study of PTH secretion in the short term (hours) but not for longer term effects on PTH gene expression. This is because these primary monolayer cultures of parathyroid cells lose the expression of the CaR after 24 h in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Parathyroid organoid cultures retain a prolonged calcium response and regulation of PTH mRNA stability by high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>and a calcimimetic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, there is no parathyroid cell line. Kifor et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] showed that the CaR activated the phosphotyrosine kinase in both CaR-transfected HEK293 cells and native bovine parathyroid cells. In CaR-expressing HEK293 cells, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>activates PI-PLC, PLA<sub>2 </sub>and PLD, similar to the effect in bovine primary parathyroid cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. There have been no studies on the effect of the CaR on the regulation of PTH gene expression using the transfected HEK293 cells. We therefore expressed the CaR together with the hPTH gene in HEK293 cells. The effect of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>and the calcimimetic R568 on PTH expression in the parathyroid <italic>in vivo </italic>is predominantly post-transcriptional, regulating PTH mRNA stability and not transcription through the PTH promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This allowed us to use a viral promoter upstream of the hPTH gene to study the effect of the CaR signaling on PTH mRNA levels. The PTH gene was efficiently transcribed, processed and translated to mature immunoreactive PTH. Significantly, PTH mRNA and secreted PTH levels were decreased in cells expressing the CaR compared with control cells. The calcium concentration in the medium was 1.2 mM, which would activate the CaR to reduce PTH mRNA levels in the CaR-transfected cells. Therefore, the CaR suppresses PTH gene expression post-transcriptionally by acting on PTH mRNA driven by a viral and not the native PTH promoter. <italic>In vitro </italic>degradation assays using extracts from cells with or without the CaR showed that expression of the CaR led to a decrease in full-length PTH mRNA half-life but not the half-life of a PTH mRNA with an internal deletion of the PTH mRNA ARE. The decreased PTH mRNA stability correlated with decreased PTH mRNA steady state levels.</p><p>Dietary-induced changes in serum calcium and phosphate levels regulate PTH gene expression <italic>in vivo </italic>post-transcriptionally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This regulation is mediated by the changes in binding of stabilizing <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, AUF1 and Unr, and the destabilizing protein KSRP, to the defined <italic>cis</italic>-acting ARE in the PTH mRNA 3'-UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The role of the PTH mRNA ARE in the regulation of PTH mRNA levels by the CaR was demonstrated by transfection experiments using a GH reporter mRNA containing the PTH mRNA 63 nt ARE. The CaR decreased GH-PTH ARE mRNA levels but had no effect on native GH mRNA or a GH mRNA containing a truncated PTH mRNA ARE. Calcium receptor-transfected HEK293 cells showed increased KSRP-PTH mRNA binding and decreased AUF1-PTH mRNA binding by RIP analysis, correlating with the decreased PTH mRNA levels and stability in the CaR-transfected cells. Therefore, the signaling of the CaR in the parathyroid is maintained in the transfected cells as reflected in changes in AUF1 and KSRP PTH mRNA interactions and the role of the PTH mRNA ARE in this regulation.</p><p>AUF1-PTH mRNA binding is increased by hypocalcemia or chronic kidney disease, or decreased by hypophosphatemia or administration of the calcimimetic R568 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These changes in serum Ca<sup>2+ </sup>or phosphate and kidney disease are associated with post-translational modifications of AUF1. AUF1 isoforms p40 and p42 are modified by dietary-induced hypocalcemia, and the secondary hyperparathyroidism of chronic kidney disease and its treatment by R568 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We now show that expression of the CaR in the engineered cells also induces post-translational modifications in both endogenous AUF1 and myc-tagged transfected AUF1 isoforms that are similar to the modifications <italic>in vivo </italic>in the parathyroid. The modification of at least AUF1 p40 involves phosphorylation where expression of the CaR is associated with dephosphorylation. Post-translational modifications of this isoform, AUF1 p40, are altered concomitant with changes in RNA binding activity and stabilization of ARE-containing mRNAs in phorbol ester-treated monocytic leukemia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. AUF1 p40 recovered from polysomes was phosphorylated on Ser83 and Ser87 in untreated cells but lost these modifications following phorbol ester treatment. It was suggested that selected signal transduction pathways may regulate ARE-directed mRNA turnover by reversible phosphorylation of AUF1 p40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Therefore, both in the CaR-transfected cells and in the phorbol ester-treated cells, dephosphorylation of AUF1 p40, is associated with decreased AUF1 activity. In the case of PTH mRNA, inactivity of AUF1 results in a less stable PTH mRNA after expression of the CaR, as AUF1 is a PTH mRNA stabilizing protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>We also show that expression of the CaR conferred responsiveness to low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>and the calcimimetic R568, underlining the relevance of this cellular model to the parathyroid. A low- [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>medium increased PTH expression only in the cells expressing the CaR. Similarly, R568 decreased PTH expression through the CaR at both 1.2 and 0.2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. Therefore, regulation of PTH mRNA levels by expression of the CaR itself and both its activation by the calcimimetic and its relaxation by a low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>are maintained in these transfected cells. This is the first demonstration that the CaR can regulate PTH gene expression in heterologous cells. This regulation is obtained through the post-transcriptional mechanisms that involve changes in PTH mRNA-protein interactions in the parathyroid (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). It is likely that PTH secretion would exhibit a similar regulation by calcium as PTH mRNA levels, given its dependence on the latter. However, secretion was not measured as a function of the extracellular calcium concentration in the heterologous HEK293 cell system, in which there is a prominent component of constitutive secretion, unlike the parathyroid cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Secretion in HEK293 cells may be independently regulated by the CaR although we have not studied this question. The parathyroid cell is unique in that the stimulus for secretion, gene expression and cell proliferation is a low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>and not a high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. Inverse control of secretion by a low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>of PTHrP secretion also occurs in the epithelial cells of the lactating breast and certain breast cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In addition high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>decreases hormone secretion in the secretion of renin by renal juxtaglomerular cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Calcium receptor activation increases cell proliferation in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], but inhibits parathyroid proliferation <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It is remarkable and intriguing that despite these differences, the transfected cell system retains so many of the native characteristics of the unique parathyroid cell, specifically the relationship between calcium and PTH mRNA stability. The CaR-mediated decrease in PTH expression in these cells mirrors the marked increase in serum PTH <italic>in vivo </italic>in mice and men with inactivating mutations of the CaR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. These results support the concept that the parathyroid cell is geared to constitutively synthesize and secrete PTH, and it is the presence of a functioning CaR that tonically inhibits PTH expression and secretion and allows responsivity to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Regulation of PTH gene expression in HEK293 cells transfected with the CaR and hPTH plasmids and in the rat parathyroid by calcium</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left">HEK293 cells + CaR</td><td align="left">Rat parathyroid</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">PTH transcription</td><td align="left">not applicable</td><td align="left">no effect</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">PTH mRNA levels</td><td align="left">regulated</td><td align="left">regulated</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">PTH mRNA stability</td><td align="left">regulated</td><td align="left">regulated</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">PTH secretion</td><td align="left">unknown</td><td align="left">regulated</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">AUF1 and KSRP-PTH mRNA interactions</td><td align="left">regulated</td><td align="left">regulated</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">AUF1 protein modifications</td><td align="left">regulated</td><td align="left">regulated</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">regulation by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>and R568</td><td align="left">regulated</td><td align="left">regulated</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>AUF1 = AU rich binding factor; KSRP = KH domain splicing regulatory protein; PTH = parathyroid hormone</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The expression of the CaR in transfected HEK293 cells decreases PTH gene expression post-transcriptionally and is sufficient to confer the regulation of PTH gene expression by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o </sub>and a calcimimetic, R568.
