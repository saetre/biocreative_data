We approached this issue by creating a mouse strain in which the coding sequence of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inserted into the <italic>Aire</italic> locus in a manner allowing concomitant disruption of functional Aire protein expression. We found that Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (i.e., GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) mTECs were the major cell types responsible for the expression of Aire-dependent TRA genes such as <italic>insulin 2</italic> and <italic>salivary protein 1</italic>, whereas Aire-independent TRA genes such as <italic>C-reactive protein</italic> and <italic>glutamate decarboxylase 67</italic> were expressed from both Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Aire<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mTECs. Remarkably, absence of Aire from mTECs caused morphological changes together with altered distribution of mTECs committed to Aire expression. Furthermore, we found that the numbers of mTECs that express involucrin, a marker for terminal epidermal differentiation, were reduced in Aire-deficient mouse thymus, which was associated with nearly an absence of Hassall's corpuscle-like structures in the medulla. Our results suggest that Aire controls the differentiation program of mTECs, thereby organizing the global mTEC integrity that enables TRA expression from terminally differentiated mTECs in the thymic microenvironment.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: Ab, antibody; Ag, antigen; Aire, autoimmune regulator; APECED, autoimmune-polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy; CRP, C-reactive protein; EpCAM, epithelial cell adhesion molecule 1; FSC, forward scatter; GAD67, glutamate decarboxylase 67; K5, keratin 5; mTEC, medullary thymic epithelial cell; SAP1, salivary protein 1; SSC, side scatter; TRA, tissue-restricted Ag; UEA-1, <italic>Ulex europaeus</italic> agglutinin 1.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Autoimmune diseases are mediated by sustained adaptive immune responses specific for self-antigens (Ags) through unknown pathogenic mechanisms. Although breakdown of self-tolerance is considered to be the key event in the disease process, the mechanisms that allow the production of autoantibodies and/or autoreactive lymphocytes are largely enigmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Autoimmune-polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED; OMIM 240300) is a rather rare autoimmune disease affecting mainly the endocrine glands. Because mutation of a single gene, <italic>autoimmune regulator</italic> (<italic>AIRE</italic>), is solely responsible for the development of APECED, understanding the relationship between <italic>AIRE</italic> gene malfunction and the breakdown of self-tolerance promises to help unravel the pathogenesis of not only APECED but also other types of autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>).</p><p>One of the most important aspects of AIRE in the context of autoimmunity is its limited tissue expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). mTECs are believed to play major roles in the establishment of self-tolerance by eliminating autoreactive T cells (negative selection) and/or by producing immunoregulatory T cells, which together prevent CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell&#x02013;mediated organ-specific autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). For this purpose, mTECs appear to express a set of self-Ags encompassing many or most of the self-Ags expressed by parenchymal organs. Supporting this hypothesis, analysis of gene expression in the thymic stroma has demonstrated that mTECs are a specialized cell type in which promiscuous expression of a broad range of peripheral tissue-restricted Ag (TRA) genes (i.e., promiscuous gene expression) is an autonomous property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Aire in mTECs has been suggested to regulate this promiscuous gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) through as yet undetermined mechanisms.</p><p>From a mechanistic viewpoint, there are two possible models to explain the function of Aire in the thymic organogenesis required for the establishment of self-tolerance. First, Aire may play a tolerogenic role within the types of mTECs characterized by Aire expression. In other words, the presence of Aire within cells is necessary in order for them to function normally as tolerance-establishing cells. Consistent with this idea, the current prevailing view on the roles of Aire in establishing self-tolerance is that Aire-positive cells are the major cell types that show promiscuous gene expression and that the lack of Aire protein within cells impairs their tolerogenic function because of the reduced transcription of TRA genes, although the developmental process of mTECs is otherwise unaltered in the absence of Aire (model 1). The second model hypothesizes that Aire is necessary for the developmental program of mTECs, including Aire-positive cells themselves. In this case, we assume that what are called Aire-positive mTECs and other Aire-dependent cell-types do not develop normally in the absence of Aire. Given that acquisition of the properties of promiscuous gene expression depends on the maturation status of mTECs (see Results and Discussion), impaired promiscuous gene expression from Aire-deficient mice can be associated with a defect of such an Aire-dependent developmental program in mTECs (model 2). Although it is still controversial whether reduced transcription of particular TRA genes in Aire-deficient mTECs can account for the development of autoimmunity targeting the corresponding self-Ags in Aire-deficient mice by itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), it is critical to determine which model provides a more appropriate explanation of Aire-dependent promiscuous gene expression to further elucidate the molecular aspects of Aire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Model 1 would direct research toward the mechanisms underlying how a single <italic>Aire</italic> gene can regulate a large number of target genes (i.e., TRA genes), whereas model 2 would accelerate studies of the developmental program of mTECs in which Aire plays a pivotal role. These two models can be tested if we can monitor the developmental process of mTECs committed to Aire expression in both the presence and absence of functional Aire protein.</p><p>This issue regarding the roles of Aire in thymic organogenesis is also directly linked to the fundamental question of how mTECs acquire their unique ability to express a broad range of self-Ags (i.e., promiscuous gene expression). The terminal differentiation model assumes that mTECs eventually acquire the capacity for promiscuous gene expression by becoming differentiated, more mature, and more promiscuous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). This model suggests that mTECs, especially Aire-positive cells, are specialized cell types that have acquired this ability through differentiation. In this context, it is noteworthy that the transcriptional machinery necessary for promiscuous gene expression other than Aire protein is considered to be acquired by mTECs independent of Aire expression in this model. The model suggests that the transcriptional unit for promiscuous gene expression becomes fully active when Aire starts to be expressed in terminally differentiated mTECs. In contrast, the developmental model considers that promiscuous gene expression is a reflection of the multipotency of immature mTECs before the developmental fate of particular cell types is determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). In this model, expression of a broad spectrum of TRA genes is regulated by conserved developmental programs that are active in developing mTECs, and Aire and/or Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells control this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Accordingly, the developmental model considers that Aire acts at the early developmental stage of mTEC differentiation, which is in marked contrast to the timing of Aire expression proposed in the terminal differentiation model. Thus, the terminal differentiation model and the developmental model favor models 1 and 2, respectively, proposed for the roles of Aire in promiscuous gene expression and self-tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><p>To investigate in more detail the roles of Aire in thymic organogenesis, we have used a knock-in mouse strategy in which the coding sequence of GFP was inserted into the <italic>Aire</italic> gene locus in a manner allowing concomitant disruption of functional Aire protein expression. This strategy allowed us to distinguish mTECs committed to expressing Aire from Aire-nonexpressing mTECs, in both the presence and absence of functional Aire protein. In addition, with the use of knock-in mice in which thymic TRA (i.e., <italic>glutamate decarboxylase 67</italic> [<italic>GAD67</italic>]) expression can be monitored by GFP expression we also examined the cell types of mTECs responsible for promiscuous gene expression in situ. The results suggest that Aire promotes the differentiation program of mTECs and that promiscuous gene expression is accomplished in terminally differentiated mTECs that have fully matured in the presence of Aire protein.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Establishment of Aire/GFP knock-in mice</title><p>To examine the molecular and cellular contribution of Aire to thymic organogenesis, we established Aire/GFP knock-in mice in which expression of the GFP gene is under the transcriptional control of the endogenous <italic>Aire</italic> gene. In this strategy, modification of the <italic>Aire</italic> gene locus was minimized by inserting a GFP-neomycin resistance (neo<sup>r</sup>) gene cassette (gfp-neo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) between exon 1 and exon 2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). After establishing <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp-neo</sup></italic> mice, they were crossed with a general deleter Cre recombinase-expressing transgenic line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) to remove the neo<sup>r</sup> gene cassette, which contains the herpes simplex virus <italic>thymidine kinase</italic> gene promoter for efficient neo<sup>r</sup> gene expression. After confirming the removal of the neo<sup>r</sup> gene cassette (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), mice were crossed with C57BL/6 mice to select a line containing the GFP knock-in allele but not the Cre recombinase-expressing transgenic allele. <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> mice were then crossed to obtain <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice, which have a null mutation for the <italic>Aire</italic> gene because of disruption of the <italic>Aire</italic> gene by insertion of the GFP gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).

Stromal cells showing variable extents of GFP expression in the cytoplasm and nucleus were scattered throughout the thymic medulla (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The medullary region was identified by staining with <italic>Ulex europaeus</italic> agglutinin 1 (UEA-1) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), anti&#x02013;epithelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (EpCAM) mAb (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>), or anti&#x02013;keratin 5 (K5) Ab (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080046/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080046/DC1</ext-link>). GFP-expressing cells from <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> mouse thymus showed a dendritic to fibroblastic morphology and were enriched at the cortico-medullary junction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>; and Fig. S1 A). When doubly stained with anti-Aire Ab, most of the GFP-expressing cells contained variable amounts of Aire nuclear dots within their nuclei (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), indicating that GFP expression is under the transcriptional control of the authentic <italic>Aire</italic> gene. However, a few cells showed Aire nuclear dots without any detectable GFP expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, arrows) or expressed GFP without obvious Aire nuclear dots (not depicted). As expected, <italic>Aire</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mouse thymus showed no GFP signals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Notably, most of the CD11c-positive DCs in the thymus were GFP negative (Fig. S1 B), suggesting that Aire expression from thymic DCs is negligible compared with that from mTECs.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Altered morphology and distribution of mTECs committed to express Aire in the absence of functional Aire protein.</bold> (A and B) mTECs active in <italic>Aire</italic> gene transcription were visualized by immunohistochemistry with anti-GFP Ab (green).

GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> thymus were enriched at the cortico-medullary junction (top), whereas GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> thymus tended to be localized more evenly within each medulla or even enriched at the center of the medulla (bottom).

A total of 80 and 88 GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> and <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> thymi, respectively, were evaluated. Red lines represent mean values. Two mice for each group were analyzed, and similar results were obtained from a total of three repeats.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052827f02"></graphic></fig></sec><sec><title>Altered thymic organization in Aire-deficient mice</title><p>We then examined the effect of Aire deficiency on thymic organization in <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mouse thymus sections, focusing on the production of cells genetically marked with GFP and, therefore, active in <italic>Aire</italic> gene transcription but lacking functional Aire protein. There were many GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> &#x0201c;Aire-less&#x0201d; TECs within the medulla (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2, A and B</xref>; and Fig. S1 A), indicating clearly that Aire protein itself is not necessary for the production of particular mTEC lineages committed to express Aire. However, detailed inspection demonstrated that the morphology and location of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> thymus were altered compared with those of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells containing functional Aire protein from <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> mouse thymus. First, we noticed that the cell shape of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mTECs lacking functional Aire protein was altered; in <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> thymus, more GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells exhibited a globular shape instead of a dendritic to fibroblastic morphology, compared with <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> thymus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, arrows). The lower preponderance of a dendritic shape of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Aire-less mTECs was verified by statistical analysis. We calculated the level of cell shape complexity for each GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell by dividing the length of the cellular periphery by the cell area using a computer program (i.e., the higher the value, the more complex the cell shape). GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> thymus showed lower values (i.e., less complexity per cell) and a narrower distribution of values (i.e., less heterogeneity of cell shape) than those from <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> thymus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Because a gene-dosage effect has been noticed at the <italic>Aire</italic> gene locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), we carefully excluded the possibility that the altered shape of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> thymus was due simply to higher GFP protein expression within each cell, i.e., imposing a potentially toxic burden on the cells. For this purpose, we crossed <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> mice with <italic>Aire</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) to establish <italic>Aire<sup>&#x02212;/gfp</sup></italic> mice in which the <italic>gfp</italic> allele is single, as in <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> mice (Fig. S2 A). Similarly to the <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> thymus analysis, GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from <italic>Aire<sup>&#x02212;/gfp</sup></italic> thymus demonstrated less complexity of cell shape than those from <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> thymus, as confirmed using the same method of statistical analysis (Fig. S2 B). Although we analyzed the thymic organization of <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice before the onset of autoimmune pathology (i.e., 4&#x02013;6 wk after birth), we also excluded the possibility that the altered cell shape of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> thymus was secondary to the autoimmune phenotypes by establishing <italic>Aire<sup>&#x02212;/gfp</sup></italic> mice expressing the OT-II TCR transgene in which the autoreactive T cell repertoire is absent (Fig. S3 A). Morphological changes in GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were similarly observed in these mice (Fig. S3 B), suggesting that the altered shape of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells lacking Aire protein was independent of autoimmune phenotype.</p><p>Second, we noticed that the distribution pattern of mTECs committed to Aire expression was also affected in the absence of functional Aire protein. In contrast with the enrichment of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> thymus at the cortico-medullary junction, GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> thymus tended to be localized more uniformly within each medulla or even enriched at the medulla center (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref> and Fig. S1 A). Altered distribution of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Aire-less mTECs was also evident in <italic>Aire<sup>&#x02212;/gfp</sup></italic> mice (Fig. S2 A), as well as in <italic>Aire<sup>&#x02212;/gfp</sup></italic> mice expressing the nonautoreactive OT-II TCR transgene (Fig. S3 A). Collectively, production of a particular mTEC lineage committed to express Aire is not determined by Aire protein alone. However, Aire deficiency in these cells results in morphological changes together with altered location within the medulla, suggesting a role of Aire in the differentiation program of mTECs in a cell-intrinsic manner.</p><p>Analysis of embryonic thymus demonstrated that GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were absent at embryonic day 13.5, but clearly present at embryonic day 16.5 in both <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> and <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice (Fig. S1 C). Although the effect of absence of Aire protein on the location of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice at the embryonic and early P1 (postneonatal) stages was difficult to evaluate because of the less organized thymic structure together with relatively small numbers of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells at those stages, morphological alteration of each mTEC committed to Aire expression was already evident at the neonatal stage (P1; Fig. S4 A), as confirmed by the same statistical analysis applied to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref> (Fig. S4 B). The properties of GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (i.e., Aire nonexpressing) mTECs as evaluated by immunohistochemistry with UEA-1, anti-EpCAM Ab (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>), anti-K5 Ab (Fig. S1 A), ER-TR5 Ab, anti&#x02013;claudin 3/4 Abs, and MTS10 Ab (not depicted) showed no obvious difference between <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> and <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> adult thymi.</p><p>In addition to the histological evaluation of mTECs based on Aire/GFP expression, another possibility that Aire controls the differentiation program of mTECs has emerged from studies focusing on the cell differentiation markers expressed by mTECs. In the skin, involucrin expression is restricted to postmitotic epithelial cells and serves as a marker of epidermal and follicular terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Interestingly, immunohistochemistry of the human thymus using anti-involucrin Ab stains characteristic swirled epithelial structures known as Hassall's corpuscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), which is consistent with the fact that Hassall's corpuscles are composed of terminally differentiated mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). When thymus sections from Aire-sufficient mice were stained with anti-involucrin Ab, involucrin-expressing cells were scattered within the EpCAM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> thymic medulla (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). The number of involucrin-expressing cells was age dependent and declined between 8 and 11 wk (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref> and Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080046/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080046/DC1</ext-link>). In addition, we occasionally found larger involucrin-expressing structures with a hyalinized degenerated core in the thymic medulla from Aire-sufficient mice, which is reminiscent of Hassall's corpuscles in human thymus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Remarkably, the numbers of mTECs expressing involucrin in Aire-deficient mice were significantly lower than those in Aire-sufficient mice, especially at 4 and 8 wk of age (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Furthermore, we observed no typical Hassall's corpuscle-like structures in the thymus of Aire-deficient mice at any age, which is in contrast to those seen in Aire-sufficient mice (Table S1). These results further support the notion that lack of Aire in mTECs alters their differentiation program, thereby altering mTEC integrity.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Reduced numbers of terminally differentiated mTECs in the absence of Aire.</bold> (A) Involucrin-expressing mTECs (green) were scattered within the thymic medulla (red; stained with anti-EpCAM Ab) of Aire-sufficient mice.

Collectively, the results suggest that <italic>Aire</italic> deficiency results in a global alteration of the thymic microenvironment that involves not only mTECs committed to express Aire but also the Aire-nonexpressing mTECs that surround Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Aire-dependent TRA gene expression</title><p>Although Aire has been suggested to regulate promiscuous gene expression in mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), demonstration that Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells are the major source of promiscuous gene expression from mTECs is still incomplete in the absence of appropriate cell markers for Aire-expressing cell lineages. Existing data for promiscuous gene expression from mTECs were obtained by flow cytometric sorting using surrogate Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell markers such as CD80 and MHC class II. As a result, it is not yet clear which population of mTECs (i.e., Aire-expressing or Aire-nonexpressing mTECs) is deficient in promiscuous gene expression as a result of absence of functional Aire protein. To answer this question, we separated GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mTECs from both <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> and <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice and examined the expression of several TRA genes, including both Aire-dependent (i.e., <italic>insulin 2</italic> and <italic>salivary protein 1</italic> [<italic>SAP1</italic>]) and Aire-independent (<italic>C-reactive protein</italic> [<italic>CRP</italic>]) TRA genes; expression of the former and the latter gene classes has been demonstrated to be reduced or unchanged, respectively, in CD80<sup>hi</sup>/class II<sup>hi</sup> Aire-deficient mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mTECs from <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> mice showed the highest expression of <italic>insulin 2</italic> and <italic>SAP1</italic>, and expression of those genes was much lower in GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mTECs from the same animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Remarkably, both GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mTECs from <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice expressed almost none of the Aire-dependent TRA genes <italic>insulin 2</italic> and <italic>SAP1</italic>. mTECs defined by UEA-1 binding from <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice, which includes both Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Aire<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells, showed intermediate expression of those genes. These results clearly indicate two important features of promiscuous gene expression in mTECs. First, Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mTECs are the major cell types responsible for the expression of Aire-dependent TRA genes. Second, mTECs cannot express Aire-dependent TRA genes in the absence of functional Aire protein, even though the lineage commitment to express Aire and the expression of Ag presentation-related molecules, such as CD80 and MHC class II, are preserved (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). It is important to emphasize that the latter observation does not necessarily mean that Aire acts on the already existing transcriptional machinery required for TRA gene expression within established terminally differentiated mTECs. Rather, in the light of the fact that GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Aire-less mTECs show defective development, as indicated by their altered morphology and distribution, we suggest that Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mTECs acquire their unique machinery for promiscuous gene expression only when they have fully achieved maturation with the help of Aire protein (see Discussion and see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>TRA gene expression from mTECs assessed by real-time PCR.</bold> Expression of <italic>insulin 2</italic>, <italic>SAP1</italic>, <italic>CRP</italic>, and <italic>Aire</italic> was examined from each fraction of mTECs sorted on the basis of the flow cytometric profile demonstrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>.

Instead, Aire seems to function within mTECs in the later stages of differentiation, when the cells are also responsible for TRA gene expression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, we addressed fundamental questions regarding how mTECs acquire the capacity for promiscuous gene expression with the participation of Aire, with the hope that understanding the roles of Aire in thymic organogenesis will help to unravel the molecular mechanisms responsible for expression of immunological self in the thymic microenvironment. The issues include the following: first, whether Aire itself is necessary for the production and/or differentiation program of Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell lineages; second, whether Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mTECs are necessary for the structural and/or functional organization of other types of mTECs; third, to what extent Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mTECs contribute to the expression of TRA genes; and fourth, the nature of the maturation status of mTECs that express Aire and are responsible for TRA expression. Because Aire-specific Ab cannot be used to investigate the differentiation process of mTECs committed to express Aire in the absence of Aire protein, we established Aire/GFP knock-in mice in which the GFP marker gene was inserted into the <italic>Aire</italic> gene locus in a manner allowing concomitant disruption of functional Aire protein expression. In <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> mice, this strategy also enables us to distinguish Aire-expressing cells from Aire-nonexpressing cells without introducing any cell markers incompletely unique to Aire-expressing cells. Accordingly, mTECs committed to Aire expression were faithfully GFP marked with this strategy; mTECs transcriptionally active for the <italic>Aire</italic> gene were mostly positive for staining with anti-Aire Ab by immunohistochemistry. There were, however, small numbers of cells that were either positive for Aire staining but negative for <italic>Aire</italic> gene transcription (i.e., GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) or, conversely, positive for <italic>Aire</italic> gene transcription (i.e., GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) but negative for Aire staining. The former cell type could result from different half-lives of the two proteins (GFP vs. Aire), whereas the latter cell type could result from Aire protein being present as a diffuse nucleoplasmic form (more difficult to recognize) instead of the typical nuclear-dot form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Alternatively, these discrepancies could simply be accounted for by differences in detection sensitivity. Indeed, RT-PCR analysis of flow cytometry&#x02013;sorted cell fractions showed the expected patterns of <italic>Aire</italic> gene expression.</p><p>With Aire/GFP knock-in mice, we have clearly demonstrated that Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mTECs are the major cell types responsible for the expression of so-called Aire-dependent TRA genes such as <italic>insulin 2</italic> and <italic>SAP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). These genes were almost exclusively expressed from GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mTECs of <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> mice but not of <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice. In contrast, expression of Aire-independent genes, such as <italic>CRP</italic>, was not affected by the absence of Aire. <italic>CRP</italic> expression from GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells was similar between <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> and <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice. <italic>CRP</italic> expression, although at lower levels, was also observed from GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells and, again, was indistinguishable between <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> and <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice. Expression of <italic>GAD67</italic> in an Aire-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) was also supported by immunohistochemistry of GAD67/GFP knock-in thymus, demonstrating <italic>GAD67</italic> expression irrespective of the presence of Aire protein in each mTEC. We speculate that the Aire dependency of TRAs reflects, in part, the cell types in which TRAs are expressed; expression of Aire-dependent genes is confined to Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mTECs, whereas expression of Aire-independent genes occurs from both Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Aire<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mTECs. It is of note that mTECs do not uniformly express the overlapping spectrum of TRAs, as exemplified by the scattered expression of the <italic>GAD67</italic> gene in GAD67/GFP knock-in mouse thymus. Similarly, although Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mTECs are the major cell types responsible for the expression of Aire-dependent TRA genes, this does not mean that all Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mTECs express Aire-dependent TRA genes uniformly. Indeed, single-cell analysis has demonstrated that expression of Aire in mTECs is not sufficient for simultaneous coexpression of Aire-dependent TRA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Thus, we favor the notion that promiscuous gene expression reflects the thymus-wide summation of expression of a small number of self-Ags by individual mTECs rather than expression of the complete spectrum of self-Ags by each cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>).</p><p>Because expression of transcription factors associated with developmental plasticity of progenitor cells (i.e., <italic>Nanog</italic>, <italic>Oct4</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic>) is Aire-dependent in mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), the developmental model predicts that Aire acts early in the development of mTECs. The developmental model also suggests that promiscuous gene expression represents coordinated gene expression reflecting an alternate program of epithelial differentiation among actively proliferating mTECs at their progenitor or immature stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). However, accumulating data together with the results of the present study do not support such a view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Rather, it is likely that Aire is acting at the late differentiation stages of mTECs. Accordingly, Aire-dependent processes for achieving promiscuous gene expression might also be active at the late differentiation stages of mTECs (see the subsequent paragraph). Clearly, this does not involve mTECs gaining the ability to express CD80 from CD80<sup>lo</sup> precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>) because GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mTECs from <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice demonstrated normal levels of CD80 expression. It is necessary to dissect the developmental process of mTECs, thereby precisely identifying the Aire-dependent steps of mTEC differentiation.</p><p>Given that Aire-expressing cells are terminally differentiated, the demonstration that Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mTECs are the major cell types responsible for expression of TRA genes, at least for Aire-dependent genes, apparently favors the terminal differentiation model for Aire-dependent promiscuous gene expression from mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). However, our results do support a key aspect of a role for Aire in the developmental model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>): absence of Aire in mTECs causes morphological changes together with altered distribution of mTECs committed to express Aire. Indeed, the difference in appearance of GFP-expressing cells was distinct enough to allow discrimination between <italic>Aire<sup>&#x0002b;/gfp</sup></italic> and <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mouse sections by blind analysis. Interestingly, Gillard et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) noted that globular mTECs without visible cellular projections were more prominent in Aire-deficient thymus, which could represent the GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> globular mTECs we observed in <italic>Aire<sup>gfp/gfp</sup></italic> mice. Furthermore, expression of functional molecules, such as CD80 and MHC class II from mTECs noncommitted to express Aire, was also affected by the absence of Aire, suggesting that Aire and/or Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mTECs influence the organization of mTECs beyond simply controlling promiscuous gene expression within Aire-expressing cell lineages. We do not believe that the demonstration that terminally differentiated Aire-expressing cells are the major source of promiscuous gene expression (apparently favoring the terminal differentiation model) and the demonstration that Aire and/or Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells controls thymic organogenesis (consistent with the developmental model; reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref> and present study) are mutually exclusive. Instead, Aire could both promote the differentiation program of mTECs committed to express Aire, ensuring that they become fully equipped with the necessary machinery for promiscuous gene expression, and be an efficient driver of promiscuous gene expression in such cells. Thus, promiscuous gene expression seems to be accomplished in terminally differentiated mTECs that have matured in the presence of Aire protein (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Alternatively, Aire might be necessary for maintenance of a terminally differentiated state in which mTECs manifest a dendritic shape with fully competent promiscuous gene expression.</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of the roles of Aire in mTEC differentiation and TRA gene expression.</bold> Aire-expressing cell lineages develop from mTEC progenitor cells through concomitant expression of claudin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Expression of Aire-dependent TRA genes, such as <italic>insulin 2</italic> and <italic>SAP1</italic>, can be accomplished in terminally differentiated mTECs showing a dendritic to fibroblastic morphology that have fully matured with the help of Aire protein (marked as Aire-sufficient). Lack of Aire in mTECs results in premature termination of differentiation, although claudin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Aire-expressing cell lineages can still develop and pass the CD80-expressing maturation stage (marked as Aire-deficient). These CD80<sup>hi</sup> Aire-less mTECs have a more globular cell shape and lack transcriptional machinery for Aire-dependent TRA genes. Because Aire-independent TRA genes, such as <italic>CRP</italic> and <italic>GAD67</italic>, can be expressed before the terminal differentiation stages, lack of Aire has little impact on their expression. The possibility also remains that Aire is necessary for the maintenance of a terminally differentiated state, in which mTECs manifest a dendritic shape with fully competent promiscuous gene expression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052827f08"></graphic></fig><p>We found that the numbers of mTECs expressing involucrin, a marker of epidermal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), were reduced in Aire-deficient mouse thymus. It was noteworthy that involucrin-expressing mTECs themselves were negative for Aire expression with immunohistochemistry (unpublished data), thus making it unlikely that <italic>involucrin</italic> gene expression in mTECs is under direct transcriptional control by Aire as a part of TRA gene expression. Similarly, it is unknown whether impaired involucrin expression is specific to mTECs committed to Aire expression or whether lack of Aire<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mTECs affects the differentiation of other type(s) of mTECs that would otherwise express involucrin at their terminally differentiated stages. Based on the fact that GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Aire-less mTECs showed alterations in their morphology as well as distribution, we assume that the former possibility is more likely. Interestingly, we found that reduction of involucrin-expressing mTECs in Aire-deficient mice was associated with a nearly absence of Hassall's corpuscle-like structures, although the exact relevance of this phenotype to the breakdown of central tolerance in Aire-deficient mice remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Together with the fact that formation of thymic cysts is a predominant feature of Aire-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), it seems likely that Aire exerts more global control of the differentiation program of mTECs than was initially thought.</p><p>Finally, although we have demonstrated that Aire organizes the global mTEC integrity that facilitates promiscuous gene expression in the thymic microenvironment, the exact nature of the mTEC differentiation program under the control of Aire protein still remains unknown. We have demonstrated that both <italic>Aire</italic> and an Aire-independent TRA gene, <italic>GAD67</italic>, are predominantly expressed by nonproliferative cells, although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that expression of these genes is associated with immature cells that turn over slowly and, thus, would be poorly labeled by BrdU. The results prompt us to propose a fascinating hypothesis that promiscuous gene expression is achieved by induction of heterogeneity among terminally differentiated mTECs rather than by multipotentiality of mTEC progenitors. We speculate that Aire may contribute to mTEC heterogeneity by acting on mTECs at the late differentiation stages and that lack of Aire may result in failure to create this heterogeneity. According to this scenario, additional mechanisms for the development of Aire-dependent autoimmunity might be possible beyond reduced TRA expression from Aire-deficient mTECs, for instance, altered Ag processing and/or presentation capacity by Aire-deficient mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) and/or altered T cell development affecting establishment of the complete T cell repertoire. Study of the mechanisms underlying the Aire-dependent production of heterogeneity among mature mTECs might be a rewarding approach to elucidating the nature of the negative selection niche in the thymus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>Aire/GFP knock-in mice (RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology accession No. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CDB0483K">CDB0483K</ext-link>) were generated by gene targeting as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>).
