Thereafter, the active site of IleRS was mapped by affinity labeling with reactive analogs of the substrates. For the ATP binding site, the affinity labeling reagent was pyridoxal 5'-diphospho-5'-adenosine (ADP-PL), whereas periodate-oxidized tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>, the 2',3'-dialdehyde derivative of tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> was used to label the binding site for the 3'-end of tRNA on the synthetase. Incubation of either reagent with IleRS resulted in a rapid loss of both the tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> aminoacylation and isoleucinedependent isotopic ATP-PPi exchange activities. The stoichiometries of IleRS labeling by ADP-PL or tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>ox corresponded to 1 mol of reagent incorporated per mol of enzyme. Altogether, the oxidized 3'-end of tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> and the pyridoxal moiety of the ATP analog ADP-PL react with the lysyl residues 601 and 604 of the consensus sequence <sup>601</sup>KMSKS<sup>605</sup>. Identification of the binding site for L-isoleucine or for non cognate amino acids on <italic>E. coli </italic>IleRS was achieved by qualitative comparative labeling of the synthetase with bromomethyl ketone derivatives of L-isoleucine (IBMK) or of the non-cognate amino acids valine (VBMK), phenylalanine (FBMK) and norleucine (NleBMK). Labeling of the enzyme with IBMK resulted in a complete loss of isoleucine-dependent isotopic [<sup>32</sup>P]PPi-ATP exchange activity. VBMK, NleBMK and FBMK were also capable of abolishing the activity of IleRS, FBMK being the less efficient in inactivating the synthetase. Analysis by MALDI mass spectrometry designated cysteines-462 and -718 as the target residues of the substrate analog IBMK on <italic>E. coli </italic>IleRS, whereas VBMK, NleBMK and FBMK labeled in common His-394, His-478 and Cys-718. In addition, VBMK and NleBMK, which are chemically similar to IBMK, were found covalently bound to Cys-462, and VBMK was specifically attached to His-332 (or His-337) of the synthetase. The amino acid residues labeled by the substrate analogs are mainly distributed between three regions in the primary structure of <italic>E. coli </italic>IleRS: these are segments [325-394], [451-479] and [591-604]. In the 3-D structures of IleRS from <italic>T. thermophilus </italic>and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the [325-394] stretch is part of the editing domain, while fragments [451-479] and [591-604] representing the isoleucine binding domain and the dinucleotide (or Rossmann) fold domain, respectively, are located in the catalytic core. His-332 of <italic>E. coli </italic>IleRS, that is strictly conserved among all the available IleRS sequences is located in the editing active site of the synthetase. It is proposed that His-332 of <italic>E. coli </italic>IleRS participates directly in hydrolysis, or helps to deprotonate the hydroxyl group of threonine at the hydrolytic site.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze at the expense of ATP the activation of specific amino acids, and their subsequent transfer onto the 3'-end of homologous isoacent of L-threonine to tRNAceptor tRNAs. The specific recognition of tRNAs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases makes these enzymes attractive model systems for studying protein-nucleic acid interaction. To probe the structure-activity relationships of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, chemical modification of these enzymes with reactive analogs of the substrates has been used. Lysyl residues at the binding site for the 3'-OH acceptor arm of tRNA were identified by affinity labeling with periodate-oxidized tRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], leading to the discovery of the KMSKS consensus sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] characteristic of class 1 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Amino acid residues at the ATP-binding site of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases were affinity labeled with ATP derivatives such as adenosine di- or triphosphopyridoxal or 5'-p-fluorosulfonyl-benzoyladenosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and pyridoxal 5'-diphosphate have also been used to identify the subsite for the pyrophosphate moiety or for the &#x003b3;-phosphate of ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Nucleophilic amino acid residues at the binding site for L-valine or for non-cognate amino acids were identified by comparative labeling of valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS) with bromomethylketone derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. The latter site referred to as the editing site is responsible for the Val/Thr editing activity of <italic>E. coli</italic> ValRS which prevents attachment of L-threonine to tRNA<sup>Val</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p><p>In the present work, we have applied this labeling strategy to <italic>E.coli</italic> isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), a monomeric synthetase with Ile/Val editing activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Reactive substrate analogs were used to identify amino acid residues at the binding site for tRNA, ATP and L-isoleucine or for non cognate amino acids on this synthetase. Lysyl residues of IleRS at the binding site for the CCA arm of tRNA have been affinity labeled by periodate-oxidized tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>. In the case of the ATP-binding site, the affinity labeling reagent used was pyridoxal 5'-diphospho-5'-adenosine (or adenosine diphosphopyridoxal, ADP-PL), an adenine nucleotide analog with an adenosine diphosphate moiety and a pyridoxal moiety capable of covalently modifying amino groups in or near the phosphate binding site. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases such as IleRS or ValRS which are concerned with editing are believed to exhibit two catalytic sites, one for aminoacylation with the cognate amino acid, and one for editing of misactivated non-cognate amino acids. In order to identify those sites on IleRS, bromomethyl ketone derivatives of the substrate L-isoleucine (IBMK) or of non-cognate amino acids valine (VBMK), phenylalanine (FBMK) and norleucine (NleBMK), were used for qualitative comparative labeling of <italic>E. coli</italic> IleRS (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). Bromomethyl ketone derivatives react preferentially with cysteine and histidine residues, and weakly with lysines and tyrosines. Since nucleophilic side chains are expected to be involved in the hydrolytic process at the editing site of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases concerned with editing, a bromomethyl moiety tethered to the carbonyl group of valine, norleucine or phenylalanine should be well situated for modification of nucleophiles at the hydrolytic site of IleRS, while the substrate analog isoleucine bromomethyl ketone would react with amino acid residues present in the binding site for L-isoleucine. The location of residues labeled by the markers is discussed on the basis of the 3-D structures of IleRS from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Indeed, the crystal structures at 2.5 &#x000c5; resolution of IleRS from <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> in complexes with L-isoleucine and L-valine were previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], as well as that at 2.2 &#x000c5; resolution of <italic>S. aureus</italic> IleRS complexed with tRNA <sup>Ile</sup> and mupirocin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p>Prior to these labeling experiments, it was necessary to establish a valid primary structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> IleRS, because two different sequences had been retrieved from literature and data bases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. The correct sequence of IleRS was determined by fast peptide mapping, using a set of four different proteases to generate peptides that were identified by means of matrix assisted laser desorption-ionisation&#x02013;mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase from <italic>E. coli</italic> strain EM20031 was purified as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].

It was verified that, in these conditions, the 3% of tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> present in the incubation mixture were completely charged with L-isoleucine. The sample was then incubated 30 min at room temperature, in the dark, in the presence of 10 mM NaIO<sub>4</sub>. As a consequence of the latter treatment, only the non-specific tRNAs which were not aminacylated with isoleucine by IleRS, were expected to be oxidized to a dialdehyde group on the 3'-terminal ribose. Further treatment of the mixture with 25 mM sodium borohydride provoked the reduction of the oxidized tRNAs (tRNAox) to yield tRNAox-red, tRNA molecules with primary alcohol groups (CH<sub>2</sub>OH) at the positions 2' and 3' of the ribose. Actually, these tRNAox-red species, which are not specific for isoleucine, are not concerned with further chemical modifications, because primary alcohol groups are non-reactive in the tRNA modification conditions used. The tRNA molecules specific for L-isoleucine, and which were charged with this amino acid in the presence of IleRS, were then deacylated as follows: the NaBH<sub>4</sub>-treated tRNA sample was precipitated by the addition of 0.2 volume of 5 M NaCl and 2.2 volumes of cold ethanol. After centrifugation, the pellet was dissolved in 5 mL of Tris-HCl 2 M (pH 9.0) and left 2h at 37&#x000b0;C. As a consequence of the latter treatment, the isoleucyl-tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> species was stripped and the sample was ethanol precipitated as above. Removal of the 3'-terminal adenosine from the 3'-OH end of tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> was achieved by combining periodate, lysine and alkaline phosphatase treatments, as already described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. The resulting tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> molecules, shortened by one nucleotide at the 3'-end, were repaired with the help of tRNA nucleotidyl-transferase in the presence of [<sup>14</sup>C]ATP (9 Ci/mol) and assayed for their recovery of isoleucylation capacity, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. After nucleotide incorporation, the tRNA sample (including the reconstituted [<sup>14</sup>C]tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> species) was separated from the excess of [<sup>14</sup>C]ATP by chromatography on a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with 1 mM potassium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The tRNA was then precipitated with ethanol and NaCl, as above, and stored in 1 mM potassium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The enzymatic labeling of truncated tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> at its 3'-end, followed by the chromatographic step, yielded 13.7 mg of total tRNA containing 3% of [<sup>14</sup>C]tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> species, which corresponded to a yield of 83% of the initial amount of unfractionated <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA (16.5 mg). The specific radioactivity of [<sup>14</sup>C]tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> molecules in the mixture, as measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, was 9,000 counts per minute per nanomole of radiolabeled tRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Inactivation and Labeling of IleRS by Periodate-Oxidized tRNA<sup>Ile</sup></title><p>tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> (0.8 nmol of isoleucine acceptance/A<sub>260</sub> unit of tRNA) or [<sup>14</sup>C]tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> (specific radioactivity 9,000 counts.min<sup>-1</sup>.nmole<sup>-1</sup>) were oxidized with NaIO<sub>4 </sub>as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>].

Therefore, our labeling data can be discussed on the basis of the 3-D structures of IleRS from <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. </p><p>The crystal structure of <italic>S. aureus</italic> IleRS is composed of three regions of differing functions: a region that binds the tRNA anticodon loop, a catalytic core that activates and transfers the amino acid and an editing domain that removes any incorrectly incorporated amino acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. The amino acid residues labeled by tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>ox or ADP-PL, as well as by IBMK, NleBMK, FBMK or VBMK, or the histidine-specific reagent DEPC, are mainly distributed between four regions in the primary structure of IleRS: these are fragments [325-394], [451-479], [591-604] and [718-905] (Table <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>). In the 3-D structures of IleRS from <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, fragment [325-394] is part of the editing domain, while fragments [451-479] and [591-604] representing the isoleucine binding domain and the dinucleotide (or Rossmann) fold domain, respectively, are located in the catalytic core.</p><p>All the thiol-specific reagents used (including the substrate analog IBMK) were found covalently attached to Cys-718 (Table <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>), in the C-terminal region of <italic>E. coli</italic> IleRS. These results would suggest that Cys-718 was unspecifically labeled, due to its special reactivity toward alkylation by the bromoketone moiety of the amino acid analogs.</p></sec><sec><title>The Binding Site for ATP or for the 3'-end of tRNA on E. coli IleRS</title><p>Several observations suggest that ADP-PL and tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>ox, are affinity labeling reagents for <italic>E. coli</italic> isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. First, incubation of either reagent with IleRS resulted in a rapid loss of enzyme activity. Both the tRNA<sup>Ile </sup>aminoacylation and isoleucine-dependent isotopic ATP-PPi exchange activities were abolished in parallel by the labeling. Inactivation of IleRS by either reagent most probably proceeded through the formation of a Schiff base between the aldehyde group of ADP-PL or of tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>ox and amino groups of the protein. Second, the stoichiometries of labeling of IleRS by ADP-PL or tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>ox corresponded to 1 mol of reagent incorporated per mol of enzyme, consistent with the 1:1 IleRS:ATP or IleRS:tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> active stoichiometries. Third, in the case of ADP-PL-labeling of IleRS, enzyme inactivation showed saturation behavior with respect to the reagent concentration, indicating that ADP-PL binds reversibly to the enzyme, prior to the covalent bond formation.</p><p>The plot of the fraction of inactivated IleRS versus increasing reagent concentrations indicated a half-effect concentration of ADP-PL in the inactivation process of about 0.17 mM, suggesting that the affinity of ADP-PL is comparable to that of ATP (K<sub>d</sub> = 0.176 mM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Finally, intact tRNA<sup>Ile </sup>or MgATP protected IleRS from inactivation by tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>ox, while incubation of the synthetase with MgATP prevented enzyme inactivation and labeling by ADP-PL. Altogether, these results suggest that labeling of IleRS by ADP-PL or by the oxidized 3'-adenosine of tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> occurs specifically at the enzyme active centre.</p><p>The chymotryptic digestion of the [<sup>14</sup>C]tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>ox-labeled IleRS yielded a unique <sup>603</sup>SKSIGN<sup>608 </sup>labeled peptide in the primary structure of the synthetase, with the 3'-oxidized adenosine covalently attached to Lys-604. In the case of ADP-PL-labeling of IleRS, the labeled residues were Lys-601 (fragment [601-604]) and Lys-604 (fragment [602-618]) (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>). Thus, altogether, the oxidized 3'-end of tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> and the pyridoxal moiety of the ATP analog ADP-PL react with lysines 601 and 604 of the consensus sequence <sup>601</sup>KMSKS<sup>605</sup>. This motif was first discovered at the active centre of <italic>E. coli</italic> MetRS, as a consequence of affinity labeling studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. In fact, lysine-335 of the <sup>332</sup>KMSKS<sup>336</sup> sequence in <italic>E. coli</italic> MetRS was identified as the residue majorily labeled by the oxidized 3'-adenosine of tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>. It was proposed that Lys-335 could serve as a ligand for the CCA arm of tRNA through electrostatic interactions between a phosphate group of the nucleic acid and the &#x003b5;-amino group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Later on, Lys-335 in MetRS was found affinity labeled by the ATP analog adenosine triphosphopyridoxal (ATP-PL), suggesting that this residue might contact and help orientate the &#x003b3; -phosphate of bound ATP in such a way as to facilitate pyrophosphate liberation as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Finally, Lys-335 was shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be involved through interaction with the &#x003b3;-phosphate of ATP in the stabilization of the transition state during the synthesis of methionyl-adenylate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Similarly, Lys-604 of IleRS may serve either to guide the tRNA CCA arm or to help adenylate formation by interacting with the phosphate chain of the ATP substrate.</p><p>This is most probable since, as already discussed, the binding site for the CCA arm of tRNA might be close to the site for the formation of aminoacyl-adenylate, since the 3'-end of tRNA has to react with the anhydride bond of the enzyme-bound aminoacyl-adenylate.</p><p>It should be noted that, Lys-604 of <italic>E. coli</italic> IleRS and the corresponding Lys-335 of <italic>E. coli</italic> MetRS are strictly conserved in the IleRS (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref></bold>) and MetRS families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], respectively, as well as in the so called class 1 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, as expected for residues involved in the stabilization of the transition state.</p><p>Since the covalent binding of the histidine-specific reagent DEPC to His-591 and His-905 of <italic>E. coli</italic> IRS, was accompanied by enzyme activity loss, it is likely that modification of His-591 situated at only a ten-residue distance from lysines-601 and -604 (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref></bold>) might be responsible for a steric hindrance which prevents the access of substrates to the catalytic site.</p></sec><sec><title>The Binding Site for L-isoleucine or for Non Cognate Amino Acids on E. coli IleRS</title><p>In the double-sieve editing mechanism proposed by Fersht [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], amino acids that are smaller than the correct one might be activated to the adenylated form, in the active site of a given synthetase, while amino acids larger than the cognate might be rejected. In support of this hypothesis, IleRS was previously shown to activate both isoleucine and valine to their adenylated form, while this synthetase could not efficiently misactivate methionine or leucine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, the double-sieve mechanism supposes that the products of misactivation of amino acids that are smaller than the correct one might be accepted in the editing site of the synthetase, while the cognate aminoacyl adenylate would be rejected from this site, in order to prevent its hydrolysis. </p><p>Interestingly, in the report by Nureki <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], the crystal structure of IleRS from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> solved at a 2.5 &#x000c5; resolution shows two catalytic sites, one for aminoacylation with the substrate isoleucine, and one for editing of misactivated valine. </p><p>Actually, the substrate analog IBMK was found covalently attached to Cys-462 and Cys-718, in the primary structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> IleRS. Cys-462 was previously identified as the target of IBMK at the active center of <italic>E. coli</italic> IleRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. The present study therefore confirms these reports, and at the same time designate Cys-462 as the binding site for L-isoleucine and/or the synthetic site where isoleucyl adenylate formation takes place.</p><p>With the exception of His-332 (or His-337), which was found labeled only by VBMK, the reactive analogs of L-valine and L-norleucine, two amino acids chemically similar to L-isoleucine were covalently attached to a set of four residues (His-394, Cys-462, His-478 and Cys-718), two of which (Cys-462 and His-478) belong to fragment [452-480] in the amino acid binding domain of the synthetase. Labeling of Cys-462 by VBMK and NleBMK might reflect that they are comparable in size or smaller than the substrate isoleucine, and that, consequently, they are well fitted to the isoleucine binding site, in agreement with the double-sieve editing mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. The fact that the bromomethyl ketone derivative of phenylalanine which is larger than isoleucine could not react with Cys-462 suggests that this reagent which is larger than IBMK, is not in proximity of binding with Cys-462 of the isoleucine-binding site on <italic>E. coli</italic> IleRS, in agreement with the double-sieve hypothesis of Fersht [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. </p><p>Therefore, inactivation of IleRS by FBMK might be accounted for, by the covalent attachment of the reagent to His-478 which prevents the access of substrates to Cys-462 of the active site.</p><p>All the used bromomethyl ketone derivatives of non cognate amino acids (VBMK, NleBMK and FBMK) labeled in common His-394 (fragment [325-394]) in the editing domain of <italic>E. coli</italic> IleRS. In addition, VBMK specifically labeled His-332 (or His-337) in this domain (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref></bold>). Labeling of His-332 (or His-337) by VBMK but not by IBMK, NleBMK or FBMK might be explained as follows: (i) valine (Van der Waals volume : 105 &#x000c5;<sup>3</sup>) is smaller than the substrate isoleucine (Van der Waals volume : 124 &#x000c5;<sup>3</sup>), so that its product of misactivation, or the reactive analog thereof (namely VBMK) would be accepted in the editing site of the synthetase, as proposed by the double-sieve mechanism; (ii) in contrast, the adenylate form of the cognate isoleucine or of larger non cognate amino acids as well as their analogs (IBMK, NleBMK or FBMK) would be rejected from this site. </p><p>In conclusion, the fact that VBMK, NleBMK and FBMK label each Cys-462 and/or His-478, in the isoleucine-binding domain on one hand, and His-332 (or His-337) and/or His-394 in the editing site on the other hand, might be the reflect of the existence of two binding sites for non cognate amino acids on IleRS, in agreement with the reports by Nureki <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] and Silvian <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] for IleRS from <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>. </p></sec><sec><title>The Editing Site of <italic>E. coli</italic> IleRS</title><p>Comparison of fragment [322-397] with IleRS amino acid sequences (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref></bold>) revealed that His-332 is strictly conserved, while the neighbouring His-337 is only weakly conserved in these synthetases. By contrast, His-394 is not conserved at all in the IleRS family. These results suggest that histidines-332 and -337 might be of functional significance in the IleRS family.</p><p>Mutational analysis of the <italic>E. coli</italic> IleRS editing active site has demonstrated a crucial role for His-332 in the hydrolytic editing activity of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. An H332A mutant IleRS from <italic>E. coli</italic>, referred to as H333A in Hendrickson <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], was shown to exhibit the following properties: (i) H333A IleRS edites isoleucine, because it stimulates tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>-dependent ATP hydrolysis in the presence of isoleucine; (ii) H333A IleRS deacylates Val-tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> and Ile-tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> at similar rates comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme with Val-tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> as substrate; (iii) both activated isoleucine and valine, in the form of their respective adenylates, are translocated at similar rates by H333A from the active site to the editing center of the enzyme. These results suggest that H333A IleRS is altered in amino acid specificity for post-transfer editing. Affinity labeling of His-332 of IleRS by the bromomethyl ketone derivative of non cognate valine directed toward the editing active site is in agreement with previous work carried out with the site directed mutagenesis approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. </p><p>In a previous work, we have used affinity labeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] and protein modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] studies to identify amino acid residues at the synthetic and the hydrolytic editing active sites on <italic>E. coli</italic> ValRS. Among the amino acid residues of the editing active site of this synthetase, Lys-277, a residue strictly conserved from bacteria to human, corresponds to His-332 of <italic>E. coli</italic> IleRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] which plays a crucial role in editing ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] and this work). Lys-277 of <italic>E. coli</italic> ValRS was also shown by site-directed mutagenesis, to be involved in the editing activity. Indeed, a point Lys277Ala (K277A) mutation yielded a mutant <italic>E. coli</italic> ValRS that presented the following properties: (i) the K277A mutant exhibited a posttransfer Thr-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> rate significantly lower than that observed for the wild-type enzyme; (ii) the K277A substitution altered amino acid discrimination in the editing site, resulting in hydrolysis of the correctly charged cognate Val-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> ; (iii) significant amounts of mischarged Thr-tRNA<sup>Val</sup> were produced by the K277A mutant, and not by the wild-type ValRS.</p><p>Primary structure alignment of the conserved editing region within the CP1 domain of IleRS, ValRS and LeuRS, reveals that His-332 of <italic>E. coli</italic> IleRS and the corresponding Lys-277 of <italic>E. coli</italic> ValRS, match with His-319 of <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> IleRS and with Lys-270 of <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> ValRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Moreover, in the tRNA-complexed <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> IleRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] and ValRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] 3-D structures, the editing domain CP1 containing His-319 (IleRS) and Lys-270 (ValRS), is arranged in a similar position. Thus, His-332 and His-319 of IleRS from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>T. thermophilus</italic>, respectively, as well as Lys-277 and Lys-270 of ValRS from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>T. thermophilus</italic>, respectively, which play a crucial role in editing in the CP1 domain, are located at similar positions in the amino acid sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] and in the 3-D structures of these synthetases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. </p><p>The involvement of nucleophiles in the CP1 editing domain of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases which are concerned with editing has been extensively discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. However, their precise role in the editing active site remains to be elucidated. For example, in the crystal structure of IleRS from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> solved at a 2.5 angstroms resolution, six residues (Thr-228, Thr-229, Thr-230, Thr-233, Asn-237 and His-319) are located in close proximity, in a way that is reminiscent of the catalytic triads of hydrolases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. However, the nucleophile His-319 of <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> IleRS is not conserved in the ValRS and LeuRS amino acid sequences, suggesting that the involvement of a mechanism analogous to the charge relay system in the editing site of the ValRS, IleRS and LeuRS families is less probable. On the bases of the data of the present work on <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> IleRS, and of the qualitative comparative labeling of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ValRS with reactive amino acids analogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], we propose that the role of nucleophilic residues in the editing active site of the synthetases consists of merely helping to deprotonate the catalytic editing residues, in order to make them capable of attacking the carbonyl group of the ester of misactivated or misacylated non cognate amino acids. This hypothesis is supported by the observation by Edsall and Wyman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], that situation of a nucleophile at a two-residue distance from another one may increase the nucleophilic character of each of them, by lowering the pKa values by up to 2 pH units. The nucleophilic attack resulting in the hydrolysis of the ester bond might insure an accurate translation process, by preventing misincorporation of non cognate amino acids into proteins. Following this nucleophilic attack, the covalent bond formed between the catalytic editing residues and the rejected non cognate amino acids might be difficult to detect with current analytical biochemistry tools because of the low mass of those amino acid adducts with regard to the whole enzymes masses. Work is in progress, with new generation mass spectrometry equipments, to detect such post-editing covalent protein modifications. </p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>ABBREVIATIONS</title><def-list><def-item><term id="G1">Hepes:</term><def><p>N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N&#x02019;-2-ethanesulfonic acid;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2">BMK:</term><def><p>bromomethyl ketone derivative of amino acids;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G3">tRNAox or tRNA dialdehyde:</term><def><p>tRNA with the 3'-terminal cisdiol group oxidized by sodium periodate to a dialdehyde group;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G4">tRNAox-red:</term><def><p>tRNAox reduced with sodium borohydride;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G5">ADP-PL:</term><def><p>adenosine diphosphopyridoxal (or pyridoxal 5'-diphospho-5'-adenosine);</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G6">DEPC:</term><def><p>diethylpyrocarbonate;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G7">MALDI-MS :</term><def><p>matrix assisted laser desorption-ionisation mass spectrometry;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G8">PSD :</term><def><p>post source decay;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G9">aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases</term><def><p>are abbreviated as a three-letter code of their specific amino acid followed by RS;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G10">amino acid residues</term><def><p>are abbreviated as the one- or three-letter codes</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><sec><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>This work was supported by grants from CNRS and the Laboratoires GLAXO (Les Ulis, Courtaboeuf, France).</p></sec><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fayat</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Hountondji</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Blanquet</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Methionyl-tRNA synthetase from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.
