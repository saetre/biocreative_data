However, there is still a substantial proportion of patients who show partial or no response to anti-TNF therapy. With treatment limited by expensive annual costs in many countries, a number of studies have investigated predictors of response in treated patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> For example, analyses in a large-scale longitudinal observational study cohort identified lower baseline health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) scores and concurrent treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) as predictors of greater response rates, although the latter was only significant in the group of patients treated with etanercept.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref></p><p>Serological and genetic factors are also likely to contribute towards drug response. Several small studies (sample sizes &#x0003c;130) have investigated the utility of autoantibodies, including rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), for predicting response to treatment with biological agents but results have been inconsistent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> Similarly, studies have investigated the role of genetic polymorphisms in the genes encoding TNF,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> interleukin (IL)1&#x003b2; and the IL1-receptor antagonist,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> IL10,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> transforming growth factor (TGF)&#x003b2;1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and Fc&#x003b3;RIIIA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> with inconsistent findings. In particular, a significant association was demonstrated between carriage of the shared epitope (SE) and response to etanercept in a cohort of 200 patients in the USA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> but was not replicated in a smaller study of 123 patients from Sweden.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> Furthermore, no association of SE status with response to infliximab treatment was observed in two European populations (78 patients from Spain and 198 patients from France).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> However, most of these studies were hindered by small sample sizes resulting in limited power to detect modest effects. In this study we established a UK-wide multicentre collaboration to recruit a large cohort of patients treated with anti-TNF agents and tested the hypothesis that confirmed RA susceptibility factors, namely RF, anti-CCP, SE and <italic>PTPN22</italic> 620W, are associated with clinical response in patients treated with anti-TNF.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patient selection</title><p>UK-wide multicentre collaborations were established to recruit patients treated with anti-TNF drugs for RA.

The following criteria were used for the selection of patients for the current study: (1) currently actively participating in the BSRBR long-term safety study, (2) doctor-confirmed diagnosis of RA, (3) currently or have been treated with one of the three anti-TNF biological agents, (4) European Caucasian descent and (5) reached 6 months of follow-up.

Analyses were adjusted for baseline DAS28, baseline HAQ score, administration of concurrent DMARDs and gender, as these factors have previously been shown to be significant independent predictors of response in the BSRBR cohort as a whole and were also associated in the current cohort (see supplementary material).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> Analyses were repeated excluding any patients with previous exposure to a biological drug, whether or not it was the same agent. In addition, interaction analyses were performed to determine whether any observed effects were similar across the two major drug types, namely etanercept and infliximab.

However, a substantial proportion of treated patients still demonstrate partial or no response to these therapies. Previous studies have suggested that the effect of clinical factors alone in predicting response is relatively modest.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> Hence, in the current study, we have focused on genetic and serological markers. In keeping with previous reports, we have shown that the presence of RF and anti-CCP antibodies is associated with a significantly reduced improvement in the DAS28 score following 6 months of anti-TNF therapy. No associations were demonstrated between drug response and carriage of risk alleles for either of the other two well established RA susceptibility factors, SE or <italic>PTPN22</italic>.</p><p>There are a number of methodological limitations to the study, which require discussion. Firstly, although the current study design may inform predictions of how patients receiving anti-TNF therapies will respond to those treatments, the lack of a control group of patients with RA that were not anti-TNF treated means that the study cannot inform the debate about whether a patient will respond better to therapy with an anti-TNF rather than a DMARD treatment.</p><p>Secondly, response measures were assessed at 6 rather than 3 months, when clinical decisions regarding the continuation of therapy are usually made. Consequently, &#x0223c;10% of patients had discontinued therapy due to inefficacy prior to the 6-month follow-up and some will have commenced alternative treatment to which they may have responded. Hence, the DAS28 at 6 months may not be a true reflection of the DAS28 when the drug was discontinued. However, this subgroup of patients generally remained non-responders at 6 months despite possibly receiving alternative drugs (mean DAS28 improvement at 6 months: 0.8 compared to 2.7 across the remainder of the cohort). As the study aims to identify predictors of response by 6 months rather than predictors of response only in those who remain on treatment, these patients were included in the analysis although we recognise that this may have resulted in underestimations of observed effects.</p><p>Thirdly, as one of the requirements for prescribing anti-TNF agents in the UK includes failure of at least two previous DMARDs, the patients recruited have severe, long-standing RA with a mean duration of 14 years. As discussed by Hyrich <italic>et al</italic>, patients with more severe disease as a result of irreversible joint damage may be less likely to respond to treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> In order to account for this, analyses were repeated adjusting for disease duration, but this did not change the overall conclusions (see supplementary material).</p><p>Lastly, the serology was measured cross-sectionally at the time of sample collection, which may have been some time after commencement of treatment. Previous studies have shown that, although titres are affected by treatment, status generally is not.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> Based on records held on the BSRBR, antibody status changed from positive to negative during anti-TNF treatment in less than 3% of patients included in the current analyses. Hence, in all the analyses, autoantibody status rather than titre has been used. It should also be noted that the proportion of patients that were RF positive in the current study is higher than that reported previously for the BSRBR cohort as a whole (89% vs 72%, respectively).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> This is most likely to be due to differences in data collection methods: the BSRBR study relies on information being provided by the contributing doctors whereas, for the purposes of the current study, RF was remeasured in all patients for whom a serum sample was available.</p><p>Conversely, our study has several advantages over previous investigations. Importantly, the use of the BSRBR to identify suitable patients has meant that the subgroup studied is comparable to the BSRBR in its entirety. As, until relatively recently, almost all patients receiving an anti-TNF drug in the UK for RA were included on this register, the cohort studied is likely to reflect the characteristics of patients treated with anti-TNF as a whole, at least in the UK. Furthermore, a wealth of clinical and demographic data had already been collected, creating a well characterised cohort. In addition, this is a large cohort, allowing robust inferences to be drawn. Finally, the use of the DAS28 measure rather than the EULAR response criteria enhances the power of the study to detect association with genetic predictors of response in patients with RA treated with anti-TNF.</p><p>As no correction for multiple testing was applied in the current analyses, these results will require validation in similar-sized cohorts. Nonetheless, the findings support those of smaller studies in which similar trends between drug response and baseline RF and anti-CCP antibody titres have been demonstrated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> As discussed by Mewar <italic>et al</italic>, RF and anti-CCP antibodies are independent markers of disease severity for RA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> Thus the present findings could be interpreted as showing that those patients with the most severe disease are least likely to respond to these therapies. Indeed, there is some evidence to support this hypothesis, as HAQ score, a measure of disability, was also significantly associated with response. However, RF and anti-CCP antibody status remained significant predictors of response even after accounting for markers of severity such as HAQ and disease duration.</p><p>It is salient to note that combining information on clinical markers of anti-TNF treatment response previously identified, (concurrent DMARD therapy, baseline HAQ and gender)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> with RF and anti-CCP antibody status data still only accounts for a small proportion of the variance in drug response (R<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;17%) and would not be useful in the clinical setting. We hypothesise that, in addition to these clinical and serological factors, genetic factors will play a role and the challenge now is to identify these. No association was observed between treatment response and carriage of the RA susceptibility allele of the <italic>PTPN22</italic> gene and, in keeping with most previous studies, no association of treatment response was observed with SE carriage, a well established RA severity and susceptibility locus. Several novel RA susceptibility loci have recently been reported (eg, <italic>OLIG3/TNFAIP3</italic>, <italic>TRAF1/C5</italic> and <italic>STAT4</italic>), which may also warrant investigation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> However, genes contributing to disease susceptibility may be different to those that determine response to treatment.</p><p>In summary, the presence of RF or anti-CCP antibodies was associated with a reduced response to anti-TNF drugs in patients with RA treated with anti-TNF. However, the presence of these antibodies only accounts for a small proportion of the variance in treatment response. It is likely that genetic factors will contribute to determining the response to treatment with these agents but do not include the well established RA susceptibility loci, SE or <italic>PTPN22</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Hannah Donovan, Paul Gilbert and Catriona McWhirter for performing DNA extractions and HLA typing, Sarah Netherwood and Suzanne Pilkington for performing the serological tests and Mark Lay for help with the databases.
