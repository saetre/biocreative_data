They were a putative CDC46/MCM5 homolog and a putative cdc21 homolog. About 30% amino acid identity was obtained between members in the family, and &#x0003e; 40% between the putative mouse and yeast homologs. The expression of these genes was cell-cycle specific at the late G1 to S phase. Immunochemical analyses showed the physical interaction between mouse P1MCM3 and CDC46 protein. These results suggest that MCM proteins function in co-ordination for DNA replication.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0030-a" xlink:role="2100"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0031-a" xlink:role="2101"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0032-a" xlink:role="2102"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0033-a" xlink:role="2103"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0033-b" xlink:role="2103"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0027.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2097"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0028.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2098"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0029.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2099"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0030.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2100"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0031.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2101"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0032.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2102"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0033.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2103"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2104"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
