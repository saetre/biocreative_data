Pregnant mice were treated with low, environmentally relevant doses of BPA during mid-gestation to assess the effect of BPA on the developing ovary.

One estrogenic chemical, bisphenol A (BPA), has received considerable attention because low-dose exposures have been reported to induce a variety of reproductive effects in rodents. In the course of studies to assess the effects of BPA on the mouse oocyte, we have uncovered a novel &#x0201c;grandmaternal&#x0201d; effect: exposure to BPA during pregnancy disturbs oocyte development in unborn female fetuses. When these fetuses reach adulthood, the perturbations are translated into an increase in chromosomally abnormal eggs and embryos. Thus, low-dose BPA exposure during pregnancy has multigenerational consequences; it increases the likelihood of chromosomally abnormal grandchildren. Our studies also provide mechanistic insight, and, surprisingly, suggest that BPA acts in the fetal ovary not by mimicking the actions of estrogen but by interfering with the function of one of the known estrogen receptors. Thus, our data suggest that estrogen plays a far earlier role in oocyte development than previously suspected and, importantly, raise the possibility that a variety of substances&#x02014;both synthetic and naturally occurring&#x02014;that mimic the actions of estrogen or act as estrogen antagonists may affect early oocyte development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Susiarjo M, Hassold TJ, Freeman E, Hunt PA (2007) Bisphenol A exposure in utero disrupts early oogenesis in the mouse.

As early as 1970, Herbst and Scully reported vaginal clear-cell adenocarcinoma in six 14- to 21-y-old women exposed in utero to the synthetic estrogenic drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. This rare cancer had been reported previously only in elderly women, and subsequent studies confirmed an increased incidence among daughters of women given DES during pregnancy to prevent miscarriage (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;).

The DES experience has not only heightened awareness of the possible health effects of synthetic compounds that mimic the actions of hormones, but, importantly, it demonstrates the difficulty of assessing effects in humans&#x02014;even when the exposure is of known duration and dose.</p><p>Bisphenol A (BPA) was formulated around the same time as DES, but, because it was considered a less potent estrogen, it was never used clinically. We are, however, exposed to BPA daily; it is a component of polycarbonate plastics, resins lining food/beverage containers, and additives in a variety of consumer products. Over 6 billion pounds are produced worldwide annually, and several studies have reported levels of BPA in human tissues in the parts per billion range &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Short-term exposure to environmentally relevant doses of BPA has been linked to a variety of reproductive effects in laboratory rodents, including reduced sperm production, alterations in prostate development, and increased susceptibility to prostate carcinogenesis in the male &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d; and alterations in mammary gland organization, brain development, and estrous cyclicity in the female &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Our laboratory is interested in the possible effects of BPA on the genetic quality of gametes. Low-dose BPA exposure in vivo during the final stages of oocyte growth &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d; or in vitro during the resumption and completion of the first meiotic division &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; disrupts meiotic chromosome behavior, resulting in the production of chromosomally abnormal eggs. Mammalian oogenesis, however, is a complex process that is initiated during fetal development but not completed until after fertilization. Hence, defining critical exposure periods requires assessment of the effects of fetal, neonatal, and adult exposures. We summarize here the results of meiotic studies of females exposed to low (20 &#x003bc;g/kg/day), environmentally relevant doses of BPA during a 1-wk fetal exposure. Our studies reveal a unique set of meiotic defects in BPA-exposed females and demonstrate that a knockout of one of the two known estrogen receptors phenocopies fetal BPA exposure. Together, these findings provide the first known demonstration that early meiotic events in the fetal ovary are responsive to estrogen.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Aberrant Meiotic Prophase in BPA-Exposed Females</title><p>During fetal development, germ cells in both sexes undergo massive mitotic proliferation. Subsequently, germ cells in the testis enter mitotic arrest and remain quiescent until after birth, while those in the ovary initiate meiosis. The prophase events of female meiosis (i.e., pairing, synapsis, and recombination between homologous chromosomes) occur during fetal development. By the time of birth, oocytes have entered a protracted period of meiotic arrest, where they remain until just prior to ovulation. Resumption and completion of the first meiotic division occurs only after an extensive period of follicle growth in the adult ovary, and this occurs weeks, years, or even decades (depending on the species) after the initiation of meiotic arrest.</p><p>To assess the effect of BPA exposure during the fetal stages of oogenesis, we implanted time-release BPA pellets (designed to leach a low, environmentally relevant dose of 20 &#x003bc;g/kg body weight/day, as used in our previous studies of BPA exposure in young adult females &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;) or placebo pellets in pregnant C57BL/6 females at gestation day 11.5. Because the first cohort of cells initiates meiosis at 13.5 d of gestation, this ensured low-level, continuous exposure of all oocytes during meiotic prophase. To test the efficacy of this delivery system, we used an oral dosing strategy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d; on a subgroup of pregnant females. The results of the two exposure paradigms were indistinguishable (unpublished data), and all data presented here were obtained using the pellet delivery method. For the prophase studies detailed below, five replicate experiments were conducted. In each, fetuses from one BPA and one placebo-treated pregnant female were examined, with the number of females per litter ranging from one to three. Significant variation among experiments was not observed, and the data presented below represent the pooled data.</p><p>To analyze meiotic prophase, ovaries were isolated from female fetuses at 18.5 d of gestation and meiotic preparations made as described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. We analyzed the relative proportion of cells in the prepachytene, pachytene, and diplotene stages and found similar profiles in ovaries from placebo and BPA-exposed females, suggesting that the rate of progression through prophase was not affected by BPA exposure (unpublished data).</p><p>We focused subsequent analyses on pachytene oocytes, the stage at which synapsis between homologous chromosomes is complete and the sites of exchange between homologs become detectable as MLH1-positive foci (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;). Using SCP3 and MLH1 antibodies to visualize the synaptonemal complex (SC) and detect exchanges, respectively &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;, we analyzed pachytene cells from placebo and BPA-exposed female fetuses. We found a highly significant increase in synaptic abnormalities in oocytes from BPA-exposed females (16.0&#x00025; versus 52.0&#x00025; of cells in placebo and BPA, respectively; &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 134.8; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030005-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), largely attributable to increases in two categories of abnormality: &#x0201c;incomplete synapsis,&#x0201d; in which a single chromosome pair remained unsynapsed in an otherwise normal pachytene cell (0.5&#x00025; in placebo versus 11.0&#x00025; in BPA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030005-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), and cells with end-to-end associations between nonhomologous SCs (7.7&#x00025; in placebo versus 25.6&#x00025; in BPA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030005-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Synaptic aberrations, including the partial or complete synaptic failure of a single chromosome pair, have been reported in a number of meiotic mutants (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;). To our knowledge, however, the end-to-end association abnormality has not been described previously. Although associations were observed in the placebo group, they were markedly different, involving fewer SCs and &#x0201c;looser&#x0201d; associations. Indeed, as the analysis progressed, this aberration became diagnostic of BPA exposure, allowing a blinded scorer to correctly identify a significant proportion of cells as &#x0201c;exposed.&#x0201d; The significance of these associations is unclear. Meiotic cells undergo nuclear reorganization as prophase progresses, with telomeres clustering at the onset of prophase in a &#x0201c;bouquet&#x0201d; formation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the increase in end-to-end associations as a result of BPA exposure may reflect the failure of normal chromosome movements at the onset of prophase.</p><p>Pachytene oocytes from exposed females also displayed striking aberrations in recombination, as assessed by the number and distribution of MLH1 foci along the SCs. A total of 124 cells were analyzed from nine placebo-exposed females, with a pooled mean of 26.0 &#x000b1; 2.3 foci per cell; MLH1 foci counts were significantly elevated in BPA-exposed females, with a mean of 29.0 &#x000b1; 3.7 foci per cell from the analysis of 155 cells from ten females (<italic>t</italic> &#x0003d; 7.7; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). There was no significant interindividual variation in either group.</p><p>Recombination is regulated by crossover interference, a mechanism that ensures at least one exchange per chromosome pair and controls the proximity of multiple exchanges on a given chromosome (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;). To analyze the distribution of exchanges, we compared the frequency of chromosomes with zero, one, two, or three MLH1 foci (E0, E1, E2, and E3, respectively) in oocytes from placebo and BPA-exposed females (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030005-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030005-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). For both groups, the proportion of E0, E1, E2, and E3 bivalents differed significantly from a Poisson distribution (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 1727.9 and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 1568.8 in placebo and BPA, respectively; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 in each group), consistent with strong, positive interference. However, we found a modest but significantly altered distribution in exposed females, with an increase in E0s, E2s, and E3s, and a corresponding drop in E1s (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 147.7; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030005-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that BPA exposure disrupts the regulation of exchange placement.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Recombination Aberrations Verified by Metaphase I Analysis</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that MLH1 foci at pachytene accurately reflect the sites of exchange &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the effect of BPA exposure on recombination was unexpected. To verify this observation, we examined recombination using an alternative approach: At metaphase I, both the number and placement of chiasmata can be scored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030005-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) and homologous chromosomes that have failed to recombine are easily identified as unpaired univalents. Based on the results of pachytene studies, we predicted that BPA-exposed females would exhibit both an increase in the average number of chiasmata per cell and in univalents. To assess this, three pregnant females implanted with placebo and five implanted with BPA pellets were allowed to go to term, and their offspring were fostered at birth to untreated, lactating females. Oocytes analyzed at 4 wk of age from these in utero&#x02013;exposed females revealed significant increases in both the average number of chiasmata per cell (25.2 &#x000b1; 2.5 in placebo versus 27.0 &#x000b1; 3.1 in BPA; <italic>t</italic> &#x0003d; 3.1; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030005-t002">Table 2</xref>) and in the frequency of univalents (0.0&#x00025; in placebo versus 4.4&#x00025; in BPA; &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 4.6; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030005-t002">Table 2</xref>). Further, the frequency of bivalents with three chiasmata was also increased, although not significantly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030005-t003">Table 3</xref>). None of the values precisely matched the pachytene data (e.g., compare <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030005-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030005-t003">3</xref>); however, this likely reflects the difficulty of accurately counting chiasmata, especially when exchanges are closely placed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Nevertheless, both approaches (i.e., MLH1 and chiasmata counts) provide evidence that BPA exposure elevates recombination frequency and disturbs exchange distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Increased Aneuploidy in Eggs and Embryos from Adult Females</title><p>In humans, aberrations in recombination are associated with meiotic nondisjunction. Both differences in the number of exchanges and their placement along the length of the chromosome (i.e., too close to the centromere or too close to the telomere) have been reported to play a role in the genesis of human trisomy (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;). On this basis, we predicted that the meiotic defects induced by fetal BPA exposure would act to increase aneuploidy in eggs and embryos from adult females.</p><p>To assess meiotic nondisjunction, ten pregnant females implanted with placebo and 16 implanted with BPA pellets were allowed to go to term and their offspring (17 placebo and 24 BPA-exposed females) were fostered at birth as described above. At 4&#x02013;5 wk of age, these females were used either as oocyte or embryo donors for analysis of air-dried chromosome preparations from metaphase II&#x02013;arrested eggs and two-cell embryos, respectively.</p><p>Because analysis of eggs is limited to a single cell, aneuploidy levels are usually estimated by doubling the frequency of hyperploidy to avoid artifacts introduced by chromosome loss. Typical aneuploidy levels for eggs in the laboratory mouse are between 0.5&#x00025; and 1.0&#x00025; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. We found a significant increase in the level of hyperploid eggs in the BPA group: 1.8&#x00025; of cells had more than the expected 20 chromosomes in the placebo group compared to 21.4&#x00025; in the BPA group (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 11.0; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030005-t004">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030005-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030005-g002">2</xref>D). Assuming that hyperploidy represents one half of all nondisjunction, our data suggest that as many as 40&#x00025; of eggs from females exposed to BPA in utero may be chromosomally abnormal.</p><p>To assess aneuploidy in embryos from exposed females, we superovulated 4- to 5-wk-old females, mated them with wild-type males, and analyzed two-cell embryos. The level of hyperploidy in embryos closely matched the level in eggs (0/13 or 0.0&#x00025; in placebo versus 4/19 or 21.1&#x00025; in BPA-exposed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030005-g002">Figure 2</xref>E) but the difference between groups was not significant due to the small sample size.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Studies of Estrogen Receptor Knockout Mice</title><p>BPA is considered a &#x0201c;weak&#x0201d; estrogen due to its low binding affinity for the known estrogen receptors; however, its ability to act as a highly potent estrogen mimic at very low concentrations has been demonstrated (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;). Further, in some cases, BPA-induced responses can be mediated through nongenomic mechanisms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. To determine whether BPA exerts its effect on the prophase oocyte via a classical estrogen receptor&#x02013;mediated mechanism, we utilized mice with targeted disruptions of the two known receptors, &#x003b1;ERKO and &#x003b2;ERKO &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Our assumption was that, if BPA acts through one of these receptors, absence of the receptor would make null females insensitive to BPA.</p><p>Although the data from &#x003b1;ERKO females paralleled that of wild-type females (unpublished data), &#x003b2;ERKO mice yielded a surprising meiotic phenotype that did not fit our expectation: Pachytene oocytes from unexposed ER&#x003b2; &#x02212;/&#x02212; females exhibited virtually identical defects to BPA-exposed wild-type females. Specifically, we observed similar levels of synaptic aberrations (57.0&#x00025; of pachytene cells from unexposed ER&#x003b2; &#x02212;/&#x02212; females, as compared to the 52.0&#x00025; level in BPA-exposed wild-type females in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030005-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) and increased levels of recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030005-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Further, BPA exposure elicited no additional effect in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030005-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Two important conclusions derive from these findings. First, the meiotic phenotype of the &#x003b2;ERKO female implies that ER&#x003b2; (and, hence, estrogen) plays an important role in the prophase events necessary for recombination during female meiosis. Although sex-specific differences in recombination rate are well documented &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;, little is known about the control of recombination in mammals, and, to our knowledge, estrogen has never been implicated. Thus, our findings have important ramifications for the study of recombination. Second, the finding that BPA exposure mimics the effects of an ER&#x003b2; loss-of-function mutation suggests that, in this system, BPA acts as an estrogen antagonist, not an estrogen mimic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous studies in our laboratory of female mice exposed as young adults &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d; provided evidence that low-dose (20 &#x003bc;g/kg/day) short-term BPA exposure during the final stages of oocyte growth increases the likelihood of producing an aneuploid gamete. Consistent with this observation, in vitro studies of BPA exposures in both mitotically dividing somatic cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b025">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d; and oocytes undergoing the first meiotic division &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; indicate that BPA adversely affects spindle formation, centrosome dynamics, and chromosome alignment and segregation. Thus, it seems likely that BPA-related abnormalities resulting from in vivo exposure during the late stages of oocyte growth reflect similar effects on the cell division machinery.</p><p>In contrast, the studies described herein reveal an effect of BPA on meiotic chromosome segregation by a second, and completely independent, mechanism, that is, by disturbing synapsis and recombination between homologs in the fetal ovary. The finding that unexposed ER&#x003b2;-null females exhibit a similar phenotype&#x02014;and that the phenotype cannot be enhanced by BPA exposure&#x02014;suggests that BPA exerts its effects on the fetal ovary by interfering with ER&#x003b2;-mediated cellular responses. Knockouts of key meiotic genes involved either in synapsis (e.g., &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;) or in the repair of double-strand breaks as recombination events (e.g., &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;) also have demonstrated synaptic and recombination defects. The disturbances both in female fetuses exposed to BPA and in ER&#x003b2;-null females are notable, however, for two reasons: first, the end-to-end association between the centromeric ends of nonhomologous chromosomes that we observed in a significant proportion of pachytene cells suggests a fundamental disturbance in the early events of chromosome pairing and alignment. To our knowledge, this type of defect has not been reported previously and further studies of early prophase stages to understand this phenotype are in progress. Second, and equally novel, is the finding that, despite disturbances in synapsis, recombination levels are increased in oocytes from exposed females and in females lacking ER&#x003b2;. This is in marked contrast to other meiotic-disturbance scenarios&#x02014;not only in mice, but also in lower eukaryotes&#x02014;in which disturbances in synapsis are accompanied by a decrease in recombination levels (e.g., &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;). Because little is known about the control of recombination number and placement in mammals, BPA-exposed and ER&#x003b2;-null females provide a powerful tool, and expression studies to evaluate the gene changes that accompany the observed increase in recombination are currently ongoing.</p><p>Defects in synapsis and altered levels of recombination have been correlated with increased aneuploidy in a variety of eukaryotic species. In addition, in humans, subtle changes in the placement of exchanges are correlated with meiotic nondisjunction; indeed, aberrant recombination is the only known molecular correlate of meiotic aneuploidy (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;). To determine whether the altered synaptic and/or recombination patterns in BPA-exposed females increased the likelihood of segregation errors during the first meiotic division, we analyzed females exposed in utero and fostered at birth to untreated mothers. Consistent with studies in both humans and mice (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;), the altered synaptic and recombination profiles we observed at the onset of female meiosis were correlated with increased aneuploidy in eggs and embryos from mature females. Thus, our results provide evidence for a multigenerational effect on chromosome segregation, since daughters of treated pregnant females have an increased risk of producing aneuploid offspring.</p><p>While these are worrying possibilities, the implications of our findings are actually much broader: synaptic and recombination defects typically result in the loss of a significant proportion of oocytes prior to sexual maturation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, reducing the pool of oocytes in the adult female. Thus, in addition to reducing the genetic quality of their eggs and embryos, BPA may adversely influence the reproductive lifespan of exposed females. Experiments to test this prediction are currently ongoing.</p><p>Further, because oocytes in the fetal ovary are not yet enclosed in primordial follicles, our findings raise the intriguing possibility that, during the earliest stages of oogenesis, the oocyte is directly responsive to estrogen and to chemicals that can bind ER&#x003b2;. Although localization studies of ER&#x003b2; in the adult mouse ovary demonstrate the presence of the receptor largely in granulosa cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, previous studies of fetal and adult oocytes in human, bovine, and hamster &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b035">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d; and of spermatocytes in adult rodents &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d; suggest that ER&#x003b2; is expressed in premeiotic germ cells and in prophase gonia. These localization studies, coupled with our data demonstrating significant meiotic disturbances in fetal oocytes from ER&#x003b2; females and in females exposed to BPA, provide compelling evidence that estrogen plays a role in mouse oogenesis far earlier than previously suspected.</p><p>An obvious and important question is whether the effects observed in mice can be translated to humans. BPA levels in the parts per billion range have been reported in human serum and amniotic fluid &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;, and an association between serum BPA levels and recurrent miscarriages in humans has been suggested &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030005-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Assessing human risk is difficult, and although our data do not allow us to draw conclusions about BPA effects in humans, they demonstrate that a chemical whose actions influence early germ cell development has the potential to induce a three-generation effect when the exposure occurs during pregnancy. Clearly understanding the basis of this effect and, more generally, the influence of estrogen on the early stages of oocyte development are essential first steps in evaluating the potential risk of in utero exposure to chemicals that mimic the action of this hormone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mouse information.</title><p>All wild-type mice used in the study were on the C57BL/6 inbred strain background.

In the second phase of the analysis, cells staged as being at the pachytene stage were scored for synaptic defects. The pachytene-stage cells were grouped into four categories on the basis of synaptic phenotype: 1) normal, if all 20 bivalents exhibited complete synapsis; 2) incomplete synapsis, if one or two pairs of homologs remained unsynapsed in an cell that otherwise exhibited complete synapsis; 3) end-to-end associations, if two or more bivalents exhibited an end-to-end association with no greater than the width of an SC separating them; and 4) other minor synaptic defects such as gaps or fragmentation of the SC. In the final stage of the analysis, MLH1 foci were scored in the subset of pachytene cells exhibiting normal synapsis; this aspect of scoring was conducted by two independent observers who were blinded with respect to the status (placebo versus BPA-exposed and wild type versus mutant).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>Statistical evaluations of possible between-group differences in the mean numbers of MLH1 foci or chiasmata were carried out using standard <italic>t</italic>-test analyses.
