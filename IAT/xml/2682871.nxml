Following OGD, synaptic AMPAR currents in hippocampal neurons show marked inward rectification and increased sensitivity to channel blockers selective for GluR2-lacking AMPARs. This occurs via two mechanisms: a delayed down-regulation of GluR2 mRNA expression and a rapid internalization of GluR2-containing AMPARs during the OGD insult, which are replaced by GluR2-lacking receptors. The mechanisms that underlie this rapid change in subunit composition are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that this trafficking event shares features in common with events that mediate long term depression and long term potentiation and is initiated by the activation of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartic acid receptors. Using biochemical and electrophysiological approaches, we show that peptides that interfere with PICK1 PDZ domain interactions block the OGD-induced switch in subunit composition, implicating PICK1 in restricting GluR2 from synapses during OGD. Furthermore, we show that GluR2-lacking AMPARs that arise at synapses during OGD as a result of PICK1 PDZ interactions are involved in OGD-induced delayed cell death. This work demonstrates that PICK1 plays a crucial role in the response to OGD that results in altered synaptic transmission and neuronal death and has implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie cell death during stroke.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>The work was funded by grants from <grant-sponsor>The Wellcome Trust</grant-sponsor>, the <grant-sponsor>Medical Research Council</grant-sponsor>, and <grant-sponsor>European Neuroscience Institutes Network</grant-sponsor> (ENI-NET).</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">3</xref> associated with transient global ischemia induces delayed cell death, particularly in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>), a phenomenon that involves Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Zn<sup>2+</sup>-permeable, GluR2-lacking AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). AMPARs are heteromeric complexes of subunits GluR1&#x02013;4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>), and most AMPARs in the hippocampus contain GluR2, which renders them calcium-impermeable and results in a marked inward rectification in their current-voltage relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>).

In these neurons, AMPAR-mediated postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) show marked inward rectification 1&#x02013;2 days following ischemia and increased sensitivity to 1-naphthyl acetyl spermine (NASPM), a channel blocker selective for GluR2-lacking AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Blockade of these channels at 9&#x02013;40 h following ischemia is neuroprotective, indicating a crucial role for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs in ischemic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>).</p><p>In addition to delayed changes in AMPAR subunit composition as a result of altered mRNA expression, it was recently reported that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permable, GluR2-lacking AMPARs are targeted to synaptic sites via membrane trafficking at much earlier times during OGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). This subunit rearrangement involves endocytosis of AMPARs containing GluR2 complexed with GluR1/3, followed by exocytosis of GluR2-lacking receptors containing GluR1/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms behind this trafficking event are unknown, and furthermore, it is not known whether these trafficking-mediated changes in AMPAR subunit composition contribute to delayed cell death.</p><p>AMPAR trafficking is a well studied phenomenon because of its crucial involvement in long term depression (LTD) and long term potentiation (LTP), activity-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity thought to underlie learning and memory. AMPAR endocytosis, exocytosis, and more recently subunit-switching events (brought about by trafficking that involves endo/exocytosis) are central to the necessary changes in synaptic receptor complement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). It is possible that similar mechanisms regulate AMPAR trafficking during OGD.</p><p>PICK1 is a PDZ and BAR (Bin-amphiphysin-Rus) domain-containing protein that binds, via the PDZ domain, to a number of membrane proteins including AMPAR subunits GluR2/3. This interaction is required for AMPAR internalization from the synaptic plasma membrane in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via NMDAR activation in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). This process is the major mechanism that underlies the reduction in synaptic strength in LTD. Furthermore, PICK1-mediated trafficking has recently emerged as a mechanism that regulates the GluR2 content of synaptic receptors, which in turn determines their Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). This is likely to be of profound importance in both plasticity and pathological mechanisms. Importantly, PICK1 overexpression has been shown to induce a shift in synaptic AMPAR subunit composition in hippocampal CA1 neurons, resulting in inwardly rectifying AMPAR EPSCs via reduced surface GluR2 and no change in GluR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). This suggests that PICK1 may mediate the rapid switch in subunit composition occurring during OGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that the OGD-induced switch in AMPAR subunit composition is dependent on PICK1 PDZ interactions, and importantly, that this early trafficking event that occurs during OGD contributes to the signaling that results in delayed neuronal death.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Electrophysiology</italic>&#x02014;Brain slices were prepared from postnatal day 13&#x02013;15 male Wistar rats following a lethal dose of anesthetic (isoflurane inhalation).

AMPARs lacking GluR2 are blocked by polyamines in a voltage-dependent manner, with the degree of blockade much greater at positive membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). These properties result in a linear current-voltage relationship for GluR2-containing AMPARs but an inwardly rectifying relationship for those lacking GluR2. It is therefore possible to assess the proportion of GluR2-containing AMPARs at the synapse by measuring the inward rectification displayed by the current-voltage relationship.</p><p>We measured the rectification of AMPAR-EPSCs by making whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices and stimulating the Schaffer collaterals. Cells were voltage-clamped at &#x02013;70 mV and +40 mV in the presence of the NMDAR antagonist <sc>d</sc>-AP5 (50 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) to measure the degree of AMPAR rectification (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). After <sc>d</sc>-AP5 washout, a 30-min OGD protocol was then applied to the slice (see &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;), after which <sc>d</sc>-AP5 was reapplied and the EPSC amplitude slowly recovered over 10&#x02013;15 min. Once the EPSC amplitude reached stability, rectification was again measured at &#x02013;70 mV and +40 mV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). The rectification index was measured by dividing the EPSC amplitude at +40 mV by that at &#x02013;70 mV; therefore a decrease in the index corresponds to an increase in the degree of current-voltage rectification. 30 min of OGD produced a decrease in the rectification index in control experiments (pre-OGD = 0.46 &#x000b1; 0.02, post-OGD = 0.40 &#x000b1; 0.02, <italic>n</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). This effect was blocked if <sc>d</sc>-AP5 was present throughout the OGD protocol (pre-OGD = 0.38 &#x000b1; 0.03, post-OGD = 0.42 &#x000b1; 0.07, <italic>n</italic> = 6, <italic>p</italic> = 0.6) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Time-matched control experiments that were identical except without OGD produced no change in the rectification index (pre-OGD = 0.35 &#x000b1; 0.03, post-OGD = 0.37 &#x000b1; 0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 6, <italic>p</italic> = 0.58, data not shown).</p><p>To ensure that OGD did not induce a change in the EPSC reversal potential, we performed separate experiments recording responses at &#x02013;70, &#x02013;50, &#x02013;30, and &#x02013;10 mV before and after OGD. By fitting a straight line through the data points, we calculated the EPSC reversal potential and found no change after OGD (pre-OGD 0.9 &#x000b1; 3 mV, post-OGD 3.2 &#x000b1; 5 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.49, data not shown).</p><p><italic>The OGD-induced Change in AMPAR-EPSC Rectification Is</italic><italic>PICK1-dependent</italic>&#x02014;The increase in rectification following OGD suggests a rapid decrease in the proportion of synaptic GluR2-containing AMPARs relative to GluR2-lacking AMPARs during the OGD insult.

The viruses are bicistronic to express enhanced green fluorescent protein in addition to the peptides. By visualizing green fluorescent protein fluorescence, we consistently observed that 80&#x02013;90% neurons were infected. We then assayed surface GluR2 following a 30-min period of OGD. The control peptide pep2-SVKE had no effect on OGD-induced GluR2 trafficking. However, pep2-SVKI and pep2-EVKI, both of which disrupt PICK1 PDZ interactions, completely blocked the reduction in surface-expressed GluR2 in response to OGD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). These data strongly suggest that PICK1 plays a crucial role in the OGD-induced switch in surface AMPAR subunit composition.</p><p><italic>Activity of GluR2-lacking AMPARs during OGD Insult Contribute to Delayed Neuronal Death</italic>&#x02014;To investigate the functional relevance of PICK1-mediated subunit switching during the OGD insult, we used NASPM to specifically block GluR2-lacking AMPARs.

This strongly suggests that PICK1 PDZ domain interactions, and therefore PICK1-mediated AMPAR trafficking, are required for delayed OGD-induced cell death.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we have identified the GluR2-PICK1 interaction as a crucial mediator of OGD-induced AMPAR trafficking that results in an increased proportion of synaptic GluR2-lacking receptors. Our work also defines this trafficking event during OGD as a critical step leading to delayed neuronal death following the insult. In a previous study, it was shown that GluR2-PICK1 binding increases in hippocampal neurons following OGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>); however, a causal link between this interaction and the switch in AMPAR subunit composition was not demonstrated. We have taken this further by providing direct evidence that disrupting PICK1-GluR2 interactions blocks the internalization of GluR2 from the cell surface and the resulting rectification change of synaptic AMPAR-EPSCs. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that PICK1-mediated regulation of GluR2 occurring during OGD is required for delayed neuronal death.</p><p>In addition to PICK1, the GluR2 PDZ ligand binds GRIP1 and ABP/GRIP. Our biotinylation data and cell death assays indicate that interfering with both PICK1 and ABP/GRIP PDZ domains (using pep2-SVKI) has the same effect as blocking just PICK1 (pep2-EVKI), suggesting that PICK1 is the more important protein. However, in our electrophysiology experiments, pep2-SVKI is less potent at blocking the OGD-induced rectification change when compared with pep2-EVKI. A possible explanation for this result may be that ABP/GRIP has an influence on GluR2-containing AMPARs that opposes that of PICK1. Consistent with this idea, it has been demonstrated that during OGD, the GluR2-PICK1 interaction is enhanced, whereas GluR2-ABP is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). The difference between the electrophysiology and cell biology results is likely to reflect the difference in mode of presentation of the peptide: acute infusion when compared with long term expression. The lack of an interfering peptide that is specific to ABP/GRIP PDZ domains makes it difficult to assess the role of ABP/GRIP using this approach.</p><p>It is well established that GluR2 mRNA levels and protein expression are reduced in hippocampal CA1 neurons 24&#x02013;48 h after ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). The specific role of GluR2-lacking AMPARs brought about by PICK1-mediated trafficking at an earlier stage during OGD when compared with those expressed at later time points via altered gene expression is unclear. It is possible that the role of the early AMPAR-mediated calcium signal during OGD is to provide a trigger for signaling pathways that result in additional synaptic changes at a later time point, which may include altered <italic>GluR2</italic> gene expression.</p><p>A change in AMPAR-EPSC rectification has recently been described following LTP induction in CA1 hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>) (but see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>), which may be PICK1-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). It has been proposed that the calcium influx through these GluR2-lacking AMPARs is required for stabilization of LTP, and therefore, for longer term changes in synaptic transmission. In the case of LTP, the rectification change is transient, lasting only for around 20 min following stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). However, the OGD-induced change in AMPAR subunit composition persists for at least 24 h after insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>), suggesting that important functional as well as mechanistic differences exist between OGD and LTP. In our experiments, the increased AMPAR-EPSC rectification seen immediately after OGD is relatively small (&#x0223c;20% change) when compared with that seen during LTP expression (&#x0223c;80% change). During OGD, therefore, the resulting calcium influx via these early GluR2-lacking AMPARs is likely to be small yet sustained, whereas during LTP, the AMPAR-mediated calcium signal may be large and more transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). These precise temporal characteristics may be crucial in determining the downstream effects of AMPAR subunit rearrangements.</p><p>PICK1 has now been implicated in a number of physiological and pathological situations that involve regulating the GluR2 content of synaptic AMPARs. Interestingly, in most of these events, including during OGD (this study), PICK1 plays a role in restricting GluR2 from the synapse, rendering a proportion of AMPARs calcium-permeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). This is likely to reflect a function for PICK1 in promoting GluR2 endocytosis or in restricting its recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). However, in cerebellar stellate cells, PICK1 plays a role in mediating a switch from GluR2-lacking to GluR2-containing synaptic AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>), suggesting that PICK1 can also promote forward traffic (or restrict endocytosis) of GluR2-containing AMPARs in certain cell types. Further work is needed to unravel the precise mechanisms that underlie how PICK1 specifically sorts and targets GluR2-containing AMPARs to appropriate subcellular locations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank H.
