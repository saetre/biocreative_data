However, this diversity of differentiation means that the efficiency of producing any one particular cell type is inevitably low. Although pancreatic differentiation has been reported from HESC, practicable applications for the use of &#x003b2;-cells derived from HESC to treat diabetes will only be possible once techniques are developed to promote efficient differentiation along the pancreatic lineages.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Here, we have tested whether the transcription factor, Pax4 can be used to drive the differentiation of HESC to a &#x003b2;-cell fate <italic>in vitro</italic>. We constitutively over-expressed Pax4 in HESCs by stable transfection, and used Q-PCR analysis, immunocytochemistry, ELISA, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> microfluorimetry and cell imaging to assess the role of Pax4 in the differentiation and intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis of &#x003b2;-cells developing in embryoid bodies produced from such HESC. Cells expressing key &#x003b2;-cell markers were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting after staining for high zinc content using the vital dye, Newport Green.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Constitutive expression of Pax4 in HESC substantially enhances their propensity to form putative &#x003b2;-cells. Our findings provide a novel foundation to study the mechanism of pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells differentiation during early human development and to help evaluate strategies for the generation of purified &#x003b2;-cells for future clinical applications.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells are the primary source of physiologically-relevant insulin and defects in their function cause diabetes and hyperinsulinism.

Thus, homozygous knock-out mice lacking Pdx1 develop the pancreatic buds but fail to form a pancreas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-Jonsson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-Ahlgren1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Building on these observations, D'Amour et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-DAmour1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> found that after inducing definitive endoderm differentiation from HESC, the subsequent exposure to retinoic acid and an inhibitor of hedgehog signalling could lead to the formation of cells expressing insulin. On the other hand, although Lavon et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-Lavon1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> found that over-expression of Pdx1 in HESC enhanced pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation in EBs, they failed to find evidence of &#x003b2;-cell formation <italic>in vitro.</italic> We speculated that signals induced downstream of definitive endoderm might be, at least in part, more potent to trigger subsequent signal cascades that culminate with the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell formation.</p><p>The precise developmental relationship of the cell lineages in the human pancreas remains uncertain, but in mice the generation of &#x003b2;-cells is specifically dependent upon the transcription factor Pax4.

This suggests a role for Pax4 in committing early pancreatic endocrine cells to a &#x003b2;-cell fate, although it has also been demonstrated that Pax4 expression can generate other islet endocrine cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-Greenwood1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on its onset of activation prior to &#x003b2;-cell specification in developing pancreas, Blyszczuk et al.

Human brain RNA (Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) was converted to cDNA and used to generate standard curves for subsequent voltage-gated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel gene expression studies. Q-PCR was performed in an ABI 7500 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) or iCycler iQ (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd., Hemel Hempstead, UK). A dissociation step was performed at the end of every experiment to confirm the presence of a single PCR product. ABI 7500 software and Excel spreadsheets (Microsoft UK, Reading, UK) were used to analyse the data. The baseline was manually set to 2 cycles below the start of any amplification and the threshold manually adjusted by choosing the value that gave the most precision between replicate samples. For the voltage-gated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel gene expression studies, samples were normalized to total RNA input with PCR product concentration determined from the standard curve and expressed relative to the calibrator sample (day 7 untransfected H7 EBs).

These include a proportion of definitive endoderm and endocrine cells as evidenced by the expression of <italic>Foxa2</italic>, <italic>NeuroD1</italic> and <italic>Isl1</italic> as described in our study. The appearance of low levels of <italic>Ins</italic> transcripts also suggests that these endoderm derivatives may include a few cells resembling &#x003b2;-cells. Previous studies have identified growth factors that promote differentiation of HESC into insulin-producing cells, but few have identified transcription factors that enhance this process in HESC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-DAmour1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Pax4 has been shown to play a role in pancreatic endocrine and &#x003b2;-cell specification from the early definitive endoderm in mouse embryos and to enhance &#x003b2;-cell differentiation from mouse ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-SosaPineda1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-Greenwood1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-Blyszczuk1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data now show that Pax4 also strongly enhances the appearance of putative &#x003b2;-cells in the EBs produced from HESC.</p><p>We found no evidence that constitutive expression of Pax4 affects the undifferentiated state of HESC. It is known that HESC do express low baseline levels of lineage-specific markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-Dvash1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> so when differentiation is triggered by EB formation, the presence of Pax4 or other lineage-specific markers may distort the process of initial lineage selection. However, it seems more likely that the effect of Pax4 expression on &#x003b2;-cell production is due to action later in the differentiation process. The specification of &#x003b2;-cell fate during embryonic development <italic>in vivo</italic> relies on a tightly balanced process of four sequential steps: (1) pancreas precursor specification and proliferation from a definitive endoderm cell pool, (2) pancreas endocrine lineage commitment, (3) formation and differentiation of &#x003b2;-cells, and (4) further maturation into functional glucose-responsive &#x003b2;-cells. We envisaged that the introduction of constitutively expressed Pax4 might bestow a selective advantage on the definitive endoderm cells that form spontaneously in EBs derived from cells and enhance their differentiation towards pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell lineage. For example, since Pax4 over-expression has recently been shown to enhance cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-Brun1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, constitutive expression of Pax4 may enhance immature endocrine cell survival in addition to promoting endocrine lineage differentiation from endodermal precursors. By this hypothesis, the starting point of Pax4 activation for &#x003b2;-cell differentiation is downstream of endodermal pancreatic induction itself, so that Pax4 activation affects pancreatic endocrine cells that spontaneously differentiated from endoderm in EBs, while other &#x02018;lineage-precommitted&#x02019; stem cells are not responsive. Further enhancement of &#x003b2;-cell differentiation may therefore be achieved by regulation of signals that promote or inhibit the initial differentiation of definitive endoderm specification from hES cells, and subsequent specification of the pancreatic lineages. For example, D'Amour et al (2006) have reported that the earliest stages of definitive endoderm differentiation can be modulated by activin A, although Mfopou et al (2007) reported the generation of inhibitory Shh signaling during production of definitive endoderm using activin A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-Mfopou1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Cells produced in the H7.Px4 EBs exhibited functional properties (C-peptide release and intracellular Ca-signalling responses) typical of human &#x003b2;-cells. We found that Pax4 positively influenced capacity of HESC to respond to depolarizing concentration of KCl in a manner consistent with an action on voltage-gated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel gene expression. This was associated with a five fold increase in the proportion of responding cells, such that 14 days after the induction all EBs were functionally responsive to KCl-induced depolarization of the membrane. This was most likely due to the upregulated expression of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel genes including those encoding Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 &#x003b1;-subunits. These genes produce high voltage activated L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels which are the specific pore-forming subunits of importance in mature pancreatic &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-cells and during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-Zhang1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. The transcriptional control of VGCC gene expression is not particulary well characterised but it is well known that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry via VGCC will influence subsequent gene expression via transcription factors such as CREB, MEF and NFAT which are phosphorylated by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent kinases such as CaMKIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-GomezOspina1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition it has been reported that a C-terminal fragment of Cav1.2 that is produced in developing and adult neurons can regulate the expression of many endogenous genes including ion channels and other proteins of importance for electrically-active cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-GomezOspina1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the early expression of VGCC subunits may be required for normal pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell development and in combination with other signals may trigger the further differentiation of endocrine and &#x003b2;-cell lineages. This hypothesis is supported by studies in the Cav1.3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> knock-out mouse where loss of pancreatic expression of <italic>CACNA1D</italic> led to low numbers of &#x003b2;-cells in adult mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-Namkung1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Intriguingly, the actions of Pax4 on voltage-gated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel function are distinct from the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-signals induced by purinergic receptor agonists,, which appear to be negatively regulated by Pax4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001783-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>In our studies, differentiation of putatitive &#x003b2;-cell progenitors was achieved by outgrowth of late stage EBs on Matrigel and treatment with low glucose and nicotinamide. Similar conditions have previously been demonstrated to enhance human &#x003b2;-cell progenitor differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-Gao1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. H7.Px4 EBs produced a higher proportion of Newport Green-positive cells than H7 EBs, and these could be isolated by FACS. Newport Green-positive cells were enriched in <italic>Ins</italic> and <italic>Pdx1</italic> gene expression and had a high content of C-peptide which could be released in a regulated manner, suggesting an increase in the numbers and competency of cells directed towards a &#x003b2;-cell lineage in H7.Px EBs. Most notably, our study demonstrated a strong correlation between the amount of <italic>Ins</italic> transcripts and C-peptide content, which is consistent with the expectation that insulin and C-peptide are produced in equimolar amounts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001783-Jonasson1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our observations also indicate that Pax4-derived HESC do not respond to glucose stimulation through C-peptide release, but that they are responsive to the insulin secretagogue tolbutamide. Sulphonylurea-mediated responses suggest that these cells have the capacity to express functional ATP-sensitive K-channels and that closure of these channels by tolbutamide facilitates a depolarization of the cell membrane, leading to Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent exocytosis of insulin-containing granules. Since glucose failed to replicate this response, it suggests that&#x02013;as in fetal islets, a key component of the glucose-sensing apparatus of HESC-derived &#x003b2;-cells is functionally absent. The data we present here suggests that this is not at the level of glucose transporter or glucokinase genes, nor the ionic basis of insulin release. In future it will be important to determine whether such cells would develop to a &#x0201c;mature&#x0201d; &#x003b2;-cell phenotype <italic>in situ</italic> following transplantation or whether they will require additional manipulation <italic>in vitro</italic> in order to promote maturation.</p><p>In summary, we have described for the first time using HESC how over-expression of Pax4, in combination with simple changes to the cell culture environment, led to the enhanced generation of cells resembling pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells. Further, we were able to purify these cells using FACS and perform functional assays <italic>in vitro</italic> to determine their physiological characteristics. This provides a proof-of-concept that genetic manipulation of HESC can provide a useful tool in the generation of insulin-secreting cells from HESC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001783.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Oligonucleotide primer sequences used for standard and quantitative PCR in this study.
