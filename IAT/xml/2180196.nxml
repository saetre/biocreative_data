In normal human fibroblasts with a tight <italic>hTERT</italic> repression, a pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 led to a weak hTERT expression, and a robust induction of hTERT mRNA was observed when LSD1 and histone deacetylases (HDACs) were both inhibited. Small interference RNA-mediated depletion of both LSD1 and CoREST, a co-repressor in HDAC-containing complexes, synergistically activated hTERT transcription. In cancer cells, inhibition of LSD1 activity or knocking-down of its expression led to significant increases in levels of hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that LSD1 occupied the hTERT proximal promoter, and its depletion resulted in elevated di-methylation of histone H3-K4 accompanied by increased H3 acetylation locally in cancer cells.

Among all above modifications, regulated methylation of six known lysine (K) residues within the tails of histone H3 (H3-K4, H3-K9, H3-K27, H3-K36 and H3-K79) and H4 (H4-K20) is unique as mono- (M1), di- (M2) and tri- (M3) three modification states can be generated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Ruthenburg1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Shi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. These different states, together with the identity of the modified lysine residues, result in diverse consequences on transcriptional activities. Methylation of H3-K4, H3-K36 and H3-79 is predominantly associated with transcriptionally active genes, whereas methylation of H3-K9, H3-K27 and H4-K20 marks silent genes or heterochromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Berger1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Shi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It is well known that histone acetylation and phosphorylation are dynamic and reversible, while histone methylation has long been thought as a static modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Berger1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Shi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the recent discovery of multiple histone demethylases (HDMs) has totally changed this dogma, and thus the dynamic histone H3 methylation&#x02013;mediated transcriptional regulation has emerged as a subject of intense investigations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Ruthenburg1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Christensen1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), the first identified HDM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Shi2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, has attracted a great deal of interest because of its broad functional activities in transcriptional programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Metzger1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Rudolph1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. By interacting with diverse co-factors and catalyzing demethylation of mono- and di-methylated H3-K4 or K9, LSD1 is capable of either repressing or activating the target genes. For instance, when recruited to the target promoters by the androgen receptor, LSD1 removed the repressive H3-K9(M2) mark, thereby driving the androgen target activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Metzger1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Kahl1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Wang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, LSD1 specifically demethylates H3-K4(M1) and (M2) that in turn leads to gene repression by maintaining a unmethylated H3-K4 status on its target promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Shi2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Lee1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Wang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Shi3">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Lee2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. By eliciting such dual effects, LSD1 has been implicated in embryonic development, cell differentiation and proliferation, stem and cancer cell biology.</p><p>Telomerase, a RNA-dependent DNA polymerase silent in most normal human somatic cells, is frequently activated during the oncogenic process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Blasco1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Shay1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The compelling evidence suggests that activation of telomerase is essential for cellular immortalization and malignant transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Blasco1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Shay1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

It has been established that the stable repression of the telomerase catalytic subunit, encoded by the <italic>telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)</italic> gene, is a predominant event resulting in the lack of telomerase activity in most normal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Cong1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Lin1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in order to acquire telomerase activity, it is necessary to erase negative regulators suppressing hTERT transcription. However, it remains incompletely understood how the repression or activation of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene in normal and cancerous cells is achieved, despite great efforts in elucidating the underlying mechanisms during the past years.</p><p>Recent studies have started to uncover a close association between histone modifications including methylation and transcriptional activity of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Hou1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Atkinson1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Lack of histone H3-K4 methylation generally marks the repressive hTERT transcription in telomerase-deficient cells while the over-expression of SMYD3, a histone methyltransferase (HMT) that specifically di- and tri-methylates histone H3-K4, leads to the induction of hTERT mRNA expression via enhancing methylated H3-K4 at the hTERT proximal promoter region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Liu2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Atkinson1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

Conceivably, histone H3-K4 demethylation at the hTERT promoter may be required to lock the chromatin in a closed state in telomerase-deficient cells. However, it remains unknown which HDMs are associated with the hTERT promoter and responsible for maintaining H3-K4 demethylation locally. In the present study, we sought to address this issue by determining the potential role for LSD1 in controlling hTERT transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Tranylcypromine treatment or depletion of LSD1 expression induces hTERT mRNA expression in MRC5 fibroblasts</title><p>The amino oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine has been identified to potently suppress the enzymatic activity of LSD1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Lee2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

For this purpose, MRC5 cells were exposed to either tranylcypromine or TSA alone, or tranylcypromine plus TSA. A weak expression of hTERT mRNA was observed in cells treated with tranylcypromine at 25 &#x000b5;M or TSA at 0.1 &#x000b5;M, whereas the cell exposure to both tranylcypromine and TSA led to a robust increase in hTERT transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001446-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

We first recorded a change in global histone H3 methylation and acetylation profile in control and treated cells, but failed to find a significant difference in total methylated H3-K4 and K9 or H3 acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001446-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were then applied to determine histone H3 modifications at the hTERT promoter region by using the PCR primers spanning the proximal promoter regions (between &#x02013;296 and &#x02013;22 relative to ATG). The treatment of HeLa cells with the LSD1 inhibitor led to substantial enrichments in H3-K4(M2) at the hTERT core promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001446-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Similar alterations were observed in SiHa cells following tranylcypromine treatment: H3-K4(M2) at the hTERT promoter was increasingly enriched. Furthermore, highly increased histone H3 acetylation at the hTERT promoter region was found in both HeLa and SiHa cells in the presence of tranylcypromine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001446-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>).

In the present study, we provide evidence that LSD1 is required for transcriptional repression of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene in both normal and cancerous human cell lines.</p><p>Previous observations showed that the entire <italic>hTERT</italic> gene was embedded in a highly condensed chromatin in human normal fibroblasts with a tight repression of hTERT transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Wang2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Wang3">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. When treated with a HDAC inhibitor, the local chromatin became open due to the increased histone acetylation, which thus allowed the transcriptional activation of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Cong1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Lin1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. These data indicate an important role for HDAC-mediated histone deacetylation in repressing <italic>hTERT</italic> expression in telomerase-deficient cells. It is evident from the present investigation that LSD1 is similarly required for the establishment of repressive hTERT chromatin in normal fibroblasts. The activation of an optimal hTERT transcription can be achieved only when LSD1 and HDACs are both inhibited. Taken together, LSD1-mediated H3-K4 demethylation and HDAC-mediated histone deacetylation cooperate to establish a repressive transcriptional environment at the hTERT promoter region in human normal fibroblasts. Moreover, the recruitment of LSD1 to the hTERT promoter observed in differentiated HL60 cells provides independent evidence for its participation in the stable repression of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene. It is currently unclear whether other histone demethylases are involved in the H3-K4 demethylation at the hTERT chromatin. This issue is now being addressed in our laboratory.</p><p>Intriguingly, the temporal patterns of expression of specific components of the LSD1 complex during the mammalian development cause a switch of LSD1 function from repression to activation, or reverse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Wang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we compared the transcriptional effect of LSD1 on the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene between cancer and normal cells. All the tested cancer cells including HeLa, SiHa, SW756 and A549 expressed hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity, but the pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 activity or depletion of its expression was capable of further up-regulating hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity levels, which clearly indicates an identical inhibitory effect of LSD1 on hTERT transcription in both normal and cancer cells. More importantly, the ChIP result demonstrated the LSD1 occupancy on the hTERT proximal promoter. Consistent with its functional activity, inhibition of LSD1 led to increased histone H3-K4 (M2) at the hTERT promoter region. In contrast, there were no detectable changes in H3-K9 methylation locally. It seems that LSD1 only targets H3-K4 for its demethylation at the hTERT promoter. Moreover, the LSD1-mediated H3-K4 demethylation was confined to the core promoter region without a further extension to upstream nucleosomes based on our unpublished data.</p><p>H3-K4 methylation alters the chromatin folding, leading to increased accessibility of DNA to proteins that mediate transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Berger1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Shi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Given the fact that <italic>hTERT</italic> gene is a direct target of c-MYC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Horikawa2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Takakura2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, the LSD1-mediated H3-K4 demethylation might prevent the c-MYC binding to the hTERT promoter, which in turn attenuates a transcriptional activity of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene. Consistent with this hypothesis, we indeed observed that the depletion of LSD1 led to not only increased H3-K4(M2) but also H3-K4(M3) at the hTERT proximal promoter in HeLa cells (data not shown). In addition, recent studies have revealed an intimate cross-talk between LSD1 and deacetylating enzymes, and histone demethylation can be a secondary target of HDAC inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001446-Lee3">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

Consistently, we observed concomitant increases in histone H3-K4(M2) and H3 acetylation in cervical cancer cells treated with either LSD1 inhibitor or its specific siRNA. Taken together, LSD1 is capable of regulating the chromatin structure of the hTERT promoter region at multiple levels.</p><p>Although LSD1 was observed to occupy the hTERT proximal promoter region, as demonstrated in our ChIP assay, it remains unclear how it is recruited there. We examined a potential interaction of LSD1 with the transcription factors Sp1 and MYC family members, the key regulators for hTERT transcription, and none of them were associated with LSD1 under our immunoprecipitation settings. It is thus plausible that LSD1 physically associates with other co-factors that are in turn tethered to the hTERT proximal promoter.</p><p>To conclude, the present study demonstrates that the histone demethylase LSD1 is required for the transcriptional repression of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene in both normal and cancerous cells. By directly demethylating H3-K4 and indirectly promoting H3 acetylation associated with the hTERT core promoter, LSD1 participates in the establishment of a stable repression state of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene in human normal or differentiated malignant cells. Our findings thus provide insights into the regulatory mechanism underlying telomerase silencing and activation in human cells, and have implications in cancer and stem cell biology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines, culture conditions, and chemicals</title><p>Human cervical cancer cell lines HeLa, SiHa and SW756, lung carcinoma cell line A549, normal fetal lung fibroblasts MRC5, and leukemic cell line HL60 were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C/95&#x00025;air/5&#x00025;CO<sub>2</sub> in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland, UK) containing 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mM L-glutamine.
