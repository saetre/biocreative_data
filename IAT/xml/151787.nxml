Although term placenta has been found to specifically bind estrogens, cellular localization of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) in trophoblast remains unclear. We used western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry with h-151 and ID5 monoclonal antibodies to determine the expression and cellular localization of ER-alpha protein in human placentae and cultured trophoblast cells. Western blot analysis revealed a ~65 kDa ER-alpha band in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells (positive control). A similar band was detected in five normal term placentae exhibiting strong expression of Thy-1 differentiation protein in the villous core. However, five other term placentae, which exhibited low or no Thy-1 expression (abnormal placentae), exhibited virtually no ER-alpha expression. In normal placentae, nuclear ER-alpha expression was confined to villous cytotrophoblast cells (CT), but syncytiotrophoblast (ST) and extravillous trophoblast cells were unstained. In abnormal placentae no CT expressing ER-alpha were detected. Normal and abnormal placentae also showed ER-alpha expression in villous vascular pericytes and amniotic (but not villous) fibroblasts; no staining was detected in amniotic epithelial cells or decidual cells. All cultured trophoblast cells derived from the same normal and abnormal placentae showed distinct ER-alpha expression in western blots, and the ER-alpha expression was confined to the differentiating CT, but not to the mature ST. Trophoblast cells from six additional placentae were cultured in normal medium with phenol red (a weak estrogen) as above (PhR+), or plated in phenol red-free medium (PhR-) without or with mid-pregnancy levels of E2 (20 nM). Culture in PhR- medium without E2 caused retardation of syncytium formation and PhR-medium with E2 caused acceleration of syncytium formation compared to cultures in PhR+ medium. These data indicate that the considerable increase in estrogen production during pregnancy may play a role, via the ER-alpha, in the stimulation of CT differentiation and promote function in normal placentae. This mechanism, however, may not operate in abnormal placentae, which show a lack of ER-alpha expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Estrogenic steroids regulate cellular function in a wide variety of tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. During human pregnancy, the production of 17-beta-estradiol (E2) rises eighty fold, from 0.75 nM preovulatory peak to 60 nM at term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and estrogens influence various aspects of placental function and fetal development in humans and primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Several previous studies have shown that human placenta binds estradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, more recent immunohistochemical studies on paraffin-embedded or snap frozen sections as well as other techniques (RT-PCR for ER-alpha mRNA) failed to demonstrate estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#x003b1;) in human placentae during pregnancy or in cultures of dispersed placental cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, it has been indicated that the failure to detect the ER&#x003b1; does not entirely preclude the presence of this receptor in human trophoblast cells, but might be attributed to a relatively low number and density of ER&#x003b1; molecules on these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. On the other hand, Billiar et al. reported identification of the ER&#x003b1; in the nuclei of cultured human placental syncytiotrophoblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To our knowledge, no western blot analysis of placental ER&#x003b1; expression has been previously described.</p><p>During the third trimester, and after 34&#x02013;36 weeks of pregnancy in particular, the placenta may develop an abnormality, often classified as placental aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These abnormal placentae are characterized by generalized interstitial fibrosis and fibrinoid degeneration of villous stroma, and are associated with cellular apoptosis and congestion of villous sinusoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Immunohistochemically, villous abnormality is associated with progressive diminution of Thy-1 differentiation protein in the villous core [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Marked changes in villous structure are particularly associated with advanced maternal age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We have recently reported that, with respect to the Thy-1 expression, compensatory dilatation of villous sinusoids, and placental expression of low molecular weight cyclin E variants, the term placentae can be classified into four placental types (PT1&#x02013;PT4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], where PT4 corresponds to the most severe placental abnormality. These observations indicate that the term placenta is not a constant structure, either morphologically or biologically. Therefore, expression of certain placental proteins, including ER&#x003b1;, may vary.</p><p>Upon immunohistochemical staining, ER&#x003b1; is predominantly localized to cell nuclei. However, positive staining of ER&#x003b1; in the cytoplasm can also be seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It has been reported that cytoplasmic ER&#x003b1; expression accompanied by a lack of nuclear staining is characteristic for immature cells, nuclear ER&#x003b1; indicates differentiating cells, and complete lack of ER&#x003b1; expression accompanies terminal differentiation of estrogen-sensitive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition, evidence for cell surface ER&#x003b1; expression has been recently presented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Trophoblast cells are usually separated and grown in media containing phenol red (PhR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Phenol red is a weak estrogen with apparent biological effects, and the ER&#x003b1; binding affinity in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) is equivalent to levels of E2 as high as 0.45 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Although relatively low when compared to the E2 levels in pregnancy, this estrogenic binding affinity of PhR is close to that of E2 during the preovulatory peak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Therefore, we included studies with PhR+, PhR-/E2- and PhR-/E2+ media in order to determine the effect of estrogens on differentiation of cultured trophoblast cells (syncytium formation) derived from normal and abnormal placental types.</p><p>Here we show for the first time that the ER&#x003b1; protein is expressed in normal and marginally abnormal placentae (normal placental types) but barely detectable in placentae exhibiting moderate and severe abnormality (abnormal placental types). However, all placental types showed distinct ER&#x003b1; expression in trophoblast cultures. Nuclear ER&#x003b1; expression was confined to the villous and tissue culture mononucleated trophoblast cells, but not syncytiotrophoblast layers. DMEM with PhR stimulated differentiation of trophoblast cells from normal placental types, but mid-pregnancy levels of E2 significantly enhanced differentiation of cultured trophoblast cells derived from both normal and abnormal placentae.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Tissues</title><p>Ten placentae from deliveries between 33 and 41 weeks of pregnancy were investigated.

Six additional cases were studied for the effect of E2 on trophoblast differentiation. Excluded were patients with blood transferable infections, e.g., hepatitis and HIV, and apparent ascendent placental infections. Frozen tissue samples of ovarian cancer (a tissue control for ER&#x003b1; expression) were obtained from NCI Cooperative Human Tissue Network, Columbus, Ohio. MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells were maintained as indicated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and utilized as a cell culture positive control. Rat kidneys for secondary antibody absorption were kindly supplied by Dr. Roberto Dominguez, Laboratory of Biology of Reproduction, Facultad de Estudios Profesionales Zaragoza, UNAM, Mexico DF, Mexico. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.</p><p>An unusually detailed description of the methods utilized follows, since placental ER&#x003b1; expression is still a highly controversial issue.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue processing and peroxidase immunohistochemistry</title><p>All chemicals, except where specified otherwise, were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO. The processing of the placenta started within 30&#x02013;60 min after delivery. Several 10 &#x000d7; 10 &#x000d7; 5 mm blocks of tissue were collected from different central cotyledons into cryomold biopsy vinyl specimens molds (Tissue-Tek Cryomold Biopsy, Miles Inc. Diagnostic Division, Elkhart, IN) and embedded in an optimum cutting temperature formulation of watersoluble glycols and resins (O.C.T. compound; Miles). The molds with specimens were frozen by floating on liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until use. Frozen tissues were sliced into 7 &#x003bc;m serial sections using a cryostat microtome with specimen retraction during return travel (Carl Zeiss Microm HM 505 E; MICROM Laborger&#x000e4;te GmbH, Waldorf, Germany) and ten to twelve distinct tissue sections were placed on each slide. The slides were dried ~2 h at room temperature, fixed 5 min in acetone, dried 30 min, and stored at 4&#x000b0;C until immunoperoxidase staining was performed &#x02013; within two to four weeks. Prior to staining, the slides were transferred in a cold room (4&#x000b0;C) into air protected boxes containing Drierite granules (W.A. Hammond Drierite Co, Ltd, Xenia, OH) to prevent water condensation, and the boxes with slides were equilibrated to room temperature before opening.</p><p>Slides were incubated overnight (4&#x000b0;C) with affinity purified mouse anti-human ER&#x003b1; alpha monoclonal antibody (1:50; 5 &#x003bc;g/ml), clone h-151. This antibody was raised against a 14 residue synthetic peptide (RAANLWPSPLMIKR) based on the human estrogen receptor (residues 287&#x02013;300), and reacts specifically with the activated 4S ER&#x003b1; alpha (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp, Victoria, BC).</p><p>Another set of sections was similarly incubated with anti-human ER&#x003b1; monoclonal antibody (ready to use without additional dilution), clone ID5 (DAKO Corporation, Carpinteria, CA). As indicated by DAKO, this antibody reacts with the N terminal domain (A/B region) of the ER&#x003b1; receptor, but the antibody concentration is unknown (not disclosed by DAKO upon request). In immunoblotting, this antibody reacts with the ~67 kDa polypeptide chain obtained by transformation of E. coli and transfection of COS cells with plasmid vectors expressing ER&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>We also used monoclonal mouse anti-human Thy-1 antibody (1:100; 5 &#x003bc;g/ml), clone F15-42-01 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] (Dr. Rosemarie Dalchau of the Institute of Child Health, University of London, London, England), for the determination of placental type (PT1&#x02013;PT4, see below). Control staining consisted of substitution of primary antibody with PBS, or with 1:50 diluted (recommended by the vendor) anti-human CD3 monoclonal antibody, which is directed against the CD3 pan T cell marker (DAKO). This control staining was also used, since the CD3 antibody specifically stains rare fetal T cells in the placental villi only, but not other villous structures.</p><p>After several washes in PBS (room temperature), the sections were incubated with peroxidase labeled secondary antibody &#x02013; goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM, pre-absorbed with human serum (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA), diluted 1:50 and absorbed with rat kidney homogenate as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Tissue sections were processed further as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], including hematoxylin counterstaining of the nuclei.</p><p>Evaluation was performed on a Leitz DM RB (Leica Inc., Wetzlar, Germany) microscope equipped with differential interference contrast and a DEI-470 CCD Video Camera System (Optronics Engineering, Goleta, CA) with detail enhancement. The video images were captured by CG-7 color frame grabber (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD) supported by Scion Image public software developed at the National Institutes of Health (Wayne Rasband, NIH, Bethesda, MD), and ported to Windows XP, 2002 release (Microsoft Corporation, Redmont, WA). To obtain figure panels, the captured video images were copied into Microsoft<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Power-Point<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>97 SR-2 (Microsoft Corporation). Each image (including controls) was further copied into Microsoft Photo Editor 3.0 (Microsoft Corporation), and total saturation balanced (usually brightness 45, contrast 65) and optimized for peroxidase immunohistochemistry by decreasing the image's blue brightness and contrast (usually to 45) and blue gamma (usually to 0.83).</p><p>For the purpose of statistical analysis in this study, the PT1 and PT2 placentae were coupled, since they can be considered as normal placentae capable of responding and fulfilling the demands of the growing fetus by compensatory villous development or expansion of existing mature villi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. They were compared with placental types showing moderate and severe abnormality (coupled PT3 and PT4).</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue lysates and western blot analysis</title><p>For preparation of protein lysates from placental tissue and ovarian cancer for western blot analysis, including control Cdk2 and normal rabbit immunoglobulin immunoprecipitates (IP), 150 cryostat tissue sections (7&#x003bc;m) were collected into microcentrifuge tubes and lysed by adding ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40; 400 &#x003bc;l/100 mg of tissue sections) containing 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium fluoride, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 15 min on ice, the lysates were sonicated using a SonicatorTM Cell Disruptor (Heat Systems-Ultrasonic, Inc., Plainview, NY) for 5 seconds, and centrifuged at 11000 &#x000d7; g for 20 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Supernatants were stored at minus 80&#x000b0;C. For western blot analysis, protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Equal amounts of unboiled protein (42 &#x003bc;g) were loaded onto reducing 10% SDS-Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad), and processed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], with some modifications.</p><p>Briefly, two identical membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and non-specific binding sites were blocked by immersing the membrane in blocking reagent (0.5% casein in TBST) for 1 hour at room temperature on an orbital shaker. After blocking, the membranes were briefly rinsed in two changes of TBST, and washed once for 15 minutes and twice for 5 minutes in fresh changes of TBST. One of two identical membranes was first subjected to overnight incubation (4&#x000b0;C) with blocking reagent only (control). Another (identical) membrane (second membrane) was incubated overnight (4&#x000b0;C) for ER&#x003b1; (clone h-151, 0.1 &#x003bc;g/ml) in blocking reagent. Next the membranes were washed and incubated with peroxidase labeled secondary antibody &#x02013; goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM (Jackson Immunoresearch) diluted 1:2000 &#x02013; for 1 hour at room temperature. Before staining, the secondary antibody was diluted 1:60 (5 &#x003bc;l/300 &#x003bc;l), absorbed with rat kidney homogenate (150 &#x003bc;g/300 &#x003bc;l) for 20 min, centrifuged and diluted to the final concentration 1:2000. This absorption eliminated any non-specific background. After incubation, the membranes were washed 1 &#x000d7; 15 min, 2 &#x000d7; 10 min and 4 &#x000d7; 5 min in fresh changes of TBST, and incubated for 1 hour in blocking buffer at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected by a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol. For exposure (1 min, 5 min, and up to 1 h) we used Kodak XAR film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY).</p><p>Next, the membranes were stripped in buffer containing 0.2 M glycine (pH 2.2.), 0.1% SDS, and 1.0% Tween 20 for 45 min, washed, and reprobed with antibodies raised against other proteins of interest, e.g., the first membrane with ER&#x003b1; antibody ID5 (DAKO) and the second membrane with actin mouse monoclonal antibody, clone C4 (Boehringer Mannheim Corp., Indianapolis, IN) 0.25 &#x003bc;g/ml. As indicated above, the ID5 antibody is delivered ready to use for immunohistochemistry, yet the antibody concentration is unknown. For western blot analysis we diluted the ID5 antibody 1:50. Although the ID5 antibody identified a band similar to that detected by h-151, the staining was weaker (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Staining for cyclin E, clone HE12 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), served as a positive Cdk2 IP control. For Cdk2 IP, the Cdk2 (M2) affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping at the carboxy terminus of Cdk2 of human origin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was utilized. Equal amounts (200 &#x003bc;g) of protein from each sample were immunoprecipitated with 0.5 &#x003bc;g Cdk2 antibody in 300 &#x003bc;l IP buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 5 mM EDTA, 20 mM glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40) and 25 &#x003bc;l protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) on an orbital shaker overnight at 4&#x000b0;C.</p><p>For IP control, 0.5 &#x003bc;g of normal rabbit IgG was used instead of anti-Cdk2 rabbit polyclonal antibody.

We have recently shown that placental abnormality is associated with the diminution of Thy-1 differentiation protein immunostaining in the villous core and less or more pronounced dilatation of villous sinusoids. Based on these two criteria, accompanied by changes in the expression of cyclin E (cE) low molecular weight protein variants, four basic placental types can be recognized (PT1&#x02013;PT4, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>Normal mature placentae, placental type 1 (PT1), show strong Thy-1 expression in the villous core, and relatively small lumen of sinusoids; expression of cE variants is low. The PT1 can be viewed as placenta capable of fulfilling the demands of the growing fetus (occasional villous regeneration and expansion of existing mature villi), without requirement of adaptive dilatation of villous sinusoids.</p><p>Marginal irregularity, the PT2, is characterized by significant diminution of Thy-1 staining, and moderate but significant dilatation of villous sinusoids. Cyclin E expression is highest in this placental type. The PT2 can be viewed as placentae with villous and vascular adaptation to imminent placental aging (enhanced villous regeneration and expansion, accompanied by moderate dilatation of villous sinusoids).</p><p>Placentae showing further diminution of Thy-1 expression and excessive dilatation of villous sinusoids are classified as PT3. Cyclin E expression is higher compared to PT1 but lower compared to PT2. The PT3 can be viewed as placentae exhibiting advanced aging, capable of compensating demands of the growing fetus only by extreme dilatation of villous blood sinusoids.</p><p>Finally, in PT4, Thy-1 expression in terminal villi is very low, but this is not accompanied by dilatation of villous sinusoids. Cyclin E expression varies. The PT4 can be viewed as placentae exhibiting villous immaturity, either compensated by placental hypertrophy (villous regeneration and expansion without maturation &#x02013; maternal diabetes mellitus; PT4A), or uncompensated (placental atrophy associated with villous immaturity &#x02013; intrauterine growth retardation; PT4B) with apparent consequences for the newborn. Further details are given in Ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Altogether, placental abnormality is not as simple as one might imagine, e.g. just placental aging. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows that abnormal placentae include either advanced placental aging with an excess of villous blood sinusoid dilatation (PT3) or severe villous immaturity without significant dilatation of villous sinusoids (PT4). Again, the latter can be either compensated by placental hypertrophy (normal Apgars associated with fetal macrosomia in maternal diabetes; PT4A), or uncompensated (placental hypotrophy) and associated with intrauterine growth retardation and apparent deterioration of the Apgar scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] (PT4B).</p><p>Note that the Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> also summarizes the data with respect to ER&#x003b1; expression showing either strong expression of ER&#x003b1; protein (PT1 and PT2) or only traces (PT3 and PT4). This supports a view that, regardless of pathophysiology, the intensity of in vivo ER&#x003b1; expression can be utilized for discrimination between the two basic categories only, the normal (NP; PT1 and PT2) and the abnormal placentae (AP; PT3 and PT4).

Trophoblast cells divided (short arrows) and associated together, yet often without fusing (long arrow, Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). However, PhR-/E2+ medium caused marked acceleration of trophoblast differentiation in early cultures, where the syncytial clusters already reached a large size. In addition, late cultures showed formation of extremely large syncytial aggregates (xl, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>).</p><p>Trophoblast cells from abnormal placentae (AP) cultured in PhR+ medium formed small syncytial clusters in early cultures and rare mid-sized clusters in late cultures (m, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>, see also Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). The same cells cultured in PhR-/E2- medium showed severe retardation of syncytium formation in early and late cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>). However, PhR-/E2+ medium stimulated trophoblast differentiation in early and late cultures, where syncytial aggregates reached a large size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref>).</p><p>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> summarizes the data on the extent of syncytium formation in late trophoblast cultures from three NP and three AP studied. It is apparent that PhR+ media stimulated syncytium formation in NP but not AP. Lack of estrogens (PhR-/E2-) caused retardation and E2 supplementation stimulated syncytium formation in trophoblast cultures derived from both normal and abnormal placentae.</p><p>Nonparametric ANOVA for Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> was extremely significant (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001). Dunn's Multiple Comparisons Test indicated significant differences in ER&#x003b1; expression at <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01 as indicated by different column superscripts in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>. Note that the measurement of extra large syncytium aggregates in NP PhR-/E2+ (see xl, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>) was limited by a maximum view area representing 90000 sq &#x003bc;m (see Materials and Methods).</p><p>Altogether, E2 appears to stimulate terminal differentiation of trophoblast cells derived from normal and abnormal placentae (both expressing ER&#x003b1; in vitro) and to enhance a fusion of syncytial clusters into extremely large aggregates. The presence of phenol red, a weak estrogen, in the culture is sufficient to stimulate differentiation of trophoblast cells into large syncytia in cultures from normal placentae, but not from abnormal ones.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first demonstration of ER&#x003b1; protein expression in human placentae by western blot analysis. Nuclear ER&#x003b1; expression was confined to the villous mononucleated trophoblast cells associated with trophoblastic syncytium and differentiating cultured cytotrophoblast cells. No nuclear ER&#x003b1; staining was detected in trophoblastic syncytia in vivo or in vitro. Unexpectedly, extravillous trophoblast cells also lacked ER&#x003b1;. These observations indicate that trophoblastic nuclear ER&#x003b1; expression is characteristic of cytotrophoblast cells differentiating into syncytial structures, but not for resting cytotrophoblast cells. Additional placental cell types expressing the ER&#x003b1; were fibroblast-derived vascular pericytes and extravillous (amniotic) fibroblasts. Estrogens may, via the ER&#x003b1;, contribute to the stimulation of terminal differentiation of mononucleated trophoblast cells into syncytial aggregates. Terminal trophoblast differentiation is associated with diminution of ER&#x003b1; expression.</p><p>Nuclear ER&#x003b1; expression is characteristic of estrogen-sensitive cells, which might be stimulated by estrogens to proliferate as well as modulate differentiated functions. In placental material ER&#x003b1; expression determined by western blot analysis showed either strong ER&#x003b1; or barely detectable ER&#x003b1; bands, and where investigated, there were no transitions between these two types of ER&#x003b1; expression. In addition, strong ER&#x003b1; expression was associated with normal placentae (PT1 and PT2), suggesting that in these term pregnancies ER&#x003b1;+ cytotrophoblast cells contribute to syncytium differentiation. On the other hand, placentae exhibiting moderate and severe abnormality showed virtually no ER&#x003b1; expression by western blot analysis or immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections (except the vessels). This indicates there is no syncytium differentiation, although the senescent placentae of females of advanced maternal age were reported to exhibit a higher number of Ki-67 (dividing) mononuclear trophoblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These observations suggest that dividing cytotrophoblast cells do not necessarily contribute to syncytium differentiation and may not express ER&#x003b1;.</p><p>An unexpected feature was the strong ER&#x003b1; expression of cultured trophoblast cells derived from placentae deficient in ER&#x003b1; expression in vivo. This observation indicates that the lack of ER&#x003b1; expression in vivo is not due to the inability of trophoblast cells to express ER&#x003b1; in general. It might be speculated that under conditions of tissue culture factors modulating ER&#x003b1; expression are different from that in vivo. Given that ER&#x003b1; expression is already enhanced at the end of the cell separation (time 0), ER&#x003b1; expression appears to be inhibited in vivo.</p><p>Virtual lack of in vivo ER&#x003b1; expression seems to be an additional indicator of moderate and severe placental abnormality. Based on in vivo ER&#x003b1; expression, the placentae may be divided into the two basic categories, normal placentae: NP, ER&#x003b1;+, and abnormal placentae: AP, ER&#x003b1;-. However, it should be considered that some PT1 placentae, the functions of which are in harmony with actual fetal demands, may not exhibit compensatory differentiation of trophoblast cells and, therefore, may not express ER&#x003b1; in vivo (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The existence of placental aging is still debated, yet various clinical, morphological, cellular and molecular aspects of placental senescence have been indicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. However, it is still unclear if there are any consequences of placental aging for normal pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal birth weight and Apgar scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. It has to be noted that even the abnormal placenta may have the capacity to improve its function and compensate for demands of the growing fetus, e.g., by elongation and excessive dilatation of villous sinusoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>As recently indicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], certain types of placental abnormality have also been ascribed to the villous immaturity (low or no Thy-1 differentiation protein expression in placental villi and a lack of blood sinusoid dilatation &#x02013; PT4, see above) accompanied by an existing (diabetes mellitus) or absent placental hypertrophy (intrauterine growth retardation) &#x02013; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. However, it has been suggested that although chronic placental adaptations may be successful for the fetal survival, e.g. in placental senescence or maternal diabetes, they may lead to adverse outcomes later in the life of an individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore, although it might not be apparent in the newborn, the abnormal placenta may indicate a burden for the future of an individual and for the quality of the human population. Yet, placental abnormality is not a rare event, since it has been found in 50% of the cases in our material.</p><p>The second cell type expressing the ER&#x003b1; were amniotic fibroblasts and fibroblast-derived vascular pericytes. Estrogen receptors have been identified in cultured fibroblasts of various origins and vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Estrogens enhance proliferation of fibroblasts and inhibit vascular smooth muscle migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Binding of estrogens to fibroblasts also stimulates fibroblast interaction with epithelial cells with subsequent acceleration of maturation of epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>The last observation is of particular importance to several aspects of this study. Activated Thy-1+ villous fibroblasts, characterized by secretion of Thy-1 differentiation protein among epithelial cells in vivo and among cultured trophoblast cells in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], are present in PT1 and PT2, but absent from PT3 and PT4 placentae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] (see also Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Various types of placental mesenchymal cells inevitably accompany "purified" trophoblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and highly activated Thy-1+ fibroblasts are present in early trophoblast cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Extravillous trophoblast cells do not express ER&#x003b1;, yet indeed, there are no Thy-1+ fibroblasts among the basal plate and chorion laeve extravillous trophoblast cells (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3O</xref>). Hence, Thy-1+ fibroblasts may stimulate differentiation and ER&#x003b1; expression in mononucleated trophoblast cells.</p><p>Although estrogens were suspected to stimulate trophoblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], no direct proof has been provided up to date. Trophoblast cells derived from normal placentae differentiated into large syncytial clusters in the presence of PhR without E2 supplementation. Phenol red in tissue culture media is a weak estrogen, sufficient to stimulate the proliferation of ER&#x003b1;+ MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We report a similar estrogenic effect of PhR+ media on trophoblast differentiation and syncytium formation in cultures from normal placentae, but not from abnormal ones.</p><p>Because trophoblast cultures derived from both the normal and abnormal placentae were ER&#x003b1;+ in time 0 cell lysates, the above difference can not be ascribed to the lack of ER&#x003b1; expression. Yet, ER&#x003b1; at mid-pregnancy levels further stimulated syncytium development, as evidenced by the development of extremely large syncytial aggregates in late cultures from normal placentae, and development of large syncytial aggregates in cultures from abnormal placentae. Hence, trophoblast cells from abnormal placentae are also capable of differentiating in response to estrogenic stimuli, but the level of estrogens must be higher. However, it is important to note that pharmacological levels of E2 (200 nM) have been found to suppress development of syncytial aggregates even in cultures derived from normal placentae (unpublished data). Hence, either low or extremely high levels of estrogens in vivo may cause a suppression of placental syncytium formation.</p><p>Our observations indicate that the cultures from normal and abnormal placentae contain similar trophoblast cells capable of differentiating in response to exogenous estrogens, but they may differ in the ability of accompanying mesenchymal cells to promote this process. One might speculate that in cultures derived from normal placentae, the weak estrogenic effect of PhR is sufficient to stimulate trophoblast/mesenchymal cell interactions in vitro resulting in a local production of estrogens. It is possible that the estrogens can be secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast clusters and fibroblasts, because these cell types express the enzyme aromatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Indeed, trophoblast cultures are capable of producing estrogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>The data are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. Our observations rise a fundamental question if E2 is not, in fact, an essential input for trophoblast differentiation. Yet, previous experience has shown that lower estrogen levels during pregnancy are indicative of poor fetal condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Summary of observations on normal (NP) and abnormal placentae (AP) and derived trophoblast cultures: ER&#x003b1; expression in vivo and in vitro, and formation of large syncytial aggregates in late trophoblast cultures under PhR+, PhR-/E2- and PhR-/E2+ conditions.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center">Condition</td><td align="center">NP</td><td align="center">AP</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">ER&#x003b1; expression</td><td align="center">in vivo</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">in vitro</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">+</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Large syncytial aggregates</td><td align="center">PhR+</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">PhR-/E2-</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">PhR-/E2+</td><td align="center">++*</td><td align="center">+</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>* Extra large syncytial aggregates</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Placental ER&#x003b1; expression in vivo is high in normal placentae and barely detectable in abnormal placentae.
