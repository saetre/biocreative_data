The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are presently unknown. In this report, we show that nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells form a T-specific complex with a motif including the &#x02013;219 site within the <italic>APOE</italic> promoter. By DNA-affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, the human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnRNPA1(A1) was identified as one component of the complex. <italic>In vitro</italic> binding analysis indicated that a fragment of A1 had a marked binding specificity for the T form. Interaction of A1 with this region is driven by an adjacent telomeric-like sequence; however, the presence of G, but not T, at &#x02013;219 position inhibited this interaction. The differences in transcriptional activity between the &#x02013;219T and &#x02013;219G promoter allelic forms correlated with the expression levels of A1 in several cell lines; also, over-expression of A1 increased the activity of the T form relative to that of the G form. These results indicate that A1 transactivates <italic>APOE</italic> promoter activity by direct and specific interaction with the &#x02013;219T site.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Apolipoprotein E (ApoE, protein; <italic>APOE</italic>, gene) is a structural component of several lipoprotein species and plays a central role in lipid metabolism through cellular uptake of lipoprotein particles by lipoprotein receptors in liver and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c2">2</xref>). In the central nervous system ApoE plays a remodeling role after a lesion and during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c3">3</xref>). ApoE is a polymorphic protein, with three common isoforms (ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4), encoded by three alleles (&#x003b5;2, &#x003b5;3 and &#x003b5;4) of a single gene on chromosome 19q13.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c4">4</xref>). This allelic variation contributes to susceptibility to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c5">5</xref>) and Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c6">6</xref>).</p><p>During the course of an epidemiological investigation, three polymorphic sites (&#x02013;219T&#x0002f;G, &#x02013;491A&#x0002f;T and &#x02013;427C&#x0002f;T) were identified in the proximal <italic>APOE</italic> promoter region (nt &#x02013;1017 to &#x0002b;406) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c9">9</xref>). Several studies have found associations of the three polymorphic sites with the risk for developing AD &#x0005b;reviewed in Bullido and Valdivieso (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c10">10</xref>)&#x0005d;. The &#x02013;219T&#x0002f;G polymorphism has also been associated with variations in myocardial infarction risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c11">11</xref>) and early-onset coronary heart disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c12">12</xref>).</p><p>The three polymorphic variants of the <italic>APOE</italic> promoter have different basal transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c9">9</xref>). The individuals possessing the &#x02013;491 or &#x02013;219 allelic forms with highest transcriptional activity have significantly higher plasma ApoE levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c11">11</xref>) and increased <italic>APOE</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c13">13</xref>). It is therefore possible that the association between <italic>APOE</italic> promoter polymorphisms and AD and cardiovascular disease risk is related to variations in ApoE expression levels.</p><p>In spite of the association between polymorphic variants and disease risk, the molecular mechanisms underlying the variations in promoter activity associated to the single-base substitutions at the polymorphic sites remain unknown. In previous studies, it has been shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) that these single-base substitutions produced variations in the pattern of nuclear proteins that bind the polymorphic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c9">9</xref>). These findings suggest that the differences in transcriptional activity and expression levels may be due to variations in the affinity of modulatory factors interacting with these regions. In this work, we identify a protein, human hnRNPA1, which specifically interacts with the allelic T form of the &#x02013;219 promoter region, analyze the DNA sequence determinants driving the T-specific interaction, and present evidence that this protein modulates the transcriptional activity of the allelic T form of <italic>APOE</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructions</title><p>The 219T and 219G vectors encompassing the &#x02013;620&#x0002f;&#x0002b;78 <italic>APOE</italic> promoter region were generated cloning the SmaI&#x0002f;SacI fragment of the two allelic forms of the &#x02013;1017&#x0002f;&#x0002b;406 <italic>APOE</italic> promoter-pXP2-luciferase reporter plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c14">14</xref>) in the corresponding sites of the luciferase expression vector pXP2.

The resulting extract was loaded onto two consecutive control DNA-affinity columns and a 219T-affinity column, placed in series, previously equilibrated in buffer D (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 25&#x00025; glycerol, 0.42 M KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM DTT and a protease inhibitor cocktail) containing 0.1 M KCl.

Eluted fractions were analyzed by 10&#x00025; SDS&#x02013;PAGE gels followed by Coomassie Blue staining, and the specific 219T-binding proteins were determined by comparing the patterns of eluted proteins from each of the columns.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein identification by mass spectrometry</title><p>Protein bands from Coomassie-stained SDS&#x02013;PAGE gels were digested as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c20">20</xref>), and individual peptides were identified using an ion-trap mass spectrometer model LCQ (Finnigan, ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanospray interface, as we have described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c21">21</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>The T-allelic form of <italic>APOE</italic> promoter forms a specific protein complex with nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells</title><p>In an initial attempt to characterize the nature of proteins responsible for the differential activity of forms &#x02013;219T and &#x02013;219G of <italic>APOE</italic> promoter, comparative EMSAs were performed in nuclear extracts from different cellular sources using two oligonucleotide probes spanning the &#x02013;219 site and containing either T or G at this position. Using nuclear extracts from the T cell line Jurkat, 219T probe was found to form three main protein complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f1">1</xref>, bands a&#x02013;c); band a was only detected by 219T probe, whereas bands b and c were also detected by 219G probe. Consistently, band a was completely displaced by an excess of cold 219T oligonucleotide while this band was only weakly displaced by the 219G oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f1">1</xref>B). To further investigate the relevance of &#x02013;219 site in complex a formation, EMSAs were carried out using oligonucleotides where the immediately adjacent nucleotides were changed. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f1">1</xref>C (right panel) and, in contrast to 219G, the 218A and 220C probes (both containing T at &#x02013;219 position) were able to form complex a, the latter binding even more efficiently than 219T probe. Consistently, an excess of either 218A or 220C cold probes completely displaced the formation of complex with 219T probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f1">1</xref>C, left panel), while 219G did not. These results indicate that formation of complex a with the &#x02013;219T allele of the <italic>APOE</italic> promoter is little influenced by nucleotides adjacent to this site and demonstrate that the complex is &#x02013;219T-specific.</p></sec><sec><title>hnRNPA1 specifically interacts with the &#x02013;219T site</title><p>To determine the nature of proteins forming part of complex a with 219T probe, nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells were passed through affinity chromatography columns containing multimerized copies of this region of <italic>APOE</italic> promoter, and bound proteins were eluted by a salt gradient. The specificity of proteins bound to this column was evaluated by previously passing the nuclear extracts through two affinity columns containing oligonucleotide constructs non-related to &#x02013;219 <italic>APOE</italic> promoter region (NR1 and NR2), and comparing the profile of eluted proteins. The &#x02013;219T-binding activity of the eluted fractions was monitored by EMSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f2">2</xref>A); as shown, the last fractions eluted from the 219T column retained the a-complex-forming activity. Analysis of the eluted fractions by SDS&#x02013;PAGE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f2">2</xref>B) indicated the presence of three specific proteins of 74, 36 and 34 kDa, which were not detectable in the eluates from the control affinity columns NR1 and NR2 (not shown). A non-specific 90&#x02013;100 kDa range doublet was detectable in the eluates from the three columns. The proteins at 36 and 34 kDa were identified as the human hnRNPA2&#x0002f;B1 protein (A2&#x0002f;B1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c22">22</xref>) and the A isoform of the human hnRNPA1 (A1) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c23">23</xref>) by MS&#x0002f;MS fragmentation analysis by nanospray-ion trap mass spectrometry (not shown), while the 74 kDa band could not be identified in databases. Since the elution profile of the 34 kDa band correlated with a-complex-forming activity (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f2">2</xref>A and B), we focused our attention on that band (A1).</p><p>Fractions eluted from the control columns NR1 and NR2 did not form the a-complex detected with the 219T column eluates (not shown). In addition, a western blot analysis using the A1-specific monoclonal antibody 4B10 indicated conclusively that A1 was retained by 219T column but not by NR1 and NR2 columns (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f2">2</xref>C), demonstrating the specificity of A1 binding to the 219T column.</p><p>Next, we analyzed by UV-induced crosslinking assays the direct binding activity to the &#x02013;219 site of the higher salt fractions eluted from 219T column. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f2">2</xref>D, left, two prominent DNA&#x02013;protein complexes of &#x0223c;50 and 52 kDa were detected using the 219T probe. These two complexes migrated closely, but only the upper complex (p52) was detected when the 219G probe was used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f2">2</xref>D, left), suggesting that the lower band (p50) was specific for the T isoform. In order to investigate whether A1 was present in these complexes, a nuclear extract from Jurkat cells was immunoprecipitated with the anti-A1 4B10 antibody, and the immunoprecipitated material was subjected to UV crosslinking assays using the 219T probe. As shown, only the p50 cross-linking band was detected in these assays, while no complexes were detected when a control antibody was used instead (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f2">2</xref>D, right). In another set of experiments, nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells were inmunodepleted with the control antibody and cross-linked to 219T; in these conditions, the p50 band was clearly observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f2">2</xref>E). However, after immunodepletion of the extracts using anti-A1 antibody the p52 band was detected instead (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f2">2</xref>E). In clear contrast, the p52 band was always obtained when the extracts were cross-linked to 219G, no matter which antibody was used for immunodepletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f2">2</xref>E). These results confirmed that the p50 band was 219T specific, and was sensitive to immunodepletion with anti-A1 antibody. Finally, formation of complex a with 219T probe was analyzed by EMSA using immunodepleted extracts. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f2">2</xref>F, immunodepletion with anti-A1 completely abolished formation of complex a, while only a partial inhibition of complex a formation was detected when immunodepleting with the control antibody. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that A1 is present in the 219T-specific complexes detected by either cross-linking (p50 band) or EMSAs (complex a).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of <italic>in vitro</italic> &#x02013;219T binding activity of recombinant A1</title><p>We next investigated the interaction of a preparation of recombinant A1 (A1r) to &#x02013;219T&#x0002f;G <italic>in vitro</italic> by UV-crosslinking assays. Incubation of increasing amounts of A1r with 219T probe resulted in the formation of a complex of increasing intensity that migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 50 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f3">3</xref>B, arrow). The complex was detected with the same intensity when the 219G probe was used instead (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f3">3</xref>C), in clear contrast with the results obtained when using material derived from cell cultures, where the crosslinked complex was only detected when using the T probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f2">2</xref>D, left). These complexes seemed to be specific, since they could be displaced by a 50-fold excess of the corresponding cold oligonucleotides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f3">3</xref>C).</p><p>Upon closer examination of the UV crosslinking results, we detected a set of minor complexes with a molecular weight lower than those expected for the full-length form of A1, which appeared consistently with the 219T probe, but not with the 219G probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f3">3</xref>C, arrows). The size of these T-specific complexes suggested that they could derive from the interaction of 219T with proteolytic fragments of A1r, generated during the purification of this protein. We hypothesized that some of these truncated forms of A1r had an enhanced binding activity to the 219T probe. This assumption was based on the fact that an A1 proteolytic fragment known as unwinding protein-1 (UP-1) has been previously purified as a single-strand DNA binding protein, capable of stimulating DNA polymerase &#x003b1; activity and having a helix destabilizing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c26">26</xref>). Interaction of UP-1 with DNA has been shown to have different physical properties to that of A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c27">27</xref>), suggesting that certain regions of A1 not contained in UP-1 may act as modulators of the DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c27">27</xref>). To explore this hypothesis, a preparation of recombinant UP-1 (UP-1r) was used to analyze binding to the &#x02013;219 site. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f3">3</xref>D, two prominent complexes of &#x0223c;30 and 35 kDa were detected by crosslinking assays when UP-1r was incubated with 219T probe; these complexes were also detected when using the 219G probe, but the complex at 30 kDa (arrow) was hardly detected. Preincubation with excess cold 219T oligonucleotide inhibited the formation of the two 219T-UP-1 complexes, suggesting that the observed interactions were specific; in clear contrast, an excess of cold 219G oligonucleotide very weakly displaced the formation of the 30 kDa complex of UP-1 with 219T probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f3">3</xref>E). These data indicate that UP-1r is able to bind 219T with much higher affinity than 219G, forming a complex of 30 kDa. These results are consistent with the T-allele binding specificity of A1 in its native state; probably, the structure of recombinant A1 is not sufficiently similar to that of native A1 to reproduce completely its binding specificity, but the elimination of some structural determinants, located outside UP-1 sequence, could make the conformation of this fragment more favorable to resemble the native binding properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping of the UP-1r binding site</title><p>Both A1 and UP-1 have been implicated in the direct binding to continuous repeated TAGGGT motifs of the single strand telomeric sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c28">28</xref>). Since the oligonucleotide probes used for affinity purification and DNA-binding assays contains the sequence AGGGT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f3">3</xref>A), we wondered whether this sequence could somewhat be involved in the formation of complexes with A1r and UP-1r. In order to explore this possibility, several oligonucleotide probes were constructed spanning different adjacent regions of the &#x02013;219 site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f3">3</xref>A) and their UP-1r-binding activity was analyzed by UV-crosslinking assays. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f3">3</xref>E, deletion of the AGGGT-5&#x02032; sequence (3&#x02032; probe) resulted in the inhibition of complex formation. In contrast, the 5&#x02032; probe (excluding &#x02013;219T&#x0002f;G site) formed complexes with UP-1r as efficiently as 219T probe. Consistently, excess cold 5&#x02032; oligonucleotide, but not 3&#x02032; oligonucleotide, completely displaced binding of UP-1r to 219T probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f3">3</xref>E). These results indicate that the 5&#x02032; region of 219T probe, which spans the telomeric-like sequence, contains the structural determinants required for the interaction with UP-1r. Our results also indicate that although the nucleotides at position &#x02013;219 are not needed for the interaction, the single T to G substitution at this position inhibits the formation of the complex, suggesting that 219G probe adopts a different conformation, which sterically impedes the interaction with UP-1r.</p><p>We also assayed the effect of eliminating the region with homology with telomere repeats in the formation of the a complex observed using nuclear protein extracts from Jurkat cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f3">3</xref>F, substitution of these bases (&#x02018;Telmut&#x02019; probe) impaired the formation of a complex with 219T probe, having the same effect that the single-base substitution of T to G. Consistently, neither excess cold 219G nor Telmut could displace the formation of the a complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f3">3</xref>F). These results not only are in agreement with our previous data demonstrating that A1 is involved in the formation of the complex a, but also reflect the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding properties of UP-1r to this region, supporting the notion that the telomeric-like region is responsible for the formation of the complex, and that the complex is inhibited by the presence of G at &#x02013;219 position.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of A1 on the transcriptional activity of APOE promoter</title><p>We next analyzed whether binding of A1 to &#x02013;219 site affects the transcriptional activity of <italic>APOE</italic> promoter. First, we studied the basal transcriptional activity of promoter constructs bearing T and G alleles and the nuclear concentrations of A1, in Jurkat, U87 and HepG2 cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f4">4</xref>A, the activity of the T form of the <italic>APOE</italic> promoter, in relation to that of the G form, was significantly lower in cells expressing lower levels of A1 (U87 and HepG2), while it was increased in cells expressing higher levels (Jurkat). This preliminary observation raises the possibility that the relative activity of the T form is influenced by changes in A1 concentration.</p><p>To explore this possibility, we assayed <italic>APOE</italic> promoter activity in the A1-deficient and A1-expressing erythroleukemia cell lines CB3 and CB7. These cells have sustained retroviral insertion events downstream of one of the two alleles encoding A1. In CB3 cells the second <italic>Hnrnpa1</italic> allele has been lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c29">29</xref>) and as a result, CB3 cells produce 200&#x02013;500-fold fewer <italic>Hnrnpa1</italic> transcripts than CB7 and no detectable A1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c29">29</xref>). The expression level of A1 in CB7 cells was similar to that found in Jurkat cells (data not shown). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f4">4</xref>C, the basal transcriptional activities of the promoter allelic forms were not significantly different in CB7 cells, but the activity of the T form was significantly lower than that of the G form in CB3 cells. These results are in good agreement with those obtained in Jurkat, U87 and HepG2 cells, and suggest that the increases in A1 levels balance the differences in activity between the T and G promoter forms, most probably enhancing the transcriptional activity of the T-allele.</p><p>Besides A1, it is known that other genes, such as <italic>p45 NFE2</italic>, whose product is an erythroid-specific transcription factor, are also inactivated in CB3 cells in comparison with CB7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c30">30</xref>). In order to discard the possibility that the differences in T&#x0002f;G activities observed in these two cell lines were not directly related to A1, and to demonstrate the direct effect of A1 on the &#x02013;219 site, we analyzed the basal transcriptional activity of the promoter in CB3 cells in which A1 levels have been restored (CB3A1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c28">28</xref>) at levels comparable to those of CB7 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f4">4</xref>D). Over-expression of A1 in CB3 cells produced a profound effect in the relative basal transcriptional activity of the T form, which becomes even higher than that of the G form (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg435f4">4</xref>C). Therefore, variations in A1 levels produce, in the same cells, a clearly different effect on two identical promoters, which differs by just a single base substitution. While differences in basal transcriptional activity between the T and G alleles may be explained by a number of different reasons, and are not necessarily related to A1, these results, obtained under careful internally controlled conditions, give strong evidence that A1 modulates the activity of the <italic>APOE</italic> promoter through the &#x02013;219 site influencing with different efficiencies the activities of the T and G allelic forms. These results are thus consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding data.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A1 is an abundantly expressed protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c23">23</xref>), which has been involved in a variety of cellular functions. It has a role in pre-mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c31">31</xref>), promotes the renaturation of complementary DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c27">27</xref>) and participates in the telomeric length maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c28">28</xref>). Several reports also associate A1 with transcriptional control. By increasing I&#x003ba;B degradation, A1 augments NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c32">32</xref>) and the interaction of A1 with a vitamin D-resistant promoter binding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c33">33</xref>) has been described. A1 has also been described to bind human thymidine kinase gene promoter, suppressing its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c34">34</xref>) and very recently, it has been described that nuclear matrix attachment regions adjacent to the LMP&#x0002f;TAP gene cluster recruit and bind A1 upon transcriptional up-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c35">35</xref>). These results are consistent with the data obtained in this work, where A1 is shown to have a direct modulator effect on the transcriptional activity of the T-allele form of <italic>APOE</italic> promoter.</p><p>While A1 may play a direct regulatory role on <italic>APOE</italic> promoter activity, our data also indicate that in cells with low or null expression of A1, the basal activity of the G form of the promoter is higher than that of the T form. Therefore, A1 appears not to be directly responsible for the basal differential activity of the two allelic forms. Although we cannot discard the existence of an additional factor, which interacts differentially with the two allelic forms, producing a difference in basal activity, we have detected no evidence for the existence of such a factor by either EMSA or UV-crosslinking assay; the only allelic-specific complexes detected during the course of this work appeared to be associated with the protein A1. It is therefore possible that the allelic differences in activity are produced by the existence of different DNA conformations without the participation of allelic-specific protein factors. This notion is supported by the finding that the &#x02013;219 site appears to be particularly critical for the formation of protein complexes, so that the presence of G at &#x02013;219 position has an inhibitory effect; thus, the conformation adopted by the G form could not only sterically impede the interaction of A1 with the adjacent telomeric-like sequence, but also be more favorable for the transcription. Similarly, while A1 may play a direct role as transcription factor, selectively enhancing the activity of the allelic T form, it is also conceivable that the interaction of A1 with this form alters its conformation, enhancing its transcriptional activity.</p><p>The recovery of <italic>in vitro</italic> T-binding specificity observed when the C-terminal region of A1 is truncated suggests that the conformation adopted by A1 <italic>in vivo</italic> may be similar to that adopted by the A1 fragment UP-1. Indeed, some lines of evidence support the notion that the conformation of A1 is regulated by several factors. Thus, <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation of A1 by protein kinase C induces a conformational change at its C-terminal region that inhibits its DNA annealing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c36">36</xref>). In addition, DNA-binding properties of A1 and UP-1 show some differences, such as its susceptibility to increasing ionic strength; some authors have proposed that the C-terminal region of A1, which is not contained in UP-1, may act as a modulator of DNA-binding activity of A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c36">36</xref>). The conformation of A1 may also be regulated by protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Thus, A1 has been shown to interact both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> with itself and with other heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins core proteins through its C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c37">37</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that a heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein complex similar to core complexes detected in other tissues both in nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c38">38</xref>) could be regulating the interaction of A1 with the &#x02013;219 site.</p><p>A1 binds <italic>in vitro</italic> a broad range of RNA oligonucleotides with similar specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c39">39</xref>), with the exception of the twice-repeated UAGGG(A&#x0002f;U) sequence, for which it has an unusually high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c40">40</xref>). The dideoxy form of this sequence is identical to the TAGGGT telomeric repeat and very similar to the AGGGT sequence localized 5&#x02032; of the &#x02013;219 site at the <italic>APOE</italic> promoter. We have demonstrated that this region drives the <italic>in vitro</italic> formation of two complexes of different mobility between UP-1 and oligonucleotides spanning the &#x02013;219 site. Formation of the high molecular weight complex is not affected by the allelic variant at this site. However, formation of the lower weight complex is strongly dependent on the nature of the nucleotide located at the &#x02013;219 polymorphic position, being the complex inhibited by the presence of G at this site. In the crystalline structure of UP-1 complexed with single-stranded telomeric DNA, an UP-1 dimer was found to bind two strands of DNA, resulting in DNA bending, and suggesting that each UP-1 molecule contacts with two different DNA sites simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c41">41</xref>). Although the DNA probes used in this work are double stranded, these data suggest that the two complexes observed here may derive from the formation of DNA structures which interact with UP-1 through different mechanisms.</p><p>Possession of the T-allele at the &#x02013;219 site in the <italic>APOE</italic> promoter has been associated with increased AD, myocardial infarction and premature coronary heart disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c42">42</xref>) and with elevated deposition of the amyloid &#x003b2; peptide accumulated in AD patients&#x02019; brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c43">43</xref>). The T-allele has also been associated with a lower transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c7">7</xref>) and decreased ApoE plasma concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg435c11">11</xref>), suggesting that the transcriptional modulation of <italic>APOE</italic> promoter through the &#x02013;219 site plays a relevant physiological role in the control of ApoE levels. Our data support the notion that the basal activity of the T-allele form of <italic>APOE</italic> promoter is lower than that of the G-allele in model cell systems with low or null expression levels of A1, and that expression of A1 tends to compensate the allelic differences in promoter activity through the specific interaction of A1 with the T-allele, which promotes an increase in transcriptional activity. This interaction of A1 appears to be very sensitive to mutations at the &#x02013;219 site, but not at adjacent sites, this finding being consistent with the differences in transcriptional activity of the &#x02013;219T and &#x02013;219G forms of the promoter. This scenario would explain why there are no significant allelic differences in basal activity in cells constitutively expressing high levels of A1, such as Jurkat or CB7 cells, while allelic differences are clearly detected in other cell systems, such as those of hepatic or astrocytic origin, which express A1 at lower levels. These arguments raise the intriguing question whether a hypothetical pharmacological intervention at the A1-mediated level of <italic>APOE</italic> promoter control would result in the attenuation of the risk of developing AD, or some cardiovascular diseases, in individuals bearing the &#x02013;219T allelic form.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg435f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Analysis of the interaction of nuclear proteins from Jurkat cells with the &#x02013;219 site of <italic>APOE</italic> promoter.
