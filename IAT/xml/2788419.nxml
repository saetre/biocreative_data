The phenotype is characterized by an early onset cerebellar ataxia and neurodegeneration, especially apparent in the Purkinje cells. Purkinje cell loss is a common pathological finding in many human and mouse ataxic disorders. Here we show that in the <italic>Inpp4a<sup>wbl</sup></italic> mutant, Purkinje cells are lost in a specific temporal and spatial pattern. Loss occurs early in postnatal development; however, prior to the appearance of climbing fibers in the developing molecular layer, the mutant has a normal complement of Purkinje cells and they are properly positioned. Degeneration and reactive gliosis are present at postnatal day 5 and progress rapidly in a defined pattern of patches; however, <italic>Inpp4a</italic> is expressed uniformly across Purkinje cells. In late stage mutants, patches of surviving Purkinje cells appear remarkably normal with the exception that the climbing fibers have been excessively eliminated. Surviving Purkinje cells express <italic>Eaat4</italic>, a glutamate transporter that is differentially expressed in subsets of Purkinje cells during development and into adult stages. Prior to Purkinje cell loss, reactive gliosis and dendritic atrophy can be seen in <italic>Eaat4</italic> negative stripes. Our data suggest that Purkinje cell loss in the <italic>Inpp4a<sup>wbl</sup></italic> mutant is due to glutamate excitotoxicity initiated by the climbing fiber, and that <italic>Eaat4</italic> may exert a protective effect.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>weeble</italic> (<italic>Inpp4a<sup>wbl</sup></italic>) mouse mutation spontaneously arose on a C57BL/6J-A<sup>w</sup> background. Affected mice are characterized by severe cerebellar ataxia and failure to thrive, visibly noticeable by postnatal day 9 (P9). Extensive neurodegeneration occurs in the cerebellum, especially evident in Purkinje cells, and CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. The ataxia is presumably due to Purkinje cell dysfunction and loss. The degenerative phenotype in the <italic>Inpp4a<sup>wbl</sup></italic> mutant is unique in that Purkinje cells degenerate relatively early compared to other ataxic mouse mutants, yet there is no prenatal developmental abnormality.

The onset of cell loss coincides with modeling of climbing fibers from the inferior olive and Purkinje cell dendritic arbors in the developing molecular layer. The pattern of loss is not defined by the expression of the mutant <italic>Inpp4a</italic> allele, but is correlated to the expression of <italic>Eaat4</italic>. Interestingly, Purkinje cells in protected <italic>Eaat4</italic> positive parasagittal stripes lose climbing fiber input in late stage mutants, which has not been documented before in other mutants. These data suggest not only the probable initiating factor and mechanism for cell death, but also a potential protective strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animals were bred and maintained under standard conditions at The University of Nebraska Medical Center research vivarium in accordance with a protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.

In order to determine if climbing fiber synaptogenesis is a possible trigger for Purkinje cell loss, mutant and wild-type littermate cerebellum were immunostained with antibodies to CALB to label Purkinje cells and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) to label climbing fibers. At P3, prior to Purkinje cell loss, climbing fibers can be seen extending into the developing molecular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008270-g005">Figure 5a,d</xref>).

In some cases four to five dendrites can be seen extending off the soma.

In the <italic>Inpp4a<sup>wbl</sup></italic> mutant, Purkinje cells are lost early and rapidly, coinciding to the developmental stage when climbing fiber connections are being made. Purkinje cells that are lost show a striking morphology. Multiple atrophic dendrites are seen extending from a rounded soma and reactive gliosis is detectable prior to appreciable Purkinje cell degeneration. This would correspond to the first major usage of the inositol second messenger system. Consistent with the genetic defect there are no histological abnormalities prior to the initial use of the pathway involving the disease gene. In striking contrast to the precipitous loss of Purkinje cells in some regions, other areas of the cerebellum have normal appearing Purkinje cells. This degenerative pattern is not due to the differential expression of the disease gene, as we have shown that <italic>Inpp4a</italic> expression is not compartmentalized. However, the pattern of protection coincides with <italic>Eaat4</italic> expression. The early onset and patterned nature of Purkinje cell death makes this mutant an efficient model for neuroprotective studies.</p><p>The inositol metabolism pathway is involved in diverse functions in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008270-Majerus1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The deficiency of INPP4A is known to cause defects in the metabolism of insoluble PtdIns substrates. A reduction in the 4-phosphatase activity toward PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> was shown in extracts from mutant cerebella compared to wild-type and this substrate was also found to be at higher levels in cultured astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008270-Shin1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

Further, knockdown of INPP4A was demonstrated to reduce the internalization of transferrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008270-Shin1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. While a heterozygous effect is observed for enzyme activity levels, there is no physical abnormality observed in heterozygotes. However, it is possible that accelerating rotorod analysis is simply not sensitive enough to identify minor differences in motor coordination.</p><p>It is unclear whether the disruption of the PtdIns pathway contributes to neurodegeneration. Mutants that affect PtdIns are not normally associated with a degenerative phenotype, and vesicle transport can be completely disrupted without neurodegeneration. It is more likely that degeneration results from the disruption of soluble substrates, absence of <italic>Inpp4a</italic> would cause a block in the metabolism of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) to inositol (Ins). IP<sub>3</sub> is involved in the regulation of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release from intercellular stores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008270-Finch1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008270-Streb1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Due to the important role of <italic>Inpp4a</italic> in inositol metabolism, one likely disease mechanism is that the regulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is disrupted leading to cytotoxic stress. Large increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> activate self-destructive enzymes, such as calpains and caspases, increase the production of free radicals, and impair the function of organelles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008270-Pinton1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008270-Rizzuto1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In Purkinje cells this pathway is triggered by glutamate binding to glutamate receptors, such as GRM1, and attenuated by glutamate transporters, such as EAAT4.</p><p>It is known that climbing fibers activate the GRM1 on the Purkinje cell dendrite. The climbing fiber-Purkinje cell connection is one of the most powerful synaptic connections between two neurons. The normal process of climbing fiber elimination is abnormal in the mutant.

Mutant climbing fibers appear to be over-eliminated.
