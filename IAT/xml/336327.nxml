We find a short region of homology (consensus Ile Tyr Pro Trp Met) in four of the cDNAs, which is also present in Antennapedia and that may correspond to a bend region preceding the homeodomain. Northern blots have been performed to show the transcriptional pattern through early frog embryogenesis. Three of the genes are expressed only during a very narrow period of embryogenesis, reinforcing the view that homeobox genes are developmentally regulated.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0233-a" xlink:role="1458"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0235-a" xlink:role="1460"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0236-a" xlink:role="1461"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0228.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1453"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0229.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1454"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0230.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1455"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0231.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1456"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0232.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1457"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0233.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1458"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0234.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1459"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0235.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1460"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0236.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1461"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0237.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1462"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0238.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1463"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0239.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1464"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0240.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1465"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0241.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1466"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0242.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1467"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0243.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1468"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00146-0244.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1469"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
