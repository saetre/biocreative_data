It remains unknown, however, how new neurons become functionally integrated into spatial circuits and contribute to hippocampus-mediated forms of learning and memory. To investigate these issues, we used a mouse model in which the differentiation of adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons can be anticipated by conditionally expressing the pro-differentiative gene <italic>PC3</italic> (<italic>Tis21</italic>/<italic>BTG2</italic>) in nestin-positive progenitor cells. In contrast to previous studies that affected the number of newly generated neurons, this strategy selectively changes their timing of differentiation. New, adult-generated dentate gyrus progenitors, in which the <italic>PC3</italic> transgene was expressed, showed accelerated differentiation and significantly reduced dendritic arborization and spine density. Functionally, this genetic manipulation specifically affected different hippocampus-dependent learning and memory tasks, including contextual fear conditioning, and selectively reduced synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus. Morphological and functional analyses of hippocampal neurons at different stages of differentiation, following transgene activation within defined time-windows, revealed that the new, adult-generated neurons up to 3&#x02013;4 weeks of age are required not only to acquire new spatial information but also to use previously consolidated memories. Thus, the correct unwinding of these key memory functions, which can be an expression of the ability of adult-generated neurons to link subsequent events in memory circuits, is critically dependent on the correct timing of the initial stages of neuron maturation and connection to existing circuits.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Previous studies have implicated adult-born hippocampal neurons in the formation of spatial and contextual memories by using mouse models where newly generated neurons are either eliminated or increased in number. Nonetheless, how new neurons are integrated in the existing circuits and contribute to memory formation still awaits clarification. Toward this end, we have developed a different approach, using a mouse model that accelerates the differentiation of the newly generated neurons without altering their number, and offers the possibility to induce the process at any chosen moment. We show that the new neurons pass through their early stages of maturation faster and, though establishing connections with the existing neuronal circuits, fail to function properly. In fact, mice are not only unable to learn new spatial information, but they are also unable to use previously acquired memories. These results demonstrate that the appropriate timing of maturation of new neurons is important for their adult performance in memory circuits, i.e., to integrate new memory traces and recall previous events.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The early stages of hippocampal neuron maturation are critical for establishing the connectivity to existing circuits that is required for normal spatial learning and memory.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Farioli-Vecchioli S, Saraulli D, Costanzi M, Pacioni S, Cin&#x000e0; I, et al.

It is widely believed that LTP and depression of synaptic transmission underlie several forms of learning and memory &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b062">62</xref>&#x0005d;, and are often accompanied by structural changes of dendritic spines (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b067">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b069">69</xref>&#x0005d;). The earliest form of excitability is shown by nestin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> non-radial precursor cells (type-2 cells; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;), and LTP begins to be observed in adult-generated, young (1&#x02013;3-wk-old) hippocampal neurons, where it is elicited more easily than in mature, post-mitotic dentate gyrus neurons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the reduced LTP that we observe should not depend on the reduced number of progenitor cells type-2 and type-3 present in mice with activated transgene, because they are too immature to generate LTP. Rather, the reduction of LTP may depend on new neurons that are &#x02265;2 wks old, whose numbers are unchanged in our mouse model but whose dendritic arborization and spine density are markedly decreased. Thus, bypassing the early stages of differentiation during adult neurogenesis in neurons generated following transgene activation strongly affects the ability of dentate gyrus circuits to integrate synaptic transmission. This is further suggested by the observation that basic synaptic transmission is unchanged, as input-output curve analysis shows.</p><p>A second functional change that we observe in the dentate gyrus of transgenic mice is the lack of activation of new, fully differentiated neurons, 4&#x02013;6 wk of age, in response to learning, as indicated by the absence of induction of c-<italic>fos</italic> expression after training. Indeed, the activation of adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons in spatial memory circuits has been linked to the induction of c-<italic>fos</italic> expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b070">70</xref>&#x0005d;. This expression is elicited in adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons, 4&#x02013;6 wk of age, in mice trained in the Morris water maze, indicating that at this developmental stage the dentate gyrus neuron develops functions critical for its activation and recruitment into spatial memory circuits &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Hence, the absence of c-<italic>fos</italic> activation in 4&#x02013;6-wk-old neurons that have expressed <italic>PC3</italic> at birth suggests that these neurons do not attain a functional state in hippocampal circuits.</p><p>The functional alterations observed by us in new, adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons that are prematurely differentiated may find a structural correlate in the morphological alterations, most evident in 4-wk-old neurons identified after infection with a GFP-expressing retrovirus, i.e., reduced dendritic length and spine density.</p><p>We can assume that the birth datings of a neuron by BrdU and retroviral infection are comparable, and we consider that a neuron analyzed 4 wk post-infection is representative of the level of mid-late maturation, when the main neuronal structures are developed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Altogether, it is plausible that the faster attainment of the terminally differentiated state, observed in adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons of mice with active transgene, may (following an initial faster development of the dendritic tree seen in neurons at 7 dpi) lead to a premature end of the developmental stages relative to the establishment and growth of the dendritic tree during the second and third week after birth.

As a result, the neuron has reduced capability to activate and integrate memory patterns, as our electrophysiological and behavioral data indicate.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Continuous Requirement in Spatial Learning of Newly Generated Neurons</title><p>In conclusion, the selective anticipation of differentiation of new, adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons induced in the <italic>PC3</italic> transgenic mouse model reveals the critical role of developmental timing, even before terminal mitosis, for the generation of neurons that are fully able to integrate new spatial memories.</p><p>As our data indicate, the number of new neurons necessary to integrate new spatial information appears relatively small. In fact, the number of new dentate gyrus neurons generated during the shortest period of activation of the transgene, sufficient to prevent new spatial learning (about 20,000, i.e., 800&#x02013;1,000 per day multiplied by 22 days elapsed before behavioral session 2), should not exceed 5&#x00025;&#x02013;6&#x00025; of the total number of neurons in the dentate gyrus (less than one half million).</p><p>It is worth noting that the progenitor cells born before or during the first session of spatial training in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF mice will normally differentiate without being affected by activation of the transgene during session 2, because in progenitor cells, the nestin promoter becomes physiologically inactive within 1 wk after their birth &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, in Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF &#x02192; ON mice, only the new neurons born in the 3&#x02013;4-wk period of transgene activation preceding and during the second behavioral session appear to be responsible for the spatial learning and memory deficits observed.</p><p>Moreover, given that Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF &#x02192; ON mice were significantly impaired in spatial tasks since the beginning of the second session, the premature differentiation of adult-generated hippocampal progenitor cells could prevent not only learning new spatial tasks but also the use of information acquired previously in normal condition, i.e., during session 1 before activation of the transgene.</p><p>Therefore, the picture emerging from our data is that the correct differentiation and integration into existing memory circuits of a relatively small population of new adult-generated neurons not more than 4 wk old are crucial not only for spatial learning but also, notably, for the use of memories consolidated in tasks previously performed. Conversely, neurons older than 4 wk appear less efficient. This unique role of younger adult-generated neurons in the maintenance of key memory functions may derive from their proposed ability to link temporally proximal events &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;, and also entails the need for continuous renewal of new neurons as soon as they terminally differentiate. The late activation (i.e., c-<italic>fos</italic> expression) observed after training in 4&#x02013;6-wk-old neurons by us and by the group of Frankland &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, might thus be related to subsequent steps of integration into spatial learning circuits.</p><p>The significant impairment of the hippocampal function observed in our model, i.e., the deficit of spatial learning in the Morris water and radial maze tests accompanied by deficit of dentate gyrus LTP, is not frequently observed in studies of spatial memory (e.g., see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b077">77</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>It is plausible that the ablation of new neurons, while eliminating their functional contribution, may at least in some case trigger compensatory processes, e.g., increased proliferation of the surviving progenitors, or a plastic reassembly of the cytoarchitecture of circuits. In our model, the new neurons exist, albeit with a reduced functionality; thus, as our data strongly suggest, no compensatory processes are activated. Moreover, these altered new neurons appear to establish connections with the existing neurons and are thus integrated in previously-formed circuits. It might be the same as expanding a circuit by interspersing new elements with lower functionality. Therefore this model, assembling within spatial circuits new neurons generated in normal number but with altered maturation, can be considered the equivalent of an anatomical dominant-negative, and may give the advantage over ablative strategies of magnifying the ability of new neurons&#x02014;variable depending on their maturation state&#x02014;to integrate and/or recall traces of temporally proximal events from existing circuits.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mouse lines and genotyping.</title><p>The bitransgenic <italic>nestin</italic>-rtTA/TRE-<italic>PC3</italic> mouse line is the progeny of two mouse lines, each carrying a transgene: <italic>nestin</italic>-rtTA transgene, encoding the tetracycline-regulated TransActivator driven by the rat <italic>nestin</italic> promoter, and TRE-<italic>PC3</italic> transgene, carrying the <italic>PC3</italic> coding region under control of the Tetracycline Responsive Elements.

At the end of the first phase, Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 8) and untreated control mice (WT, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 11) were administered with doxycycline and, after day 22 of treatment, these two mice groups (labeled as Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF &#x02192; ON and WT-doxy, respectively) were subjected to a second behavioral testing session.</p><p>The Morris water maze &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d; was carried out in a circular swimming pool of 1.3 m in diameter, filled with opaque water at a temperature of 25 &#x000b1; 1 &#x000b0;C and located in a room containing prominent extra-maze cues. A hidden, 15-cm diameter platform was used. In the first experimental phase, the training consisted of 18 trials (six trials per day, lasting a maximum of 60 s, with an intertrial interval of 30 min), with the platform left in the same position. After 3 d of learning, the platform was moved to the opposite position and reversal learning was monitored for two additional days. Probe tests (60 s) were carried out 24 h after both learning and reversal learning by removing the platform from the pool. In the second phase, Tg<italic>PC3</italic> OFF &#x02192; ON and WT-doxy mice were submitted to a further session of spatial learning lasting 2 d, during which the platform was located in a different position from those used in the previous experimental phase. A probe test was carried out 24 h after learning. Behavior was evaluated by EthoVision software (Noldus Information Technology).</p><p>For the eight-arm radial maze &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;, mice were singly housed, with water provided ad libitum, and gradually reduced to 85&#x00025; of their free-feeding body weight. Throughout the experiment, mice were maintained at their reduced weight by being fed with a premeasured amount of food on each day. The maze apparatus was constructed of gray plastic maze, with eight identical arms radiating 37 cm from an octagonal starting platform (side 7 cm). On each training trial, a 20-mg food pellet was placed at the end of each arm (baits were not replaced) and the animal was placed on the central platform, facing a randomly selected direction. In both the first and second experimental phases, all groups of mice were submitted to one trial per day for 10 training days; each daily trial ended when eight choices were made or 15 min had elapsed. An arm choice was defined as placement of all paws on a maze arm. An error was noted when an animal entered a previously visited arm.</p><p>For the contextual and cued fear conditioning &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060246-b087">87</xref>&#x0005d;, the experiments were carried out in two different chambers. In both the first and second experimental phases, all mice were trained in conditioning chamber A (26 &#x000d7; 22 &#x000d7; 18 cm), made of transparent Plexiglas with a grid metal floor and located in a sound-insulated box lighted by a white tensor lamp (60 W). After an acclimatizing period lasting 120 s, a 30-s tone was administered (CS; 3 kHz, 80 dB). During the last 2 s of tone presentation, a foot-shock was delivered (US; 0.5 mA). Both CS and US ended simultaneously. Mice were left in the conditioning chamber for a further period of 30 s and then returned to their home cage. For the contextual conditioning test, 24 h after training mice were placed in the same chamber for 5 min. Two hours after the contextual test, mice were tested for cued conditioning in chamber B, made of black Plexiglas, with a floor of triangular shape, lighted by a blue tensor lamp (60 W) and perfumed by a vanilla essence diffuser. The test lasted 6 min, with CS administered during the last 3 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the c-<italic>fos</italic>-expressing neurons, the dendritic length, branching points, and spine density, as well as the levels of freezing in the contextual and cued fear conditioning and the electrophysiological data originating from slices from the different animal groups. Morris water maze and radial maze results were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Individual between-group comparisons, where appropriate, were carried out by Fisher's PLSD post-hoc or Duncan multiple range test. Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used to analyze the number of neurons and hippocampal volumes as well as data obtained in the same slices after LTP-inducing stimuli.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0060246-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Types of Progenitor Cells Expressing &#x003b2;-Galactosidase Activity in Dentate Gyrus of Tg<italic>PC3</italic> ON Mice at P95</title><p>Shown are representative optical and confocal micrographs of the progenitor cell types expressing &#x003b2;-galactosidase, which, being encoded by the &#x003b2;<italic>-geo</italic> reporter gene fused to the nestin-rtTA transgene, matches the expression of the Tg<italic>PC3</italic> transgene.</p><p>(A) Progenitor cells expressing nestin (type-1 and type-2ab; brown) co-express &#x003b2;-galactosidase (labeled by X-gal staining, blue).
