This condition is caused by mutations in the <italic>RS1</italic> gene and is, characterized by schisis within the retina. The purpose of this study was to identify the mutations in the <italic>RS1</italic> gene associated with XLRS in an Indian cohort.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The coding region of <italic>RS1</italic> was analyzed for mutations by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis in six unrelated subjects clinically diagnosed as having XLRS and in their available family members. Direct sequencing was performed for all samples that displayed an electrophoretic mobility shift in SSCP gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mutation analysis of <italic>RS1</italic> gene revealed five mutations in exon 6 like c.574C&#x0003e;T, c.583A&#x0003e;G, c.608C&#x0003e;T, c.617G&#x0003e;A, and c.637C&#x0003e;T, respectively, among them four missense mutations, one nonsense mutation, and two novel sequence variations. These mutations were found in individuals who exhibited clinical features of bilateral foveal and peripheral retinoschisis consistent with XLRS. The mutations were absent in the 100 age matched control samples analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first report of mutations in <italic>RS1</italic> to be associated with XLRS in the Indian population. The identified genetic variations, phenotype and genotype correlations were consistent with other studies.

Estimations of its prevalence range from 1:5000 to 1:25000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. It is characterized by a mild to severe decrease in visual acuity, foveal schisis due to a splitting of the retinal layers, progressive macular atrophy, and reduction in the ERG b-wave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Lesions in the peripheral retina have been observed in half the cases. Clinically the presentation is variable; most patients present with progressive visual impairment between five and ten years of age, but a proportion of patients present in infancy with squint, bilateral nystagmus and highly elevated bullous retinoschisis (RS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. During the course of the disease, complications such as retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage and neovascular glaucoma can arise, leading to a poor visual outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>RS1</italic> gene responsible for XLRS was identified by positional cloning and found to encode a 24-kDa protein called retinoschisin, or RS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], which is secreted from photoreceptor and bipolar cells, as a disulfide-linked oligomeric complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. The function of retinoschisin is unknown. The <italic>RSI</italic> gene contains a discoidin domain. Disease-causing mutations are clustered in regions that encode this domain, suggesting that it is crucial for the normal function of retinoschisin. Several deleterious gene mutations have been reported in different ethnic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. The <italic>RS1</italic> gene maps to the distal short arm of the X chromosome (Xp22) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>] and consists of six exons that span approximately 15 kb of genomic DNA. Over 130 different mutations in <italic>RS1</italic> are associated with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dmd.nl/nmdb/index.php?select_db=RS1">retinoschisin</ext-link>. These include small intronic deletions, nonsense and missense mutations, frameshift insertions, deletions, and splice site mutations. Most are missense mutations in exons 4-6 encoding the discoidin domain. A large number of these involve cysteine residues. Most mutations in the discoidin domain result in protein misfolding and intracellular retention by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. The discoidin domain is implicated in cell-cell adhesion and phospholipid binding, a function which is in agreement with the observed splitting of the retina in XLRS patients, indicating that <italic>RS1</italic> is important during retinal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>].</p><p>Some published reports have described the clinical features with defined mutations in the <italic>RS1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. In this study, we discuss five mutations, two of which have not been previously described, and we determine the clinical phenotype associated with these genotypes in six patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Clinical evaluation</title><p>Subjects suspected to have XLRS were recruited to the study from outpatients presenting at a tertiary care eye hospital. Eligible participants were prospectively evaluated by visual acuity tests, indirect ophthalmoscopy, slit lamp biomicroscopy. Ganzfeld electroretinography (ERG), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) with (Stratus OCT), version 4.0.1, (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). The clinical diagnosis of XLRS was based on the presence of foveal schisis with/without peripheral schisis, supported by typical findings on ERG and OCT, as well as a positive family history. Family members, where available, were screened for fundus findings suggestive of XLRS; further evaluation was similar when clinically suggested. The study protocol, which followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, was approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from the patients and their family members prior to their evaluation in the course of the study. The clinical management was conservative in all cases. Six unrelated male patients with XLRS, their available family members, and 100 healthy control subjects, were recruited for the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic evaluation</title><p>DNA extraction and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) was performed as follows: Venous blood (5 ml) was collected for genomic DNA extraction using the salt precipitation method described by Miller et al.

Previous reports have described the clinical features in families with defined mutations in the <italic>RS1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. In the present study, patients with the clinical phenotype of XLRS had five different genetic variations in the <italic>RS1</italic> gene. All patients had typical clinical features, such as foveal schisis (with or without peripheral RS) and ERG b-wave suppression. Four patients had bilateral foveal schisis. Five patients had a temporal peripheral schisis. Three patients had RRD with variable extent. In addition to that, two patients had atypical findings. The right eye of patient 5 demonstrated evidence of foveal and parafoveal atrophy. The left eye of patient 1 exhibited a full-thickness macular hole. Four of the genetic variants identified in this study were noted to be sporadic cases, and one novel genetic variant c.617G&#x0003e;A was identified in a family.</p><p>A c.617G&#x0003e;A novel nonsense mutation was identifiedin patient 4. His mother had the same mutation, although in the heterozygous condition, and his brother and father were unaffected. The co-segregation of this gene mutation with the RS phenotype and the RS carrier status as well as its complete absence in normal control chromosomes indicate this genetic change is responsible for the RS pathology in this family and that the disease is transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait. Another non-sense mutation involving a different nucleotide c.618G&#x0003e;A in the same codon was previously reported in a French population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Our results are also consistent with this report. Highly conserved tryptophan was replaced by stop codon X at position 206, causing premature termination that might truncate the protein retinoschisin. ERG findings showed suppression of a and b waves. Total RRD was observed that might be due to loss of function of the protein due to premature termination.</p><p>Patient 2 was found to have a c.583A&#x0003e;G novel genetic variation, leading to the replacement of non-conserved amino acid isoleucine at position 195 by valine. This patient had typical retinoschisis clinical findings.</p><p>All the identified mutations are present in the hotspot region at exon 6 reported by the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dmd.nl/nmdb/index.php?select_db=RS1">retinoschisis</ext-link> Consortium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. These belong to the discoidin motif of retinoschisin protein. Retinoschisin is a soluble secretory protein predicted to have a globular conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Recent in vitro expression analysis revealed that the pathologic basis of RS is intracellular retention and defective secretion of the mutant retinoschisin as a result of protein misfolding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Many missense and protein-truncating mutations of the causative gene <italic>RS1</italic> have now been identified and are thought to be inactivating. These mutations are mainly located in exons 4-6. An alignment of 32 discoidin domain proteins was constructed to reveal the consensus sequence and to deduce the functional importance of the identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>].</p><p>Our data provides evidence that the five <italic>RS1</italic> gene mutations identified in our series of XLRS patients might lead to disruption of gene expression. Further functional insights needs to be elucidated. The genotypic approach will provide further understanding of the influence of genes in the pathogenesis of clinical disease and the correlation of the genotype with the phenotype. Carriers of mutant genes can be identified, enabling the identification of offspring at risk for specific disease as well as precise diagnosis before the development of typical, clinically recognizable phenotypes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the participating patients for their contribution.
