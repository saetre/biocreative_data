Prostasin is involved in the extracellular proteolytic modulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and is an invasion suppressor. The aim of this study was to evaluate prostasin expression states in the transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) of the human bladder and in human TCC cell lines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Normal human bladder tissues and TCC on a bladder cancer tissue microarray (TMA) were evaluated for prostasin expression by means of immunohistochemistry. A panel of 16 urothelial and TCC cell lines were evaluated for prostasin and E-cadherin expression by western blot and quantitative PCR, and for prostasin gene promoter region CpG methylation by methylation-specific PCR (MSP).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Prostasin is expressed in the normal human urothelium and in a normal human urothelial cell line, but is significantly down-regulated in high-grade TCC and lost in 9 (of 15) TCC cell lines. Loss of prostasin expression in the TCC cell lines correlated with loss of or reduced E-cadherin expression, loss of epithelial morphology, and promoter DNA hypermethylation. Prostasin expression could be reactivated by demethylation or inhibition of histone deacetylase. Re-expression of prostasin or a serine protease-inactive variant resulted in transcriptional up-regulation of E-cadherin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Loss of prostasin expression in bladder transitional cell carcinomas is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and may have functional implications in tumor invasion and resistance to chemotherapy.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>According to the American Cancer Society Cancer Facts &#x00026; Figures 2008, 68,810 new cases of bladder cancer would have been diagnosed in the United States over the year of 2008, with a total of 14,100 bladder cancer patients dying from the disease. The cost of managing bladder cancer and the associated complications is estimated to be $65,158 per patient per year in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], amounting to a multi-billion dollar economic impact. For bladder cancer patients of all stages, the 5-year survival rate is 80%. For localized disease, the 5-year survival rate is 92%. But the 5-year survival rate sharply declines to 45% and 6% for patients with regional and distant metastasis, respectively. The majority of bladder cancers (90%) are "transitional cell carcinomas" (TCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. More than 70-80% of the bladder cancers are papillary non-invasive tumors that rarely develop into invasive tumors. The remaining bladder cancer cases (20-30%) are non-papillary invasive tumors that produce lymphatic and distant metastasis, accounting for most of the bladder cancer deaths. Radical cystectomy combined with chemo- or radiation therapy is required for patients with invasive bladder cancers, and offers improved survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. But 50% of patients with invasive bladder tumors die from metastasis within 2 years of diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For patients with metastasis, i.e., invasive tumors that escaped the current chemo- or radiation adjuvant therapy, new drugs and new drug targets are needed.</p><p>Recent advances in bladder cancer research have identified the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as an important factor in determining patient responses to therapy and survival. EMT is causal to the development of invasive and metastatic cancers including TCC. At the molecular level, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin, and transcription repressors of E-cadherin such as SNAIL and SLUG have been shown to play essential and major roles in EMT and development of invasive and metastatic bladder cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We have shown that a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored epithelial extracellular membrane serine protease, prostasin/PRSS8, modulates EGFR signalling via enhancement of matriptase cleavage of the EGFR extracellular domain (ECD), and regulates SLUG and E-cadherin expression in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Prostasin is essential for terminal epithelial differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and is abundantly expressed in the normal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In epithelial cancers, prostasin expression, however, is down-regulated. Down-regulation of prostasin protein expression has been shown for high-grade and hormone-refractory prostate cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and gastric cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Promoter DNA hypermethylation was shown to be a mechanism of prostasin silencing in various cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Invasive human cancer cell lines are often associated with loss of prostasin expression while prostasin re-expression inhibits their invasion through the Matrigel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In ovarian cancers, however, an up-regulation of prostasin was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>We have previously demonstrated urothelial-specific prostasin expression in the mouse bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. But the expression states of prostasin in urothelial cancers have not been evaluated to date. In this study, we undertook this task with an immunohistochemical examination of prostasin protein expression in transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) using a commercial bladder cancer tissue microarray (TMA). We further evaluated prostasin expression in a normal human urothelial cell line (UROtsa) and 15 TCC cell lines. The methylation states at the -96 CpG dinucleotide in the prostasin gene promoter region were determined in all the cell lines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation of prostasin expression in bladder cancer tissue microarray (TMA)</title><p>A paraffin slide panel containing normal human tissues including the bladder (Multi-Tissue VI) was obtained from BioChain Institute, Inc.

The tissue procurement by these commercial suppliers was conducted with informed consent for use in research, in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration; also with approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the institutions where the tissues were collected. The tissues on the slides from these commercial sources did not contain any personal identifiers. The use of these tissues in this study is exempt from reviews by the IRB of the authors' institution, per Code of Federal Regulations Title 45, Part 46, Section 101 (United States Department of Health and Human Services). The IHC staining with a prostasin-specific polyclonal antibody was carried out as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

Prostasin-negative staining in the TMA tissue cores was assigned a score of "0", including tissues presenting sporadic prostasin-positive cells in areas of overall negative staining. These scores were used to calculate the average prostasin staining score/percent positive in each tumor grade group and the non-cancerous group. The IHC scores were evaluated by single-factor ANOVA (analysis of variance) with ranked prostasin staining data (rank 1 = no staining, rank 2 = positive staining), using the ANOVA data analysis tool of Microsoft Excel 2003. The Tukey-Kramer method was used for post hoc analysis of the ANOVA data to evaluate between-group differences.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>The normal immortalized urothelial cell line UROtsa was kindly provided by Dr. Donald A.

In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, we show that the UM-UC-5, -9, -10, and -14 TCC cell lines express very high (UM-UC-5, -9) or intermediate levels (UM-UC-10, -14) of the prostasin protein. The 253J P, 253J B-V, UM-UC-6, -12, and -13 TCC cell lines do not express the prostasin protein. The E-cadherin protein expression information on the MDA TCC cell lines was recently reported by Black et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The prostasin-positive MDA TCC cell lines, UM-UC-5, -9, -10, and -14, were shown to express a high abundance of E-cadherin at the protein level, and were also all epithelial in appearance in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We have confirmed the observations on E-cadherin protein expression and morphology for these four cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Two of the prostasin-negative MDA TCC cell lines, UM-UC-6 and -13, were shown not to express E-cadherin and to have mesenchymal-like morphology in culture by Black et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These two cell lines also appeared mesenchymal in culture in our hands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), but the UM-UC-6 cells expressed E-cadherin at the protein level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The prostasin-negative 253J P, 253J B-V and UM-UC-12 cell lines express the E-cadherin protein at low to medium levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]) and are mesenchymal-like in culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>For comparisons of gene expression at the transcriptional level (mRNA), we performed reverse-transcription and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of the urothelial cell lines for prostasin, E-cadherin, and EGFR expression. The results for prostasin and E-cadherin are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. The data columns were sorted by the relative prostasin mRNA levels (per GAPDH mRNA copy) in the descending order. While the qRT-PCR analysis yielded a copy number readout for every cell line, an arbitrary "zero" cut-off for prostasin mRNA expression in the data presentation was set with the KU-7 cell line, which does not express detectable levels of the prostasin protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Among the seven cell lines positive for prostasin mRNA, all but one (UM-UC-10) expressed the E-cadherin mRNA at above the median level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Among the nine cell lines negative for prostasin mRNA, all but two (UM-UC-6 and 253J B-V) expressed the E-cadherin mRNA at below the median level, and four lines were negative (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

In the CpG-rich promoter region of the prostasin gene, methylation state at the CpG dinucleotides at position -96, part of the restriction endonuclease recognition/cutting sequence for Hpa II/Msp I, was directly correlated to prostasin expression state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We used a methylation-specific PCR (MSP) method to evaluate the methylation states of the -96 CpG in the urothelial cell lines. The MSP amplicon is 192 bp in length, and is expected from the Xho I-digested DNA as this enzyme does not cut in the amplicon region. Amplification of the MSP amplicon from the Hpa II-digested DNA occurs only when the DNA is methylated at the -96 CpG as Hpa II is methylation sensitive and will only digest unmethylated but not methylated DNA. No amplification of the MSP band is expected from the Msp I-digested DNA as this enzyme is insensitive to DNA methylation state at the -96 CpG and will cut either unmethylated or methylated DNA. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, the prostasin-expressing cell lines, UROtsa, HT-1376, RT4, UM-UC-5, -10, and -14 are not methylated at this site, as the MSP amplicon is absent from the Hpa II-digested DNA of these cell lines under the specific experimental conditions. The cell lines negative for prostasin protein expression, J82, T24, KU-7, 253J P, 253J B-V, UM-UC-3, -6, -12, and -13 are methylated to various degrees at the -96 CpG, as indicated by the MSP amplicon signals from the Hpa II-digested DNA of these cell lines.

Demethylation treatment alone resulted in reactivation of prostasin protein expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <bold>Lane 2, versus Lane 1</bold>).

This is not surprising given prostasin's required role in terminal epithelial differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This association of prostasin expression and epithelial differentiation also holds true in the urothelial and cancer cell lines that we have evaluated, as shown in the summary of data in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. The following observations were made upon examinations of the data in the present study. The presence of prostasin protein expression (in 7 of 16 cell lines evaluated) is associated with the highest levels of prostasin mRNA expression and there is a direct correlation of the prostasin protein expression levels and the prostasin mRNA expression levels. Prostasin protein or mRNA expression in the urothelial cells is 100% associated with the epithelial morphology, and with the most abundant E-cadherin protein expression (+++). Prostasin expression is also strongly associated with above-median level E-cadherin mRNA expression, in 6 out of 7 lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Conversely, a lack of prostasin protein or mRNA expression in 9 of the 16 cell lines is strongly associated with the mesenchymal morphology (8 out of 9), with only one exception (KU-7). A lack of prostasin protein or mRNA expression is also strongly associated with below-median level E-cadherin mRNA expression, in 7 out of 9 lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Only one cell line with a high abundance of E-cadherin protein expression (+++), UM-UC-6, is negative for prostasin expression. We did not, however, find a good correlation between prostasin expression and EGFR mRNA expression in the urothelial cell lines, except to note that the highest levels of EGFR mRNA expression were observed among the prostasin-positive cell lines, for example, UROtsa, HT-1376, and UM-UC-5. Black et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] reported recently that resistance to the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody drug cetuximab displayed by the TCC cell lines correlated with their E-cadherin protein expression state and cell morphology. With a strong correlation to the epithelial morphology and to E-cadherin expression, prostasin expression may also correlate with urothelial cancer sensitivity to cetuximab. This potential correlation will be investigated in future studies.</p><p>Prostasin promoter DNA hypermethylation is an epigenetic mechanism of prostasin expression silencing in human gastric, breast, and prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In this study, we showed that methylation of the -96 CpG dinucleotide in the promoter region is associated with prostasin expression silencing in the TCC cell lines. By the ratio of the MSP amplicon signal from the Hpa II-digested DNA to the signal from the Xho I-digested DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), we could see that the prostasin promoter -96 CpG dinucleotide is methylated to various degrees in the TCC cell lines negative for prostasin expression. In most cases, the ratio suggests a heterogeneous state of methylation, i.e., the amplicon signal is stronger from the Xho I-digested DNA than that from the Hpa II-digested DNA. In the 253J P cells, the amplicon signal from the Hpa II-digested DNA is as strong as that from the Xho I-digested DNA, suggesting a homogeneous methylation state at the -96 CpG. On the other hand, the UROtsa and all TCC cell lines expressing the prostasin mRNA and protein, except for one (UM-UC-9), did not present -96 CpG methylation at the sensitivity level of our MSP assay. The UM-UC-9 cell line with abundant prostasin mRNA and protein expression had a weak but detectable signal of the MSP amplicon from the Hpa II-digested DNA. This is consistent with our previous findings that heterogeneous methylation at this site is permissive for prostasin protein expression, as was seen in the MDA-MB-453 human breast cancer cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Clearly promoter region CpG dinucleotide methylation is not the only mechanism by which prostasin expression is regulated in epithelial or cancer cells. Within our MSP assay's sensitivity, the UM-UC-6 cell line is only marginally more methylated than the UM-UC-9 at the -96 CpG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), yet the UM-UC-6 is negative for prostasin mRNA or protein expression while the UM-UC-9 expresses an abundance of prostasin mRNA and protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Other factors that could also regulate prostasin expression in the urothelial or urothelial cancer cells, such as the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP's) and the SNAIL family transcription repressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], will be investigated in future studies. In the KU-7 cells, demethylation with 5-Aza-2'-dC or HDAC inhibition with TSA independently restored prostasin protein expression to a level detectable by western blot analysis, and to a greater level when the two agents were combined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This synergistic effect of 5-Aza-2'-dC and TSA on prostasin expression was also observed for the prostasin/E-cadherin double-negative T24 cell line, which is mesenchymal in morphology, with an up-regulation of the prostasin mRNA (data not shown). The E-cadherin mRNA in the T24 cells was also up-regulated by 5-Aza-2'-dC or TSA, and more robustly up-regulated by their combination (data not shown). We could not, however, attribute the E-cadherin mRNA up-regulation solely to the up-regulation of prostasin because these two epigenetic modulating agents have a direct impact on the E-cadherin promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. DNA demethylation agents and HDAC inhibitors, though, could be used as intravesical drugs for restoring prostasin expression in TCC and suppressing tumor invasion and metastasis once an anti-invasion role for prostasin in TCC is established.</p><p>We had previously shown with the PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line, that re-expression of the wild-type prostasin or a serine protease-inactive mutant could up-regulate E-cadherin expression via a transcriptional mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This transcriptional up-regulation of E-cadherin by prostasin or the protease-inactive variant could be recapitulated in the KU-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), though not as robust as that seen previously with the PC-3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The extent by which E-cadherin transcription is up-regulated by prostasin re-expression could be impacted by epigenetic modifications in the E-cadherin promoter, events that are common in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We also performed prostasin expression silencing by using a prostasin-specific siRNA previously shown to effectively knock-down its expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We knocked-down prostasin expression by at least 50% and up to 75%, in five urothelial cell lines, UROtsa, HT-1376, RT4, UM-UC-5, and UM-UC-9, but the prostasin expression knock-down was not associated with E-cadherin down-regulation (data not shown). We have observed in the TCC cell lines, a low level of prostasin expression could still be associated with a high abundance of E-cadherin expression, as seen with the RT4 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The prostasin expression knock-down may not have been sufficient to affect E-cadherin expression. During urothelial tumorigenesis, prostasin expression down-regulation is likely a progressive event. This hypothesis is supported by the IHC data, showing a progressive loss of prostasin expression from non-cancerous tissues to TCC of increasing grades (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The association between prostasin expression state and cell morphology is manifested at the two end points of this progression, i.e., the starting end of epithelial morphology and prostasin/E-cadherin expression, and the EMT end of mesenchymal morphology and loss of prostasin with reduced or loss of E-cadherin expression. It may require a complete loss of prostasin expression over many generations of cell division to have a significant impact on E-cadherin expression and cell morphology seen in the prostasin-negative TCC cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Expression of prostasin in the urothelial cells is associated with the epithelial state, marked by abundant E-cadherin expression. Absence of prostasin is associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), marked by a loss of or a reduced E-cadherin expression. EMT and EMT-associated molecular changes are underlying mechanisms of malignant progression of TCC, such as gain of invasive potential and resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. Future research is warranted to address if prostasin may be used as a therapeutic agent for treating invasive and chemo-resistant TCC cells that have undergone an epithelial-mesenchymal transition.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LC carried out all of the IHC work and the western blot analysis.
