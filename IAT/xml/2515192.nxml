To investigate Paf1C-related function in higher eukaryotes, we analyzed the effects of loss of Paf1C on histone H3 density and patterns of H3 methylated at K4, K27, and K36 in Arabidopsis genes, and integrated this with existing gene expression data. Loss of Paf1C did not change global abundance of H3K4me3 or H3K36me2 within chromatin, but instead led to a 3&#x02032; shift in the distribution of H3K4me3 and a 5&#x02032; shift in the distribution of H3K36me2 within genes. We found that genes regulated by plant Paf1C showed strong enrichment for both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 and also showed a high degree of tissue-specific expression. At the Paf1C- and PcG-regulated gene <italic>FLC</italic>, transcriptional silencing and loss of H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 were accompanied by expansion of H3K27me3 into the promoter and transcriptional start regions and further enrichment of H3K27me3 within the transcribed region. These results highlight both genic and global functions for plant Paf1C in histone modification and gene expression, and link transcriptional activity with cellular memory.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged with histones and other proteins into a dynamic fabric called chromatin. Specific modifications of histones&#x02014;including methylation of key lysine residues&#x02014;provide genetic information that acts synergistically with the DNA code. In yeast, the conserved transcriptional regulator Paf1C is required for marking histone H3 within active genes by methylation of Lysine-4, a modification thought to promote gene activity. In higher eukaryotes, this mechanism is elaborated through Polycomb-Group (PcG), which maintains transcriptional repression through cell divisions and involves methylation of Lysine-27 of H3. In this study, we mapped these and other key H3 modifications throughout the genome of the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and evaluated the effects of loss of Paf1C on these modifications and gene expression. We found that Paf1C acts globally to maintain histone modification within genes, but is required for appropriate expression of only a handful of genes. These typically showed a high degree of developmental regulation in both Lysine-4 and Lysine-27 methylation. At the flowering regulator <italic>FLC</italic>, targeted by both Paf1C and PcG, loss of activating (Lysine-4) methylation was accompanied by further accumulation of repressive (Lysine-27) methylation. These results provide a link between transcriptional activity and cellular memory.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Post-translational modification of core histones considerably extends the information potential of the genetic code <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000077-Strahl1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000077-Turner1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Methylation of specific residues within the amino-terminal tail of nucleosomal histone H3, in particular, has been tied to activation or repression of transcription within the associated gene(s). For example, where studied in budding yeast and human, nucleosomes containing H3 trimethylated at lysine-4 (H3K4me3) are globally enriched near the transcriptional start sites (TSS) and 5&#x02032; regions of active genes, with the degree of enrichment correlating with gene activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000077-SantosRosa1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000077-Vakoc1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, H3K4me3 may define a mechanism that reinforces the active state of transcription.

Interestingly, H3 signals were lower in <italic>vip3</italic> plants within transcribed regions for the five highest expression bins, with the two top expression bins showing a significant (P&#x0003c;0.0001) relative loss of H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000077-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). When Paf1C-dependence of H3 occupancy was considered as a function of gene length, we noted a subtle relationship between gene length and degree of depletion in <italic>vip3</italic> plants relative to wild-type, with the shortest genes analyzed showing little or no relative H3 loss, and genes with transcribed regions &#x0003e;1 kb in length showing significant (P&#x0003c;0.0001) H3 depletion throughout the transcribed region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000077-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Although these effects were slight when analyzed on a genome level, our results suggests plant Paf1C may have transcription-dependent activity in maintaining H3 and/or nucleosomal density, especially in long genes.</p><p>For subsequent analysis of H3K4me3, H3K36me2, or H3K27me3, we expressed signal values relative to total H3 signal. For H3K4me3 and H3K36me2, signals showed a similar pattern at the chromosomal level, being generally above the genomic median in gene-rich chromosome arms and below the genomic median in heterochromatic regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000077.s001">Figure S1</xref> and data not shown). Considering only protein-coding genes, H3K4me3 increased in the promoter region, peaked near the TSS, and decreased throughout most of the body of the genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000077-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, H3K36me2 showed an increase throughout the transcribed regions, peaking near the end of the transcribed regions. Transposon-related/pseudogenes showed depletion of both modifications throughout the extent of the transcribed regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000077-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Further analysis of genes within expression percentile bins revealed a striking relationship between the enrichment for H3K4me3 or H3K36me2 and transcriptional activity. For example, those genes included in Bin 10, which exhibited the top 10&#x00025; of expression values, also exhibited the highest peak of H3K4me3 modification near the TSS, whereas those genes with the lowest expression levels showed no obvious peak (Bins 1&#x02013;3) or only a subtle peak (Bin 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000077-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). For H3K36me2, genes included in Bins 8 and 9 showed the strongest 3&#x02032; peaks, Bin 10 genes showed slightly lower peaks, and genes in Bins 1&#x02013;4 exhibited low levels of signal throughout the transcriptional unit with no apparent 3&#x02032; peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000077-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Peaks of these two H3 modifications also varied with gene length. When H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 were plotted for genes representing each of five length-assigned bins, the longest genes (Bins 4 and 5, containing genes with transcribed regions &#x0003e;3 kb) displayed the strongest H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 signals at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends, respectively, whereas Bin 2 (1&#x02013;2 kb) showed only weak peak signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000077-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). For genes &#x0003e;2 kb in length, the peak of H3K4me3 occurred in a &#x0223c;1-kb region at the 5&#x02032; end of genes, independent of gene length, whereas the H3K36me2 peak occupied the 3&#x02032; &#x0223c;one-half of genes, being much broader in longer genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000077-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

Instead, loss of plant Paf1C led to redistribution of these modifications within genes: a 3&#x02032; shift in the distribution of H3K4me3 and 5&#x02032; shift in the distribution of H3K36me2. In yeast, the spatially restricted pattern of genic methyl-K4 and methyl-K36 is thought to depend on the transition from Ser5-phosphorylation to Ser2-phosphorylation within the heptapeptide repeat of the PolII CTD and recruitment of Set1 and Set2, a mechanism that requires Paf1C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000077-Sims1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. If an analogous mechanism linking PolII with these chromatin modifications exists in plants, then a plausible explanation for the general spreading of both H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 within genes in <italic>vip3</italic> mutants is an irregular transition from the Ser-5 to Ser-2 phosphorylated form of PolII.

What are the distinguishing features of genes whose expression is dependent on plant Paf1C activity? Here, we showed that genes either positively or negatively regulated by plant Paf1C were generally enriched in H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K36me2. We observed some distinction in the degree and pattern of enhanced H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 enrichment between those genes misregulated in <italic>vip3</italic>, and those genes misregulated in <italic>vip5</italic> or <italic>vip6</italic>. This may be attributed to the fact that our gene expression information for <italic>vip5</italic> and <italic>vip6</italic> was archival and derived from plants of a slightly different developmental stage. The observation that both up- and down-regulated genes show similar chromatin profiles may be explained by the fact that some of these genes may be targeted by Paf1C only indirectly. If plant Paf1C primarily targets developmentally regulated genes, then genes positively or negatively regulated by these genes would also be expected to show developmental regulation and accordant chromatin signatures.</p><p>The apparent co-occurrence of H3K4me3/H3K36me2 and H3K27me3 domains seen in these genes may result from the net observation of distinct chromatins marked predominantly by H3K4me3/H3K36me2 (in cells where the gene is mostly active) or by H3K27me3 (in cells where the gene is repressed). Another possibility, not mutually exclusive, is that these modifications could be juxtaposed within contiguous chromatin, as seen for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in numerous developmentally important genes in mammalian embryonic stem (ES) cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000077-Bernstein2">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>. In ES cells, this so-called H3K4me3/H3K27me3 bivalent domain has been considered as a mechanism to facilitate switching from a repressed to active state, and can resolve to a H3K4me3-dominated or H3K27me3-dominated signature in differentiated cells where the locus is active or repressed, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000077-Bernstein2">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000077-Mikkelsen1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Chromatin Dynamics at the <italic>FLC</italic> Gene</title><p>The MADS-box gene <italic>FLC</italic> is promoted through a mechanism involving Paf1C during early plant development, and is targeted for repression by a PRC2-like mechanism in response to cold. In wild-type plants, the <italic>FLC</italic> locus showed H3 modification profiles typical for Paf1C-regulated genes: high levels of H3K4me3 at the 5&#x02032; end, relatively low enrichment for H3K36me2 at the 3&#x02032; end, and a domain of H3K27me3 enrichment throughout much of the transcribed region. However, unlike other genes whose expression is promoted by plant Paf1C, <italic>FLC</italic> exhibited a substantial further accumulation of H3K27me3 when silenced in mutant plants. This suggests a role for Paf1C in antagonizing PcG repression at this locus. Plant Paf1C may also function to antagonize silencing of the several additional known PcG targets, including genes with homeotic functions in flower development, and this could explain the misregulation of these genes and floral abnormalities seen in mutants for various Paf1C-related genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000077-Zhang3">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>How might such antagonism be mediated? One of several possibilities is that a role for Paf1C in linking transcription with H3K4/K36 methylation may be elaborated in higher eukaryotes through transcription-associated histone replacement, in which canonical H3 assembled into nascent chromatin is exchanged for &#x02018;variant&#x02019; histone H3 (H3.3, also called H3.2 in plants) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000077-Ahmad1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref> known to be enriched for methyl-K4 and/or methyl-K36 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000077-Johnson1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000077-McKittrick1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref>. Random distribution of H3.3 nucleosomes during replication of active loci would result in a relatively high proportion of methyl-K4-modified H3.3 in nascent chromatin. This content may be further increased during pioneering rounds of transcription through Set1-like H3K4 methyltransferase activity, effectively resetting chromatin to the active state. In contrast, nascent chromatin at silenced loci is expected to be enriched for nucleosomes containing canonical H3, known to be preferentially modified by methyl-H3K27 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000077-Johnson1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>. H3K27me3 occupancy may be actively reinforced, or passively sustained by modification of canonical H3 in nascent chromatin upon successive replication events. Disrupting Paf1C, and thus the linkage between transcription and H3K4 methylation, would negatively influence resetting of chromatin to the active state and shift the balance of modification to H3K27me3. For some genes, such as <italic>FLC</italic>, even a small disruption of such a balance may then have qualitative effects on chromatin structure and expression.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation</title><p>Antibodies specific for histone H3 or H3 modifications were as follows: anti-H3-CT (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY; catalog no. 07-690), anti-H3 K4me3 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA; catalog no. ab8580), anti-H3 K36me2 (Upstate 07-369), and anti-H3 K27me3 (Upstate 07-449).
