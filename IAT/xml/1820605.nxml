Most of these deaths are caused by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum,</italic> which is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. These insects inject a form of the parasite known as sporozoites into people that replicates inside liver cells without causing symptoms. Four to five days later, merozoites (another form of the parasite) are released from the liver cells and invade red blood cells. Here, they replicate 10-fold before bursting out and infecting other red blood cells. This massive increase in parasite burden causes malaria's flu-like symptoms. If untreated, it also causes anemia (a red blood cell deficit) and damages the brain and other organs where parasitized red blood cells sequester. Malaria can be treated with antimalarial drugs and partly prevented by reducing the chances of being bitten by an infected mosquito. In addition, researchers are developing vaccines designed to reduce the global burden of malaria. These contain individual malaria antigens (proteins from the parasite that stimulate an immune response) that should, when injected into people, prime the immune system so that it can rapidly control malaria infections.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>The development of an effective malaria vaccine is not easy, in part because people can be simultaneously infected with several parasite strains. These often carry different variants (alleles) of the genes encoding antigens, which means that the actual parasite proteins might differ from the ones used for vaccination. If this is the case, the immune response generated by the vaccine might be less effective or even ineffective. An ideal vaccine would therefore stimulate an immune response that recognizes all these strain-specific antigens. However, little is known about their distribution in parasite populations in malarial regions, or about how this distribution changes over time (its dynamics). This information is needed to aid vaccine design and development. In this study, the researchers have investigated the distribution and dynamics of genetic variants of a merozoite antigen called MSP-1<sub>19</sub>, which is included in a vaccine currently being tested in Mali, West Africa. Although most of the MSP-1<sub>19</sub> sequence is conserved, it contains six strain-specific polymorphisms (genetic variations); the candidate vaccine contains MSP-1<sub>19</sub> from the 3D7 strain of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content>.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers used rapid DNA sequencing (pyrosequencing) to examine the MSP-1<sub>19</sub> sequence in more than 1,300 malaria infections in 100 Malian children. They compared the frequencies of 14 MSP-1<sub>19</sub> haplotypes (sets of polymorphisms at the six variant sites) over three years, in three age groups, and in consecutive infections within individuals. They found that the frequency of individual MSP-1<sub>19</sub> haplotypes fluctuated in their study population but that those found in <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> FVO and FUP strains were always the commonest, each being present in about 40&#x00025; of the infections. By contrast, the <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> 3D7 MSP-1<sub>19</sub> haplotype was present in only 16&#x00025; of the infections. They also found that mixed infections were more common at the start of each malaria season and in older individuals. In addition, individuals who were infected repeatedly by parasites from different strains (with different MSP-1<sub>19</sub> variants) seemed to get sick with malaria more often than those infected multiple times by the same strain. The differences might, therefore, be important in determining the specificity of the immune response to MSP-1<sub>19</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings indicate that most parasites that cause malaria at the Malian test site for the malaria vaccine that contains 3D7-specific MSP-1<sub>19</sub> have a different form of MSP-1<sub>19</sub>. Although early results from field trials suggest that the 3D7-derived vaccine provides some protection against the more common FVO and FUP strains, the immunity stimulated by the vaccine might be mainly allele specific. If this turns out to be the case, these results suggest that a FVO- or FUP-derived vaccine might be more effective in Mali than the 3D7-derived vaccine, though not necessarily elsewhere. More generally, these results show the importance of determining the genetics of pathogen populations before starting vaccine trials. Without this information, a vaccine's ability to prevent infections with specific parasite strains cannot be determined accurately and potentially useful vaccines might be abandoned if they are tested in inappropriate populations. Importantly, baseline information of this sort will also allow vaccine developers to detect any vaccine-induced changes in the pathogen population that might affect the long-term efficacy of their vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040093">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040093</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A related <italic>PLoS Medicine</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0040116">Perspective</ext-link> by Colin Sutherland discusses variation in malaria antigens as a challenge in vaccine development</p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microbiology.umaryland.edu/faculty/default.asp?ID=130">malaria program</ext-link> of the University of Maryland Center for Vaccine Development performs research on many aspects of malaria</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information on malaria and the development of vaccines is available from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.malariavaccine.org">Malaria Vaccine Initiative</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/topics/malaria">World Health Organization</ext-link> provides links to general information on malaria plus some specific information on malaria vaccine development</p></list-item><list-item><p>MedlinePlus encyclopedia has entries on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000621.htm">malaria</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002024.htm">vaccination</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</ext-link> provides information for patients and professionals on malaria</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/topics/malaria">US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</ext-link> has information on malaria, including research into vaccines</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Takala SL, Coulibaly D, Thera MA, Dicko A, Smith DL, et al.

However, the extensive genetic diversity and rapid evolution of these viruses could lead to the generation of vaccine-resistant strains. Malaria vaccine developers may face similar challenges.</p><p>Several subunit malaria vaccines in clinical development are based on merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1), the major protein on the surface of the extracellular blood stage of the parasite. The protein is synthesized as a 190 kDa precursor, which undergoes proteolytic cleavage into four fragments that remain on the surface of the merozoite as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored complex. Prior to erythrocyte invasion, the entire MSP-1 complex is shed, except for the C-terminal 19 kDa (MSP-1<sub>19</sub>), which remains on the merozoite's surface as it enters the erythrocyte &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040093-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our results contrast with the temporal changes observed in 138 isolates from Brazil, where in 1985&#x02013;1986 the FUP haplotype was absent and the 3D7 haplotype was present in 40&#x00025; of samples collected, but in 1997&#x02013;1998 the FUP haplotype was more common than 3D7 (37&#x00025; versus 10&#x00025;, respectively) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040093-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. These different patterns may reflect true differences in haplotype dynamics in these locations, but may also have resulted from differences in sample size, sampling interval, and study duration.</p><p>It is possible that the stability of MSP-1<sub>19</sub> polymorphism prevalences in Mali might be due to balancing selection acting to maintain genetic diversity at this locus, as has been demonstrated for other regions of MSP-1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040093-b040">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040093-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. If vaccine-induced immunity is allele specific, then vaccination could disturb this equilibrium, imposing directional selection that favors alleles not targeted by the vaccine. Such directional selection could induce changes in haplotype frequency and cause a reduction in vaccine efficacy over time, although this effect would likely be diluted by the substantial parasite population maintained in unvaccinated older children and adults. By decreasing the effective population size, vaccination could also increase the effect of genetic drift in the parasite population, resulting in decreased stability of haplotype frequencies. Use of insecticide-treated nets or prolonged effective drug treatment might be expected to have the same effect.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Genetic Diversity and Malaria Epidemiology</title><p>Although MOI based on MSP-1<sub>19</sub> is likely an underestimate of true MOI, the observed pattern of greater MOI in older individuals is in agreement with studies that have documented similar associations between MOI and age &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040093-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040093-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. It has been hypothesized that fevers experienced during clinical malaria episodes may play a role in clearing parasitemia in younger children, while older children and adults have acquired immunity that limits disease but does not clear genotypes below the threshold of detection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040093-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040093-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. This hypothesis is consistent with the epidemiology of malaria in this area of Mali, where there is a lower incidence of symptomatic infection in individuals aged 11 years or more. However, the increased MOI in this group could also be due to less frequent treatment. Whatever the cause, these data emphasize the possibility that older children and adults serve as an important reservoir of genetic diversity.</p><p>MOI was highest at the beginning of the transmission season and decreased over the course of the transmission season, particularly in the two younger age groups. This initial decrease in MOI may be due to an increase in clinical malaria episodes that lead to drug treatment and clearance of parasites, followed by a continued decrease in MOI as EIR drops after the rains cease in October. Since vaccination could reduce MOI, as it has in previous malaria vaccine trials &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040093-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040093-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040093-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;, it is important to document the reduced frequency of mixed infections over the course of the transmission season at this site to allow these natural fluctuations to be distinguished from the effects of a vaccine.</p><p>The associations between MOI, age, and time do not appear to be confounded by parasite density, though the data suggest that MOI is higher in infections with moderate parasitemias. The apparent decrease in MOI in higher-parasitemia infections may reflect the rapid growth of a disease-causing parasite clone overtaking the infection and masking the presence of minor alleles.</p><p>This study also demonstrated a reduced frequency of three specific MSP-1<sub>19</sub> haplotypes in symptomatic infections compared to asymptomatic infections, including one haplotype (ETSSRL &#x0005b;3D7&#x0005d;) currently being targeted for vaccines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040093-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. This association appears to be due to these haplotypes having a higher prevalence in low parasitemia infections. Vaccination against haplotypes associated with favorable clinical outcomes instead of those associated with poor clinical outcomes could result in increased morbidity and mortality in the human population. Although analyses of the within-host dynamics of MSP-1<sub>19</sub> diversity suggest that a change in amino acid at specific residues may be more important than having any particular haplotype, it will be important to examine the association between MSP-1<sub>19</sub> haplotypes and clinical malaria in other endemic regions and in the context of genome-wide analyses to determine whether these three haplotypes are inherently less virulent (or are linked to important virulence factors) or whether these associations are an artifact of the haplotype dynamics at this particular site.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This molecular epidemiology study provides information needed to accurately measure and interpret population responses to an MSP-1-based malaria vaccine in clinical trials of vaccine efficacy. It also provides insight into which MSP-1<sub>19</sub> polymorphisms may be most relevant to cross-protective immunity and thus informs vaccine design. If immunity elicited by such a vaccine is allele specific, a vaccine derived from either the FVO or FUP strain might have better initial efficacy in settings where these MSP-1<sub>19</sub> haplotypes predominate and haplotypes corresponding to the leading vaccine strain, 3D7, are less frequent. Given the polymorphic nature of vaccine antigens for <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> and other genetically diverse pathogens, it is important to monitor pathogen populations before, during, and after introduction of vaccines to determine vaccine efficacy at the molecular level and to detect potential vaccine-induced changes in the pathogen population that could compromise vaccine efficacy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The sequence of <italic>msp-1</italic> from the 3D7 strain of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> was published with the <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> genome sequence and can be found under GenBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) accession number XM&#x0005f;001352134.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the population of Bandiagara, Mali for their continued participation in our studies, as well as the regional and district health authorities of Bandiagara, Mali for their continued support.
