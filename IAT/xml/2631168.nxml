Mutations in the gene for MyBP-C are the second most frequent cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. MyBP-C binds to myosin with two binding sites, one at its C-terminus and another at its N-terminus. The N-terminal binding site, consisting of immunoglobulin domains C1 and C2 connected by a flexible linker, interacts with the S2 segment of myosin in a phosphorylation-regulated manner. It is assumed that the function of MyBP-C is to act as a tether that fixes the S1 heads in a resting position and that phosphorylation releases the S1 heads into an active state. Here, we report the structure and binding properties of domain C1. Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and NMR interaction experiments, we identified the binding site of domain C1 in the immediate vicinity of the S1&#x02013;S2 hinge, very close to the light chains. In addition, we identified a zinc binding site on domain C1 in close proximity to the S2 binding site. Its zinc binding affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of approximately 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) might not be sufficient for a physiological effect. However, the familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-related mutation of one of the zinc ligands, glutamine 210 to histidine, will significantly increase the binding affinity, suggesting that this mutation may affect S2 binding. The close proximity of the C1 binding site to the hinge, the light chains and the S1 heads also provides an explanation for recent observations that (a) shorter fragments of MyBP-C unable to act as a tether still have an effect on the actomyosin ATPase and (b) as to why the myosin head positions in phosphorylated wild-type mice and MyBP-C knockout mice are so different: Domain C1 bound to the S1&#x02013;S2 hinge is able to manipulate S1 head positions, thus influencing force generation without tether. The potentially extensive extra interactions of C1 are expected to keep it in place, while phosphorylation dislodges the C1&#x02013;C2 linker and domain C2. As a result, the myosin heads would always be attached to a tether that has phosphorylation-dependent length regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>MyBP-C, myosin binding protein C</kwd><kwd>FHC, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</kwd><kwd>WTWT, wild type</kwd><kwd>IgI, immunoglobulin I</kwd><kwd>C1C2, C1&#x02013;linker&#x02013;C2</kwd><kwd>NOE, nuclear Overhauser enhancement</kwd><kwd>MD, molecular dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>domain C1</kwd><kwd>NMR spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>model building</kwd><kwd>mutagenesis</kwd><kwd>protein structure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The regulation of muscle contraction depends on the precise interaction in time and space of a large number of proteins. In vertebrate cardiac muscle, the prime means of regulation is achieved by the well-established calcium-dependent steric blocking and unblocking of the myosin binding site on actin by the troponin&#x02013;tropomyosin complex. Unlike skeletal muscle, where force is regulated by recruitment of activated fibres, modulation of the force levels in the electrically coupled cardiomyocytes occurs by posttranslational modification of regulatory proteins, especially phospholamban and troponin I.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> More recently, several proteins that provide an additional level of control in a more indirect and subtle manner have emerged. Among these is the cardiac isoform of myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C).<xref rid="bib2 bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2&#x02013;4</sup></xref> MyBP-C belongs to the family of sarcomeric multidomain proteins that also includes titin, myomesin and obscurin, all of which are believed to play an important role in the assembly of different components of the sarcomere&#x02014;modulation of contractile properties and mechanical strain sensing.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> For MyBP-C, more and more data suggesting its more prominent role in the regulation of muscle contraction are accumulating. Binding of the N-terminal portion of MyBP-C to myosin close to the S1 head<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> is generally accepted to hold back the myosin heads and thus reduce their ability for interaction with actin as observed by X-ray fibre diffraction and electron microscopy<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a for illustration). Tethering of the S1 heads via MyBP-C to the rest of the thick filament reduces force development,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> which returns to normal once the tether is released upon phosphorylation of MyBP-C<xref rid="bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9,10</sup></xref> (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). Malfunction of MyBP-C caused by missense or truncation mutations is a well-known cause of cardiomyopathies.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> After myosin itself, mutations in MyBP-C are the second most frequent cause of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC), suggesting that MyBP-C does indeed play a vital role in cardiac function.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> A vital yet subtle role for MyBP-C in the regulation of cardiac muscle was confirmed by the analysis of knockout mice.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> It was found that the overall structure of the sarcomere was unaffected, suggesting that MyBP-C is not required for sarcomere assembly, yet the knockout mice displayed symptoms of cardiac hypertrophy. Detailed studies of the structure of the thick filament revealed small rearrangements of the myosin heads but no significant change in diameter.<xref rid="bib13 bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13,14</sup></xref> The latter finding is surprising because large changes have been observed as a result of phosphorylation,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> which is thought to dislodge the MyBP-C N-terminus from its binding site on S2.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> If MyBP-C functions mainly as a tether, then the arrangements of myosin heads should be comparable in phosphorylated wild-type (WT) and knockout mice. The fact that they are very different suggests MyBP-C functionality beyond that of a mere tether. A more direct influence of the N-terminus of MyBP-C on muscle contraction is indeed supported by recent observations. Several studies showed that N-terminal fragments too short to perform the tethering function nevertheless had a significant effect on myocardial contraction<xref rid="bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16,17</sup></xref> (possible interpretations illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b and c).</p><p>The N-terminal myosin binding site of cardiac MyBP-C consists of two immunoglobulin I (IgI) domains,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> C1 and C2, connected by an &#x0223c;&#x000a0;100-residue linker of unknown structure containing the phosphorylation sites. We recently determined the structure and mapped the binding site of domain C2 on myosin S2 using a shortened fragment of S2, S2&#x00394;, giving a first glimpse of the mode of binding of these two proteins and how mutations related to FHC can interfere.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Here, we extend our investigation of this interaction by determining the structure of domain C1 and locating its binding site on myosin S2. The results of our study on the binding of C1 and C2 to myosin S2 are combined in a model for the interaction that agrees well with current understanding of this system and its perturbation by mutations in MyBP-C or myosin S2. The location of domains C1 and C2 is also highly suggestive as an explanation of how the N-terminus of MyBP-C alone can affect myosin activity.<xref rid="bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16,17</sup></xref> Furthermore, our work shows that most FHC-related point mutations do not abolish the MyBP-C-myosin interaction but weaken it, reflecting the general observation that FHC-related mutations in MyBP-C lead to late-onset FHC with generally good prognosis.</p></sec><sec id="sec1"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Structure of domain C1</title><p>The overall quality of the NMR structure is apparent by the excellent agreement of the 29 structures shown superimposed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a, giving an overall backbone RMSD of 0.6&#x000a0;&#x000c5;. The only region with modest disorder is around the last C-terminal residues, which are already part of the linker that connects C1 to C2. The domain folds as expected into an all-&#x003b2;-sheet structure of the IgI fold,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> apparent in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b. Here, the structure is shown as a cartoon in the same orientation as in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a. Four strands, ABED, form the first sheet and the remaining five, C&#x02032;CFGA&#x02032;, form the second sheet, which are assembled in a &#x003b2;-sandwich structure. The CD loop in domain C1 is slightly extended compared with other IgI domains in MyBP-C (see <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>). The extra residues fold into a very compact structure, very close to a single turn of an &#x003b1;-helix. The turn is supported by an &#x003b1;-helix type of hydrogen bond between the amide group of Val203 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Leu199.</p></sec><sec><title>Zn binding of C1</title><p>Close inspection of the structure of C1 revealed the presence of a zinc binding site formed by residues Gln208, His210, Glu223 and His225. These four residues are arranged in a neat square right in the centre of the A&#x02032;BED &#x003b2;-sheet (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a), two on &#x003b2;-strand D and two on &#x003b2;-strand E, in a manner similar to other zinc binding sites on the surface of &#x003b2;-sheets.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Titrations of <sup>15</sup>N-labelled protein with ZnCl<sub>2</sub> were performed and monitored with the use of fast-heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence spectra to experimentally ascertain the ability of domain C1 to bind zinc.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Large chemical shift perturbations were observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b) for two main regions, residues 208&#x02013;213 and residues 223&#x02013;230, covering very well the predicted zinc binding site. The largest chemical shift perturbations were seen for the two histidines in the predicted binding site, suggesting strong zinc coordination by these two residues (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c). A zinc atom was positioned in the binding site followed by energy minimisation in AMBER<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> using standard zinc parameters<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> to test the relevance for further ligands. The resulting distances suggest that the zinc is coordinated by four ligands&#x02014;Gln208, His210, Glu223 and His225. Interestingly, the residues with the largest chemical shift perturbations are titrating in the slow-exchange regime, suggesting a slow off rate and thus reasonably tight binding (spectra for representative residues are shown in <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S2</xref>). Titration curves plotted for some residues close to the binding site in fast exchange are used for analysis of binding affinity, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>d. Fitting these curves leads to a dissociation constant in the range of 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, in good agreement between these residues.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding of C1 to myosin S2&#x00394;</title><p>To probe the binding of C1 to S2&#x00394;, we followed essentially the same approach previously described for domain cC2.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> A transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy two-dimensional <sup>15</sup>N&#x02013;<sup>1</sup>H spectrum of C1 was recorded in the absence and in the presence of a 4-fold excess of S2&#x00394; (examples are shown for several representative residues in <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S3</xref>). To identify the binding site of S2&#x00394; on C1, we plotted the chemical shift differences for all assigned residues against the sequence of C1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, top, blue curve). In this plot, three regions of chemical shift perturbations clearly stand out: the region around strands C, C&#x02032;, the CD loop and parts of strand D; the EF loop and part of &#x003b2;-strand E; and the last three residues of &#x003b2;-strand G. Most prominent as individual residues are Lys195 and Trp196. Mapping of the significant chemical shift perturbations on the surface of the structure of C1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a) shows that the three regions, although disconnected in the sequence, come together in the three-dimensional structure. These residues form a continuous surface covering most of the C-terminal half, from the CD loop onward.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of FHC-related mutations in C1 on binding to myosin</title><p>Several point mutations linked to FHC have been identified in domain C1 of cardiac MyBP-C. They are shown mapped on the structure of the domain in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>d. For completeness, known polymorphisms are also indicated. Among these is residue 236, which in the construct used in this work is actually a glycine.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> It is worth noting that most polymorphisms in human cardiac C1 are found in other isoforms or species, confirming their compatibility with the structure and function of C1 (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>). In contrast, the majority of residues where mutations correlate with disease are highly conserved, at least in the cardiac isoform (e.g., Arg177, Tyr237 or Val256). Most of the FHC-related mutations affecting exposed amino acids cluster toward the C-terminus of the domain (on the right side of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>c). A smaller cluster of FHC-related mutants is formed on the ABED sheet, close to the &#x003b2;-bulge in strand A and far away from the S2&#x00394; binding site. The correlation of most FHC-linked mutations with the location of the binding site of S2&#x00394; suggests that at least the solvent-exposed amino acids might contribute to FHC by interfering with protein interactions. To investigate this hypothesis, we selected two mutants from this region, Asp228 to asparagine, representing exposed charged residues in the binding site for S2&#x00394;, and Tyr237 to serine, representing mutations of non-exposed amino acids close to the binding site. Tyr237 is strongly conserved, and part of the hydrophobic core and its replacement by a serine would remove substantial hydrophobic contacts, leading to destabilisation of the fold. In contrast, there is no indication that the replacement of Asp228 with asparagine will affect the structure. The different expectations for the effects of both mutants on the structure of C1 were confirmed by expression trials of both mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). C1 Asp228Asn expressed extremely well as a soluble protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, lane 1). In contrast, Tyr237Ser did not express as a soluble protein at all (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, lane 2). Efforts to refold this mutant from inclusion bodies failed repeatedly. As a result, only Asp228Asn could be studied with respect to binding to S2&#x00394;.</p><p>The Asp228Asn mutant of C1 is still capable of binding to S2&#x00394; (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, top, green curve), with almost the full chemical shift perturbations around Trp196 as in WT. In contrast, in the other two regions of largest chemical shift perturbations in WT, residues around His210 on strand D and those in the EF loop around Gln230, there is very little response to binding. Also, the three amino acids at the C-terminus show hardly any response (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>b). Asp228 is located right in the middle of the EF loop, such that its mutation to asparagine, leading to the loss of negative charge, might lead to an almost complete lack of binding ability in this part of the interface. The Asp228Asn mutant of C1 is still able to bind, albeit with only part of its interface and consequently substantially reduced affinity.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of FHC-related mutations in S2&#x00394; on binding to MyBP-C domain C1</title><p>A large number of point mutations contributing to the development of FHC have been identified in myosin (for databases, see <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>; a summary on the structure of S2&#x00394; is given in <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S4</xref>). Previously, use of point mutations has been successful in mapping the binding site of MyBP-C domain C2 in the vicinity of Arg870.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> We therefore used the same approach in the hope that an FHC-related point mutation might be linked to the disease by interfering with the binding of domain C1. The initial focus was on the cluster of eight mutations of exposed amino acids between residues 921 and 935. The majority are either charge inversions or charge changes, suggesting the cluster to be a potential protein&#x02013;protein interaction site. Furthermore, the S2&#x00394; mutant Glu924Lys was shown to abolish binding to an MyBP-C fragment containing domain C1.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> However, binding experiments of isolated C1 with two representative mutants, Glu924Lys and Glu935Lys, led to chemical shift perturbations indistinguishable from those of WT S2&#x00394; (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, bottom). As this region was the only clearly discernible cluster of mutations in addition to the region around Arg870, we opted to systematically mutate exposed residues mutated in FHC. The first mutations tested were Glu846Lys and Glu894Gly, the former being an FHC-related mutation in S2&#x00394; and the latter being a representative of a mini-cluster of mutants immediately following the C2 binding site. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, top and bottom, shows that the chemical shift perturbations of C1 in a mixture with S2&#x00394; Glu894Gly are virtually identical with those observed with the WT of S2&#x00394;. In marked contrast, mutant Glu846Lys led to a significant reduction in the chemical shift perturbations. This reduction is non-uniform, with perturbations around residues 190&#x02013;210 comprising the CD loop and the D-strand dropping significantly, even to almost noise level for some residues in the D-strand (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>c). In contrast, perturbations around the EF loop were much closer to those observed for the WT. C1 thus binds to S2&#x00394; around residue Glu846, but binding of C1 to the S2&#x00394; E846K mutant is not completely abolished but severely compromised.</p></sec><sec><title>Model of C1 bound to S2&#x00394;</title><p>Expanding the previous model of C2 bound to S2&#x00394;,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> we produced a model of the complex of C1&#x02013;linker&#x02013;C2 (C1C2) with S2&#x00394;. Use of the entire minimal binding site of MyBP-C for S2 should aid in identifying a realistic binding mode. Based on the FHC-related mutation S2&#x00394; Glu846Lys, which led to a significant reduction in binding, domain C1 was modelled to be in contact with this amino acid on S2&#x00394;, very close to the start of the S2 region at Pro838. The interface in the model is formed by C1 aligning with its &#x003b2;-strands almost in line with the main axis of the coiled coil. The slope created by the crossing helices is well covered in shape by the extended loops at the C-terminus of C1, which generate an interface of complementary shape (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a). This arrangement covers most of the amino acids with significant chemical shift perturbations in the C1&#x02013;S2&#x00394; interaction experiments very well. At the heart of the interface sits the residue with the largest chemical shift perturbations, Trp196. Together with Ala232, it forms a small hydrophobic patch that packs to Phe856 and Met852 on S2&#x00394;. Furthermore, the backbone oxygen of Trp196 makes a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Arg845. The rest of the interface is composed of polar interactions, even though the charge distribution is much more mixed compared with the C2&#x02013;S2&#x00394; interface.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Right next to the Trp196 is Lys195, which forms an ionic bridge and/or a hydrogen bond with Glu848. The previous residue, Gly194, forms a hydrogen bond with its backbone oxygen to the side chain of Lys847. On the other side of the central tryptophan, Asp198 interacts with Lys841 via an ionic bridge and/or a hydrogen bond. Lys202 in the following single turn of &#x003b1;-helix forms another ionic bridge and/or a hydrogen bond with Glu844. At the end of the CD loop, Gln205 makes a hydrogen bond with Glu846 and potentially with Lys847. The final residue on this stretch of protein involved in the interface is His206, which forms a hydrogen bond with Glu846. In the EF loop, Gln230 forms hydrogen bonds with Glu854. Importantly, Asp228 forms an ionic bridge and/or a hydrogen bond with Lys853, which will be significantly weakened in the FHC-causing Asp228Asn mutant. Finally, the very last residue of C1, Glu258, is positioned to make a hydrogen bond with Thr857.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Structure of domain C1</title><p>The structure of C1 conforms to the well-established pattern for the IgI fold,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> including the once controversial C&#x02032;-strand.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> A single-turn &#x003b1;-helix is introduced through a small extension of the CD loop, a feature unique to domain C1 and seen in the NMR structure of the slow skeletal isoform of domain C1 as well [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code <ext-link xlink:href="2dav" ext-link-type="gen">2dav</ext-link>; <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S5</xref>].

The only structural differences are found in the termini and some loops (e.g., the BC loop). In the crystal structure, the first five residues extend away from the protein, stabilised by crystal contacts while they pack tightly to the rest of the protein in the NMR structure. The most similar structures found through a DALI search<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> in the PDB are those of the slow skeletal muscle isoform of human MyBP-C, the well known telokin and the first and second IgI domains of human cardiac titin. Cardiac and slow skeletal isoforms of domain C1 share a sequence identity of 53% (for more details, see <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>) such that a highly similar structure is not surprising. Main sequence differences exist in the BC loop, the EF loop and close to the C-terminus (see <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>). These variations are reflected in the structure where the BC loop is packing very closely to the N-terminus in the cardiac isoform, whereas it is shifted toward the DE hairpin in the slow skeletal isoform. Overall, however, the structures are extremely similar such that the substantial sequence divergence between the isoforms has no impact on the detailed structure. This is not surprising, as most of the conserved amino acids are the key hydrophobic residues important for determining the fold.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Most of the divergent amino acids are found on the surface of the protein, suggesting subtle functional differences (e.g., with regard to binding partners).</p></sec><sec><title>Zinc binding of C1</title><p>The zinc binding site exhibits very similar structure and topology in employing two amino acids each on adjacent &#x003b2;-strands (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a) to a variety of otherwise completely unrelated structures.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> The arrangements of ligands are identical in the NMR and X-ray structures. Interestingly, the composition of amino acids in the binding site, His&#x02013;His&#x02013;Glu&#x02013;Gln, is typical of zinc binding in metalloenzyme active sites. Taken together with the appreciable binding affinity in the lower micromolar range, this makes C1 a <italic>bona fide</italic> zinc binding domain. Zinc binding in enzyme active sites occurs with affinities from picomolar to micromolar,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> while it is even higher when it fulfils a structural role.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> In the context of cardiac muscle, however, the presence of a zinc binding site with micromolar affinity is surprising. Measurements of free zinc concentration in rat cardiac muscle show values of less than 1&#x000a0;nM, even under extreme cell stress,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> such that the affinity of C1 is too low to bind zinc <italic>in vivo</italic>. One could make some allowance for the underestimation of binding affinities by NMR spectroscopy and for different zinc concentrations in human cardiac muscle compared with rat, but a variation by several orders of magnitude seems unlikely. Given the usual specificity of zinc binding sites, it is also unlikely that this binding site could bind other metals. Instead, we expect the zinc binding site to become physiologically relevant by the mutation of Gln208 to histidine, which is linked to FHC by an as yet unknown mechanism.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Gln208 is one of the four zinc-coordinating ligands and shows significant chemical shift perturbations in the zinc titration. However, glutamines are known to contribute much less as zinc ligands, such that a replacement by histidine is expected to strongly increase the affinity, which would allow for zinc binding in cardiac muscle. Because of the very low concentration of free zinc, even a modest sequestration of zinc might have pathological consequences. The effect could also be more direct because the zinc binding site partly overlaps with the S2&#x00394; binding site. As a result, having zinc bound in part of the S2&#x00394; binding site might influence the interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of C1C2 and S2&#x00394;</title><p>The results of the interaction experiments between C1 and S2&#x00394;, including the respective mutations, are well summarised in the model of the complex. The amino acids of C1 showing the largest chemical shift perturbations are well covered by the interface (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a) and involved in hydrogen bonds/ionic interactions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>b). This is only a model based on chemical shift perturbations combined with mutagenesis. Yet, many details agree well with the NMR observations and can explain why a number of residues mutated in FHC may cause the disease (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>b). Residue Glu846 is involved in a hydrogen bond and/or an ionic bridge and when replaced by a lysine will weaken the interaction considerably, in particular around the C-terminus of the CD loop (residues 202&#x02013;208), while the core interactions around W196 and the EF loop are maintained (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>b). Also, the last residue in the C1 construct, Glu258, is an FHC-related residue when mutated to lysine. In our model, Glu258 forms a hydrogen bond with Thr857, which will be abolished by a lysine. Even though this interaction was not investigated experimentally because Glu258 is not very well defined in the structure and not part of domain C1 but of the C1&#x02013;C2 linker, we can clearly reveal its importance in our model. It can be assumed that the nearby mutation His257Pro would have similar consequences. We do not see any direct interactions of His257 with S2&#x00394;, but a proline in its place would distort the backbone at this position, resulting in repositioning Glu258 in a manner not conducive to the interaction with Thr857. This mutation could also have long-range effects, because it is located in a place where C1 and C2 are almost in touching distance, exemplified by the interaction of Arg858 of S2&#x00394; with Asp431 in C2, right next to the interaction of Thr857 with Glu258 in C1.</p><p>The effects of the FHC-related mutations in C1 that were experimentally investigated here, Tyr237Ser and Asp228Asn, can also be explained in this context. While the mutation of Tyr237 to serine led to the unfolding of the domain, the other point mutation, Asp228Asn, did not interfere with folding at all, as expected. Instead, the Asp228Asn mutant severely weakened the interaction of C1 with S2&#x00394;, as would be expected based on our complex model. Asp228 forms an ionic bridge and/or a hydrogen bond with Lys853, which will be much weakened by replacing the negatively charged aspartate with an uncharged asparagine. The latter would still be able to form a hydrogen bond, but this interaction would be much weaker. This is confirmed by the chemical shift perturbations measured in the Asp228Asn mutant, where almost all chemical shift perturbations in the EF loop are absent, while binding is still maintained by the interactions made by the CD loop, as well as other parts of the binding site.</p><p>Intriguingly, two further solvent-exposed amino acids that are FHC related when mutated, Arg177Cys and Val219Leu, are distant from the S2&#x00394; binding site. Yet, being on the surface, it is unlikely that they would interfere with the domain stability like Tyr237Ser. This suggests that C1 could be involved in other interactions, as these residues are close together on a part of the surface pointing away from S2&#x00394;, which is thus accessible for other ligands. In our model, this part of the protein points toward the S1&#x02013;S2 junction close to the regulatory light chains. Hence, C1 could directly or indirectly be involved in an interaction with the myosin head group. This may provide us with a possible explanation why untethered N-terminal MyBP-C fragments have significant effects in motility assays,<xref rid="bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16,17</sup></xref> as illustrated in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>a.</p><p>In this work, we have modelled the position of both IgI domains of MyBP-C's N-terminal binding site on myosin that begs the question of the location of the linker (MyBP-C motif). Recently, the linker was proposed to be an IgI domain as well,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> which appears very unlikely, given the low sequence similarity of the linker sequence to Ig sequences. Furthermore, these observations are in direct contrast to our own NMR data on the whole C1C2 fragment, which show the linker to be completely unstructured (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>a). All residues of the linker are in the random-coil region of the spectrum. Additionally, in a heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) experiment, the highest value for residues in the linker was 0.2, while the residues of domains C1 and C2 had values around 0.8 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>b). One would expect residues in a rigid, well-folded domain to have values between 0.7 and 0.9, while values close to zero are indicative of almost complete freedom of motion as expected of an unfolded polypeptide chain. As both the small-angle X-ray scattering and our NMR experiments were performed with bacterially expressed protein, methodological differences in protein folding can be excluded. We therefore propose that the linker is unfolded in solution but adopts a compact shape, similar to other unstructured peptides (e.g., the extensively characterised &#x003b1;-synuclein). This protein is intrinsically unstructured yet has been shown by a variety of NMR methods to adopt a compact overall shape.<xref rid="bib33 bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33,34</sup></xref> This would enable it to adopt a more defined conformation upon binding to myosin. We do not have experimental data as yet about the binding mode of the linker but at least endeavoured to ensure that the positions of C1 and C2 in the model allow a location of the linker in accord with published interaction data. In our extended model (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>c), the positions of C1, C2 and the linker on S2 are indicated. The positions of C1 and C2 are such that the linker runs along S2 to reach the area around residue 930 of S2&#x00394;. Here, we find a cluster of FHC-related point mutations, one of which, E924K, makes binding of C1C2 to S2&#x00394; undetectable by isothermal titration calorimetry.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> As neither C2 binding nor C1 binding to S2&#x00394; is affected by this mutation, this part of S2&#x00394; likely interacts with part of the linker. The linker can easily reach this part of S2 in our model, even though we cannot make comments about detailed interactions. It is conceivable, however, that the linker does not adopt a precise, stable and rigid conformation with very specific interactions. Instead, the contribution from the linker to binding might come from general charge complementarity. Retaining a certain degree of mobility might add to complex stability by reducing the entropic penalty otherwise unavoidable for folding upon binding. This mode of binding is not unusual and has been observed (e.g., in the interaction of microbial proteins with host receptors).<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> The general charge matching would also suggest an explanation for the effect of phosphorylation upon binding: all three serines known to be phosphorylated<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> are positioned in the vicinity of negatively charged patches on the surface of S2. Phosphorylation would subsequently lead to increased charge repulsion and consequent destabilisation of the complex in accordance with experimental observations.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> That the linker/MyBP-C motif might bind alternative ligands when undergoing phosphorylation-induced conformational changes is another possibility to explore.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our combined NMR and mutagenesis data place the N-terminus of MyBP-C right on top of the S1&#x02013;S2 hinge and thus in immediate vicinity of the S1 head and the light chains. In this location, MyBP-C is able to directly interact with the hinge, potentially influencing the positioning of the S1 heads directly or indirectly via interactions with the light chains (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>a). Such an interaction could also involve the as yet relatively uncharacterised domain C0, which is specific for the cardiac isoform. The ability to manipulate the S1&#x02013;S2 junction would give MyBP-C the potential to directly adjust the position of the S1 heads and thus subtly influence muscle contraction. With further interactions possible for domains C1 and C0 in the S1/light chain region, one could expect that phosphorylation of the C1&#x02013;C2 linker does not dislodge the MyBP-C N-terminus completely. While the linker and possibly domain C2 will dissociate, the more N-terminal part might remain attached (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>b). The dissociation of a substantial part of polypeptide chain will allow the release of the myosin head and facilitate actomyosin cross-bridge formation. At the same time, the remaining part of MyBP-C is well positioned to exert a subtle influence on the position of the S1 heads. Maintaining a loosely tethered state would also be useful through increasing the probability of rebinding once the C1&#x02013;C2 linker is dephosphorylated and the S1 heads need to return to their resting positions. The myosin heads are thus never taken off the leash, but the length of the leash is adjusted by phosphorylation. As such, our data provide a good explanation for the observations that MyBP-C has functions beyond those of a simple tether and that its influence on the structure of the S1 heads is more complex than can be explained by a simple on/off model driven by phosphorylation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Sample preparation</title><p>Domain C1 of human cardiac MyBP-C (residues 151&#x02013;258 of UniProt entry <ext-link xlink:href="Q14896/MYBPC3_HUMAN" ext-link-type="gen">Q14896/MYBPC3_HUMAN</ext-link>) was cloned as previously described<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> into pET8c vector.

In this interpretation, the N-terminus directly affects the orientation of the myosin head group, indicated by the arrows.
