An important inducer of inflammation underlying both syndromes is the cellular recognition of bacterial products through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We identified a novel antagonistic mAb (named 1A6) that recognizes the extracellular portion of the TLR4&#x02013;MD-2 complex. If applied to mice before infection with clinical isolates of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> or <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and subsequent antibiotic therapy, 1A6 prevented otherwise fatal shock, whereas application of 1A6 after infection was ineffective. In contrast, coapplication of 1A6 and an anti-TLR2 mAb up to 4 h after infection with Gram-negative bacteria, in combination with the start of antibiotic therapy (mimicking clinical conditions), provided robust protection. Consistent with our findings in mice, dual blockade of TLR2 and TLR4 inhibited TNF-&#x003b1; release from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells upon Gram-negative bacterial infection/antibiotic therapy. Both murine splenocytes and human PBMCs released IFN-&#x003b3; in a TLR4-dependent manner, leading to enhanced surface TLR2 expression and sensitivity for TLR2 ligands. Our results implicate TLR2 as an important, TLR4-driven sensor of Gram-negative bacterial infection and provide a rationale for blockade of both TLRs, in addition to antibiotic therapy for the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infection.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>S.

Gram-negative and -positive bacterial infections are the major causes of sepsis, which is characterized by extension of local infection to the systemic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Typical early findings include high serum concentrations of cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;. The early phase of sepsis is followed by endocrine and cardiovascular dysregulation, often triggering fatal septic shock. Evidence of a link between the initial immune hyperactivation and a later immunoparalysis contributing to sepsis mortality may emphasize a rationale for timely and transient therapeutic immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>Binding of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as envelope constituents or nucleic acids, to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) induces inflammation upon infection. PRRs include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which carry N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR)&#x02013;rich domains that interact with PAMPs. Ligand binding to the ectodomains induces TLR dimerization via the adjacent transmembrane domains. C-terminal intracellular domains recruit the cytoplasmic adaptor molecules MyD88 and/or TRIF/TICAM-1 to initiate intracellular signal transduction via specific pathways such as those involving NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). The immune-stimulatory activity of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane glycolipid LPS depends on binding to LPS-binding protein (LBP) and CD14. These proteins deliver LPS to the complex formed by TLR4 and MD-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). N-terminally oligo-acylated proteins, produced by most if not all bacteria, are PAMPs that activate TLR2&#x02013;TLR1 or TLR2&#x02013;TLR6 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Previous reports have shown the relative importance of TLR2 and TLR4 as sensors of Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, but have indicated involvement of additional PRRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>Existing strategies for the prevention of Gram-negative bacterial septic shock target inflammatory mediators or specific PRRs such as CD14. Antagonistic anti&#x02013;rabbit CD14 antibody-dependent blockade of CD14 has been shown to prevent pathology such as organ injury by repetitive LPS challenge when applied, even after the initial LPS administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Efforts to inhibit LPS-induced TLR4 activation include application of LBP, antagonistic lipid A, or antagonistic anti&#x02013;murine (m)TLR4 mAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examined the host response to infection with clinical isolates of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> or <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>. Specifically, we investigated whether blockade of TLR4 and/or TLR2 on murine or human immune cells inhibits cytokine release. In addition, we studied the effect of antibiotic therapy paired with such blockade during Gram-negative bacterial infection of mice to protect against the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which is induced in vivo when PAMPs are released rapidly from bacteria exposed to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Results of either single or dual TLR blockade before or upon acute Gram-negative bacterial infection showed a central role of both TLR4 and TLR2 in sensing of Gram-negative bacterial challenge in vivo, a TLR4&#x02013;TLR2 interrelation, and the capacity to protect from shock upon subsequent or synchronous antibiotic therapy.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>Investigating the involvement of TLR2 in addition to TLR4, we applied experimental models of Gram-negative bacterial infection and subsequent antibiotic therapy both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). We observed TLR2/4-independent activity of primary macrophages upon high-dose infection and subsequent antibiotic therapy affirming the involvement of further PRRs (such as TLR9 binding bacterial DNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) in the recognition of Gram-negative bacteria. However, at lower infection doses, <italic>TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> macrophages were barely responsive. Substantial <italic>TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> macrophage activity upon Gram-negative bacterial challenge thus implied a contributing TLR2 activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Next, we infected mice with clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria. After 1 h, infection was terminated by antibiotic therapy, which was effective as indicated not only by the sterility of blood cultures 18 h after infection (not depicted) but also by the survival of all <italic>TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>/<italic>TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>).

To extend the concept of sole TLR2 blockade and to translate it to an experimental setting mimicking sepsis upon bacterial infection, we first identified a novel mAb (1A6). 1A6 bound the murine TLR4&#x02013;MD-2 complex in a dose-dependent fashion, as well as a human (h)TLR4&#x02013;mMD-2 complex (Fig. S1, A&#x02013;C, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071990/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071990/DC1</ext-link>). Fluorescent staining of WT, but not <italic>TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, macrophages using 1A6 and subsequent flow cytometry or microscopy confirmed primarily intracellular TLR4 localization (Fig. S1 D and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Co-precipitation of mTLR4 and mMD-2 from cells overexpressing both proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>) indicated the specificity of 1A6 for an epitope formed by both chains of the murine TLR4&#x02013;MD-2 complex together. Binding of 1A6 to TLR4&#x02013;MD-2, but not to TLR2, resulted in TLR4 neutralization and contrasted with the inverse features of T2.5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>; Fig. S2 A). Furthermore, preapplication of 1A6 reduced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 upon <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> infection highly effectively, whereas blockade of TLR2 on RAW264.7 macrophages that constitutively express TLR2 at a high level was less effective (Fig. S2 B and not depicted).

Antibiotic therapy started 1 h after infection, and supernatants were analyzed by ELISA 6 h after infection. Results illustrated represent similar results (A, B, and E) or summarize the results (C, D) of at least three independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2051747f02"></graphic></fig><p>The inhibitory effect of TLR4 blockade during systemic LPS challenge depended on both the LPS dose and the 1A6 dose (Fig. S3, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071990/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071990/DC1</ext-link>). For example, if 1A6 was applied 4 h after LPS injection, a fully protective 1A6 dose was 30 mg/kg body weight (Fig. S3 C). Mice were completely protected from high-dose LPS shock if 1A6 was applied within a time window of 5 h before challenge and 4 h after challenge (Fig. S3, D and E). The different requirements in respect to 1A6 doses might depend on specific demands for celerity of TLR4 blockade (Fig. S3, B and C). The protective effect of systemic 1A6 administration, however, was not caused by induction of TLR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell-specific depletory activity, and TLR4&#x02013;MD-2&#x02013;bound 1A6 persisted on the surface of macrophages in vitro for at least 4 h (Fig. S4, A&#x02013;C), which indicated a slow TLR4&#x02013;MD-2&#x02013;1A6 complex uptake. Based on the results of our KO mice and murine macrophage analyses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), we evaluated dual TLR blockade in respect to its protective potential. To this we applied both mAbs systemically before challenge with antibiotic-treated <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>.

Our findings on the necessity of concordant dual TLR blockade (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>), however, somehow opposed exclusiveness of TLR4 involvement; possibly caused by the high TLR2 expression level in RAW264.7 macrophages used in our initial experiments here, which is not apparent in primary macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). That <italic>TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice lacked significant resistance to Gram-negative bacterial challenge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>) could not be explained by a compensatory hyperactivity of TLR2 in <italic>TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, because average serum TNF-&#x003b1; concentrations in WT and <italic>TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice upon challenge with bacterial lipopeptide analogue for 90 min (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 14 for each of the two genotypes) did not differ significantly (not depicted). Instead, a systemically operative TLR4&#x02013;TLR2 interrelation, which is outlined in the following paragraphs, provides a possible explanation for the effectiveness of TLR4 preblockade.</p><p>In modeling treatment of an established Gram-negative bacterial sepsis, we first infected mice with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> or <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic>.

Notably, dual mAb application resulted in complete protection against infection/antibiotics treatment&#x02013;induced shock (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, G and H</xref>). Dual TLR blockade was protective, even if performed in synchrony with the start of antibiotic therapy 4 h after infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, I and J</xref>), even though mice already displayed symptoms of severe illness 3 h after infection. The 4-h time window of effective treatment is consistent with specific mAb-mediated protection upon single TLR-specific challenge (Fig. S3 E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).

To evaluate this hypothesis, we challenged mice with TLR2 and TLR4 ligands consecutively, at a low dose.

Blockades of different cytokines are currently being used as therapies of chronic inflammatory diseases. Yet, they have proved less successful for the treatment of acute infection, possibly caused by redundant activities via untargeted cytokines. Targeting late mediators of sepsis has proved successful in experimental models of sepsis, as demonstrated by antagonism of macrophage migration inhibitory factor or high-mobility group box 1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Using an experimental model of hyperinflammation induced by Gram-negative bacterial infection coupled to antibiotic therapy, we show a 4-h window of opportunity for protective TLR2/TLR4 blockade, contrasting the hypothesis of immediate early TLR activation as a point of no return. Our data also imply a time-dependent accumulation of inflammatory TLR signals encompassing one signal that &#x0201c;switches on&#x0201d; second line TLR2-specific sensitivity, which might depend on first line TLR4 activation upon a Gram-negative bacterial insult. Therefore, effective interference with pattern recognition concomitant with initiation of antibiotic therapy might be possible even in an advanced phase of sepsis pathology after infection. It is conceivable that dual TLR antagonism (as demonstrated in this study), as well as late mediator blockade and other concepts of sepsis pathology inhibition might have to match with each other or complement one another to define the most effective therapy.</p><p>It remains to be shown whether, in addition to averting a &#x0201c;storm&#x0201d; of cytokines, transient TLR blockade upon infection also reduces sepsis-related apoptosis and/or immunoparalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), as deduced from TLR2/TLR4 blockade&#x02013;dependent IL-10 reduction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>).
