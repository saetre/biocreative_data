This study examined both the role of oocyte-secreted factors on granulosa and thecal cells, cultured independently and in co-culture, and the effect of stem cell factor (SCF); a granulosa cell derived peptide that appears to have multiple roles in follicle development. Granulosa and theca cells were isolated from 2&#x02013;6 mm healthy follicles of mature porcine ovaries and cultured under serum-free conditions, supplemented with: 100 ng/ml LR3 IGF-1, 10 ng/ml insulin, 100 ng/ml testosterone, 0&#x02013;10 ng/ml SCF, 1 ng/ml FSH (granulosa), 0.01 ng/ml LH (theca) or 1 ng/ml FSH and 0.01 ng/ml LH (co-culture) and with/without oocyte conditioned medium (OCM) or 5 oocytes. Cells were cultured in 96 well plates for 144 h, after which viable cell numbers were determined. Medium was replaced every 48 h and spent medium analysed for steroids.</p><p>Oocyte secreted factors were shown to stimulate both granulosa cell proliferation (P &#x0003c; 0.001) and oestradiol production (P &#x0003c; 0.001) by granulosa cells throughout culture. In contrast, oocyte secreted factors suppressed granulosa cell progesterone production after both 48 and 144 hours (P &#x0003c; 0.001). Thecal cell numbers were increased by oocyte secreted factors (P = 0.02), together with a suppression in progesterone and androstenedione synthesis after 48 hours (P &#x0003c; 0.001) and after 144 hours (P = 0.02), respectively. Oocyte secreted factors also increased viable cell numbers (P &#x0003c; 0.001) in co-cultures together with suppression of progesterone (P &#x0003c; 0.001) and oestradiol (P &#x0003c; 0.001). In granulosa cell only cultures, SCF increased progesterone production in a dose dependent manner (P &#x0003c; 0.001), whereas progesterone synthesis by theca cells was reduced in a dose dependent manner (P = 0.002). Co-cultured cells demonstrated an increase in progesterone production with increasing SCF dose (P &#x0003c; 0.001) and an increase in oestradiol synthesis at the highest dose of SCF (100 ng/ml). In summary, these findings demonstrate the presence of a co-ordinated paracrine interaction between somatic cells and germ cells, whereby oocyte derived signals interact locally to mediate granulosa and theca cell function. SCF has a role in modulating this local interaction. In conclusion, the oocyte is an effective modulator of granulosa-theca interactions, one role being the inhibition of luteinization.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Within the ovarian follicle in mammals, oocyte growth and differentiation depends upon an intimate association between the somatic follicular cells and the developing germ cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Oocyte-granulosa cell communication is bi-directional and essential for both oocyte and follicular somatic cell function and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that various aspects of follicular development also depend upon and/or are influenced by the presence of the oocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. For example, increased numbers of ovulations in sheep heterozygous for the FecX<sup>I </sup>gene are linked to an oocyte-derived gene, bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP-15) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. BMP-15 is an oocyte specific growth factor expressed in rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] oocytes throughout folliculogenesis. Otsuka et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] showed that BMP-15 is responsible for FSH-independent granulosa cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>. BMP-15 is also closely related to growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9) and these two factors have similar expression patterns in the ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Follicular development is arrested at the primary stage in mice carrying an induced null mutation at the GDF-9 locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], a gene that is only expressed in oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It is likely that oocyte secreted factors provide a signalling mechanism to regulate the developmental fate of individual follicles. Although paracrine factors secreted by theca or granulosa cells, in addition to FSH, could regulate the development of individual follicles, the oocyte may play a dominant role in controlling follicle development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Much work on oocyte-secreted factors has focussed on murine systems. Oocytes are capable of modulating steroid synthesis by murine cumulus cells <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], particularly by inhibiting progesterone production. The oocyte also affects granulosa cell proliferation and morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, little information is available on the effect the oocyte has on theca cell growth and function. It has been documented that theca cells affect oocyte growth and maturation in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and that there is a theca-derived factor(s) which inhibits germinal vesicle breakdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Since oocyte granulosa cell communication is bi-directional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and there is bi-directional communication between the granulosa and theca cell compartments of the follicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], this raises the possibility that there is bi-directional communication between the oocyte and theca cells.</p><p>Stem cell factor (SCF) is one possible locally produced factor, encoded by the Steel (<italic>Sl</italic>) gene, and is thought to have many roles in follicular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. SCF is essential for the colonisation of the gonad by germ cells and the continued survival and growth of germ cells in the ovine foetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. SCF has also been implicated in the recruitment and early progression of primordial follicle development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. SCF mRNA is localised to granulosa cells at all stages of follicle growth in foetal and adult ovine ovaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Joyce et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] observed that SCF mRNA expression in mouse follicles was controlled by the oocyte depending on the stage of its growth and development. The nature of such control factors remains to be elucidated, but highlights the role of SCF during follicle growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. It has also been shown that SCF and its interaction with its receptor, <italic>c-kit</italic>, have a role in antrum formation, steroidogenesis and oocyte quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies on the effect of the oocyte on somatic ovarian cell function have used a variety of culture conditions. For example, cultures have been supplemented with serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], that causes the cells to luteinize. Culture vessels have been coated with attachment factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], which can also result in luteinization; and different populations of granulosa cells (cumulus versus mural cells) have been incubated. Primary serum-free culture systems have been developed for ovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], bovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and porcine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] granulosa cells and also for porcine theca cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The advantage of these serum free culture systems is that they maintain the follicular phenotype <italic>in vitro</italic>, in that spontaneous luteinization is avoided and the granulosa cells are able to maintain the activity of the aromatase enzyme complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Based upon the observation that follicular development is the result of a complex progression of cellular interactions, the aims of this work were to test the hypothesis that a porcine oocyte secreted factor(s) modulate granulosa and theca cell growth and function and to determine if any effects elicited by an oocyte secreted factor(s) are modified by SCF. These studies investigated the possibility that the communication between theca and granulosa cells is a key factor modulating the growth and function of these cells. We report here an investigation of porcine oocyte secreted factors using a physiologically relevant long-term, serum free culture system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Collection of oocyte conditioned medium (OCM)</title><p>All reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

In the presence of OCM, large interconnected cell clusters developed compared to controls. These cell clusters were viable as shown by neutral red assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). OCM inhibited progesterone production both after 48 (P &#x0003c; 0.001) and 144 (P &#x0003c; 0.001) hours in culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). A 100-fold dilution of OCM was still potent enough to inhibit progesterone production after 48 hours (P &#x0003c; 0.001). OCM in combination with LR3 IGF-1 also elicited a significant increase overall in oestradiol production after both 48 (P = 0.03) and 144 (P &#x0003c; 0.001) hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).

These serum free systems maintain the aromatase complex, maintain thecal cell LH responsiveness and prevent full luteinization of cells in culture unlike previous systems, which used serum in culture and resulted in a luteinized phenotype rather than a follicular phenotype. The current results also demonstrate that this oocyte-secreted factor(s) is capable of stimulating cell proliferation together with suppression in progesterone production, and that there is an interaction with LR3 IGF-1 and SCF. In addition, we have shown for the first time to our knowledge, that the porcine oocyte secretes a factor(s) that can stimulate oestradiol synthesis by non-luteinized, FSH-responsive mural granulosa cells and suppress androstenedione synthesis by LH stimulated thecal cells. The study has also demonstrated that granulosa and theca interactions are mediated not only by somatic cell-derived factors, but also by oocyte-derived factors.</p><p>OCM increased viable granulosa and thecal cell number and altered the gross morphology of the cells since there was formation of large interconnected clusters (experiment 1). Such clusters of cells and the presence of gap junctions have been observed previously in serum free conditions for ovine and bovine granulosa cell systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and in porcine thecal cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, granulosa cells were restructured around oocytes, whereas theca cells did not appear to form connections with oocytes. Cell proliferation was also observed when granulosa and theca cells were co-cultured independently with 5 or 10 oocytes per well (experiment 1). This is in agreement with co-culture experiments in other species (rat and bovine: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] where cell proliferation has also been observed.</p><p>The interactions between oocyte secreted factors and somatic cells were studied further by the use of granulosa-theca cell co-culture (experiment 2) and the cellular interactions were extended by the addition of SCF (experiment 3). Porcine oocyte secreted factor(s) modulated granulosa and theca cell function when the somatic cells were cultured together. OCM increased viable cell numbers above controls, both with and without LR3 IGF-1. However, addition of 5 oocytes per well increased granulosa and theca viable cell numbers in the absence of LR3 IGF-1. This provides evidence that co-culturing cells stimulates cellular interactions necessary for cell growth and differentiation without the requirement for LR3 IGF-1.</p><p>The results demonstrate that oocyte secreted factors are potent inhibitors of luteinization. OCM and oocyte co-culture consistently reduced progesterone production by granulosa cells compared to control cultures (experiment 1). This observation is in agreement with studies in mice and cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Overall progesterone synthesis increased between 48 and 144 hours and this may indicate that granulosa cells become less responsive to OCM with time. These effects may be associated with i) changes in intracellular signalling pathways (such as c-<italic>jun </italic>or c-<italic>myc </italic>expression); ii) proteolysis of oocyte secreted proteins; iii) reduced production of secreted factors over the incubation period or iv) increased metabolism of any secreted factors by the granulosa cells <italic>in vitro </italic>and remain to be elucidated. In contrast, the opposite effect was observed with oestradiol production. Throughout culture, OCM and oocyte co-culture significantly stimulated oestradiol production. This effect was repeated even with a 1000-fold dilution of OCM (with LR3 IGF-1) and at 144 hours, granulosa cells were still responsive to OCM, which indicates that sensitivity to OCM may increase throughout culture. Oocyte viability after culture was in excess of 85%, which would support the belief that the presence of the oocyte would allow the continued secretion of oocyte factors such as BMP15 and/or GDF-9, which are multifunctional oocyte secreted proteins and hence candidates for the control of ovarian cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Granulosa and theca cells, cultured with OCM, showed a 65% and 15% fall in progesterone levels respectively, compared to controls, after 48 hours. These oocyte-secreted factors appear to be more potent in granulosa cell function than theca cell function, raising the possibility of a cell specific action of oocyte secreted factor(s).</p><p>We report for the first time that oocyte secreted factor(s) enhanced oestradiol production. The effect of oocyte secreted factors on porcine granulosa cell steroidogenesis has been studied previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], suggesting that the oocyte suppresses oestradiol production. Coskun et al, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] cultured oocytectomized complexes which contain cumulus granulosa cells whereas the granulosa cells cultured in the present study were isolated by scraping the wall of dissected follicles and were expected to be largely mural granulosa cells and hence more oestrogenic in nature.</p><p>Thecal cell progesterone production was also suppressed by OCM and oocyte co-culture (experiment 1). Androstenedione production was also inhibited when theca cells were supplemented with OCM, either with or without LR3 IGF-1. Reduced androstenedione synthesis was also observed when theca cells were co-cultured with 15 oocytes. However, these effects were only observed after 48 hours in culture. The finding that there was an oocyte-dependent decrease in androstenedione production indicates that precursor availability may also play a role in the inhibition of oestradiol synthesis.</p><p>OCM and oocyte co-culture suppressed progesterone production by co-cultured granulosa and theca cells after the addition of LR3 IGF-1 (experiment 2). It can be postulated that the oocyte-induced reduction in progesterone production is elicited by inhibiting 3&#x003b2; HSD activity and enzymes responsible for pregnenolone synthesis. Oocyte secreted factors may also inhibit androstenedione synthesis by the attenuation of side chain cleavage P450 enzyme. If this is the case, then precursors for androstenedione synthesis are also reduced, although this remains to be elucidated. It is also reasonable to hypothesize that oocyte secreted factors reduce theca cell oestradiol synthesis because of low levels of precursor availability. This is overcome in the granulosa cell cultures because of the supplementation with exogenous testosterone. In addition, the observation that OCM stimulated oestradiol production indicates that oocyte secreted factors potentiate aromatase P<sub>450 </sub>activity.</p><p>Despite many similarities, the results also highlight the differences between cell function under the influence of either OCM or oocyte co-culture. For example, as observed with granulosa cells, only 5 oocytes per well were sufficient to effect an increase in viable cell numbers, whereas several thousands of oocytes were required to condition medium before any such effect was observed. This implies that oocyte secretions are extremely potent and are of a labile nature. Other workers have reported the labile nature of oocyte secretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, a single oocyte is bathed in approximately 10&#x02013;250 &#x003bc;l of follicular fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] in medium-sized follicles (2&#x02013;6 mm) which emphasises how potent oocyte secreted factors must be in their physiological control of granulosa cell development and function.</p><p>SCF has many roles in follicle development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and is a granulosa cell derived peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] which is expressed at high levels in mural granulosa cells in murine preovulatory follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The addition of SCF to granulosa cell cultures in the present study (experiment 3) elicited an increase in progesterone production after 48 hours in culture. Morphological appearance of the granulosa cells however, did not suggest luteinization. SCF increased oestradiol after 48 hours in culture and similarly oocyte co-culture also increased oestradiol concentrations above controls (Experiment 3). These effects are in agreement with Experiment 1 and also correspond with the finding that human follicular fluid concentrations of SCF are positively correlated to oestradiol concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>The receptor for SCF, c-kit, has been isolated to bovine the theca cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, the results demonstrate that SCF acted in an autocrine manner in granulosa cells, which suggests that there is either c-kit present on granulosa cells or that SCF is capable of eliciting a biological response through receptors similar to c-kit or through c-kit receptor sub-types. A decrease in cell number was observed when theca cells were supplemented with SCF. This is in contrast to Parrott et al, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] who reported an increase in theca cell number and thereby highlights differences in the action of SCF between mono- and poly-ovulatory species. Very little data is available on SCF levels in ovarian tissue, however, Tanikawa et al, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] reported a range of 0.116 &#x02013; 3.26 ng/ml SCF in human follicular fluid, which is comparable to the lower concentrations of SCF used in the dose response study (Experiment 3).</p><p>Progesterone production by co-cultured granulosa and theca cells showed an increase with SCF, both with and without oocytes, throughout culture. However, progesterone suppression was observed with oocyte co-culture. This was identical to the pattern observed with granulosa cells alone. This suggests that granulosa cells are the major source of progesterone in this co-culture system and that SCF may be responsible for cellular differentiation, including the stimulation of 3&#x003b2;-HSD activity.</p><p>Theca cells became more sensitive to SCF with time in culture in terms of increased androstenedione production at both doses of SCF. This is in agreement with studies in cattle demonstrating that SCF stimulates androgen production by theca cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>Oestradiol production also followed an interesting trend. In contrast, after 48 hours, SCF reduced oestradiol production, both in the presence and absence of oocytes. However, after 144 hours, theca cells, co-cultured with oocytes and 10 ng/ml SCF, stimulated oestradiol concentrations &#x02013; supporting an inverse relationship between cellular differentiation and steroidogenesis. 100 ng/ml SCF inhibited oestradiol production by co-cultured cells compared with lower doses. A similar effect was observed when either granulosa or theca cells were cultured alone (with 100 ng/ml SCF). Oestradiol production was also inhibited in theca and oocyte co-cultures, compared to controls, at all doses of SCF. However, these observations are in contrast to granulosa and oocyte co-culture, where 10 ng/ml SCF stimulated oestradiol production. If porcine theca cells are the main source of SCF, these results support a role of theca cells in modulating granulosa cell steroidogenesis.</p><p>The results demonstrate that oocyte derived factors may inhibit 3&#x003b2;-HSD activity but stimulate the aromatase enzyme complex. Huang et al, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] showed that SCF, in combination with IGF-1, increased the expression of StAR, LH receptor, P450<sub>scc</sub>, CYP17 and 3&#x003b2;-HSD in theca cell cultures which supports a modulatory role for SCF. The findings of the present study indicate the presence of a co-ordinated interaction between somatic and germ cells whereby oocyte derived signals are mediated between the granulosa and theca cells and that granulosa cells secrete factors that promote theca cell differentiation. The present study also supports the role of feedback signals from the granulosa cells to the theca cells. A positive feedback loop has been identified between theca and granulosa cells that is mediated by keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and SCF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, this work has demonstrated that the oocyte is a potent modulator of ovarian cell proliferation and an inhibitor of luteinization. It has also shown that SCF can dramatically affect ovarian cell function by modulating the interaction between granulosa and theca cells. This supports the hypothesis that local granulosa-theca cell interactions play an important role in regulating cellular function within ovarian follicles and that oocyte secreted factors have a key role in this feedback loop. Although the identification of oocyte secreted factor(s) have not yet been elucidated, we have recently demonstrated the presence of a functional BMP system in the porcine ovary whereby BMP receptors were localised particularly in the oocytes and granulosa cells, along with BMP expression in the oocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Further investigations will reveal the functional significance and mechanisms of action of BMPs and other oocyte factors on follicular cell function.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>VB carried out all experiments and drafted the manuscript.
