BGLAP is an 11 kDa protein which is synthesized and secreted by normal maturing osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It regulates the dynamics of new bone formation and bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] by interaction with vitamin D, and by influencing the differentiation of osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. BGLAP is also involved in the posttranslational targeting of vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], which controls blood coagulation. Accordingly, defects in BGLAP expression lead to the development of chondrodysplasia punctata, coagulation defects, and coumarin embryopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Since the discovery of BGLAP secretion in a subset of osteosarcoma cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], BGLAP has been implicated in the development of various malignant tumors. In multiple myeloma, BGLAP is considered a biochemical marker for bone resorption and dynamics during the malignant process. Thus, serum BGLAP levels are reduced in patients with multiple myeloma with osteolytic bone lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. There is also growing evidence that markers of bone metabolism correlate with the risk of skeletal complications, disease progression and tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In prostate cancer, BGLAP is expressed in the cancer cells and improves adhesion, proliferation, and survival of tumor cells metastasizing to the bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In breast cancer, BGLAP serum levels determine the progress of the disease, especially with respect to bone metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although metastasis of pancreatic cancer to the bones is exceedingly rare, both PDAC and CP are characterized by a dense desmoplastic reaction, which in the case of CP often leads to calcification. Therefore, in the present study we analyzed the expression of BGLAP in normal and diseased human pancreatic tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To exactly quantify mRNA levels of BGLAP in bulk pancreatic tissues, qRT-PCR was carried out. This analysis demonstrated no significant difference between median BGLAP mRNA levels in the normal pancreas, CP and PDAC tissues (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). As the cellular composition of bulk PDAC and CP tissues is different than that of normal pancreatic tissues, BGLAP mRNA values were normalized to amylase-2A (Amy2A) mRNA levels for each tissue sample to exclude the mRNA expression of BGLAP in the acini (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This analysis revealed a significant increase in the mRNA ratio of BGLAP/Amy2A in PDAC (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) compared to normal pancreatic tissues. This suggests that in PDAC, tissue elements other than acini contribute to the observed BGLAP mRNA levels in bulk tissues. Therefore, and in order to localize BGLAP, immunohistochemistry was performed on pancreatic tissue sections from normal (n = 10), CP (n = 20) and PDAC (n = 20) cases. BGLAP expression was weak to absent in normal pancreatic ductal cells of 9/10 normal pancreatic tissues (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In contrast, acinar cells of 9/10 normal pancreatic tissues exhibited moderate cytoplasmic BGLAP staining (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). PanIN1-2 lesions in normal pancreatic tissues demonstrated weak to moderate BGLAP staining (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In contrast, in CP tissues there was moderate cytoplasmic and occasionally nuclear staining of tubular complexes in 18 out of 20 cases (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Moderate BGLAP staining was also observed in the PanIN1-2 lesions (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), as well as in ductal cells (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). In 15/20 PDAC tissues, moderate to strong cytoplasmic and occasionally nuclear BGLAP staining was observed in the tubular complexes (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), PanIN1-3 lesions (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), and cancer cells (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>).

In the present study, BGLAP mRNA levels were not significantly different between bulk normal pancreatic, CP and PDAC tissues. Normal pancreatic tissues consist mainly of acinar cells (and to a lesser extent of islets and ductal cells). In contrast, in CP tissues, the acinar cell compartment is replaced by extensive fibrosis, ductal proliferation, and acinar cell conversion into tubular complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These changes further progress towards malignant transformation and cancer cell proliferation in PDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the present study, BGLAP was localized in the acini of normal pancreatic tissues, indicating that the mRNA content of BGLAP represents the acinar fraction in normal pancreatic tissues. Interestingly, BGLAP was localized in the tubular complexes and PanIN lesions of both CP and PDAC as well as in the cancer cells in PDAC. This was indirectly confirmed by normalizing BGLAP mRNA levels to the acinar marker Amy2A. Using this method, a significant increase in the ratio of BGLAP/Amy2A mRNA expression in PDAC tissues was observed compared to normal pancreatic tissues. This might indicate that BGLAP is expressed in the disease-specific tissue elements such as the tubular complexes, PanINs and cancer cells. Surprisingly, there was a decrease of BGLAP serum levels in PDAC patients compared to healthy controls. These findings suggest that BGLAP is principally released by acinar cells in the normal and diseased pancreas. However, since cytoplasmic expression of BGLAP was also observed in tubular complexes and cancer cells, it could be speculated that BGLAP is not efficiently released from these cells. This might explain the elevated BGLAP serum levels in healthy controls despite similar amounts of BGLAP mRNA in bulk diseased pancreatic tissues.</p><p>Numerous growth factors and cytokines &#x02013; such as TGF-&#x003b2;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], BMP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], FGF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], Shh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], Ihh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] &#x02013; have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PDAC. Among those factors, only TNF-&#x003b1; reduced the expression of BGLAP in pancreatic cancer cell lines. The other growth factors and cytokines exhibited no effects on BGLAP expression in the tested pancreatic cancer cells. TNF-&#x003b1; has anti-tumor effects in pancreatic adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The down-regulation of BGLAP by TNF-&#x003b1; in pancreatic cancer cells indicates that BGLAP is one of the TNF-&#x003b1; targets and indirectly suggests a tumor-promoting function of BGLAP in pancreatic cancer. In line with this argument, down-regulation of BGLAP levels using siRNA molecules resulted in a significant reduction in pancreatic cancer cell growth and invasion. This has also been shown in other tumors, such as osteosarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>The transcription of BGLAP is dependent on the expression of runx2 transcription factor, which binds to an osteoblast-specific cis-acting element in the promoter of BGLAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

The slides were then washed in washing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.85% NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and pH 7.4), and incubated with the mouse monoclonal BGLAP antibody (ZYTOMED Systems GmbH, Berlin, Germany) diluted in a universal block reagent (DAKO Corporation, Carpentaria, CA) for 18 h at 4&#x000b0;C. In consecutive sections, the specificity of the primary antibody was confirmed using the corresponding normal mouse IgG (DAKO). The slides were then rinsed with washing buffer and incubated with anti-mouse HRPO-labeled IgG (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, UK) diluted in a universal blocking reagent (DAKO) for 1 h at room temperature. The tissue sections were then washed in washing buffer and each section was subjected to 100 &#x003bc;l of DAB-chromogen/substrate reagent (DAKO) and counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin.</p><p>Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Briefly, pancreatic cancer cells were cultured on Super Frost microscope slides (Menzel GmbH &#x00026; Co KG, Braunschweig, Germany) overnight till adherent and then washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 3.5% para-formaldehyde for 25 min, and quenched with 30 mM glycine/PBS for 5 min, followed by permeabilization of the cell membrane with 0.1% Triton x-100 for 5 min at room temperature. Next, slides were incubated with the mouse monoclonal BGLAP antibody and immunostaining was performed as described above. Slides were analyzed using the Axioplan 2 imaging microscope (Carl Zeiss light microscope, G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Enzyme immunoassay (EIA)</title><p>Determination of the BGLAP protein levels was performed with an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). Briefly, 96-well flat-bottomed plates pre-coated with the mouse monoclonal BGLAP antibody were loaded with 100 &#x003bc;l serum, cell culture supernatant or protein standards for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, 100 &#x003bc;l of the BGLAP antibody labeled with peroxidase (POD) were loaded into the wells for 1 h at room temperature. Next, 100 &#x003bc;l of substrate solution were added to the wells for 20 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of 100 &#x003bc;l 1N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>stop solution. Then, absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microtiter plate reader (Opsys MR, Thermo Labsystems, Frankfurt, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>siRNA transfection</title><p>Aspc-1 and Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells were grown in complete RPMI or DMEM medium in 10 ml cell culture plates until 50% confluence. BGLAP siRNA transfection was performed using RNAifect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected with a 5 &#x003bc;g mixture of two BGLAP siRNA target sequences &#x02013; Hs-BGLAP-3-HP siRNA (AAG CAG GAG GGC AGC GAG GTA) and Hs-BGLAP-4-HP siRNA (CCC AGG CGC TAC CTG TAT CAA) &#x02013; as well as with a control siRNA target sequence (AAT TCT CCG AAC GTG TCA CGT) (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 48 h.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell growth assays</title><p>Aspc-1 and Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells transfected with BGLAP siRNAs or control siRNA were seeded at a density of 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates for 48 h. Then, 10 ml MTT (5 mg/ml) dissolved in PBS pH 7.4 were added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Subsequently, cellular formazan crystals were solubilized with 0.04 mM HCl/isopropanol. Optical density was measured at 570 nm with an ELISA plate reader (Opsys MR). All assays were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro invasion assays</title><p>The Matrigel invasion assay (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) was used to assess the invasive potential of pancreatic cancer cells following BGLAP silencing. Briefly, BioCoat Matrigel invasion chambers were rehydrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five hundred &#x003bc;l of DMEM cell culture medium supplemented with 10% FCS were added to the bottom of 24-well plates. Aspc-1 and Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells transfected with BGLAP siRNAs or control siRNA were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well into the upper inserts and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C. After 24 h, the non-invading cells were removed from the upper surface of the separating membrane by gentle scrubbing with a cotton swab. Invading cells were fixed in ice-cold 100% methanol and stained with 0.05% crystal violet in 20% ethanol. The membranes were mounted on glass slides and manually counted using a light microscope. The invasion index was calculated as the percentage of invading cells in the treatment group compared to the control group. All assays were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For statistical analyses, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test and the Kruskal-Wallis test (followed by Dunn's post-hoc test) were used, unless indicated otherwise. Significance was defined as p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HK and SB carried out the preparation of samples, performed the experiments and molecular analyses and participated in drafting the manuscript.
