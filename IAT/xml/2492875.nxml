Tat stimulates the elongation of transcription with the aid of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), a heterodimer comprised of cyclin T1 (CycT1) and cyclin dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9). Tat and CycT1 bind to the transactivation response element (TAR), an RNA stem loop structure located at the 5'-end (+1 to +59) of all viral transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This interaction results in the recruitment of Cdk9 and the subsequent stimulation of its kinase activity by Tat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Among three distinct P-TEFb complexes (CycT1/Cdk9, CycT2/Cdk9, and CycK/Cdk9), only the CycT1/Cdk9 complex can support Tat transactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The interaction between Tat, TAR, and CycT1 has been extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Tat binds to the bulge region (+23 to +25) of TAR and the CycT1 subunit of P-TEFb through its central arginine-rich motif (ARM; a.a. 49&#x02013;60) and its N-terminal activation domain (a.a. 1&#x02013;48), respectively. CycT1, in turn, is thought to bind to the central loop (+30 to +35) of TAR through its Tat-TAR recognition motif (TRM; a.a. 251&#x02013;271) in the presence of Tat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Human CycT1 is comprised of 726 amino acids and contains a cyclin box repeat domain (from positions 31 to 250), a coiled-coil sequence (from positions 379 to 530), and a PEST sequence (from positions 709 to 726). The N-terminal cyclin boxes are important for binding and activation of Cdk9. Residues from positions 251 to 272 are essential for the zinc ion-mediated binding between Tat and TAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This region also interacts with the HEXIM1 protein and 7SK small nuclear RNA, which negatively regulate the kinase activity of P-TEFb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The C-terminal region (a.a. 273&#x02013;726) of CycT1 is dispensable for Tat transactivation since the N-terminal cyclin repeats (a.a. 1&#x02013;250) and TRM (a.a. 251&#x02013;272) of CycT1 interact with Cdk9, Tat and TAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Recently, we have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal region (a.a. 1&#x02013;280) of human CycT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and its interacting dimeric Cyclin T-binding domain in HEXIM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Since P-TEFb is the essential cellular host co-factor of the viral Tat protein, this interaction serves as a potential target for anti-HIV therapeutics. Several approaches have been taken to block HIV transcription by targeting P-TEFb. First, mutant Cdk9 proteins defective in kinase activity have been shown to inhibit HIV transcription in cell culture systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A number of small compounds that inhibit Cdk9 activities or disrupt the Tat/TAR/P-TEFb interaction have also been tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Another approach by Napolitano et al. aimed to inactivate Cdk9 by an oligomerization chain reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Additionally, our group has constructed chimeric proteins containing wild type (wt) CycT1 and mutant Cdk9 which inhibited HIV replication up to 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Moreover, several CycT1-binding proteins and their truncation mutants have been used as inhibitors of Tat transactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Finally, Bai et al. demonstrated that intrabodies against CycT1 inhibited Tat stimulated transactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It is important to note, however, that because P-TEFb is involved in the transcription of many cellular genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], it is critical to exclusively block HIV-specific pathways in order to develop safe and effective anti-HIV therapies.</p><p>In this study, we sought to construct dominant negative CycT1 mutant proteins capable of blocking HIV transcription. A sequence alignment between the cyclin proteins CycT1, T2 and K revealed ten very well-conserved regions that are essential for the formation of the alpha-helical cyclin box repeat domain. We introduced random mutations in the nine most conserved amino acid clusters in these regions and tested the resulting mutant CycT1 proteins for their ability to block HIV transcription. One of the mutant proteins, called CycT1-U7, showed a potent, yet specific, dominant negative effect on HIV transcription, although the steady-state expression level of CycT1-U7 was remarkably low. Western blot analysis indicated that the expression level of the Tat proteins co-expressed with CycT1-U7 was also significantly lower than those co-expressed with wt CycT1. Proteasome inhibitors restored the expression of CycT1-U7 and Tat proteins. As a consequence, these inhibitors diminished the dominant negative effect elicited by over-expression of CycT1-U7. Our results suggest that CycT1-U7 inhibits HIV transcription by promoting a rapid degradation of Tat proteins. These mutant CycT1 proteins represent a novel class of specific inhibitors for HIV transcription, which might be further utilized in development of safe and effective anti-HIV therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Construction and screening of CycT1 mutants</title><p>CycT1 is a member of the C-type cyclin family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Its N-terminal 250 amino acids form two cyclin repeat boxes that are essential for the interaction with, and the activation of, Cdk9. Recently, we have determined the three dimensional crystal structure of CycT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The cyclin boxes consist of two repeats, each containing five &#x003b1;-helices (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Sequence alignment of three P-TEFb-forming cyclins T1, T2, and K from different species revealed that the secondary structure elements are well conserved among these cyclins, indicating that they play important roles in P-TEFb functions (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Based on this secondary structure alignment, we selected the nine most conserved amino acid clusters in the cyclin box domain of CycT1 and introduced random mutations into a C-terminal truncation mutant of CycT1 (CycT1(1&#x02013;280)). This truncation is sufficient to support Tat transactivation as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Construction of mutant CycT1 proteins.</bold><bold>A</bold>.

In total, 115 CycT1 mutants were constructed and tested for their activities on Tat transactivation by co-transfecting murine NIH 3T3 cells with an HIV LTR-Luciferase (Luc) reporter gene and Tat (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Since murine endogenous CycT1 (mCycT1) cannot support Tat transactivation, Tat activated the LTR-driven Luc expression only by approximately 10-fold (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lane 2). Over-expression of the wt human CycT1 further activated the gene expression up to 70-fold (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). The luciferase activities obtained by overexpressing any of the pool of mutant CycT1 proteins ranged from five to 70-fold. Fifteen mutants showed an equal or a higher activity than the wt, 45 mutants showed modest (50&#x02013;100% of wt) activity and 55 had less than 50% of the activity of wt CycT1 in these cells (summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These 55 mutants were further sequenced and tested for their dominant negative effect on HIV transcription by co-transfecting HeLa cells stably expressing the HIV-Luc reporter gene (HeLa/HR-Luc cells) with Tat (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>N-terminal mutant CycT1 proteins (CycT1-U7) exhibit a strong dominant negative effect on HIV transactivation.</bold><bold>A</bold>.

At least four other mutant CycT1 constructed by the same oligonucleotides (Mut 2, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) showed potent dominant negative effects on HIV transcription (60&#x02013;90%, data not shown). Over-expression of CycT1-U7 affected neither the basal HIV transcription nor CMV-Luc reporter gene expression (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Next, HeLa/HR-Luc cells stably expressing CycT1-U7 were created by infecting with a second lentiviral vector. Tat transactivation in these cells was scored by transfecting an increasing amount of Tat and measuring LTR-driven luciferase activity. In cells expressing CycT1-U7, Tat exhibited a significantly lower activity compared to the cells stably carrying the empty pHR lentiviral vector (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed that the steady-state expression level of CycT1-U7 is much lower than wt CycT1 (1&#x02013;280) although the same amount of plasmid was transfected (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3 in the top panel). Interestingly, the expression level of Tat was also much lower in CycT1-U7-expressing cells than in wt CycT1 (1&#x02013;280) expressing cells, (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 2 and 3). In contrast, the expression levels of the endogenous CycT1 and Cdk9 in the presence of CycT1-U7 remained unchanged (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). These results suggested that Tat transactivation in CycT1-U7 expressing cells is kept at a low level because the steady state Tat expression is diminished in these cells. Since CycT1-U7 retains the wild type sequence of Tat-TAR recognition motif (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), we hypothesized that CycT1-U7 forms a complex with Tat, and this complex is rapidly degraded in cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>CycT1-U7 promotes the degradation of Tat. </bold><bold>A</bold>.

The expression of both CycT1-U7 and Tat was partially restored in the presence of MG-132 (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, lanes 2 and 3 compared with lane 1), and much more efficiently restored in the presence of Epoxomicin (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, lanes 5 to 7 compared with lane 4). In contrast, the expression of wt CycT1 (1&#x02013;280) and Tat remained virtually unchanged in the presence of these inhibitors (lanes 9 and 10 compared with lane 8).</p><p>The restoration of the CycT1-U7 and Tat expression by Epoxomicin was also observed at the cellular level by an indirect immuno-fluorescence (IF) assay (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). HA-tagged wt and mutant CycT1 and myc-tagged Tat proteins were co-expressed in HeLa/HR-Luc cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were untreated or treated with 25 &#x003bc;M Epoxomicin for 3 hours. HA-CycT1 proteins were probed with mouse anti-HA and Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and myc-Tat proteins were probed with Texas Red-labelled anti-myc antibody. As shown in Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, the expression of CycT1-U7 and Tat was kept at low levels without Epoxomicin treatment. The protein levels were elevated when the cells were treated with Epoxomicin. The wt CycT1 and Tat proteins co-expressed with wt CycT1 were detected in the presence or absence of Epoxomicin. Finally, the inhibitory effect by CycT-U7 was diminished in transient (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) and stable (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) expression systems when the cells were incubated with 25 &#x003bc;M Epoxomicin for 6 to 18 hours. Since it has been demonstrated that CycT1 is ubiquitinated in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], we sought to examine whether CycT1-U7 is ubiquitinated by co-immunoprecipitation analysis (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

Also, in this condition, the interaction between CycT1-U7 and Tat was detected by co-immunoprecipitation (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, lane 4). These results suggest that CycT1-U7 inhibits Tat-transactivation by rapidly recruiting Tat proteins into an ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Epoxomicin restores CycT1-U7 and Tat expression.</bold><bold>A</bold>.

This is presumably due to the high stability and the complex regulatory mechanism of the endogenous P-TEFb complex. In the present study, we constructed and evaluated a novel class of CycT1 mutant proteins (CycT1-U7) that explicitly block HIV transcription by promoting a rapid and specific degradation of Tat proteins co-expressing CycT1-U7. Resulting from a functional screen of 115 randomized mutant proteins, sequence analysis of CycT1-U7 showed five mutations including one amino acid deletion in the second helix of the cyclin box repeat fold (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that a CycT1 variant lacking this region (CycT1 (119&#x02013;280)) is also unstable in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This particular mutant exhibited a potent dominant negative effect on HIV transcription, potentially by a similar mechanism (data not shown). Therefore, H2 of CycT1 appears very important for maintaining the structural stability of CycT1 and the interface in between the two repeats. In addition, a residue directly preceding the first helix of the cyclin box repeat that varies between human and equine CycT1 has been previously identified as responsible for differences in the recognition of Tat/TAR complexes from HIV and EIAV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Together, these data point towards the importance of the integrity of the first cyclin box repeat for the interaction with Tat. This region also appears to be essential for the interaction with Cdk9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, CycT1-U7 does not promote degradation of endogenous Cdk9. On the other hand, this mutant does bear the wild type sequence of Tat/TAR recognition motif (a.a. 251&#x02013;272). Indeed, the complex between CycT1-U7 and Tat was detected when the cells were treated with proteasome inhibitors (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The mutant CycT1-U7 proteins can form a complex with Tat and this complex would be immediately degraded because of the instability of CycT1-U7. Therefore, we conclude that CycT1-U7 exhibits a strong dominant negative effect on Tat transactivation by specifically degrading the co-expressed Tat protein, without disturbing the endogenous P-TEFb complex (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed model for the mechanism of dominant negative effect elicited by CycT1-U7.</bold> Wild type CycT1 forms a complex with Cdk9 as an active P-TEFb, and interacts with Tat and TAR RNA. Alternatively, CycT1-U7 associates with Tat but the CycT-U7/Tat complex is immediately degraded <italic>via </italic>an ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathway. This degradation can be prevented using proteasome inhibitors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-5-63-6"/></fig><p>It has been demonstrated that CycT1 interacts with other cellular transcription factors through its N-terminal cyclin box regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. It is of importance to examine whether CycT-U7 can also inhibit cellular transcription mediated by these factors <italic>via </italic>a similar pathway. Additionally, the TRM region of CycT1 also interacts with HEXIM1, the endogenous inhibitory protein of P-TEFb which interacts with this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and it is possible that CycT1-U7 affects P-TEFb activity by reducing HEXIM1 levels. More detailed studies are required to assess the effect of CycT1-U7 on cellular transcription.</p><p>Our results indicate that CycT1-U7/Tat is recruited to the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway. CycT1 seems to be ubiquitinated not only on its C-terminal PEST region (a.a. 706&#x02013;726) but also at other regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It is to be noted that wt CycT1 (1&#x02013;280) is resistant to degradation (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Although we have not identified the potential ubiquitination site(s) of CycT1-U7 in this study, it is possible that the cyclin box structure stabilizes the protein by preventing ubiquitination. Conformational changes induced by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may expose any additional ubiquitination sites in this region, which would represent a novel pathway to regulate P-TEFb function.</p><p>Constructing CycT1 mutants based on C-terminal truncated forms of wt CycT1 (CycT1(1&#x02013;280)) is particularly beneficial in terms of HIV transcription. CycT1 (1&#x02013;280) has been demonstrated to be sufficient for supporting Tat-transactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In addition, Tat competes with HEXIM1 to increase active P-TEFb complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. CycT1 (1&#x02013;280) can therefore bypass the 7SK/HEXIM-mediated complex regulatory pathway and be exclusively directed towards Tat-dependent transactivation (Jadlowsky et al., unpublished data), making CycT1 (1&#x02013;280) proteins highly specific for Tat.</p><p>Since the mechanism by which CycT1-U7 inhibits HIV transcription seems not to be through blocking the normal function of P-TEFb, but rather through a "gain-of-function" pathway, it represents a novel class of inhibitory molecules. Moreover, since the steady-state expression of CycT-U7 is very low, it may be an excellent candidate for gene therapy because the mutant proteins would not persist for a prolonged period of time, thereby avoiding induction of unwanted immune responses. Additionally, these proteins would work only when Tat is actively expressed in cells.</p><p>HIV utilizes the cellular transcriptional machinery for its own replication. Therefore, it is important to inhibit this step without disturbing cellular functions. Since CycT1 interacts with Tat and TAR, it can be an excellent target to develop safe and effective anti-HIV therapies. Here we present an example of a dominant negative CycT1 molecule which specifically blocks HIV transcription. Studying the precise mechanism by which this mutant CycT1 protein inhibits HIV transcription could unveil novel regulatory pathways of the HIV life cycle and therefore provide reliable clues for designing anti-HIV agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we constructed and evaluated dominant negative CycT1 mutant proteins that specifically block HIV transcription by promoting a rapid degradation of Tat proteins. These mutant CycT1 proteins represent a novel class of specific inhibitors for HIV transcription, which can be further utilized to develop a safe and effective anti-HIV therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>HeLa, 293T or NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) including 10% fetal bovine serum at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
