However, in the absence of K<sup>+</sup>, significant NMDG<sup>+</sup> currents could be recorded from human embryonic kidney cells expressing Kv3.1 or Kv3.2b channels and Kv1.5 R487Y/V, but not wild-type channels. Inward currents were much larger than outward currents due to the presence of intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> (1 mM), which blocked the outward NMDG<sup>+</sup> current, resulting in a strong inward rectification. The NMDG<sup>+</sup> current was inhibited by extracellular 4-aminopyridine (5 mM) or tetraethylammonium (10 mM), and largely eliminated in Kv3.2b by an S6 mutation that prevents the channel from opening (P468W) and by a pore helix mutation in Kv1.5 R487Y (W472F) that inactivates the channel at rest. These data indicate that NMDG<sup>+</sup> passes through the open ion-conducting pore and suggest a very flexible nature of the selectivity filter itself. 0.3 or 1 mM K<sup>+</sup> added to the external NMDG<sup>+</sup> solution positively shifted the reversal potential by &#x0223c;16 or 31 mV, respectively, giving a permeability ratio for K<sup>+</sup> over NMDG<sup>+</sup> (<italic>P</italic><sub>K</sub><sup>+</sup>/<italic>P</italic><sub>NMDG</sub><sup>+</sup>) of &#x0223c;240. Reversal potential shifts in mixtures of K<sup>+</sup> and NMDG<sup>+</sup> are in accordance with <italic>P</italic><sub>K</sub><sup>+</sup>/<italic>P</italic><sub>NMDG</sub><sup>+</sup>, indicating that the ions compete for permeation and suggesting that NMDG<sup>+</sup> passes through the open state. Comparison of the outer pore regions of Kv3 and Kv1.5 channels identified an Arg residue in Kv1.5 that is replaced by a Tyr in Kv3 channels. Substituting R with Y or V allowed Kv1.5 channels to conduct NMDG<sup>+</sup>, suggesting a regulation by this outer pore residue of Kv channel flexibility and, as a result, permeability.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channels conduct and regulate K<sup>+</sup> flux across the cell membrane, and they can be exquisitely selective, generally allowing K<sup>+</sup> to pass across cell membranes while blocking other ion species. Crystal structures and biophysical studies have provided us with considerable insight into the mechanisms underlying K<sup>+</sup> channel selectivity. The crystal structures of KcsA and Kv1.2 channels have revealed a central pore that is mostly constricted over a narrow span, termed the selectivity filter, near the extracellular side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2005</xref>). K<sup>+</sup> selectivity arises mostly from two essential features of the selectivity filter structure: the carbonyl oxygen atoms lining it, which mimic the coordination of K<sup>+</sup> ions in water, and the protein packing around the selectivity filter that holds the pore open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>). The diameter of the selectivity filter (&#x0223c;3 &#x000c5; in the closed state) allows the carbonyl oxygen atoms to coordinate well with dehydrated K<sup>+</sup> (2.66 &#x000c5; in diameter) and cuts off the permeation of larger ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hille, 2001</xref>), which suggests sufficient structural rigidity to maintain selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jordan, 2007</xref>). Biophysical studies have attempted to deduce the size of the K<sup>+</sup> channel selectivity filter from the size of the largest permeant ion. The largest alkali metal ion that permeates K<sup>+</sup> channels is Rb<sup>+</sup> (2.96 &#x000c5; in diameter). Cs<sup>+</sup> (3.38 &#x000c5; in diameter) and methyl groups (4 &#x000c5; in diameter) permeate very weakly or only under extreme circumstances, and this suggests a selectivity filter diameter of between 2.96 and 3.38 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bezanilla and Armstrong, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hille, 1973</xref>). These data are consistent with the crystal structure, implying that the selectivity filter is not easily expanded further.</p><p>No protein is rigid, however, and not only when open must the selectivity filter conform to each ion by numerous small adjustments that may greatly improve ion&#x02013;filter interaction, but global conformational changes of the channel protein can also change the dimensions of the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hille, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jordan, 2007</xref>). In Kv channels, the most dramatic example arises when Kv channels C-type inactivate, and the channels transiently become Na<sup>+</sup> permeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Starkus et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiss et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2000a</xref>). This is one line of evidence that C-type inactivation makes the channel nonconducting through a localized constriction of the selectivity filter. In addition, mutated <italic>Shaker</italic> K<sup>+</sup> channels can pass through subconductance states on the way to the fully open state and during channel closing. These states, which seem to represent successive conformational steps in different subunits, also exhibit different ion selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zheng and Sigworth, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">1998</xref>). Collectively, these studies strongly suggest a flexible nature of the selectivity filter, rather than a rigid cylindrical structure.</p><p>NMDG<sup>+</sup> is an organic monovalent cation that forms a linear molecule with a charged methylamine head group and a glucose-like hydrophilic tail, making it 6.4-&#x000c5; wide and 12-&#x000c5; long (&#x0223c;7.3 &#x000c5; in mean diameter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Villarroel et al., 1995</xref>). NMDG<sup>+</sup> permeation has been reported in a few ion channels, such as ATP-gated P2X channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khakh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Virginio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eickhorst et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Q. Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujiwara and Kubo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2006</xref>), epithelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel ECaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nilius et al., 2000</xref>), glutamate receptor channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ciani et al., 1997</xref>), and some mechanosensitive channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shiga and Wangemann, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lawonn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">T. Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang and Bourque, 2006</xref>). Recently, a slight permeation of NMDG<sup>+</sup> through voltage sensor pores has been reported in mutant Nav1.4 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sokolov et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast to its permeation, block by NMDG<sup>+</sup> has been widely observed in K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and other ion channels. Internal NMDG<sup>+</sup> acts on <italic>Shaker</italic> channels as an open-channel blocker, impeding activation gate closure and thus prolonging deactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Melishchuk and Armstrong, 2001</xref>). NMDG<sup>+</sup> also produces a very rapid block of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels from the inside of the membrane, but not the outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lippiat et al., 1998</xref>). Because it does not permeate most ion channels, NMDG<sup>+</sup> has been widely used as a substitute for permeant cations, such as K<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heinemann et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perozo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Villarroel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Melishchuk and Armstrong, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Potassium channels of the Kv3 family have some unique biophysical properties among the Kv channel subfamilies. They activate at more negative potentials and have remarkably fast activation and deactivation kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rudy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>). These gating properties mirror those of certain endogenous neuronal K<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brew and Forsythe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perney and Kaczmarek, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Southan and Robertson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lien and Jonas, 2003</xref>). In addition to those atypical gating properties, here we show that Kv3 channels also have unusual permeation properties, becoming permeable to NMDG<sup>+</sup> in the absence of K<sup>+</sup>. The permeation of NMDG<sup>+</sup> implies that the selectivity filter of Kv3 channels is capable of expanding dramatically to accommodate an NMDG<sup>+</sup> ion. Furthermore, a tyrosine residue at the outer pore region (TVGYGDM<bold>Y</bold>) of Kv3 channels has been identified as a crucial component in the control of the permeability, suggesting that the structural support of the TVGYG sequence can be altered by changing the property of this residue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Molecular biology and cell culture</title><p>Two forms of rat Kv3 channels, Kv3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luneau et al., 1991b</xref>) and 3.2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luneau et al., 1991a</xref>), as well as human Kv1.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fedida et al., 1993</xref>), were used in these experiments. The wild-type (WT) Kv3.1 and Kv1.5 R487Y/V mutant channels were separately expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells to form stable lines, whereas the WT Kv3.2b, Kv3.2b P468W, WT Kv1.5, and Kv1.5 W472F/R487Y were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells. The mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 was used for expression of the channels which were sequenced to check for errors before being used in transient transfections. HEK cells were grown in MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37&#x000b0;C in an air/5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. For transient transfection, HEK cells were plated at 20&#x02013;30% confluence on sterile glass coverslips in 25-mm Petri dishes and incubated overnight. The channel DNA was incubated with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) cDNA to identify the transfected cells efficiently (2 &#x000b5;g eGFP and 2 &#x000b5;g of channel DNA) and 3 &#x000b5;l LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in 100 &#x000b5;l of serum-free medium for 30 min, and then added to the dishes containing HEK 293 cells in 2 ml MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 5 h of incubation, the culture medium was changed and the cells were incubated overnight before recording. Cells that expressed eGFP were selected for patch clamp experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Coverslips with adherent cells were removed from the incubator before experiments and placed in a superfusion chamber (volume of 250 &#x000b5;l) containing the control bath solution at an ambient temperature (22&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C). The bath solution was exchanged by switching the perfusates at the inlet of the chamber, with complete bath solution changes taking 5&#x02013;10 s. Whole cell current recording and data analysis were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp 8 software (MDS Analytical Technologies). Patch electrodes were fabricated using thin-walled borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments) and fire polished to improve seal resistance. Electrodes had resistances of &#x0223c;1&#x02013;3 M&#x003a9; when filled with the filling solutions. Capacity compensation was routinely used in all whole cell recordings, and 80% series resistance compensation was only used when recording in excess of 5 nA of whole cell current. Measured series resistance was between 1 and 3 M&#x003a9; for all recordings. When the series resistance changed during the course of an experiment, data were discarded. A &#x0201c;-P/6&#x0201d; protocol was used for the online subtraction of the leakage and capacitive currents. The potential used for delivery of leak subtraction pulses was &#x02212;90 to &#x02212;110 mV. Data were filtered using a 4-pole Bessel filter with an <italic>f</italic><sub>c</sub> of 10 kHz and sampled at 10&#x02013;100 kHz. Membrane potentials have not been corrected for small junction potentials that arose between bath and pipette solutions.</p><p>All charge measurements (<italic>Q</italic><sub>on</sub> and <italic>Q</italic><sub>off</sub>) were obtained by integrating the currents during the depolarizations (<italic>Q</italic><sub>on</sub>) and the repolarizations (<italic>Q</italic><sub>off</sub>) over sufficient time to allow the currents to return to the baseline. The time course of the decaying tail currents was fit with a single-exponential function: <italic>a*exp(&#x02212;t/&#x003c4;)+c</italic>, where <italic>a</italic> is the initial current amplitude, <italic>&#x003c4;</italic> is the time constant, and <italic>c</italic> represents an offset.

The data are presented throughout as mean &#x000b1; SEM. Statistical analyses were conducting using one-way ANOVA.</p><p>For recordings of NMDG<sup>+</sup> currents, patch pipettes contained (in mM): 140 NMDG<sup>+</sup>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES. The solution was adjusted to pH 7.2 with HCl. The bath solution contained (in mM): 140 NMDG<sup>+</sup>, 10 HEPES, 10 dextrose, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub> and was adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl. Throughout, the subscripts <sub>i</sub> or <sub>o</sub> denote intra- or extracellular ion concentrations, respectively. All chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich. All water used in these experiments was passed through organic filters and two-stage distillation before a Milli-Q de-ionizing system (Millipore) that returned water with specific resistance of &#x0223c;20 M&#x003a9;&#x000b7;cm at 25&#x000b0;C. Any contaminating K<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> in the water used for the solutions was below detection limits (&#x0003c;2.6 &#x000b5;M for K<sup>+</sup> and &#x0003c;2.2 &#x000b5;M for Na<sup>+</sup>), measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (CANTEST). The purity of NMDG from Sigma-Aldrich was reported to be &#x02265;99%, and there was a measured contamination of &#x0223c;33 &#x000b5;M K<sup>+</sup> and &#x0223c;14 &#x000b5;M Na<sup>+</sup> in the 140-mM NMDG<sup>+</sup> solutions (CANTEST). Because the central aim of this work was to examine the permeation of NMDG<sup>+</sup> through Kv3 channels, it was important to discount the actions of any contaminating permeant ions. For that reason, we repeated the examination of NMDG<sup>+</sup> permeation by using a highly purified NMDG<sup>+</sup> (99.9%) from Spectrum. The NMDG<sup>+</sup> from Spectrum gave rise to an undetectable level of K<sup>+</sup> (&#x0003c;2.6 &#x000b5;M) and 11 &#x000b5;M Na<sup>+</sup> in the140-mM NMDG<sup>+</sup> solutions. The data in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200810139/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link> show that NMDG<sup>+</sup> tail currents persisted under these conditions and that the further addition of 1 mM Na<sup>+</sup> to the extracellular NMDG<sup>+</sup> solution reduced the observed tail current, which we explain by competition for permeation through the channel between NMDG<sup>+</sup> and this added Na<sup>+</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>The supplemental material provides further support that NMDG<sup>+</sup> ions carry the inward tail currents in the experiments with symmetrical NMDG<sup>+</sup>.

Furthermore, the addition of 1 mM Na<sup>+</sup> to the extracellular NMDG<sup>+</sup> solution reduced the amplitude of the tail current. This phenomenon can be explained by competition for permeation through the channel between NMDG<sup>+</sup> and this added Na<sup>+</sup>.

Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> shows experiments to record Kv3 channel gating current, in which symmetrical 140 mM NMDG<sup>+</sup> was substituted for K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> in the solutions, an ionic condition often used in Kv channel gating current studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heinemann et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perozo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Melishchuk and Armstrong, 2001</xref>). With these solutions, depolarizations failed to elicit any current in the untransfected HEK cells, confirming the abolition of cationic conductance through the endogenous K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). When the same experiment was repeated with the HEK cells transiently expressing rat WT Kv3.2b channels, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, upward transient current deflections were observed during the depolarizations. These are on-gating currents that originate from the displacement of the charged residues in voltage-sensing domains, mostly in S4 segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noda et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Papazian et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shao and Papazian, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perozo et al., 1994</xref>). However, if the depolarization was more positive than &#x02212;40 mV, when the membrane was repolarized to &#x02212;100 mV, robust inward deactivating currents appeared during the repolarization. The amplitudes of the inward currents were much larger than the amplitude of the on-gating currents during the depolarizations, so that the charge returned during repolarization (<italic>Q</italic><sub>off</sub>) was much larger than that moved during the prior depolarization (<italic>Q</italic><sub>on</sub>). The magnitude of <italic>Q</italic><sub>off</sub> increased in a voltage-dependent manner when the depolarizations were over &#x02212;40 mV and saturated at the potentials over &#x0223c;0 mV.

First, a nonconducting mutant of the rat Kv3.2b channel was created by converting P468, the first proline of the PVP motif in the S6 helix, to tryptophan (P468W; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>, inset). This nonconducting mutation is analogous to <italic>Shaker</italic> P473W (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hackos et al., 2002</xref>), in which the structural alterations of the activation gate prevent the channel from opening during activation. Transient expression of Kv3.2b P468W channels in HEK cells allows the recording of gating currents as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>. When membrane voltage is stepped back to &#x02212;100 mV, the inward currents appear as transient downward current deflections after 12-ms pulses to between &#x02212;80 and +60 mV, and compared with the recordings from WT channels shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, it is obvious that the large inward currents during repolarization seen there have been eliminated in this S6 mutant channel. The amplitude of the inward tail current was only modestly larger than the amplitude of on-gating current with an averaged ratio of Q<sub>off</sub>/Q<sub>on</sub> of 1.5&#x02013;2 over the range of voltages from &#x02212;50 to +80 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, B and D</xref>), much less than that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>. In addition, the inward tail currents remained fast with monoexponential kinetics during the decay. The time constant of relaxation of the inward tail current (&#x003c4;<sub>off</sub>) was &#x0223c;0.6 ms over the range of voltages from &#x02212;60 to +80 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>).

Hence, the lack of significant inward NMDG<sup>+</sup> current in the Kv3.2b P468W mutant channel resulted from the closing of the activation gate, supporting the idea that the permeation path for NMDG<sup>+</sup> ions is the central ion-conducting pore, i.e., through the selectivity filter.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Lack of inward NMDG<sup>+</sup> currents in cells expressing Kv3.2b P468W channels.

However, they do not establish the nature of the conducting channel state. Potassium channels are typically highly selective for K<sup>+</sup> ions over other cations in their open state, but the ion selectivity of K<sup>+</sup> channels is altered along with conformational changes of the channel protein. One example is C-type inactivated <italic>Shaker</italic> and Kv channels that do not pass significant amounts of K<sup>+</sup>, but become permeable to Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Starkus et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiss et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2000a</xref>). As well, in the absence of internal and external K<sup>+</sup>, <italic>Shaker</italic> and some Kv channels show rapid increases in Na<sup>+</sup> permeability as a result of accelerated C-type inactivation. Because many of the experiments we describe here were performed in the absence of internal or external K<sup>+</sup>, it is possible that although slow inactivation appears absent in these channels, it may be enhanced in the absence of K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Fedida, 2001</xref>), and thus that NMDG<sup>+</sup> currents are passing through inactivated channels. Interestingly, it is thought that 4-AP cannot block inactivated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Castle et al., 1994</xref>), so the observation that 4-AP blocks NMDG<sup>+</sup> currents quite effectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>) argues against the channels being C-type inactivated and supports the hypothesis that they are in the open state.</p><p>If the permeation of NMDG<sup>+</sup> is through the open Kv3 channel pore, NMDG<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions will occupy the conduction pathway, so mixtures of NMDG<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> should produce one of two possible changes of the reversal potential. If permeation of NMDG<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> through the channel is mutually exclusive, the reversal potential for the currents should be at the equilibrium potential of one of the ions. On the other hand, if both K<sup>+</sup> and NMDG<sup>+</sup> can permeate open Kv3 channels at low concentrations of K<sup>+</sup>, mixtures of K<sup>+</sup> and NMDG<sup>+</sup> should show an intermediate reversal potential, governed by the permeability ratio, <italic>P</italic><sub>K</sub><sup>+</sup>/<italic>P</italic><sub>NMDG</sub><sup>+</sup>, of the two ions.

Here, apart from demonstrating a significant NMDG<sup>+</sup> permeability in Kv3 channels, we also confirmed the lack of NMDG<sup>+</sup> conductance in a Kv1 family channel, Kv1.5. This led us to compare the amino acid sequences in the pore of Kv3 and Kv1.5 channels to attempt to identify a molecular mechanism underlying the permeability to NMDG<sup>+</sup>. The pore helix and selectivity filter region are highly conserved, and only four differences are seen between Kv3.1, Kv3.2b, and Kv1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>). One of these is an Arg residue located at the outer pore region in Kv1.5 (R487), which is the positional equivalent of T449 in <italic>Shaker</italic>. In Kv3.1 and Kv3.2b, this is replaced by a Tyr residue that confers a high affinity to extracellular TEA<sup>+</sup> binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacKinnon and Yellen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fedida et al., 1999</xref>) and is suggested to inhibit C-type inactivation in Kv channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lopez-Barneo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 1996</xref>).

Clearly, the pore mutation W472F blocked the permeation of NMDG<sup>+</sup>, despite the presence of a Tyr at 487, and further, the lack of NMDG<sup>+</sup> current through the permanently inactivated W472F channels strongly suggested that NMDG<sup>+</sup> conduction in the Kv3 and Kv1.5 R487Y/V channels cannot be through inactivated channels, but must be through the ion-conducting pore in its open state.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Permeation of NMDG<sup>+</sup> in Kv3 channels</title><p>Here, we describe a novel permeability to NMDG<sup>+</sup> in Kv3.1, 3.2b, and Kv1.5 R487Y/V channels. NMDG<sup>+</sup> is a much larger molecule than K<sup>+</sup>, and the ability of the pore to allow NMDG<sup>+</sup> to permeate suggests a significant flexibility in the structure of the selectivity filter, more so than previously thought, and we ascribe this regulation of selectivity filter diameter to a residue external to the filter itself. In this study, the permeability to NMDG<sup>+</sup> was tested in rat Kv3.1 and Kv3.2b channels, but because the composition of amino acids is very conserved in the pore region of Kv3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rudy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shealy et al., 2003</xref>), it is very likely that all Kv3 subfamily channels share this permeability to NMDG<sup>+</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Asymmetrical gating currents in Kv3 channels inhibited by 4-AP and TEA</title><p>This work began with unusual gating current recordings from HEK cells expressing WT Kv3.1 and 3.2b channels. With the symmetrical NMDG<sup>+</sup> solutions that are often used, the recorded &#x0201c;off-gating currents&#x0201d; were much larger than the on-gating currents at the voltages over the activation threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2 B</xref>), showing a larger amount of charge returned during deactivation than moved during activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2 D</xref>). Such gating current recordings are different from those obtained from <italic>Shaker</italic> and other Kv channels, in which the <italic>Q</italic><sub>off</sub> is usually equal to or less than <italic>Q</italic><sub>on</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perozo et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bezanilla et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 1999</xref>). It is clear that the larger tail currents obtained in Kv3 channels were not due to any contamination from the endogenous channels, and that they could be reduced to a magnitude equal to or less than the on-gating currents by replacing NMDG<sup>+</sup><sub>o</sub> with TEA<sup>+</sup><sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). These data suggested that the larger tail currents resulted from contamination by ionic NMDG<sup>+</sup> currents during repolarization. Both 4-AP and TEA<sup>+</sup><sub>o</sub> could inhibit the inward NMDG<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), and mutations made in the deep pore or at the activation gate to prevent the ions from entering the selectivity filter also successfully abolished the NMDG<sup>+</sup> current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>), suggesting that NMDG<sup>+</sup> passed through the ion-conducting pore of the channels. Because NMDG<sup>+</sup> currents had a voltage dependence that matched channel opening rather than <italic>Q</italic><sub>on</sub>, this also suggests that they are associated with pore opening rather than a secondary conduction pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> block of NMDG<sup>+</sup> currents</title><p>Internal Mg<sup>2+</sup> strongly blocks the outward NMDG<sup>+</sup> current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> has also been reported to produce a small block of macroscopic K<sup>+</sup> current at very positive potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friederich et al., 2003</xref>), but this seems less significant than the block of NMDG<sup>+</sup> current seen here. This may not be directly related to the different ionic diameters because although Mg<sup>2+</sup> is roughly half the diameter of K<sup>+</sup>, fully hydrated Mg<sup>2+</sup> is somewhat bigger (&#x0223c;10 &#x000c5;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lunin et al., 2006</xref>) than a hydrated K<sup>+</sup>, which is &#x0223c;8 &#x000c5; in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang and Sachs, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khodakhah et al., 1997</xref>). It is possible that hydrated Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the inner vestibule provides a more effective barrier preventing NMDG<sup>+</sup> access to the selectivity filter than it does for K<sup>+</sup>. Interestingly, we found that the block of outward NMDG<sup>+</sup> current by internal Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions could be relieved by very large depolarizations, which suggested that Mg<sup>2+</sup> needed to overcome a large energy barrier to pass through the selectivity filter, perhaps one required to dehydrate Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that strong depolarizations can deform the selectivity filter structure and allow permeation.</p></sec><sec><title>NMDG<sup>+</sup> conduction through the open channel</title><p>The selectivity of Kv channels varies with conformation, giving state-dependent ion selectivity.

Because NMDG<sup>+</sup> currents were recorded in the absence of K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), conformational and functional changes such as enhanced C-type inactivation might have occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Starkus et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Fedida, 2001</xref>). The addition of 0.3 and 1 mM K<sup>+</sup> to the external NMDG<sup>+</sup> solution positively shifted the reversal potential from &#x02212;5.5 mV for symmetrical NMDG<sup>+</sup> to +10.2 and +25.2 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>), with little change in <italic>P</italic><sub>K</sub><sup>+</sup>/<italic>P</italic><sub>NMDG</sub><sup>+</sup>. This permeability ratio (<italic>P</italic><sub>K</sub><sup>+</sup>/<italic>P</italic><sub>NMDG</sub><sup>+</sup>) also governed the shifts of reversal potential in the mixtures of K<sup>+</sup> and NMDG<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). These observations can be explained by a permeation of both NMDG<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions through Kv3 channels in their open state. Alternatively, if channels were inactivated or in other states that allowed NMDG<sup>+</sup> but not K<sup>+</sup> permeation, low concentrations of K<sup>+</sup> might produce a block of NMDG<sup>+</sup> permeation without itself conducting, but would not change the observed reversal potential.</p><p>NMDG<sup>+</sup> conduction through the open state was further supported by experiments with the Kv1.5 W472F/R487Y channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, D and E</xref>). As the Kv1.5 W472F mutation permanently inactivates channels, the failure to record NMDG<sup>+</sup> current from cells expressing the construct strongly indicates that the inactivated channels were unable to conduct NMDG<sup>+</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Expansion of the narrow selectivity filter</title><p>The crystal structures of KcsA and Kv1.2 channels show that the open intracellular gate can be as wide as 10 &#x000c5;, and the deeper internal cavity has a diameter of &#x0223c;10 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2005</xref>), so that neither of these structures should be a barrier for the entry of NMDG<sup>+</sup> to the base of the selectivity filter. The selectivity filter itself is lined by backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms, approximating the hydration shell of K<sup>+</sup> ions, and the Val and Tyr side chains from the V-G-Y-G sequence point away from the pore and make specific interactions with side chains of amino acids from the tilted pore helix. These structural constraints hold the selectivity filter open at its proper diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>), as wide as only one or two atomic diameters. Such a narrow pore allows the carbonyl oxygen atoms to coordinate dehydrated K<sup>+</sup> ions, but not smaller Na<sup>+</sup> ions, to give the selectivity over Na<sup>+</sup> seen in K<sup>+</sup> channels. The number of carbonyl oxygen atoms that surround permeating ions is the most important factor in determining ion selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Varma and Rempe, 2007</xref>), so there must be sufficient structural rigidity to maintain the carbonyl ligation environment. Consequently, a selectivity filter one or two atomic diameters wide cuts off the permeation of larger particles. Biophysical studies show that the largest permeant metal ion in K<sup>+</sup> channels is Rb<sup>+</sup>, suggesting a selectivity filter with a maximum inner diameter of around 3 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bezanilla and Armstrong, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hille, 1973</xref>), which is in good agreement with data from the crystal structures of KcsA and Kv1.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2005</xref>). The sharpness of the permeability cutoff for K<sup>+</sup> channels implies that the selectivity filter is not easily expanded further.</p><p>The permeability to NMDG<sup>+</sup> observed in Kv3 channels is therefore surprising, suggesting an expansibility or plasticity of the selectivity filter in Kv channels. Such a dramatic enlargement of the pore, similar to the phenomenon reported in some P2X channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khakh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Virginio et al., 1999</xref>), has never been reported in Kv channels. There is only one amino acid difference between the filter sequence of Kv1.5 and Kv3 channels, TVGYG in Kv1.5 and TLGYG in Kv3 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>), and it seems unlikely that a single change of V to L would make the selectivity filter of Kv3 channels better able to conduct NMDG<sup>+</sup> than Kv1.5 because of their chemical similarity. Alternatively, the protein packing around the selectivity filter could be an important factor in allowing flexibility of the selectivity filter, as suggested by crystal structure and biophysical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cordero-Morales et al., 2007</xref>). And indeed, the data in the present study suggest an important role for Tyr residues in the outer pore.</p></sec><sec><title>Control of the permeability by an outer pore residue</title><p>A Tyr residue in the outer pore of Kv3 channels (Y407 in Kv3.1 and Y444 in Kv3.2b) appears to be responsible for the permeability to NMDG<sup>+</sup>, as Kv1.5 with an Arg at the equivalent site, R487, does not conduct NMDG<sup>+</sup> at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 1999</xref>), whereas mutation of Arg to either Tyr or Val in Kv1.5 R487Y/V allows NMDG<sup>+</sup> permeation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). The equivalent residue in <italic>Shaker</italic> (T449) was originally identified as part of the high affinity TEA binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacKinnon and Yellen, 1990</xref>). Mutation of T to Y results in even higher affinity TEA<sup>+</sup> binding, whereas mutation of T to a charged residue results in a loss of external TEA<sup>+</sup> sensitivity as exemplified in Kv1.5. The mechanisms underlying external TEA<sup>+</sup> binding are well understood from biophysical, pharmacological, and crystal structure studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacKinnon and Yellen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kavanaugh et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lenaeus et al., 2005</xref>). The aromatic side chains of Y or the aliphatic hydroxyl side chain of T form a receptor for TEA<sup>+</sup> where it can bind and occlude the pore. All Kv3 subfamily channels have a Tyr residue at the equivalent site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rudy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shealy et al., 2003</xref>) and are very sensitive to external TEA<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rudy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The interaction between outer pore and pore helix residues has also been suggested to be key in initiating and stabilizing the constriction of the selectivity filter during C-type inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cordero-Morales et al., 2007</xref>). We also noted that when Kv3.1 channels conduct Na<sup>+</sup> current, C-type inactivation is reduced (not depicted) as in Kv1.5 R487V/Y mutant channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2000b</xref>). And so, it seems that this Tyr residue plays a similar role in determining many of the biophysical and pharmacological properties of Kv3 channels as it does in <italic>Shaker</italic> and other Kv1 channels. The molecular mechanisms underlying the NMDG<sup>+</sup> permeability of Kv3 channels remain to be fully understood, but some speculations are possible. This outer pore residue may regulate the flexibility of the selectivity filter directly, perhaps by affecting the interaction between the residues of selectivity filter and the pore helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cordero-Morales et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, the action of Y407/444 in Kv3 channels may be indirect, as in Kv1.5 where the mutation of R487 to Y or V reduces C-type inactivation of the selectivity filter. In this case, the presence of Y407/444 may prevent Kv3.1/3.2b channels from undergoing the conformational changes associated with C-type inactivation, and this might reduce the ability of the pore to cut off the permeation of larger ions. In native Kv3 channels, the selectivity filter may remain in a more flexible open state, allowing NMDG<sup>+</sup> ions to enter and then expand the pore to go through.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material Index</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200810139_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jgp.200810139_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr. D.
