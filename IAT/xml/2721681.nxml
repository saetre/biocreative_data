SIRT1 increases survival in response to stress such as DNA damage by deacetylating a number of substrates including pro-apoptotic protein p53. The molecular mechanism by which DNA-damage activates SIRT1 is not known. By screening a kinase inhibitor library, we identified CK2 as a SIRT1 kinase. CK2 is a pleiotropic kinase with more than 300 substrates and well-known anti-apoptotic and pro-growth activities. We find that CK2 is recruited to SIRT1 after ionizing radiation (IR) and phosphorylates conserved residues Ser 154, 649, 651 and 683 in the N- and C-terminal domains of mouse SIRT1. Phosphorylation of SIRT1 increases its deacetylation rate but not if the four Ser residues are mutated. In addition, phosphorylation of SIRT1 increases its substrate-binding affinity. CK2-mediated phosphorylation increases the ability of SIRT1 to deacetylate p53 and protect cells from apoptosis after DNA damage. Based on these findings, we propose that CK2 protects against IR-induced apoptosis partly by phosphorylating and activating SIRT1. Thus, this work suggests that SIRT1 is a component of the expansive anti-apoptotic network controlled by CK2. Since expression of both CK2 and SIRT1 is upregulated with tumorigenesis and downregulated with senescence, the CK2-SIRT1 link sheds new light on how CK2 may regulate cancer development and aging.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sirtuins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006611-Haigis1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, which are composed of seven members (SIRT1- SIRT7), are class III histone/protein deacetylases (HDAC).

The consensus sequence for CK2 phosphorylation is S/TXXD/E, where X can be any amino acid residue. There are four evolutionarily-conserved CK2 consensus sequences (Ser 154,649,651,683) within the CK2 phosphorylated regions of SIRT1 (&#x0002a;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). To identify the CK2 phosphorylation sites, we mutated the four CK2 consensus sites to Ala either individually or in groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g002">Fig. 2D&#x02013;I</xref>).

Compared with WT SIRT1, the 2A and 4A mutants showed progressively decreasing phosphorylation intensity. Even in 4A mutant, there was some residual phosphorylation, indicating that other kinase(s) also phosphorylate SIRT1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. To directly visualize phosphorylation at these four Ser residues, we attempted to make phospho-specific antibodies recognizing each of the four phosphorylated Ser residues. However, due to the acidic nature of some of these sites, we were able to make a phospho-specific antibody only for Ser 649 (Ser 659 in human SIRT1). To test the specificity of the phospho-S649 (P-S649) antibody, we performed CK2 kinase reactions using either WT or 4A SIRT1 as substrates with or without TBCA in the reaction mixture. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, P-S649 antibody recognized SIRT1 phosphorylated by CK2 <italic>in vitro</italic> but not 4A SIRT1. P-S649 antibody also recognized WT but not 4A SIRT1 in transiently transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Ser 649 phosphorylation of endogenous SIRT1 was poorly visible in untreated cells but was induced 90 min after IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). The interaction between SIRT1 and the two catalytic subunits of CK2 also increased significantly 90 min after IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). To demonstrate that SIRT1 phosphorylation is mediated by CK2, we transiently expressed SIRT1 along with siRNA for either a scrambled sequence or for both catalytic subunits of CK2 (&#x003b1; and &#x003b1;'). Two hours before they were harvested, cells were exposed to IR to induce Ser 649 phosphorylation. Knock-down of CK2 dramatically reduced Ser 649 phosphorylation, indicating that CK2 phosphorylates Ser 649 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). In agreement with this, treatment of cells with CK2-inhibitor TBCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>) or coexpression of kinase-dead (KD) CK2 &#x003b1;' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>) significantly inhibited Ser 649 phosphorylation. Our inability to detect Ser 649 phosphorylation in endogenous SIRT1 without IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>) was unexpected because CK2 has high basal activity and also because we did not use IR when we discovered through our kinase inhibitor screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) that TBCA inhibited SIRT1 phosphorylation. We believe that this apparent contradiction is due to the low sensitivity of P-S649 antibody.

Acetylation of p53 increases its affinity to the target DNA sequence and thus its transcriptional activity. We investigated the effect of CK2 on SIRT1 activity in U2OS cells using p53 (K382) acetylation as the endogenous marker for the deacetylase activity of SIRT1. The acetylation level of K382 at any given moment is determined by the rate of acetylation and deacetylation at that moment. To determine the time course of CK2-mediated activation of SIRT1, we visualized acetylation of K382 at different time points after IR in cells transfected with siRNA for either a scrambled sequence or for both catalytic subunits of CK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Consistent with the observation that acetylation of K382 by p300 occurs 2 hr after IR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006611-Sakaguchi1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, K382 acetylation peaked 2 hr after IR. However, K382 acetylation at 2 hr was higher when CK2 was knocked-down and did not return to baseline even at 7 hr, indicating that CK2 increases the deacetylase activity of SIRT1. Although CK2 enhanced SIRT1 activity at 2 hr point, the acetylation level of K382 at this time is still higher than before IR, suggesting that p300 activity exceeds SIRT1 activity at 2 hr point. Although this experiment suggests that CK2-activated SIRT1 deacetylated p53, we cannot rule out the possibility that activated SIRT1 decreased p53 acetylation by an indirect mechanism, such as improved DNA repair leading to reduced p300-mediated acetylation of p53. However, as of now, there is no evidence that SIRT1 improves DNA repair.</p><p>In order to confirm that CK2 phosphorylation increases SIRT1 activity, we transiently expressed p53 along with WT SIRT1 or 4A SIRT1 in H1299 cells and monitored p53 acetylation. The deacetylase activity of WT SIRT1 was inhibited in the presence of TBCA but the deacetylase activity of 4A SIRT1, which was lower than that of WT SIRT1, was insensitive to TBCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Since there is a possibility that the effect of TBCA on SIRT1 activity was due to an off-target hit of TBCA, we overexpressed kinase-dead (KD) CK2 &#x003b1;' to inhibit the CK2 activity in a dominant-negative fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). The deacetylase activity of WT SIRT1 as measured by p53 deacetylation was suppressed in the presence of KD CK2 &#x003b1;', but the deacetylase activity of 4A SIRT1 was not affected by KD CK2 &#x003b1;'. To determine if CK2 regulates deacetylation of other SIRT1 substrates, we repeated the experiment using RelA/p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B, another known SIRT1 substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006611-Yeung1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

We also tried to knock-down CK2 using siRNA specific for the catalytic subunits of CK2 in cells transiently expressing either WT or 4A SIRT1. However, we noticed that the combination of CK2 siRNA and 4A SIRT1 expression caused cell death, and therefore did not continue this experiment. Thus, CK2-dependent phosphorylation of SIRT1 stimulates the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 against at least two known substrates, p53 and NF-&#x003ba;B.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Phosphorylation by CK2 increases SIRT1 substrate-binding</title><p>Since the CK2 phosphorylation sites are distant from the Sirtuin domain of SIRT1, it is curious that deacetylation of its substrate is increased by CK2 phosphorylation. One possibility is that SIRT1 phosphorylation changes its substrate binding affinity. To investigate whether phosphorylation by CK2 affects SIRT1-substrate interaction, we performed a GST-pull down assay using acetylated GST-p53 fusion protein and WT or 4A mutant SIRT1 that has been preincubated with CK2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, preincubation of WT SIRT1 with CK2 increased WT SIRT1-p53 interaction in a TBCA-sensitive manner. In contrast, preincubation of 4A SIRT1 with CK2 did not affect SIRT1-p53 interaction. To determine if acetylation of the substrate is required for the increased SIRT1-p53 interaction, we also performed the GST-pull down assay using unacetylated GST-p53. CK2-mediated phosphorylation increased SIRT1 interaction with unacetylated GST-p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, bottom), indicating that the acetyl-group on the substrate is not a feature that is required for the enhanced affinity. Taken together, these findings indicate that one mechanism by which CK2-mediated phosphorylation increases SIRT1 deacetylase activity is increasing interaction with its substrate. We cannot rule out the possibility that CK2-mediated phosphorylation also increases SIRT1 activity by other mechanisms.</p><fig id="pone-0006611-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006611.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Phoshorylation by CK2 increases SIRT1-p53 interaction.</title><p>GST-pull down experiment was performed with GST-p53 (acetylated) using WT (top) and 4A SIRT1 (center) phosphorylated with CK2 with or without TBCA.

The most commonly studied role of SIRT1 in stress resistance is p53 deacetylation and suppression of p53-induced apoptosis. To measure the effect of CK2-mediated phosphorylation of SIRT1 on p53 mediated apoptosis, H1299 cells were co-transfected with p53 and either WT or 4A SIRT1 and treated with the genotoxin etoposide for 24 hr. Quantification of apoptosis indicated that WT SIRT1 suppressed etoposide-induced apoptosis by 42&#x00025; and 4A SIRT1, by 16&#x00025;, compared to vector (pcDNA)-alone control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Thus, the CK2 phosphorylation sites are important for the anti-apoptotic effects of SIRT1. Since the 4A mutation does not significantly affect the intrinsic SIRT1 activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006611-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), the low magnitude of the anti-apoptotic effect of 4A SIRT1 is most likely due to the baseline protection from endogenous SIRT1 in all the samples.

Our results indicate that CK2 activates SIRT1 by phosphorylating four Ser residues in N- and C-terminal domains. Although very little is known about the function of the N- and C-terminal domains of SIRT1, our finding that CK2-mediated phosphorylation increases SIRT1-p53 interaction suggests that the N- and C-terminal domains regulate substrate recruitment. A full understanding of how these terminal domains and their phosphorylation regulate SIRT1 function is hampered by the lack of 3D structure information on the full-length SIRT1 or on the terminal domains. It remains to be determined whether CK2-mediated phosphorylation affects SIRT1 activity by simply increasing substrate recruitment or whether other mechanisms are also involved.</p><p>To our knowledge, this work represents the first identification of a signal pathway that activates the catalytic function of SIRT1 in response to DNA damage. While this work was in progress, Zschoernig et. al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006611-Zschoernig1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> reported that CK2 phosphorylates Ser 649/651 but did not determine whether phosphorylation affected SIRT1 in any way or under what conditions CK2 phosphorylates SIRT1. Also, Sasaki et. al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006611-Sasaki1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> reported that SIRT1 is activated by phosphorylation at multiple sites and two of these sites (Thr 530 and Ser 540 in human SIRT1) are phosphorylated by cyclinB/Cdk1, and mutation of these residues disturbed cell cycle progression. However, phosphorylation by cyclinB/Cdk1 <italic>in vitro</italic> did not affect the catalytic activity of SIRT1. Thus, it is not clear how phosphorylation by cyclinB/Cdk1 activates SIRT1 activity. Interestingly, SIRT1 activity is activated by sumoylation of Lys 734 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006611-Yang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>; and DNA-damage causes SENP1-mediated desumoylation and inhibition of SIRT1 activity. SIRT1 activity is also regulated by proteins that bind SIRT1 directly. AROS, which binds to the N-terminal domain of SIRT1, activates SIRT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006611-Kim2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. It is not known if AROS-SIRT1 interaction is regulated by DNA damage or other forms of stress.

Thus, these previous reports and our findings indicate that DNA-damage has both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on SIRT1 activity.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that CK2 can phosphorylate Ser 392 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006611-Meek1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> of p53 and enhance its activity by increasing tetramerization and DNA binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006611-Hupp1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.
