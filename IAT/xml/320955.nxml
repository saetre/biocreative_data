The fnr coding region (750 bp) was identified, and the initiation and termination points of fnr transcription were located by RNA:DNA hybridisation with single-stranded M13 probes. The DNA fragment also contained the 5' end of a separately transcribed gene of unknown function. The deduced molecular weight (27947) of the Fnr protein was in agreement with that of the protein identified by the maxicell procedure, and the primary structure contained regions of homology with several transcriptional regulator proteins.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00388-0402-a" xlink:role="6126"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00388-0395.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6119"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00388-0396.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6120"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00388-0397.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6121"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00388-0398.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6122"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00388-0399.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6123"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00388-0400.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6124"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00388-0401.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6125"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00388-0402.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6126"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00388-0403.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6127"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00388-0404.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6128"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00388-0405.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6129"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00388-0406.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6130"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
