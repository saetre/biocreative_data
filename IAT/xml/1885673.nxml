In order to gain biochemical insights into this process, we purified <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Hop2-Mnd1 to homogeneity. spHop2 and spMnd1 interact by co-immunoprecipitation and two-hybrid analysis. Electron microscopy reveals that <italic>S. pombe</italic> Hop2&#x02013;Mnd1 binds single-strand DNA ends of 3&#x02032;-tailed DNA. Interestingly, spHop2-Mnd1 promotes the renaturation of complementary single-strand DNA and catalyses strand exchange reactions with short oligonucleotides. Importantly, we show that spHop2-Mnd1 stimulates spDmc1-dependent strand exchange and strand invasion. Ca<sup>2+</sup> alleviate the requirement for the order of addition of the proteins on DNA. We also demonstrate that while spHop2-Mnd1 affects spDmc1 specifically, mHop2 or mHop2-Mnd1 stimulates both the hRad51 and hDmc1 recombinases in strand exchange assays. Thus, our results suggest a crucial role for <italic>S. pombe</italic> and mouse Hop2-Mnd1 in homologous pairing and strand exchange and reveal evolutionary divergence in their specificity for the Dmc1 and Rad51 recombinases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Diploid eukaryotes produce genetically recombined haploid gametes or spores through meiosis. This is achieved by one round of DNA replication followed by two successive rounds of nuclear division, meiosis I and meiosis II. These divisions are preceded by a distinctive meiotic prophase during which homologous chromosomes synapse and undergo genetic recombination between allelic and non-allelic positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Reciprocal recombination events, named crossovers, establish chiasmata, which are physical connections between homologs that ensure proper chromosome segregation at meiosis I. Meiosis II involves the segregation of sister chromatids and is therefore analogous to a mitotic division. Meiotic interhomolog recombination leads to an exchange of genetic material, contributes to genetic diversity and is required for proper chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Meiotic recombination in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is initiated by the creation of double-strand breaks by Spo11 (Rec12 in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>), a type II topoisomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Spo11 knock-out mice display chromosome synapsis defects suggesting that the initiation of recombination precedes and is required for normal chromosome synapsis during meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the Rec6, Rec7, Rec12, Rec14 and Rec15 proteins are essential for the creation of DNA double-strand breaks and meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The Mre11, Rad50 and Nbs1 proteins are involved in the processing of DSBs to form recombinogenic 3&#x02032;-single-stranded tailed DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The resected DSBs are then used to invade homologous duplex DNA, leading to the exchange of genetic information, a process that requires the RAD51 and DMC1 genes. Rad51 and the meiosis-specific protein Dmc1 are homologs of the bacterial recombinase RecA. <italic>In vitro</italic>, these proteins are, however, less efficient than their bacterial counterpart. Hence, there exist accessory cofactors that assist Dmc1 and Rad51. Dmc1 is helped specifically by Mei5 and Sae3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and Rad51 is aided by the members of the Rad52 group including Rad52, Rad54, Rad55 and Rad57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>), whereas Tid1/Rdh54 assists both recombinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence implicate Hop2 and Mnd1 in meiotic recombination. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Hop2 plays a crucial role in the proper alignment of homologs during meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Hop2 knock-out mice and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mutants show resemblance in their phenotypes such as spermatocyte arrest at the pachytene-like chromosome condensation and the failure in meiotic DSBs to be repaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Although the recombination defects of the Hop2 and Mnd1 mutants were thought to be an indirect consequence of the lack of chromosome pairing, studies have indicated that Hop2 and Mnd1 are directly involved in recombination. In budding yeast, <italic>hop2</italic> and <italic>mnd1</italic> mutants, meiotic cells arrest at the pachytene stage, double-strand breaks are not repaired properly and the Dmc1 and Rad51 recombinases accumulate on meiotic chromosomes at a high level but neither strand invasion, heteroduplex DNA or joint molecules are detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>). A decrease in intragenic recombination and homologous pairing is observed in <italic>S. pombe meu13</italic> mutants (a Hop2 homolog) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Mnd1 is suggested to be involved in strand invasion since <italic>mnd1-1</italic> mutant cells initiate recombination but do not form heteroduplex DNA or Holliday Junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Genetic analysis of the fission yeast ortholog Mcp7, revealed functions necessary for meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Because of the very similar phenotypes of the <italic>hop2</italic> and <italic>mnd1</italic> mutants, the Hop2&#x02013;Mnd1 proteins are thought to be involved in a common pathway leading to homology search during meiotic recombination. In fact, several lines of evidence suggest that Hop2 and Mnd1 both functions in a Dmc1-dependent pathway. First, the recombination phenotypes of the <italic>hop2</italic> and <italic>mnd1</italic> mutants are very similar to those of <italic>dmc1.</italic> Second, overexpression of RAD51 largely suppresses the meiotic defects of the dmc1 and hop2 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Third, in every genome analyzed to date, the presence of the HOP2 and MND1 genes correlates with that of DMC1. In particular, the genome of <italic>C. elegans</italic> or <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not contain Dmc1, Hop2 or Mnd1 while Rad51 is present.</p><p>Biochemical studies of Hop2-Mnd1 have led to several paradoxes. Purified budding yeast Hop2-Mnd1 only stimulates the strand invasion activity of Dmc1 by a modest 3-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Purified mHop2-Mnd1 stimulated strand invasion of hRad51 by about 10-fold and hDmc1 by 35-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) while in another study mouse Hop2 had no effect on human Rad51 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Finally, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and human Hop2-Mnd1 was found to bind dsDNA preferentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), which is not consistent with its role in strand invasion.</p><p>In this manuscript, we present biochemical evidence that fission yeast Hop2-Mnd1 binds ssDNA of 3&#x02032;-tailed molecules specifically by electron microscopy. spHop2-Mnd1 show properties reminiscent of recombinases, it can anneal long complementary single-strand DNAs and promote strand exchange. Moreover, D-loop and strand exchange assays revealed that spHop2-Mnd1 can activate spDmc1 efficiently. In addition, we show that mouse Hop2 and Hop2-Mnd1 can stimulate both human Rad51 and Dmc1 recombinases in strand exchange assays in accordance with the Yokohama group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). These results show that Hop2-Mnd1 participates in both the homologous pairing and strand exchange steps of homologous recombination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Nucleic acids and <italic>S. pombe</italic> techniques</title><p>Single-strand and double-strand &#x000f8;X174 DNA was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA, USA). pPB4.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) was prepared using Qiafilter plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).

Individual fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. By carefully selecting the fractions, the Hop2&#x02013;Mnd1 proteins were generally pure after this step. When necessary, a Mono S chromatography was performed and co-elution of spHop2-Mnd1 was observed. The purified proteins were free of endo- and exonuclease activities (data not shown). The predicted molecular weight of his-tagged Hop2 is 28 652 Da and his-tagged Mnd1 is 26 761 Da. Hence, the two proteins co-migrate on a SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, SDS-PAGE). Mass spectrometry was performed to confirm the purity of our preparation and the presence of both Hop2 and Mnd1 (data not shown). </p></sec><sec><title>Gel filtration and interactions between <italic>S. pombe</italic> Hop2 and Mnd1</title><p>The native molecular weight of the spHop2-Mnd1 protein preparation was determined by gel filtration through Superdex 200. The bulk of spHop2 and spMnd1 eluted in fractions 46&#x02013;50 suggesting that these proteins could form complexes containing a variable number of molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The corresponding molecular mass of these fractions range from 47 to 80&#x02009;kDa with a peak observed at 60&#x02009;kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lanes 54&#x02013;56). Native electrophoresis experiments revealed that our preparation contained two complexes of 40 and &#x0223c;66&#x02009;kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, native). Given the predicted molecular weight of his-tagged Hop2 (28.6&#x02009;kDa) and his-tagged Mnd1 (26.7&#x02009;kDa), this is indicative of multimeric forms composed of homo- or hetero-complexes. Monomeric Hop2 or Mnd1 were not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 56 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D).</p><p>In order to characterize these complexes, three experiments were conducted. First, we expressed spMnd1, spHop2 or both proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> and total and soluble extracts were prepared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). When expressed on their own, spMnd1 and spHop2 were not soluble (lanes d&#x02013;e). Solubility was only achieved if both proteins were co-expressed (lane f). Similar results were obtained in insect cells (data not shown). This result suggests that our protein preparation is composed of an hetero-complex of spHop2-Mnd1. Second, immunoprecipitations were conducted using cells extracts expressing Myc-tagged spMnd1 and His-tagged spHop2. Anti-Myc antibodies pulled down a complex between spMnd1 and spHop2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E, lane a). Third, the interactions of Hop2 and Mnd1 were further characterized by two-hybrid analysis. The AH109 strain (BD Bioscience) was co-transfected with plasmids encoding fusions to the Gal4 DNA binding and activation domains, respectively, and spotted on media lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine and adenine with 3-aminotriazole. Strong interactors are white in color because of the expression of the <italic>ADE</italic> gene. Co-expression of full-length spMnd1 fused to the Gal4 DNA binding and full-length spHop2 fused to the activation domains in yeast lead to growth of white colonies on omission media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F). Interactions were also observed when spHop2 fused to the Gal4 DNA binding and Mnd1 fused to the activation domain were co-transformed. The strength of interactions between spHop2 and Mnd1 was similar to spRad51 self-interactions, which indicates a strong interaction between the proteins. Truncations of spHop2 and spMnd1 in N-terminal and C-terminal portions revealed that the C-terminus of spHop2 (amino acids 111&#x02013;216) interacts with the C-terminal portion of spMnd1 (amino acids 107&#x02013;211). The N-terminus of spHop2 (amino acids 1&#x02013;110) and spMnd1 (amino acids 1&#x02013;106) did not interact with each other or the C-terminus of the proteins. Interestingly, spHop2 and spMnd1 self-interactions were also observed suggesting that these complexes can form <italic>in vivo</italic> although we were unable to get these proteins soluble when expressed on their own.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA binding by <italic>S. pombe</italic> Hop2-Mnd1</title><p>In the presence of ATP, RecA binds single-strand DNA preferentially over double-strand DNA because of a kinetic barrier to associate with dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). This difference in affinity is critical for strand exchange reactions since pairing occurs between single-strand DNA and a naked duplex DNA. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays were used to investigate the ssDNA- and dsDNA-binding properties of spHop2-Mnd1. spHop2-Mnd1 bound preferentially to ssDNA, over 3&#x02032;- or 5&#x02032;-tailed DNA or dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;D). We observed the formation of protein&#x02013;DNA networks that tended to smear up the gel, which is characteristic of the formation of networks containing a variable number of protein and DNA molecules. Quantification of the DNA&#x02013;protein complexes at 0.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M Hop2-Mnd1 indicated that 31% of the input ssDNA was stably bound compared with 10% for 3&#x02032;-tailed and 5&#x02032;-tailed DNA or 3% for dsDNA. The formation of protein&#x02013;DNA complexes on ssDNA was optimal at 50&#x02009;mM NaCl, supported in a wide range of Mg (CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub> concentrations (from 1 to 10&#x02009;mM; with an optimal concentration at 2&#x02009;mM) and was gradually reduced by inclusion of increasing concentrations of potassium chloride over 150&#x02009;mM (data not shown). Binding to ssDNA was observed both in the absence of ATP or ATP analogs suggesting that DNA binding can occur without ATP or ATP hydrolysis. </p></sec><sec><title>Strand annealing and strand exchange catalyzed by Hop2-Mnd1</title><p>We next investigated their ability to promote single-strand annealing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). Long single-strand DNA of 400 bases was used instead of oligonucleotides, which can be prone to artifacts. Interestingly, spHop2-Mnd1 promotes annealing of long complementary single stranded DNAs. Single-strand annealing was observed rapidly, within 0.5&#x02009;min (6%) and increased to a level of 16% after 10&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E, lanes g&#x02013;k). Low levels of spontaneous strand annealing were observed in the control alone (lanes b&#x02013;f). The renatured products were in the form of linear duplex as opposed to high molecular weight networks. Annealing by spHop2-Mnd1 could persist in the presence of a single-strand binding protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F). The functional analogy between RPA and SSB is supported by results indicating that SSB can substitute for budding yeast and human RPA in strand exchange mediated by <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and human Rad51, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). spHop2-Mnd1 annealing did not require ATP consistent with the fact that spHop2 or spMnd1 do not contain any known ATP-binding motif (data not shown).</p><p>Since spHop2-Mnd1 promoted strand annealing, a characteristic shared by the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Rad51 and Dmc1 recombinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), we investigated whether spHop2-Mnd1 possessed other recombination activities. We then examined the ability of purified Hop2-Mnd1 to promote strand exchange <italic>in vitro</italic> using a linear single-stranded DNA and homologous linear duplex DNA. spHop2-Mnd1 could perform strand exchange with oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>G, lane c&#x02013;l) but not with longer substrates (data not shown) suggesting that it has limited ability to do this reaction. The reaction did not require ATP hydrolysis but homologous single-strand DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>H, lanes b&#x02013;f, g). DNA strand exchange activity with oligonucleotides can be due to thermal opening of the duplex followed by subsequent annealing, as demonstrated for the RAD51C protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In order to eliminate this possibility, we performed experiments as described by Lio <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;B). First, no released ssDNA was produced when the DNA substrates were heterologous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, compare lanes a&#x02013;b). This result demonstrates that spHop2-Mnd1 DNA strand exchange is homology-dependent. Next, the standard homology-dependent experiment was carried out, with an excess of homologous ssDNA added to the stop buffer. The oligonucleotide used is of a different length (79-mer). DNA pairing was observed with homologous DNA but not heterologous DNA (compare lane c&#x02013;d). The level of pairing observed with heterologous DNA was similar to spontaneous reannealing (lane e). This result shows that spHop2-Mnd1 promotes strand exchange independently of a DNA melting activity. The temperature dependence of spHop2-Mnd1 strand exchange was also analyzed. Strand exchange increased over a period of 90&#x02009;min and was more efficient at 37&#x000b0;C than 30&#x000b0;C or and 20&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). This result is inconsistent with DNA melting which occurs within 5&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Since spHop2-Mnd1 are expected to function in concert with the spRad51 and spDmc1 recombinases during meiotic recombination we investigated whether spHop2-Mnd1 was able to stimulate spDmc1 and spRad51 strand exchange. We have previously shown that spRad51 and spDmc1 have strand exchange abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). When limiting concentrations of spDmc1 were used, only 2% of displaced ssDNA were produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lane d, 2% products). However, when spDmc1 was supplemented with spHop2-Mnd1&#x02009;at concentrations of 2&#x02013;5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, strand exchange occurred at a higher level than with either protein alone (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lanes g&#x02013;j to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>G, lanes e&#x02013;h). Quantification of the products at 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M spDmc1 and 4&#x02009;&#x003bc;M spHop2-Mnd1-Dmc1 revealed a 5-fold increase in activity compared to spHop2-Mnd1 alone. These results reveal that stimulation of spHop2-Mnd1 was specific for spDmc1, as the effect was not observed on Rad51 (data not shown). </p></sec><sec><title>Dmc1 strand invasion is stimulated by Hop2-Mnd1</title><p>spHop2-Mnd1 are also expected to help the spRad51 and spDmc1 recombinases during strand invasion. First, purified spHop2-Mnd1 was unable to perform strand invasion on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, lane g). Strikingly, spHop2-Mnd1 stimulated spDmc1 D-loop formation in a buffer containing magnesium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, lanes b&#x02013;f). At 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M Hop2-Mnd1&#x02009;a 8-fold increase was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E). This spDmc1-dependent spHop2-Mnd1 stimulatory effect was even greater in calcium buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes c&#x02013;h) and quantification of the products revealed a 17-fold increase in D-loop formation at 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M spHop2-Mnd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F). D-loop formation is a reversible reaction, known as the D-loop cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Therefore, we studied the reversibility of the D-loop assay using 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M spHop2-Mnd1, which was optimal for the magnesium and calcium reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E and F). In magnesium buffer, we observed a constant diminution of the D-loop reaction from 5 to 60&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C and G). Apparent reversibility of the D-loops may be due to nicking of the supercoiled plasmid DNA by contaminating nucleases. This possibility was ruled out since 4&#x02009;&#x003bc;M concentrations of spDmc1 or spH2M1 did not reveal any increase in the nicked DNA (data not shown). D-loop cycles were not observed in calcium buffer as D-loop products increased over a period of 60&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D and H). The order of addition of the proteins to the DNA in D-loop was assayed in a magnesium buffer. Stimulation of spHop2-Mnd1 on spDmc1 was maximal when Dmc1 was added to the ssDNA and spHop2-Mnd1 to the dsDNA and the two mixtures were combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes d and h). Intermediate levels of stimulation were observed when spDmc1 was loaded on the ssDNA, followed by spHop2-Mnd1 and the dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes b and f). When the ssDNA and dsDNA were premixed, followed by the addition of spDmc1 and spHop2-Mnd1, stimulation occurred at lower efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes c and g). Notably, spHop2-Mnd1 stimulated spDmc1 regardless of the order of addition in calcium buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes j&#x02013;p). These results suggest that calcium is an important regulator of spHop2-Mnd1 functions. As for strand exchange, SpHop2-Mnd1 enhanced the activity of spDmc1 specifically, as the effect was not observed on spRad51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). No stimulation of the D-loop formation was observed at concentrations of Rad51 and Hop2-Mnd1 up to 6 and 8&#x02009;mM, respectively. Negative results were also observed when various order of addition was used as well as different salt conditions and the use of non-hydrolysable ATP analogs ATPgS and AMP-PNP (data not shown). A number of different Rad51: Hop2-Mnd1 ratios were tested and at least two time points (8 and 30&#x02009;min) were taken for all reactions. Specific stimulation of Dmc1 but not Rad51 by Hop2&#x02013;Mnd1 complex was also observed in budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and Ting-Fang Wang, personal communication]. Therefore, we investigated whether spHop2-Mnd1 interacted with spDmc1 and spRad51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Pull-down assays revealed an interaction with both spRad51 and spDmc1. Hence, the specificity of spHop2-Mnd1 for spDmc1 is not due to protein&#x02013;protein interactions in solution. </p></sec><sec><title>hRad51 and hDmc1 strand exchange is stimulated by mouse Hop2 and Hop2-Mnd1</title><p>We were curious to verify whether this specificity was conserved during evolution. Using mouse Hop2 and Hop2-Mnd1, we next investigated its ability to promote hRad51 and hDmc1 strand exchange <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of larger substrates using a circular single-stranded DNA (4300 nucleotides) and homologous linear duplex DNA (400&#x02009;bp). Although the proteins used in this assay come from different species, it is important to note that the human and mouse Rad51 and Dmc1 recombinases are homologous at 98% at the amino acid level. When hDmc1 was used at subsaturating concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, lane c), we observed a strong stimulation by both mHop2-Mnd1 (lanes d&#x02013;e) and mHop2 (lane f). hRad51 strand exchange was also enhanced by increasing concentrations of mHop2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes d&#x02013;i) or mHop2-Mnd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C, lanes d&#x02013;i). Stimulation was also observed either when hRad51 or mHop2 was added to the ssDNA first, or when the proteins were premixed and added to the ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D, lanes d&#x02013;i). Enhancement of hRad51 or hDmc1 strand exchange by mHop2 or mHop2-Mnd1 required the presence of ATP. Strand transfer products were not observed when ATP was replaced by the non-hydrolysable form AMP-PNP, when Mg<sup>2+</sup> was omitted or when heterologous single-stranded DNA was used (data not shown). To ascertain whether mHop2 or mHop2-Mnd1 was able to stimulate hRad51 or hDmc1 activity specifically, and not any recombinase, we tested whether mHop2 was able to stimulate <italic>E. coli</italic> RecA. Very low level of strand exchange was observed in the presence of both proteins (data nor shown). Altogether, we conclude that mouse Hop2 or Hop2-Mnd1 can work in concert specifically with hRad51 or hDmc1 and not a distant homolog such as RecA. </p></sec><sec><title>Visualization of fission yeast Hop2-Mnd1 on DNA</title><p>When complexes formed between spHop2-Mnd1 and DNA were visualized by electron microscopy, we observed large protein complexes bound to single-strand DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, right). We also observed less frequently irregular filament-like structures possibly due to many molecules bound to the ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, left). Consistent with gel-retardation assays, spHop2-Mnd1 had high affinity for ssDNA since unbound protein was not distinguished. Because meiotic recombination is thought to be initiated by DNA that contains single-stranded tails, the possibility that spHop2-Mnd1 may bind specifically to tailed linear duplex molecules was investigated. Following uranyl acetate staining, duplex DNA is well visible while single-stranded DNA, if not bound by proteins, is collapsed to very small blobs or bushy structures. Consistent with a specific interaction with ssDNA, spHop2-Mnd1 (5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) selectively bound the ssDNA of linear duplex DNA molecules with ssDNA at both ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Very interestingly, the two ends of the tails were often found entangled in one and other, suggestive of homology search. Unbound spHop2-Mnd1 was also discerned (white arrow). In order to confirm specific interactions with ssDNA, we also observed binding of ssDNA ends at lower concentrations of spHop2-Mnd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). About 70% of the molecules observed had spHop2-Hop2&#x02009;at both extremities. These results are consistent with specific roles for spHop2-Mnd1 in strand invasion during meiotic homologous recombination. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The DNA strand exchange activity of both Rad51 and Dmc1 is critical for proper meiotic DNA double-strand break repair in lower eukaryotes.

Much attention is now turned toward the Hop2 and Mnd1 proteins because of their important roles in meiotic recombination.</p><sec id="SEC23"><title><italic>S. pombe</italic> Hop2 and Mnd1 form a complex binding ssDNA preferentially</title><p>Sequence analysis revealed that Hop2 and Mnd1 possesses a coiled-coil motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Fission yeast Hop2 coiled-coil region spans amino acids 128&#x02013;159 whereas spMnd1 possess a long coiled-coil from amino acids 82 to 149. Using two-hybrid analysis we showed that spHop2 interacts with spMnd1. Domain mapping experiments revealed that the C-terminus of spHop2 (amino acids 111&#x02013;216) interacts with the C-terminal portion of spMnd1 (amino acids 107&#x02013;211). Hence, it is not the complete coiled-coiled region of spMnd1 that is required for the interaction with spHop2. These results are in accordance with a recent report showing that mouse Hop2 and Mnd1 interact through their coil&#x02013;coil motif and that the C-terminus of the protein is important for the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Gel filtration experiments revealed that spHop2-Mnd1 eluted in a broad profile, suggesting that it can form structures containing a variable number of molecules. However, our results suggest that purified spHop2-Mnd1 strictly forms a hetero-complex in solution. Indeed, we were unsuccessful in detecting soluble spHop2 or spMnd1 alone suggesting that these proteins are unstable without each other. In accordance with this, the overexpression of Mnd1 suppressed a temperature-sensitive mutant allele of Hop2 in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Instability of Hop2 without Mnd1 was also observed with the human homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The 40&#x02009;kDa complex observed by native electrophoresis thus corresponds to spHop2-Mnd1. The 66&#x02009;kDa complex most likely corresponds to a dimer of Hop2 bound to Mnd1 (or a dimer of Mnd1 bound to Hop2) or spHop2-Mnd1 having a different conformation. It is most likely that one or both of these spHop2&#x02013;Mnd1 complexes exist <italic>in vivo</italic>. Immunoprecipitation analyses from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> meiotic cell extracts revealed that Hop2-Myc and Mnd1-GFP interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Moreover, in pat1 fission yeast strain, Hop2-GFP and Mnd1-HA show almost identical expression profiles during meiosis and both proteins interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation, of mouse Hop2 and Mnd1 has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). We do not exclude the possibility of other spHop2&#x02013;Mnd1 complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>. We observed spHop2&#x02013;Hop2 and spMnd1&#x02013;Mnd1 interactions by two-hybrid analysis. In this context, perhaps endogenous <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins could stabilize spHop2&#x02013;Hop2 or spMnd1&#x02013;Mnd1 complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>SpHop2-Mnd1 were purified with short histidine tags at their N-terminus. The tags should not affect the function of the heterodimer as tagging spMnd1 or Hop2 with large proteins such as GFP did not affect spore viability [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and Hiroshi Nojima and Takamune Saito, personal communication]. When observed by electron microscopy, purified spHop2-Mnd1 formed filament-like structures on single-strand DNA. The nature of this structure remains to be determined but it might be the result of random binding of spHop2-Mnd1 to the ssDNA so the whole DNA is covered. Our electron microscopic observations support the concept of specific binding of spHop2-Mnd1 to ssDNA ends on 3&#x02032;-tailed DNA. The preferential interaction with ssDNA tails may have important biological consequences at the initiation of recombination during meiosis since double-strand breaks are processed into 3&#x02032;-tailed DNA molecules. Presumably, the resected tails could act as a landing site for spHop2-Mnd1 leading to the nucleation of a presynaptic filament of spDmc1. In contrast, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and human Hop2-Mnd1 was found to bind dsDNA preferentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), whereas mouse Hop2&#x02013;Mnd1 binds DNA with no preference toward single- or double-strand DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). This is an important issue since it influences the way we perceive the roles of these proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>. Very importantly, we found that the addition of calcium eliminates the order of addition requirement on DNA in spDmc1-Hop2-Mnd1 strand invasion assays. Dependence of meiosis on Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been observed during meiosis I, when homologous recombination occurs, and it has been shown that calcium stimulates strand exchange by the human Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) and human Dmc1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Hence, although the preferential binding of Hop2&#x02013;Mnd1 proteins on DNA differs between species, calcium might be a key component in the regulation of their interactions with DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> by altering preferential binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Strand invasion and strand exchange by <italic>S. pombe</italic> Hop2-Mnd1</title><p>Strand exchange with oligonucleotides can occur in an ATP-independent fashion and also by a DNA melting and strand separation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). We show that SpHop2-Mnd1 does not possess DNA melting activity. We have shown previously that fission yeast Dmc1 and Rad51 can both promote strand exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). At a concentration of one monomer per nucleotide, spDmc1 promotes weak strand exchange unless a single-strand binding protein such as SSB is included in the reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). In support of this, RPA is required for meiotic recombination in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Very interestingly, the addition of spHop2-Mnd1 markedly increases strand exchange activity of the spDmc1 protein. SpDmc1 strand invasion, but not spRad51, was stimulated by spHop2-Mnd1. Budding yeast Hop2-Mnd1 and mouse Hop2 can also stimulate Dmc1 specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25">23&#x02013;25</xref>). However, it is not clear how this stimulation occurs. It may be caused by changes in the DNA structure resulting either from spHop2&#x02013;Mnd1 binding. Second, although spHop2-Mnd1 interacts with both spRad51 and spDmc1, protein&#x02013;protein interactions might only be beneficial for Dmc1 nucleoprotein filaments. Since spHop2-Mnd1, spDmc1 and spRad51 bind DNA, this might be difficult to assess experimentally.</p><p>D-loop products from Dmc1&#x02013;spHop2&#x02013;Mnd1 reactions were about 3-fold more abundant in calcium buffer than in magnesium buffer. Moreover, we observed that the D-loop reaction was not reversible in the presence of calcium. These results suggest that calcium might be an important regulator of spDmc1-Hop2-Mnd1 strand invasion <italic>in vivo</italic>. D-loop cycle was first described for RecA protein and was proposed to protect from illegitimate recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Only if the sequences are truly homologous, successive D-loop cycles at many sites will result in stable pairing. Ca<sup>2+</sup> was shown to stimulate the strand exchange activity of human Rad51 protein by inhibiting the ATPase activity of Rad51 thus preventing the conversion of the Rad51-ATP-ssDNA filament to an inactive Rad51-ADP-ssDNA form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Hence, activation of DNA strand exchange appears to be correlated with calcium-triggered transition from inactive ring-shaped oligomers to active nucleoprotein filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). It is possible that a similar mechanism might be involved in the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Dmc1&#x02013;Hop2&#x02013;Mnd1 reaction. Dmc1 filaments might be more stable in the presence of calcium and cycling of the D-loop reaction in Mg<sup>2+</sup> buffer is observed only in the presence of ATP, but not when ATP is replaced by non-hydrolysable analog AMP-PNP (our unpublished data).</p><p>Knowing that fission yeast Hop2-Mnd1 enhances Dmc1 recombinase activity specifically, we investigated whether we could find the same stimulatory effect for mouse Hop2 or Hop2-Mnd1. As expected, the addition of mouse Hop2 or Hop2-Mnd1 markedly increases strand exchange activity of the human Dmc1 or Rad51 proteins. However, in order to achieve the same level of stimulation, a smaller amount of mHop2-Mnd1 was required compared to mHop2. Hence, mHop2-Mnd1 perhaps functions in a catalytic manner. It is interesting to note that mammalian Hop2 functions in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) and interacts with the DNA-binding domains of nuclear receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Our results suggest that Hop2, in the absence of Mnd1, can also function in DNA recombination. We believe that the stimulation observed involves a specific interplay between mHop2 or mHop2-Mnd1 and hRad51/Dmc1 for three reasons. First, we could not detect any stimulatory effect of mHop2 or mHop2/Mnd1 on RecA-promoted strand exchange. Second, the stimulatory activity was not severely affected by the order of addition of proteins on the single-stranded DNA, suggesting that there was no sequestration of ssDNA by mHop2 or mHop2-Mnd1 alone. This is important as sequestration of ssDNA would lead to a decrease in the available concentration of ssDNA by hDmc1 or hRad51 therefore increasing the local concentration of the recombinases per DNA molecule, which could explain the strand exchange activity. If it was the case, mHop2 or mHop2-Mnd1 would have also stimulated RecA. Third, hRad51 and hDmc1 stimulation by mHop2 or mHop2-Mnd1 was dependent on ATP hydrolysis, which suggests that the stimulation required the activity of both recombinases. Altogether, these results would argue that mHop2 is not a non-specific factor capable of stimulating any strand exchange reaction in general. Our results are in accordance with recent studies showing that human Hop2-Mnd1 stimulates hRad51 and hDmc1 strand exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In addition, we show that mHop2 can also stimulate hRad51 and hDmc1 and perhaps Mnd1 is the catalytic subunit.</p></sec><sec><title>Roles of Hop2-Mnd1 in meiotic recombination</title><p>Genetic studies have established that fission yeast Hop2 is important during DSB-independent homolog pairing when cells are transferred to sporulation media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Our results also support roles for Hop2-Mnd1 later, during homologous pairing and strand exchange. After resection of a meiotic double-strand break, the 3&#x02032;-tailed DNA invades an homologous double-strand DNA, a step known as homologous pairing without extensive heteroduplex formation. In meiosis, this occurs between homologs rather than sister chromatids. Then, the heteroduplex region is expanded by strand exchange to form joint molecules and Holliday junctions. The Holliday junctions are resolved to produce at least one crossover per chromosome. We observed that spHop2-Mnd1 can promote strand exchange with oligonucleotides and stimulate strand invasion by spDmc1. These activities demonstrate a key role for spHop2-Mdn1 in strand invasion. Also, mHop2-Mnd1, stimulates hRad51 and hDmc1 strand exchange, which means that these proteins can stabilize interactions between homologous sequences, as suggested recently with genetic studies in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). A subset of meiotic DSBs is also repaired by synthesis-dependent strand annealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). It is thought that following the initial strand invasion and repair synthesis, the invading strand containing newly synthesized DNA is displaced and reannealed to the other 3&#x02032; end. Annealing by spHop2-Mnd1 might be very important in this reaction. Indeed, spHop2-Mnd1 promoted strong annealing with long 400 bases single-strand DNAs. Moreover, this reaction persisted in the presence of a single-strand binding protein. Altogether, our results suggest important functions of Hop2&#x02013;Mnd1 complex in the various steps of homologous recombination. These results are supported <italic>in vivo</italic> by the phenotypes of the hop2 knock-out mice which displays failure of DSB repair and sterility, although the Rad51 and Dmc1 recombinases are still present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to Isabelle Brodeur and Am&#x000e9;lie Rodrigue for helpful comments on the manuscript.
