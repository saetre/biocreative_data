Our aim was to clarify its role in cutaneous wound healing. In wild type mice, maximal expression of HO-1 in the skin was observed on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> days after wounding. Inhibition of HO-1 by tin protoporphyrin-IX resulted in retardation of wound closure. Healing was also delayed in HO-1 deficient mice, where lack of HO-1 could lead to complete suppression of reepithelialization and to formation of extensive skin lesions, accompanied by impaired neovascularization. Experiments performed in transgenic mice bearing HO-1 under control of keratin 14 promoter showed that increased level of HO-1 in keratinocytes is enough to improve the neovascularization and hasten the closure of wounds. Importantly, induction of HO-1 in wounded skin was relatively weak and delayed in diabetic (db/db) mice, in which also angiogenesis and wound closure were impaired. In such animals local delivery of HO-1 transgene using adenoviral vectors accelerated the wound healing and increased the vascularization. In summary, induction of HO-1 is necessary for efficient wound closure and neovascularization. Impaired wound healing in diabetic mice may be associated with delayed HO-1 upregulation and can be improved by HO-1 gene transfer.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The repair of wound is a complex process engaging activity of various cell types, tightly orchestrated by specific cytokines. The molecular and cellular machinery, which is switched on in response to destructive stimuli, is very similar in case of burn, cutaneous wounds, myocardial infarction, spinal-cord damage, and visceral injuries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Gurtner1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Noteworthy, chronic nonhealing wounds, leading very often to ulceration, necrosis and amputation, are one of the severe consequences of diabetes, which result in significant morbidity. Especially in this case, the new avenues for therapeutic approaches of deep skin injuries are urgently needed.</p><p>In mammals, skin wound healing occurs in three overlapping phases: inflammation, granulation tissue formation and remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Stadelmann1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, the injury causes immediate blood vessel constriction and activation of coagulation cascade. When the blood clot is formed, neutrophils and monocytes enter the wound site. Then, keratinocytes and fibroblasts are stimulated to proliferate and migrate over the provisional matrix, so the granulation tissue formation begins. During the final phase of wound healing the granulation tissue is replaced with an acellular scar, when myofibroblastic and vascular cells in the wound undergo apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Falanga1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Vascularization of wound, achieved both by angiogenesis (formation of blood vessels from preexisting ones) and vasculogenesis (formation of blood vessels from endothelial progenitor cells), is necessary for quick and effective tissue repair. It has been shown that endostatin, an angiogenesis inhibitor, delayed wound healing through attenuation of granulation tissue formation and vascularization in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Michaels1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, and impaired maturation of blood vessels during the restoration of skin integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Bloch1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, although reepithelialization of wound was not affected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Michaels1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Bloch1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, neutralizing antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the major angiogenic and vasculogenic mediator, inhibited formation of granulation tissue and decreased number of blood vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Howdieshell1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas VEGF overexpression by <italic>ex vivo</italic> expanded keratinocyte cultures promoted matrix formation, angiogenesis, and healing in porcine full-thickness wounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Dickens1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Also diabetic wound healing was accelerated in response to VEGF via increased angiogenesis and recruiting bone marrow-derived cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Galiano1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, transplantation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) improved dermal wound healing, showing the potency of blood vessel-directed cell therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Suh1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>One of the important molecular mediators of new blood vessel formation is heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). This cytoprotective enzyme, strongly induced by pro-oxidants and inflammatory agents, degrades heme to three compounds: CO, free iron and biliverdin, which is subsequently reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Maines1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous studies have revealed the significance of HO-1 in regulation of synthesis and activity of VEGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Dulak1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Cisowski1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and its role in angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Sunamura1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently we have indicated an importance of HO-1 in stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1)-dependent neovascularization, showing delayed wound closure and poor vascularity of wounded skin in 3-month old HO-1 knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Deshane1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It has been shown that HO-1 is rapidly induced in the wounded tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Hanselmann1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Kampfer1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Keeping in mind its pro-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties, as well as its influence on cell proliferation and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Platt1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, one can suppose that expression of HO-1 may play a role in the process of wound healing. The aim of our study was to verify this hypothesis. We evidenced the significance of HO-1 in skin repair, and demonstrated that delayed HO-1 induction may contribute to the impairment of wound healing in diabetes. Accordingly, we showed that HO-1 gene transfer may facilitate wound closure and neovascularization in diabetic mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Effect of SnPPIX on wound closure</title><p>First experiments were performed <italic>in vitro</italic> on human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, using a scratch assay model.

To this end, immediately after wounding, mice were divided into four groups and injected every day for 10 consecutive days either intraperitoneally (<italic>i.p.</italic>) or subcutaneously (<italic>s.c.</italic>) with SnPPIX or with vehicle. The animals were photographed every day to measure the wound surface. Analysis of images revealed that mice treated <italic>s.c.</italic> with SnPPIX showed a delayed wound closure compared to mice injected with the vehicle, which was evident throughout the whole process of healing, beginning from day 1<sup>st</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005803-g002">Fig. 2B,D</xref>). The first fully closed wounds in control mice were found on the 7<sup>th</sup> day after wounding, whereas in SnPPIX-treated group they appeared earliest on day 8<sup>th</sup>. In case of <italic>i.p.</italic> injected animals, the delay did not become apparent until the 3<sup>rd</sup> day after injury, which might be associated with less effective penetration of the inhibitor to the wounded tissue than after local injection. However, similarly as in the <italic>s.c.</italic> treated individuals, the delayed wound healing was clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005803-g002">Fig. 2C,D</xref>).

Time required for wound closure in the wild type mice did not differ significantly compared to the younger ones. However, lack of even one functional HO-1 allele resulted in a potent delay in wound healing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005803-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). In some individuals (both HO-1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> and HO-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) wounds did not cure at all and their surface increased with time forming large unhealing lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005803-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Such animals had to be subjected to euthanasia before the planned end of experiment. Immunohistochemical staining of CD31-positive endothelial cells, carried out on the day 17<sup>th</sup> after injury, demonstrated that number of blood vessels was lower in nonhealing than in healing skins of HO-1 deficient individuals (9.76&#x000b1;1.64 <italic>versus</italic> 11.84&#x000b1;1.66 of vessels per surface unit, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.035). Necrotic areas were also visible within the wounds. However, the mechanism behind reduced vascularization is not clear, as we did not observe any significant differences in concentration of VEGF, SDF-1 or tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) in the tissue lysates prepared from the healing and nonhealing wounds (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Effect of SnPPIX and HO-1 deficiency on production of inflammatory mediators</title><p>Since restoration of tissue integrity and function is strongly dependent on inflammation, we compared the influence of subcutaneous injection of SnPPIX and HO-1 deficiency on a profile of cytokines in the blood serum of mice on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day post-wounding, using a protein macroarrays (RayBiotech).</p><p>We found that SnPPIX strongly decreased concentrations of many inflammatory mediators in the blood of wounded mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005803-t001">Tab. 1</xref>).

In healthy skins, numbers of vessels in the wild type and db/db mice were similar, as revealed by CD31 staining. In both cases tissue injury induced angiogenesis, and vessel density reached the highest level on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day. However, this increase was much weaker in diabetic mice compared to wild type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005803-g007">Fig. 7B,C</xref>). When wound healing process was ending, nonfunctional capillaries underwent regression and the number of vessels decreased in both groups.</p><p>Western blot analyses showed that expression of HO-1 was upregulated after injury both in wild type and db/db mice. However the time course of this process was different. In the wild type animals HO-1 expression reached the highest level during first three days post-wounding, whereas in db/db mice the maximal HO-1 induction was postponed, with the highest level of expression on day 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005803-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). Thus, during the first phases of response to injury, expression of HO-1 was weaker in diabetic than in wild type animals. Such impaired induction of HO-1 we observed also after intradermal injection of hemin, a substrate and potent inducer of HO-1 expression. In wild type animals local injection of hemin resulted in a strong upregulation of HO-1 protein in the healthy skin. In contrast, the same treatment led to a very weak response in the skin of db/db mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005803-g007">Fig. 7E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Effect of HO-1 gene transfer on wound healing in diabetic mice</title><p>Because expression of HO-1 was disturbed in the wounds of diabetic mice, we investigated whether transfer of HO-1 gene into the injured tissue may improve the healing process. To address this question, we produced adenoviral vectors harboring rat HO-1 cDNA (AdHO-1) or control GFP cDNA (AdGFP) under control of CMV promoter. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments evidenced that these carriers provided high level of transgene expressions (data not shown).</p><p>Immediately after injury db/db mice were injected intradermally at four sites around the wounds either with AdGFP or AdHO-1 vectors (2.3&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> IU per wound). This treatment did not induce any noticeable side effects, as evidenced by unchanged level of aspartate aminotransferase in the blood of animals (data not shown). The presence of transduced cells in the skin was confirmed by GFP expression on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day in the injured tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005803-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). We did not find GFP-positive cells in any other organ analyzed (liver, kidney, lungs, spleen), which indicates that transgene localized only near the site of injection. However, the level of transgene expression was low and we were unable to detect the differences in HO-1 protein concentration in tissue lysates prepared from the wounded skin of AdHO-1 and AdGFP injected animals on day 3 after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005803-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). Importantly, RT-PCR with primers specific for rat HO-1 evidenced transgene expression at mRNA level already on day 1 and also on day 3 after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005803-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>). This was fully confirmed by quantitative, real-time RT-PCR (signal undetectable in AdGFP injected wounds; HO-1/EF2 ratio 0.014&#x000b1;0.0097 P&#x0003c;0.0132 for AdHO-1 treated wounds on day 1<sup>st</sup>). On the other hand, real-time RT-PCR with primers recognizing both murine and rat HO-1, indicated the tendency for increased expression of total HO-1 mRNA, but the differences between AdGFP and AdHO-1 injected mice did not reach statistical significance. Namely, HO-1 to EF2 reference gene ratio was 0.052&#x000b1;0.020 in AdGFP and 0.071&#x000b1;0.031 in AdHO-1 (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.056) on day 1 and 0.054&#x000b1;0.026 in AdGFP and 0.065&#x000b1;0.009 (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.230) on day 3. Possibly, transgene expression is masked by significant induction of endogenous enzyme in response to injury, as the HO-1/EF2 ratio in healthy skin was 0.013&#x000b1;0.012. It appears however, that local expression of HO-1 in the transduced cells can be upregulated. This supposition is supported by measurement of HO-1 protein at later time points, when expression of endogenous HO-1 is already diminished. Thus, although we observed similar upregulation of HO-1 expression on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day post-wounding both in AdGFP and AdHO-1 treated wounds, the higher HO-1 protein concentration on 14<sup>th</sup> day was observed in AdHO-1 injected wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005803-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0005803-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005803.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Expression of GFP and HO-1 transgenes in skin.</title><p>A &#x02013; Representative pictures showing the expression of GFP in the wounded skin of db/db diabetic mice, 3 days after local injection with AdGFP adenoviral vectors (2.3&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> IU).

To elucidate the role of HO-1 induction we applied two models i) pharmacological inhibition of HO-1 using SnPPIX and ii) HO-1 deficient mice. In both cases decrease in HO-1 activity impaired wound healing. In mice injected subcutaneously with SnPPIX or in HO-1 deficient individuals, the delay was statistically significant already on the first day after wounding, while in case of intraperitoneal injections of SnPPIX it became apparent on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day. Probably after <italic>s.c.</italic> application the inhibitor was instantaneously in contact with the injured tissues while after <italic>i.p.</italic> delivery the saturation point of SnPPIX in the organism was reached later. It should be also kept in mind that SnPPIX, being a competitive inhibitor of HO-1, may in the same time induce HO-1 expression. Therefore it decreases enzymatic activity of HO-1, but usually is unable to block it completely. We suppose that this is a reason of much weaker effect of pharmacological than genetic inhibition of HO-1 on wound healing.</p><p>Interestingly, the effect of HO-1 deficiency increased with age and was much stronger in 6-month old than in 3-month old animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005803-g003">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). Moreover, we did not observe significant delay in wound closure in younger heterozygous mice, whereas the effect of decreased level of HO-1 in older heterozygotes was strong, leading to complete inhibition of reepithelialization and formation of skin lesions in some individuals.

We demonstrated that tissue-specific upregulation of HO-1 in keratinocytes is enough to accelerate wound closure and augment vascularization.

Unfortunately, we were unable to detect a difference in concentration of HO-1 protein in lysates of injured tissues between animals treated with therapeutic HO-1 or control GFP cDNAs on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day after gene transfer. Possibly the expression of transgene was masked by induction of endogenous HO-1, induced by wounding, inflammatory response to adenoviral vectors and by GFP expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Zhang1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. The ELISA assay used for measuring the HO-1 protein in tissue lysates appears to be not sensitive enough to detect a subtle difference. We demonstrated, however, that HO-1 level was sustained in AdHO-1 treated animals on day 14<sup>th</sup>, when endogenous HO-1 was already attenuated, which implies a successful gene delivery. Expression of GFP in control wounds and presence of rat HO-1 mRNA in AdHO-1 treated wounds, detected also on 3<sup>rd</sup> day, confirms that adenoviral gene transfer was effective. It seems, that even such local overexpression of HO-1 can still improve wound closure and vascularization. Thus, a similar strategy could be proposed for diabetic patients suffering from non-healing ulcers.</p><p>There are several possible mechanisms underlying the influence of HO-1 on healing of wounds, since its products exert proangiogenic, anti-apoptotic, cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. One potential pathway is an inhibition of production of inflammatory cytokines. This may facilitate the wound healing and increase the reepithelialization, as demonstrated in several reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Ashcroft1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Goren1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. In our model, however, the effect of HO-1 on inflammatory response is not so clear. Analysis of blood collected three days after wounding showed that concentrations of many cytokines or growth factors are higher in mice of normal level of HO-1, whereas HO-1 deficiency or inhibition results in decreased cytokine production. Such relation was observed for sCD40 antigen, IL-2, KC, IL-17, IFN&#x003b3;, and GM-CSF. One can suppose, that the differences observed do not result from a direct effect of HO-1 on cytokine expressions, but are rather the consequences of different rate of wound closure, where at the same time the progression of healing is delayed in animals of lower HO-1 activity. Experiments carried out in HO-1 overexpressing mice seem to confirm lack or relatively weak influence of HO-1 on the cytokine production in response to wounding, as level of cytokines at the wound site was more dependent on wounding phase that on HO-1 activity, while production of inflammatory cytokines in transgenic keratinocytes was similar to control cells (data not shown).</p><p>It has been also postulated that HO-1 is beneficial in wound healing, due to protection of cells from toxic effects of reactive oxygen species, which are intensively generated at the site of injury, especially during first two days, in the inflammatory phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Hanselmann1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005803-Ojha1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.

This suggests that beneficial role of HO-1 in wound healing may result from its proangiogenic activity. We confirmed decreased level of VEGF in the blood of HO-1 deficient animals three days after wounding, and tendency for reduced VEGF production in the wounded skin. Additionally, overexpression of HO-1 in keratinocytes was associated with slight, but statistically significant increase in VEGF synthesis in hypoxia.
