In the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> large changes in transcription accompany the diauxic shift, as organisms switch from using glucose as the main carbon source to non-fermentable carbon sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-DeRisi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Many of the genes that are activated upon glucose exhaustion are under the control of the upstream kinase, Snf1, a homolog of the mammalian AMP-activated kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Hardie1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Within the Snf1 network there is a wide range of finer control which includes two gene-specific activators, Adr1 and Cat8, that are necessary for the expression of about two hundred of these genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Young1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Broadly, Adr1 regulates genes involved in peroxisomal proliferation, &#x003b2;-oxidation and utilization of non-fermentable carbon sources (pathways involved in metabolism of ethanol, glycerol and lactate) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Young1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> whereas Cat8 regulates gluconeogenic genes and most of the enzymes in the glyoxylate cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Haurie1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. However both Adr1 and Cat8 are known to work in tandem to obtain complete derepression of some genes, for example <italic>ADH2</italic> and <italic>ACS1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Kratzer1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>This overlapping regulation created by this non-redundant pair of activators is a unique system for controlling gene expression. Other pairs of transcription factors in yeast exist, but they do not mimic the situation observed with Adr1 and Cat8. For example, Ace2 and Swi5 are similar because they co-regulate some genes, while acting independently at others, but Ace2 and Swi5 are highly homologous and bind to the same DNA target sequence, unlike Adr1 and Cat8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Haurie1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Oaf1 and Pip2 form another set of activators that, although there is some Pip2-independent regulation by Oaf1, are structurally very similar and form a heterodimer at most promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Karpichev1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Msn2 and Msn4 comprise yet another common pair of activators, but these function almost entirely as a unit, and even their own expression is intimately connected (<italic>MSN4</italic> expression depends on Msn2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Estruch1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Even Cat8 itself shares its binding site (<underline>C</underline>arbon <underline>S</underline>ource <underline>R</underline>esponse <underline>E</underline>lement or CSRE) with Sip4, another zinc cluster transcription factor, although evidence suggests that Cat8 is more important for regulation of CSRE-containing genes than Sip4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Roth1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike the pairs mentioned above, which arose by genome duplication, Adr1 and Cat8 are structurally different, independently expressed transcription factors with distinct binding sites. They often bind to the same promoter under activating conditions, and yet their individual contributions to expression of the gene vary widely.</p><p>One mechanism for co-regulation is cooperative binding of transcription factors. This seems to occur at a few promoters regulated by both Adr1 and Cat8. At the <italic>ADH2</italic> promoter, Cat8-binding is enhanced in the presence of Adr1, but the reverse is not true <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Tachibana1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The same situation is observed at a few other promoters but for the most part, their binding seems to be independent.</p><p>Another potential avenue for differential contributions to activation is in a transcription factor's ability to recruit coactivators to the promoter. The paradigm for eukaryotic activator-dependent transcription relies on such recruitment: DNA-binding transcription factors provide specificity by binding preferentially to unique sequences, and then recruit a number of coactivators, such as complexes involved in chromatin remodeling and adaptors between activators and polymerase, as well as the actual transcription machinery itself. A number of these coactivators are non-essential and are only recruited to some promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Holstege1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, a possible explanation for the range of dependence on Adr1 and Cat8. The <italic>HO</italic> promoter in yeast is activated by Swi5 and the heterodimer Swi4/Swi6 (SBF). Swi5 binds first and recruits the coactivator Swi/Snf, followed by Swi4/Swi6 binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Cosma1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Swi5 also recruits Mediator, a multi-subunit complex thought to act as a bridge between gene-specific activators and the holoenzyme, but does not recruit polymerase itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Bhoite1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. A variation on this mechanism is seen with Gcn4, which has two activation domains, each with their own functionality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Drysdale1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. We asked whether or not Adr1 and Cat8 could also operate in a &#x0201c;division of labor&#x0201d; mechanism to co-regulate many genes, and if so, at the genes dependent only on one activator, if that activator then does the work of two recruiters, or if some coactivators are dispensable.</p><p>Starting from previous microarray studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Young1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, we confirmed the dependencies on Adr1 and Cat8 for derepression of a number of glucose-repressed genes. Based on these results, we further refined the subset of genes at which to study coactivator recruitment (<italic>ADH2, ADY2, FBP1</italic> and <italic>JEN1</italic>). We found that although Adr1 and Cat8 share a common ability to recruit coactivators, this inherent property may be mediated through promoter architecture, which dictates the factor that will be the dominant recruiter. We also looked at chromatin remodeling of two promoters, <italic>ADH2</italic> and <italic>FBP1.</italic> The effects on chromatin remodeling at these promoters upon derepression caused by deletion of Adr1 and/or Cat8 correlated with expression data. When Adr1 was over-expressed however, the role of Cat8 in remodeling was abolished at the <italic>ADH2</italic> promoter, and this again was mirrored in expression levels of this high copy Adr1 <italic>cat8&#x00394;</italic> strain. These data support the conclusion that for coactivator recruitment and chromatin remodeling, Adr1 and Cat8 are not intrinsically unique, and that the observed differences between them may arise from differences in promoter context.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A subset of glucose-regulated genes exhibit a range of dependence on the two transcription factors Adr1 and Cat8 for expression</title><p>Microarray analysis under glucose-limiting conditions in strains deleted for either Adr1 and Cat8 singly or in combination identified over a hundred Adr1-dependent genes and nearly twice that many Cat8-dependent genes, with 30 genes overlapping these sets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Young1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. We confirmed the dependence on these transcription factors at a number of genes using real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) from mRNA isolated from a wild-type strain, a <italic>adr1&#x00394;</italic> strain, a <italic>cat8&#x00394;</italic> strain and a <italic>adr1&#x00394;cat8&#x00394;</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001436-t001">Table 1</xref>). <italic>ADH2</italic>, the canonical Adr1-dependent gene, but which is also known to be both bound and regulated by Cat8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Tachibana1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, showed a strong dependence on both Adr1 and Cat8 for expression. Some genes showed a strong requirement for just Cat8 (<italic>ICL1, MLS1</italic> and <italic>MDH2</italic>), whereas others (<italic>SPG1, CYB2, CTA1, POT1</italic> and <italic>ALD4</italic>) were only dependent on Adr1. Many genes, however, showed a dependence on both Adr1 and Cat8 that varied between these extremes. We note that at these extremes, however, loss of the unnecessary factor (i.e. loss of Adr1 at <italic>MLS1</italic> or loss of Cat8 at <italic>SPG1</italic>) resulted in significantly <italic>higher</italic> than wild-type levels of expression. This may indicate a metabolic requirement for elevated transcription of some genes to compensate for the loss of other gene products resultant in the absence of activator. Of the strongly Adr1-dependent genes, only <italic>SPG1</italic> contains a consensus CSRE, making it unlikely that Cat8 is acting as a direct repressor. All genes tested, even those that are strongly Cat8-dependent, contain Adr1 binding sites, and furthermore, binding of Adr1 has been observed at a number of these promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr"

This was true for all of the coactivators we studied (with the exception of TFIID, see below) so data was shown only for derepressed conditions.

In order to determine whether or not Gcn5 was being recruited as part of SAGA or SLIK, we tagged unique components of both of these complexes and observed the identical pattern of recruitment only with the SAGA-specific protein (Spt8) and not with the SLIK-specific protein (Rtg2) (which was detected at the SLIK-dependent promoter <italic>CIT2</italic>) (data not shown). Esa1, the HAT component of NuA4, which mainly acetylates the H4 tail, bound to promoters upon derepression, however in contrast to SAGA, its recruitment was largely activator independent, suggesting it may play a global, rather than targeted role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001436-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).

The recruitment of Swi/Snf was strongly dependent on Adr1 at all promoters tested, and also strongly dependent on Cat8 at <italic>ADH2</italic> and <italic>FBP1</italic>.

The importance of Mediator under respiratory conditions, however, has never been explored.

We detected Mediator in the ORF of <italic>ADH1</italic> under repressed (activating) conditions, but at a much lower amount than in the promoter.

Activator-dependency was expected given the putative role of Mediator as a bridge between transcription factors and general transcription machinery, although at most promoters, one activator by itself was enough to achieve maximal or near-maximal recruitment.

ChIP for TBP reflects this requirement, as a small but significant increase in binding occurs upon derepression. It was difficult to assess the role of activators in this recruitment due to the small range of signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001436-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>). It is clear, however, that Adr1 (and not Cat8) is important for proper recruitment of TBP at <italic>ADH2</italic> and <italic>ADY2</italic>. TBP was expressed from a 2 &#x000b5; plasmid, and the resulting high levels of TBP may contribute to non-specific binding, accounting for the low specific signals.</p><p>ChIP for TFIID, using Taf1 (Taf<sub>II</sub>145) (which was not identified as part of SAGA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Grant1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>), suggests that under normal conditions (e.g. in a wildtype strain), these four glucose-repressed genes are TAF-independent, as there is no observable increase in binding upon derepression of a wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001436-g001">Fig. 1H</xref>). Deletion of activators did not effect the apparent level of Taf1 binding (data not shown).

In large part, transcription levels of Adr1 and Cat8 are unaffected by loss of these coactivators. The slight decreases observed are likely due to a combination of global reduction in transcription and slow growth of these strains, in accordance with the severity of the mutation. Adr1 binding persists at wild-type levels in the <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>med17 ts</italic> strains, indicating that although protein levels may be diminished up to 50&#x00025; compared to a wild-type strain, there is still enough transcription factor to fully occupy the promoter (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Chromatin remodeling at the ADH2 and FBP1 promoters have different requirements for Adr1 and Cat8</title><p>Differential recruitment of known coactivators seems unable to explain the dependence of gene expression on both Adr1 and Cat8.

These findings agree with the expression data, in that both activators are required for a substantial increase in expression upon derepression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001436-t001">Table 1</xref>).

In order to investigate this possibility, we looked at the levels of activation in strains over-expressing Adr1 in the presence or absence of Cat8.

At promoters where Adr1 primarily recruits coactivators (<italic>i.e. ADH2</italic>), Cat8 is dispensable when Adr1 is over expressed, despite what is otherwise a strong requirement for Cat8 in terms of expression. Since the binding sites recognized by Adr1 and Cat8 are very dissimilar, the possibility that stable PIC formation requires the DNA to be bound at two positions or by two separate factors at these promoters is ruled out. Additionally, there is no consistent arrangement of the Adr1 and Cat8 binding sites within promoters of co-regulated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Tachibana1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, supporting the conclusion that two separate activator binding events are not necessary for activation of these genes.</p><p>Interestingly, we observed that multi-copy Adr1 strains lacking Cat8 fail to grow on glycerol, ethanol, acetate and lactate, all carbon sources whose utilization normally require Cat8 (data not shown) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Schuller1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and references therein). These observations suggest that the functional redundancy between these activators appears to be limited to a subset of their target genes, perhaps indicative that they have specialized roles during growth on specific non-fermentable carbon sources. Although we did not perform the converse experiment with over expressed Cat8, we predict that this would yield similar results, with compensation for loss of Adr1 at most genes in this subset, with the exception of those that do not have Cat8 binding sites (<italic>POT1,</italic> for example).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Promoter architecture may dictate the roles that activators assume at each promoter</title><p>In wild-type cells, even at co-regulated genes, subtle differences exist between the roles of Adr1 and Cat8. While they may both share the function of recruiting and stabilizing coactivators, the fact that some promoters display a bias for Adr1 while others depend primarily on Cat8, indicates that under physiological conditions factors exist which dictate which activator dominates regulation (or if both activators will contribute equally). A candidate for such a factor is the promoter architecture, which includes such things as the number and position of nucleosomes, the arrangement of binding sites, and the overall spacing of elements throughout the promoter. For example, it has been demonstrated that the correct helical phasing of Adr1 and Cat8-binding sites is required for wild-type levels of expression of ADH2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Donoviel1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar constraints may play a role in the choice of Adr1 versus Cat8 as the more prominent activator at other co-regulated genes.</p><p>Nucleosome positioning is another factor that may be important. For example, ADH2 has a repressive chromatin structure under high glucose conditions, with significant remodeling of the nucleosomes upon activation (unpublished data), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Agricola1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. The preference for Adr1 at ADH2 may be a result of the fact that the UAS1 is in a nucleosome-free region, whereas at FBP1, the presumed Adr1 binding site is less accessible due to the position of the &#x02212;1 nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001436-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), and so Cat8, which binds in a nucleosome-free region, becomes the dominant factor.</p><p>Based on our studies with these four genes, it appears that despite an overarching shared regulation, the finer workings of the mechanism of activation remain varied. Although there are some commonalities (a consistent set of coactivators), we conclude that the mechanism of activation must be examined on a promoter by promoter basis, even amongst highly related genes. Additionally, the fact that we see no inherent differences in the abilities of Adr1 and Cat8 to recruit coactivators and yet some genes are more heavily dependent on one than the other further supports the conclusion that promoter architecture is equally important for activated transcription.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast strains and growth of cultures</title><p>All strains used in this study were derived from W303.

Strains over-expressing Adr1 were created by introducing plasmid YEpNKA1(URA), based on pKD17, which expresses Adr1 from the <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter, with only a minor modification from its original form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Dombek1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> in a strain chromosomally deleted for Adr1 or both Adr1 and Cat8. For comparison, the single copy Adr1 strain was created in the same strain background using pKD16, a centromeric plasmid carrying a single copy of <italic>ADR1</italic> with its endogenous promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Dombek1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. These strains were grown in synthetic media lacking uracil or tryptophan, respectively, for plasmid selection with either 5&#x00025; glucose (repressed) or 0.05&#x00025; glucose (derepressed).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>ChIP and real-time PCR (QPCR)</title><p>ChIP was performed as previously described, using both dimethyladipimate (Pierce chemicals) and formaldehyde as crosslinking agents and using QPCR instead of standard PCR (Tachibana, 2005). We note that the use of an additional cross-linker did make a substantial difference in the observed binding for some proteins. Monoclonal antibodies against c-Myc (9E10)(Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-40) and HA (F-7)(Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-7293) epitopes were used for all immunoprecipitations except for Pol II, which was immunoprecipitated using the 8WG16 antibody (Abcam ab817). Primers (IDT) for gene-specific QPCR were designed to cover promoter regions. Sequences are available upon request. QPCR was performed on an MJ Research DNA Engine using Power-SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems). Samples were run in triplicate and relative amounts of DNA were calculated using a standard curve generated from serial dilutions of the input DNA. Standard curves were included for every primer set. Experiments were performed in biological duplicate or triplicate and all results were averaged together. Except where noted, values were calculated as the ratio of the percent immunoprecipitation of ChIP to input at the specific locus to the percent immunoprecipitation at the telomeric region. For repressed samples, this ratio was approximately one. Derepressed values were expressed as the percent of the wild-type value. The associated error results from the standard deviation of the biological replicates. Additional analysis using previously published methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Knop1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Agricola2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> all yielded similar patterns (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>mRNA isolation and QPCR</title><p>mRNA was isolated from strains grown in either repressing or derepressing media using a hot acidic phenol isolation procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Collart1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The RNA was DNAse I-treated with the Ambion DNAse free Kit and cDNA was made using 1 &#x003bc;g of RNA, oligo dT as primer and SSII-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the company's procedure. The cDNA solutions were diluted 1&#x02236;300 with water before performing QPCR. Gene-specific QPCR was performed in duplicate using primers near the 3&#x02032; end of the ORF regions (sequences available upon request). Relative amounts were obtained by comparison to a standard curve and normalized to <italic>ACT1</italic> levels. Samples were prepared from biological triplicates and quantitated in duplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Nucleosome scanning assay <italic>(NuSA)</italic></title><p>Two hundred mL cell cultures in either repressing or derepressing conditions were processed using the procedures in the yeast culture, micrococcal nuclease digestion, protein degradation and DNA purification steps as outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Liu1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically, repressed cells were incubated with zymolyase for 15 min. at 30&#x000b0;C while derepressed cells were incubated for 45 min. After the RNAse A digestion, samples were analyzed on 2&#x00025;-agarose gel to determine the extent of digestions and only samples that were highly enriched in mononucleosomal DNA were gel-extracted using a Qiagen gel extraction kit. DNA samples were diluted 1/300&#x02013;1/500 and used in QPCR reactions to quantify the presence of a specific amplicon. The protection value set for each amplicon corresponds to the fold-enrichment of that amplicon in the mononucleosomal DNA compared to the undigested-sample and normalized to <italic>CEN3</italic> values. The amplicon used for <italic>CEN3</italic> covered the region shown previously to have a well-positioned nucleosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001436-Yuan1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.
