To identify VDR responding regions, we analyzed 20 overlapping regions covering the first 7.1 kb of the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells using chromatin immuno-precipitation assays (ChIP) with antibodies against p53 and VDR. We confirmed two known p53 binding regions at approximate positions &#x02212;1400 and &#x02212;2300 and identified a novel site at position &#x02212;4500. In addition, we found three VDR-associated promoter regions at positions &#x02212;2300, &#x02212;4500 and &#x02212;6900, i.e. two regions showed binding for both p53 and VDR. <italic>In silico</italic> screening and <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays using recombinant and <italic>in vitro</italic> translated proteins identified five p53 binding sites within the three p53-positive promoter regions and also five 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> response elements within the three VDR-positive regions. Reporter gene assays confirmed the expected responsiveness of the respective promoter regions to the p53 inducer 5-fluorouracil and 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. Moreover, re-ChIP assays confirmed the functionality of the three 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-reponsive promoter regions by monitoring simultaneous occupancy of VDR with the co-activator proteins CBP, SRC-1 and TRAP220. Taken together, we demonstrated that the human <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> gene is a primary 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-responding gene with at least three VDR binding promoter regions, in two of which also p53 co-localizes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The biologically most active vitamin D metabolite, 1&#x003b1;,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>), is essential for mineral homeostasis and skeletal integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>), but it also has important roles in the control of the cell growth and differentiation in normal and malignant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> receptor (VDR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and the only nuclear protein that binds 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> with high-affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 0.1 nM). One key gene for understanding the anti-proliferative action of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic>, which has been suggested first by Jiang <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) to be a 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> target gene. A VDR binding site, a so-called 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> response element (VDRE), was suggested to be located at position &#x02212;750 in relation to the transcriptional start site (TSS) of the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic>gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). The <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> gene is also a transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which is a transcription factor with response elements (REs), at positions &#x02212;1400 and &#x02212;2300 of the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The p53 protein is a master regulator of a prominent transcriptional network that can control the fate of cells in response to stress and can be induced by chemotherapeutic agents, such as 5-fluorouracil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>).</p><p>An essential prerequisite for the direct modulation of gene expression by transcription factors, such as VDR and p53, is the location of at least one ligand-activated VDR or phosphorylated p53 molecule close to the basal transcriptional machinery of a primary responding gene. This is traditionally achieved through the specific binding of VDR or p53 to REs within the promoter of the respective gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The DNA-binding domain of the VDR contacts the major groove of a double-stranded hexameric DNA sequence with the consensus sequence RGKTCA (R = A or G, K = G or T). In most cases the heterodimeric partner of VDR is the retinoid X receptor (RXR), another nuclear receptor superfamily member, which also contacts DNA. Therefore, simple VDREs are often formed by a direct repeat of two hexameric core binding motifs spaced by 3 nt (DR3-type VDRE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Additionally, strong DNA-binding of VDR&#x02013;RXR heterodimers to two hexameric motifs arranged as a direct repeat spaced by 4 nt (DR4-type VDRE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) or as an everted repeat with nine intervening nucleotides (ER9-type VDRE) have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). In contrast, p53 binds as a tetramer to the consensus sequence RRRCWWGYYY-N-RRRCWWGYYY (W = A or T, Y = C or T and N can be 0 to 13 bases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Although individual REs have been shown to be able to induce transactivation on their own, the observation of multiple VDREs in several primary VDR target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and of two p53-REs within the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) suggests that carrying more than one binding site for a given transcription factor in the promoter favors the prominent response of the gene's transcription to the respective regulator. Never-the-less, the average short-term transcriptional response of most primary VDR target genes is only 2-fold or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), because most of them are in parallel also under the control of other transcription factors, such as the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> gene by p53.</p><p>Ligand-binding to the VDR causes a conformational change within the receptor's ligand-binding domain, which results in the replacement of co-repressor proteins by co-activator (CoA) proteins of the p160-family, such as steroid receptor co-activator 1 (SRC-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), in complex with more general CoAs, such as CREB binding protein (CBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). These CoA complexes have histone acetyltransferase activity, that causes chromatin relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). In a subsequent step, ligand-activated VDR changes rapidly from interacting with the CoAs of the p160-family to those of mediator complexes, such as thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein 220 (TRAP220), also called Med1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The mediator complex acts as a bridge from activated VDR to the basal transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). In this way ligand-activated VDR executes two tasks, the modification of chromatin and the regulation of transcription.</p><p>The reported VDRE within the human <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter was characterized to be very weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and many studies questioned the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> gene being a primary VDR target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). In order to challenge these questions, we analyzed in this study the first 7.1 kb of the human <italic>p21<sup>(waf/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter for p53 and VDR binding regions. Whole promoter chromatin immuno-precipitation assays (ChIP) using antibodies against p53 and VDR confirmed two known p53 binding regions at positions &#x02212;1400 and &#x02212;2300, identified a novel site at position &#x02212;4500, found three VDR-associated regions at positions &#x02212;2300, &#x02212;4500 and &#x02212;6900, but could not confirm VDR binding to position &#x02212;750. <italic>In silico</italic>/<italic>in vitro</italic> screening identified five p53 binding sites within the three p53-positive promoter regions and also five VDREs within the three VDR-positive regions. Reporter gene assays confirmed the expected responsiveness of the respective promoter regions to 5-fluorouracil and 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and re-ChIP assays confirmed the functionality of the three 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-reponsive promoter regions by monitoring simultaneous occupancy of VDR with the CoA proteins CBP, SRC-1 and TRAP220. These data demonstrate that the human <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> gene is a primary VDR target gene with at least three 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-responsive promoter regions, in two of which also p53 co-localizes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were grown in phenol red-free DMEM, supplemented with 5% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin, in a humidified 95% air / 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator.

Cross-linking was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M and incubating for 5 min at room temperature on a rocking platform. The medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and 8.1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O). The cells were collected by scraping in ice-cold PBS supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). After centrifugation the cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer [1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, protease inhibitors and 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.1)] and the lysates were sonicated to result in DNA fragments of 300 to 1000 bp in length.

To minimize the number of primers in repetitive sequences, we employed the web-based CENSOR server screening service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) to identify repetitive sequences in the promoter sequence. We determined that the repetitive sequence content of this segment of human chromosome 6 is 24.2%. Where possible the remaining 73.8% unique sequence was used to design the overlapping PCR primer pairs, but for regions 9, 10, 14, 15, 17 and 18 one of the primers is located in repetitive sequence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, due to unspecific binding of IgG to promoter region 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we designed an alternative primer pair detecting region 12C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Chromatin was extracted from MCF-7 cells that were grown overnight in the presence of 5% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum, stimulated for 360 min with solvent (DMSO) or 300 &#x000b5;M 5-fluorouracil and then cross-linked for 10 min in the presence of formaldehyde. ChIP assays were performed using an antibody against p53 and representative agarose gels of the PCR products are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Comparable detection sensitivity for the 20 different <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter regions was demonstrated by representative PCR products that were obtained using DNA liberated from the recovered chromatin by reverse cross-linking (input lane). Immunoprecipitations with IgG and anti-glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) antibodies served as negative controls. PCR products obtained with p53-enriched chromatin visualized the localization of p53 to the first 7.1 kb of the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter. We found induction of p53 binding to promoter regions 1, 5, 7 and 12C. The binding to region 4 may be unspecific (see IgG control lane), while the binding to regions 2, 6 and 13 may represent flanking effects of the ChIP method.</p><p>The relative binding of p53 to regions 1, 5, 7 and 12C was also determined by quantitative real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Strongest induction (70-fold) was found on the TSS (region 1), followed by region 5 (48-fold) and region 7 (46-fold), while on region 12C only a 3.7-fold induction of p53 binding could be detected. Interestingly, regions 7 and 12C showed significantly higher basal association of p53 than regions 1 and 5. For regions 5 and 7 this confirms the findings of a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), further downstream regions of the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter have not been studied before. Taken together, we could confirm the expected binding of p53 to promoter regions 5 and 7 and could show for the first time binding of p53 protein to region 12C. We presume the association of p53 with the TSS region (region 1) is most likely a consequence of chromatin looping of distal regions (e.g. regions 5, 7 and 12C) to bring them in contact with Pol II.</p></sec><sec><title>Whole <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter screening for VDR binding</title><p>ChIP assays were performed using an antibody against VDR on chromatin that was extracted from MCF-7 cells after stimulation for 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min with 10 nM 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>.

We found significant VDR binding to promoter regions 7, 12C and 19. The VDR binding to the TSS (region 1) is again most likely the sign of complexes of Pol II with VDR-associated with distal promoter regions. We consider signals at regions 2 and 13 as flanking effects and the apparent association of VDR to regions 4, 12 and 17 as unspecific, since these two regions also bind IgG (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In summary, as an essential condition for a primary VDR target gene, the TSS of the human <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> gene associates with VDR. Moreover, the first 7.1 kb of the promoter contain three distal VDR binding sites in regions 7, 12C and 19.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of p53-REs and VDREs on the human <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter</title><p>The ChIP assays with anti-p53 and anti-VDR antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) suggest that the human <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter contains multiple responsive regions for both p53 and VDR.

We found five putative p53-REs, of which three are located in promoter region 7 and one each in regions 5 and 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, we found eight putative VDREs, of which four have a DR3-type structure, three are DR4-type REs and one is an ER9-type RE. Each two of these VDREs were found in regions 4, 7 and 19, while each one was found in regions 3 and 12.

An oligonucleotide with mutated p53 binding sites served as negative control. Strong p53 binding was observed to the known p53 binding site within region 7 (p53-RE2), while the p53-REs 3, 4 (region 7) and 5 (region 12) showed only 10&#x02013;12% of this binding. The p53-RE1 (region 5) showed only very week complex formation with p53 protein (3%); this may reflect the fact that this sequence appears to diverge significantly from the established consensus p53 binding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The negative control did not show any p53 binding at all.</p><p>To assess basal association between the eight putative VDREs the gelshift assays were performed with <italic>in vitro</italic> translated VDR and RXR proteins, either alone or in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) under conditions identical to our earlier DR3-type VDRE comparative study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). The DR3-type VDRE of the rat <italic>ANF</italic> gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) served as a positive control. In reference to this control, REs 4, 5 (region 7), 6 (region 12C) and 7, 8 (region 19) showed 10&#x02013;15% of VDR&#x02013;RXR complex formation.

The reporter gene constructs were transfected into MCF-7 cells, stimulated for 16 h with 100 nM 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> or 100 &#x000b5;M 5-fluorouracil and relative reporter gene activity was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Promoter regions 7, 12C and 19 showed statistically significant induction by 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (1.5- to 1.9-fold), while regions 5, 7 and 12C were also 1.5- to 1.9-fold inducible by 5-fluorouracil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Regions 1, 2 and 3 were inducible by neither of the two stimuli. Interestingly, the basal activity of the reporter gene constructs varied significantly with low activity of region 19, intermediate activity of regions, 1, 2, 3 and 12C and strong activity of regions 5 and 7 suggesting varying amounts of other transcription factors associating with these regions.</p><p>In order to analyze the contribution of the different REs within promoter region 7, we introduced point mutants into the complex VDRE 4/5 and p53-REs 2, 3 and 4 as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. Reporter gene assays in MCF-7 cells indicated that all three half-sites of VDREs 4 and 5 are critical for the response of the promoter region to 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (see mutants 1, 2 and 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and that the p53-RE2 is essential for the response to 5-fluorouracil (mutant 4). Moreover, mutation of the p53-RE2 reduced the basal activity by a factor of 20. Interestingly, the mutated promoter region was still responsive to 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. In contrast, mutations in p53-REs 3 and 4 did not affect the responsiveness of the promoter construct to 5-flurouracil or 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (mutants 5, 6 and 7).</p><p>In summary, the functional assays confirmed the results from the ChIP scanning, <italic>in silico</italic> screening and <italic>in vitro</italic> binding studies. Namely that regions 5, 7 and 12C contain functional p53 binding sites and regions 7, 12C and 19 have functional VDREs. The known p53-RE2 was confirmed to be of central importance for the basal activity of the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter and the complex VDRE was shown to mediate the response of promoter region 7 to 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. In contrast, there is neither direct p53 nor VDR binding in response to their inducers within the proximal <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter (regions 1, 2 and 3).</p></sec><sec><title>Co-localization of VDR and its partner proteins</title><p>An additional test for the functionality of the VDREs in the chromatin context of MCF-7 cells was performed by re-ChIP experiments in response to 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min treatment with 10 nM 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Initial rounds of immuno-precipitation were performed with the VDR antibody and then the precipitated material was interrogated further with antibodies against CBP, SRC-1 and TRAP220. This approach was undertaken to enrich for chromatin templates that were associated with both VDR and its partner proteins at the same time. Single ChIP assays with anti-phosphorylated Pol II antibodies served as reference for the transcriptional activity of the test promoter regions. From the double-fractionated chromatin template, VDR was found to associate in a 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-stimulated and time-dependent fashion with CBP, SRC-1 and TRAP220 on the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter regions 1 (TSS), 7, 12C and 19, but not on the negative control region 3. The association of VDR with its partner proteins showed individual profiles. On regions 7 and 19 there is rather constant association of VDR with CBP, while on region 12C and the TSS there was a peak after 15 to 60 min of ligand treatment. The respective VDR-CBP co-localization on the TSS was also rather constant, but showed a maximum at time point 15 min. Some association of VDR with SRC-1 was observed at nearly all time points with maxima at 0 and 60 min and a minimum at 120 min for region 7, a maximum between 15 and 60 min for region 12C and maxima for time points 0, 30 and 180 min for region 19. These rather divergent VDR-SRC-1 association profiles were integrated at the TSS with maxima at 15 and 120 min. The VDR-TRAP220 association was found to peak at 60 min for region 7, and at 60 to 180 min for regions 12C and 19. The TSS showed some VDR-TRAP220 association already after 15 min, but the main interaction was observed at 60 to 180 min. For regions 7 and 12C the activity of phosphorylated Pol II was highest at 60 min, while for region 19 rather constant activity was detected and even region 3 showed low level of constant association of Pol II. The TSS integrates these activities by high basal association with phosphorylated Pol II over all time points with a slight maximum at 60 min.</p><p>Taken together, re-ChIP assays confirmed 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-dependent functionality of promoter regions 7, 12C and 19, by demonstrating individual association profiles with different CoA proteins. Equally the data generally supported the concept of initial, rapid recruitment of SRC family members CoAs, followed subsequently by members of the mediator complex.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In recent years 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and its low-calcemic analogues have emerged as promising anti-cancer agents. However, the mechanisms of the anti-proliferative, pro-differentiating and pro-apoptotic effects of VDR ligands vary and are cell-specific. Therefore, they cannot be explained by a single molecular pathway in all cell types, but the status of the <italic>p53</italic> gene, being mutated in over 50% of human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), may be of critical impact in most cases. The p53 protein is well known as the master regulator of the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> gene, which in turn for the last decade has appeared to be the most promising 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> target concerning cell growth regulatory effects of the nuclear hormone. In this study we have undertaken whole promoter ChIP assays covering the first 7.1 kb of the human <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> to characterize the critical p53 and VDR binding sites (for summary see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). For each of the two transcription factors we found three binding regions within the promoter. Interestingly, two of these, regions 7 and 12C at approximate positions &#x02212;2300 and &#x02212;4500 relative to the TSS, were identical for both, i.e. they contain both p53-REs and VDREs. This leaves only region 5 at position &#x02212;1400 unique for p53 binding and region 19 at position &#x02212;6900 restricted to VDR binding. Functional studies confirmed the responsiveness of the respective regions to the p53 inducer 5-fluorouracil and VDR activation by 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, respectively.</p><p>The p53 binding regions 5 and 7 have been well characterized by others by a range of approaches including ChIP assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). However, due to the fact that most analyses of the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter were restricted to the first 3 kb, the novel p53 binding site at position &#x02212;4000 (region 12) have been overlooked so far. <italic>In vitro</italic> gelshift analysis indicated a 10-fold lower binding affinity of this novel site, compared to the perfect site at position &#x02212;2300 (region 7), and quantitative real-time PCR from released chromatin template in ChIP assays detected 10-fold less induction of p53 binding to that <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter region. In contrast, this novel p53 binding region demonstrated significant induction after 5-fluorouracil treatment in reporter gene assays and rather high basal association with p53 in quantitative ChIP assays.</p><p>Binding of p53 to the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter in the absence of genotoxic signals have also been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Since the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter contains one high- and several low-affinity sites, it may support a hypothesis that affinity dictates the choice between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, with high-affinity sites regulating cell cycle arrest and low-affinity sites regulating pro-apoptotic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). In cells with a wild-type <italic>p53</italic> gene the novel p53-RE at position &#x02212;4000 may be of minor impact for the response of the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> gene to cellular stress mediated by p53, but still critical for the induction of apoptosis. Moreover, in cases of <italic>p53</italic> gene mutations the elevated p53 protein association to region 12 and the location of a functional VDRE may become of higher impact. The same holds true for region 7, which contains a very potent p53-REs and a complex VDRE. Therefore, we hypothesize that high basal p53 binding paired with closely located VDREs may represent a integrated system to assure sufficient <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> mRNA expression even in cases where regular p53 signaling is impaired by mutations.</p><p>In cells, such as the MCF-7 breast cancer cells that were used in this study, having a wild-type <italic>p53</italic> gene, the basal <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> mRNA expression appear elevated, compared to other VDR target genes, such as <italic>CYP24</italic>. The drastic loss of basal activity of promoter region 7 by mutagenesis of its potent p53-RE supports this view. Moreover, possibly reflecting this treatment with 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> results only in a minor 1.6-fold further elevation of mRNA levels. This may indicate that cells with wild-type <italic>p53</italic> gene have already sufficiently high <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> protein levels, so that they need not take advantage of the 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> signaling pathway to further increase their <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> expression. This may also explain the varied observations concerning the response of the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> gene to 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, found by various groups. The adjacent functional response elements for p53 and VDR suggest that these factors co-operate in normal breast epithelial cells, perhaps to regulate <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> mRNA levels, such that in 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-replete environments the p53 activation of the gene is very readily undertaken to bring about cell cycle control and/or programmed cell death. Anyway, the demonstration of functional 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-responding promoter regions confirms that the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> is a primary 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-responding gene.</p><p>The <italic>CYP24</italic> gene probably is the most responsive primary VDR target gene, because its protein product leads to the degradation of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and therefore the eventual extinction of the transcriptional signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Therefore, it makes sense that VDR&#x02013;RXR heterodimers are the central transcription factors on the <italic>CYP24</italic> promoter and that the basal expression of the gene in the absence of an activating signal for VDR&#x02013;RXR heterodimers is very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Thus the <italic>CYP24</italic> gene appears to be somewhat of a special example of VDR gene regulation. In contrast, the basal expression of other VDR target genes, such as <italic>cyclin C</italic>, <italic>PPAR&#x003b4;</italic> and <italic>p21</italic>, is 10&#x02009;000- to 100&#x02009;000-times higher as that of the <italic>CYP24</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) suggesting that also other transcription factors than VDR&#x02013;RXR heterodimers contribute to the gene's activity. Therefore, the stimulation of the gene's mRNA expression is elevated from a high level only 1.5- to 3.0-fold, which still represents the production of more mRNA molecules than in case of a 1000-fold stimulation of the <italic>CYP24</italic> gene. The promoters for the genes <italic>CYP24</italic> and <italic>cyclin C</italic> contain four VDREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and the <italic>insulin-like growth factor binding proteins 1</italic>, <italic>3</italic> and <italic>5</italic> genes each carry three VDREs in their promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Thus the number of VDREs within a promoter does not correlate with the inducibility of a VDR target gene. The <italic>p21</italic> promoter contains three 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-responsive regions (7, 12C and 19, see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), each of which show 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-dependent recruitment of CoA proteins to VDR-bound chromatin regions. Moreover, each of the three promoter regions contains at least one VDRE. This confirms again the rule of the multiple VDREs in primary 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-responsive genes. Please note that the previously suggested VDRE [RE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>)] is not binding VDR&#x02013;RXR heterodimers and is located in the non-1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-responsive promoter region 3 (position &#x02212;750).</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides insight into the regulation of the human <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> gene by 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. Further we demonstrate that whole promoter ChIP screening with anti-VDR and anti-p53 antibodies is suitable for RE identification and that within 7.1 kb of the <italic>p21<sup>(waf1/cip1)</sup></italic> promoter there are five VDREs and five p53-REs, being located, often in clusters, at positions &#x02212;1400, &#x02212;2300, &#x02212;4500 and &#x02212;6900. This may help to understand the physiological function of these pathways in the process of normal mammary gland renewal and anti-proliferative effects of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in p53 in cancer cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Dr Lise Binderup for 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and Dr Christian Frank for support in <italic>in silico</italic> analysis.
