Understanding how apoptosis contributes to &#x003b2;-cell turnover may lead to strategies to prevent progression of diabetes. A key mediator of apoptosis, mitochondrial function, and cell survival is apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). In the present study, we investigated the role of AIF on &#x003b2;-cell mass and survival using the Harlequin (<italic>Hq</italic>) mutant mice, which are hypomorphic for AIF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Immunohistochemical evaluation of pancreata from <italic>Hq</italic> mutant mice displayed much smaller islets compared to wild-type mice (WT). Analysis of &#x003b2;-cell mass in these mice revealed a greater than 4-fold reduction in &#x003b2;-cell mass together with an 8-fold increase in &#x003b2;-cell apoptosis. Analysis of cell cycle dynamics, using BrdU pulse as a marker for cells in S-phase, did not detect significant differences in the frequency of &#x003b2;-cells in S-phase. In contrast, double staining for phosphorylated Histone H3 and insulin showed a 3-fold increase in &#x003b2;-cells in the G2 phase in <italic>Hq</italic> mutant mice, but no differences in M-phase compared to WT mice. This suggests that the &#x003b2;-cells from <italic>Hq</italic> mutant mice are arrested in the G2 phase and are unlikely to complete the cell cycle. &#x003b2;-cells from Hq mutant mice display increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis, which was confirmed in human islets in which AIF was depleted by siRNA. AIF deficiency had no effect on glucose stimulated insulin secretion, but the impaired effect of hydrogen peroxide on &#x003b2;-cell function was potentiated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our results indicate that AIF is essential for maintaining &#x003b2;-cell mass and for oxidative stress response. A decrease in the oxidative phosphorylation capacity may counteract the development of diabetes, despite its deleterious effects on &#x003b2;-cell survival.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Apoptosis of the insulin producing &#x003b2;-cells and the decline in &#x003b2;-cell mass is a major mechanism of the progression of diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004394-Donath1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the rapid loss of &#x003b2;-cell function and the relative discrepancy between insulin demand and insulin secretion worsen the ability of the organism to maintain normoglycemia.</p><p>Important metabolites that regulate insulin secretion are generated in the mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004394-Wiederkehr1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004394-Wiederkehr2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The &#x003b2;-cell mitochondria are key regulators of glucose stimulated insulin secretion, and several mitochondrial pathways are disabled in type 2 diabetes (T2DM), e.g. the glucose induced hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and the raise in the ATP/ADP ratio at high glucose. Diabetic islets also have increased UCP-2 expression, which uncouples mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, such that energy is wasted through heat, and cellular ATP synthesis is decreased, probably through an increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004394-Krauss1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Besides regulating factors of insulin secretion, mitochondria play a prominent role in apoptosis. In &#x003b2;-cells, elevated free fatty acids and production of ROS have been shown to induce apoptosis through the release of cytochrome c from the inner mitochondrial membrane to the cytosol, which triggers caspase activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004394-Maedler1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004394-Sakurai1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, the role of AIF as a death executor or as an oxidative stress scavenger is controversial. Evidence that AIF serves as free radical scavenger to prevent apoptosis came from studies on the Harlequin (<italic>Hq</italic>) mutant mouse. These mice have an 80&#x00025; reduction in AIF protein due to a proviral insertion in the first intron of the AIF gene. They exhibit a reduced oxidative phosphorylation (OxPHOS) in the retina and in the brain, which entails increased oxidative stress and neuronal cell death through unscheduled cell cycle reentry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004394-Klein1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Defects in OxPHOS and mitochondrial energy metabolism have been implicated in human diseases, including insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004394-Lowell1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004394-Pospisilik1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and diabetes mellitus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004394-Rabol1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, as well as aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004394-DiMauro1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004394-Wallace1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Under physiologic conditions, AIF acts as a free radical scavenger in the mitochondrial respiratory chain to prevent apoptosis. Considering the high correlation of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress with T2DM, we hypothesized that AIF may play an important role in the regulation of &#x003b2;-cell mass and survival.</p><p>In the present study, we report that AIF depletion results in a 3-fold decrease in &#x003b2;-cell mass at 2-weeks of age which was further decreased with age. This was due to the missregulation of cell cycle control. Although there was no difference in proliferating &#x003b2;-cells in the Harlequin mice, 3-fold more &#x003b2;-cells in the <italic>Hq</italic> mice retained in G2 phase of the cell cycle.

Under normal circumstances the cell cycle proceeds without interruptions. However, if cycling cells are damaged by agents which induce oxidative stress, a G2 check point response is triggered and cells pause and repair the damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004394-Shackelford1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of a severe damage, cells may alternatively undergo apoptosis. Given the role of AIF in mitochondrial respiration as a hydrogen peroxide scavenger, loss of AIF could result in an accumulation of ROS, which would then generate a misregulation of &#x003b2;-cell cycle and apoptosis. This is further supported by the finding, that &#x003b2;-cells from both AIF-deficient mice (<italic>Hq</italic> mutant mice) and human islets (AIF-siRNA-treated) displayed increased sensitive to cell death induced by hydrogen peroxide. &#x003b2;-cells are in general very sensitive to oxidative stress, in particular with hydrogen peroxide, due to their low expression of a peroxide scavenging system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004394-Maechler1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Given the role of &#x003b2;-cell mitochondria as key regulators of glucose stimulated insulin secretion, we hypothesized that <italic>Hq</italic> mice show an impaired glucose tolerance. Surprisingly, and in accordance to a recent study, AIF deficiency in <italic>Hq</italic> mutant mice did not impair glucose tolerance. <italic>Hq</italic> mice were rather hypoglycemic compared to wt.

In line with our results, this study found that <italic>Hq</italic> mice displayed improved glucose tolerance associated with reduced fasting and glucose-induced insulin secretion, possibly due to the improved insulin sensitivity. This explains, why <italic>Hq</italic> mice still maintain normoglycemia, despite their loss of &#x003b2;-cell mass. Interestingly, in the absence of oxidative stress, AIF depleted human islets did not show any changes in insulin secretion. When compared to WT islets, <italic>Hq</italic> islets showed a similar response to glucose, confirming the hypothesis that AIF does not directly act on insulin secretion.
