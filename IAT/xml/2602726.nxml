Recently, a downstream common mechanism of antibiotics leading to cell death has been reported. It was shown that the three major groups of bactericidal antibiotics, regardless of their targets interactions, stimulate the production of hydroxyl radicals in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which ultimately causes cell death. In contrast, the bacteriostatic antibiotics do not produce hydroxyl radicals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We have previously shown that some antibiotics trigger cell death by the activation of the built-in death system <italic>mazEF</italic> of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>mazEF</italic> is a toxin&#x02013;antitoxin (TA) module found on the chromosomes of many bacteria, including pathogens &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>E. coli mazF</italic> specifies for the stable toxin MazF, and <italic>mazE</italic> specifies for the labile antitoxin, MazE.

MazE counteracts the action of MazF. Because MazE is a labile protein, preventing MazF-mediated action requires the continuous production of MazE. Thus, any stressful condition that prevents the expression of the chromosomally borne <italic>mazEF</italic> module will lead to the reduction of MazE in the cell, permitting the toxin MazF to act freely. Such stressful conditions can be caused by antibiotics, including (i) those that inhibit transcription and/or translation like rifampicin, chloramphenicol, and spectinomycin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;; and (ii) those that cause DNA damage like mitomycin C, nalidixic acid, and trimethoprim &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

It is obvious that antibiotics belonging to the first group prevent <italic>mazEF</italic> expression.

The nature of the mechanism that is involved in <italic>mazEF</italic> P<sub>2</sub> promoter inactivation by trimethoprim, and whether it is involved by other DNA-damaging antibiotics, is still unknown. In addition, we recently reported that <italic>E. coli mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death is a population phenomenon requiring a communication signaling molecule that we call the Extracellular Death Factor (EDF) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. EDF is the linear penta-peptide NNWNN. Each of the five EDF amino acids is important for its <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated killing activity, and the terminal asparagines are the most crucial.

(i) The ROS detoxifying enzymes catalase or superoxide dismutase, and the iron chelator 2&#x02013;2&#x02032;-dipyridyl completely prevented death when they were induced before the activation of <italic>mazEF</italic> by antibiotics that inhibit transcription and/or translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g001">Figure 1</xref>). (ii) We observed similar results when <italic>mazEF</italic> was activated under completely anaerobic growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, we found that when cell death was activated by the inhibition of transcription and/or translation, <italic>mazEF-</italic>mediated cell death was ROS-dependent. In contrast, it was clear that, when induced by DNA damage, <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death was independent of ROS since cell death was not prevented by the presence of ROS detoxifying enzymes or the iron chelator 2&#x02013;2&#x02032;-dipyridyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g001">1</xref>D) or by anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Based on our results, we suggest that antibiotic-induced <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death is a developmental process for which there are at least two pathways: ROS-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g007">Figure 7</xref>A pathway (a)) and ROS-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g007">Figure 7</xref>A pathway (b)). The ROS-dependent <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death takes place when <italic>mazEF</italic> is induced by inhibitors of transcription or translation. Under those conditions, cell death is prevented either by anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) or by ROS detoxifying enzymes or the iron chelator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g001">Figure 1</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g001">1</xref>C). MazF due to its endoribonucleolytic effect inhibits bulk protein synthesis, including ROS detoxifying enzymes, thereby elevated levels of ROS are produced leading to cell death.Therefore, when <italic>mazEF</italic> is activated by the inhibition of transcription or translation, ROS, and not MazF, is the mediator of cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g007">Figure 7</xref>A pathway (a)). The ROS-independent pathway takes place when <italic>mazEF</italic> is activated by agents causing DNA damage. Under those conditions, we found that although high levels of ROS were formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g002">2</xref>E), neither catalase nor superoxide dismutase, nor anaerobic conditions prevented cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We suggest that when certain antibiotics cause damage to the DNA, the endoribonucleolytic action of MazF triggers a downstream cascade leading to cell death. That such a downstream cascade exists is supported by our results showing that MazE can reverse MazF toxicity only during a short window of time &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, our recent experiments have shown that although MazF leads to the inhibition of synthesis of most <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> proteins, it still permits the synthesis of a small group of proteins that participate in cell death (Amitai S, IK-G, Hananya-Meltabashi M, Sacher A, HE-K, unpublished data). This downstream cascade might be initiated by a special mechanism through which MazF would cleave mRNAs at specific sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; leading to the selective synthesis of proteins encoded by mRNAs that are resistant to the cleavage of MazF. Our results suggest that such proteins may function as executioners of cell death independent of ROS, possibly by acting more rapidly or efficiently than does ROS (Amitai S, IK-G, Hananya-Meltabashi M, Sacher A, HE-K, unpublished data) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g007">Figure 7</xref>A pathway (b)).</p><fig id="pbio-0060319-g007" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Alternative Death Pathways Induced by Some Antibiotics in</title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content></p><p>(A) Antibiotic induction of EDF-<italic>mazEF</italic> activates MazF (in red).

Under the experimental conditions in which the EDF-<italic>mazEF</italic>&#x02013;mediating pathways operated, the transcriptional and translational inhibitor rifampicin, traditionally known as being bacteriostatic, became bactericidal when it activated the EDF-<italic>mazEF</italic> system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The free MazF led to the production of ROS, which led to ROS-dependent death. Antibiotics causing DNA damage, like nalidixic acid, also activated the EDF-<italic>mazEF</italic> system so that the free MazF caused ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g002">Figure 2</xref>). But in this case, cell death was ROS-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g006">Figure 6</xref>). We suggest that the ROS-independent pathway requires a selective production of proteins whose mRNA are resistant to the action of MazF &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. We have also shown that during a long period of treatment with antibiotics causing DNA damage, an EDF-<italic>mazEF</italic>&#x02013;independent cell death takes place which is ROS-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060319-g007">7</xref>B pathway (d)).

Kohanski and colleagues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d; were the first to show that ROS formation is a common mechanism downstream of the action antibiotics, and that it is the ROS that lead to cell death. Our work has revealed yet another dimension to the mode of action of some antibiotics. We found that it is determined by the ability of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> cells to communicate through the signaling molecule EDF as it participates in <italic>mazEF</italic> induction. Thus, using synthetic EDF together with an antibiotic that is an inhibitor of transcription or translation could lead to an increase in the efficiency of killing the bacterial cells, even in the initial stage of infection when the density of the bacteria is low. This implies that EDF (or its derivatives) increases the repertoire of antibiotic drugs. Thus, at least in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> and probably in other bacteria as well, bacteriostatic antibiotics could be turned into bactericidal antibiotics by using EDF to turn on the built-in <italic>mazEF</italic> system.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids.</title><p>The following strains were used: MC410<italic>relA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and its &#x00394;<italic>mazEF</italic>::<italic>kan</italic> derivative &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;; <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> strain K38 and its &#x00394;<italic>mazEF</italic> derivative &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;; MG1655 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060319-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d; and its &#x00394;<italic>mazEF</italic>::<italic>kan</italic> derivative, which we constructed by P1 transduction from strain MC4100<italic>relA1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>mazEF</italic>::<italic>kan</italic>.
