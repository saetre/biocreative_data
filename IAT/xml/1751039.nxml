ALI/ARDS can result from a direct insult in the lung or an indirect insult from other organs mediated through the systemic circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. ARDS of both etiologies results in acute inflammatory responses leading to lung dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Mesenteric ischemia-reperfusion represents an important cause of extrapulmonary ARDS, as gut mucosal perfusion deficits appear to be instrumental in the propagation of multiple organ failure, of which the most vulnerable organ is the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Increased pulmonary permeability that leads to diffuse interstitial and pulmonary edema is one of the most important manifestations of ALI/ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Increased cell death has been proposed to be an important component for lung tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors are critical in the regulation of both vascular permeability and endothelial cell survival. Therefore, VEGF and related molecules may have important roles in the development of ALI/ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The VEGF system consists of several VEGF isoforms and VEGF receptors (VEGFRs). Most studies have focused on VEGF-A (from hereon the abbreviation VEGF refers to VEGF-A) because it plays an essential role in angiogenesis and vascular permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the lung tissue, VEGF is highly compartmentalized and mainly produced in epithelial cells, whereas endothelial cells are suggested as its major target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Most of the angiogenic activities of VEGF as well as its effects on vascular permeability are mediated by its receptor Flk-1 (VEGFR-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], while the functions of Flt-1 (VEGFR-1), especially its role in ALI, are largely unknown.</p><p>Pulmonary permeability is controlled by both endothelial and epithelial layers. Pulmonary injury in ARDS causes widespread destruction on both sides of the epithelial-endothelial barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The effect of VEGF on endothelial cell permeability and survival has been demonstrated in both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The effect of the VEGF system on the integrity of pulmonary epithelium is unclear.</p><p>VEGF may contribute to the development of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in ALI/ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Systemic overexpression of VEGF has been shown to cause widespread capillary leakage in multiple organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and high plasma levels of VEGF were found in ARDS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, studies from animal models as well as from ARDS patients have shown that decreased levels of VEGF in the lung are associated with a worse prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, the role of VEGF and related molecules in ALI/ARDS is controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. One possible explanation is that VEGF may play different roles at different stages of the development of and recovery from ALI/ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We hypothesized that, in the early stage of lung injury, the release of VEGF from alveolar epithelial cells and leukocytes induced by acute inflammatory response may increase the vascular permeability and contribute to the formation of interstitial edema in the lung, whereas reduced VEGF and its receptors in alveolar epithelial cells due to tissue damage may lead to cell death. In the present study, we investigated the release of VEGF, and the expression and distribution of VEGF and its receptors in the lung during the early onset of ALI induced by intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IIR), a well-established model of extrapulmonary ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Since expression levels of VEGF and VEGFR-1 were negatively correlated with alveolar epithelial cell death, we investigated the potential roles of these two proteins on epithelial survival by reducing their expression with small interference RNA (siRNA) in A549 cells, a human lung epithelial cell line with partial type II pneumocyte characteristics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion model in mice</title><p>We randomized 6 to 9 week old male C57BL6 mice (weight = 25.8 &#x000b1; 2.7 g) into IIR, sham (sham-operated), or control groups. The animals subjected to IIR or sham operation were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of acepromazine (10 mg/ml)-ketamine (100 mg/ml) (10:1, 0.15 ml). Tracheostomy was performed after blunt dissection of the neck and exposure of the trachea. A metal cannula for mouse (1.0 mm; Harvard Apparatus, St Laurent, Canada) was inserted into the trachea, and animals were connected to a volume-controlled constant flow ventilator (Inspira Advanced Safety Ventilator, Harvard Apparatus). Anesthesia was continuously maintained with isoflurane and body temperature was maintained at 37&#x000b0;C by an immersion thermostat throughout the experiment. In the IIR group the abdomen was rinsed with betadine, a lower midline laparatomy was performed and the superior mesenteric artery was identified and occluded below the celiac trunk with an arterial microclamp. Intestinal ischemia was confirmed by paleness of the jejunum and ileum. After 30 minutes the clamp was removed, 0.5 ml of sterile saline at 37&#x000b0;C was injected into the peritoneal cavity and the skin was sutured. The same procedures were carried out in the sham group, but the mesenteric artery was not clamped. The animals were then ventilated for four hours with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg, inspiratory oxygen fraction 1.0, inspiratory/expiratory ratio 1:2 and a frequency of 140 breaths per minute. An esophageal catheter (Harvard Apparatus) was applied to eight animals per group for measurement of dynamic lung compliance. The left femoral artery was cannulated in four animals per group for measurement of mean arterial blood pressure. Airways pressures, dynamic lung compliance and blood pressure were continuously monitored throughout the four hour period of mechanical ventilation (MV) with HSE-USB acquisition hardware and Pulmodyn software (H Sachs Elektronik, March-Hugstetten, Germany). The control group consisted of mice spontaneously breathing room air. The experimental protocol was approved by the Toronto General Hospital Animal Care and Use Committee. All mice received care in compliance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care formulated by the National Society for Medical Research, and the Guide for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals formulated by the Canadian Council on Animal Care.</p><p>All animals were sacrificed by exsanguinations. The lungs were sub-grouped either for histological evaluation and immunohistochemistry (<italic>n </italic>= 4/group) or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; <italic>n </italic>= 12/group). Blood samples were collected (<italic>n </italic>= 8 animals/group) at the end of the experiment by puncture of the aorta. After centrifugation at 4,000 g for 10 minutes, plasma samples were stored at -20&#x000b0;C before use.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of acute lung injury</title><p>Lungs for histological evaluation were removed <italic>en bloc </italic>and inflated at a 20 cm height with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for fixation. Sections (4 &#x003bc;m) were either stained with haematoxylin and eosin or processed for immunohistochemistry. A pulmonary pathologist performed the histological analysis in a blinded fashion. The degree of lung injury was determined using the grading system developed by Ginsberg and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>BAL was performed by instilling 0.5 ml of saline through the endotracheal tube and gently aspirating back. This was repeated twice and the amount of fluid recovered was recorded. An aliquot of BAL fluid (50 &#x003bc;l) was diluted 1:1 with trypan blue for total cell counting using a haemocytometer. In 8 animals per group, an aliquot of BAL fluid (80 &#x003bc;l) underwent cytospin (72 g, 5 minutes) and the cells collected were stained using the Harleco Hemacolor staining kit (EMD Science, Gibbstown, NJ, USA). Differential cell count was conducted by counting of at least 500 cells. The remainder of the lavage fluid was centrifuged (4,000 g, 10 minutes), and the supernatant was stored at -20&#x000b0;C until measurement of protein concentration with Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).</p><p>For the Evans Blue Dye (EBD) permeability assay, the left jugular vein was isolated and cannulated in four animals per group. An EBD solution (5 mg/ml) was injected into the left jugular vein (30 mg/kg) 30 minutes prior to sacrifice of the animal. The BAL fluid and plasma were collected and the optical density of EBD was read at 630 nm with a spectrophotometer (Opsys MR, Thermo Labsystems, Franklin, MA, USA). The optical density ratio of BAL/plasma EBD was then calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</title><p>VEGF levels were determined in the BAL supernatants and plasma samples using an ELISA kit (DuoSet Mouse VEGF, R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) that recognizes VEGF isoforms with either 120 or 164 amino acids. Assays were performed in duplicate following the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>For immunohistochemistry (IHC), lung tissue slides (4 &#x003bc;m) were pre-treated with 0.25% Triton X-100 for five minutes and blocked for endogenous peroxidase and biotin with 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in methanol. The slides were incubated with designated primary antibodies, with a dilution of 1:200 for VEGF (sc-507), 1:20 for VEGFR-1 (sc-316) and VEGFR-2 (sc-505) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), for 32 minutes at 42&#x000b0;C, and then with a secondary antibody (1:600) for 20 minutes. Detection was done by Avidin Biotin Complex system with 3&#x02013;3 diaminobenzidine as chromogen from a VECTSTAIN ABC kit (PK-4001, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Cell nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. Non-immune serum instead of the primary antibody was used for negative controls (data not shown). The VEGFR-1 staining was abolished by pre-incubation of slides with a specific blocking peptide (sc-316p, Santa Cruz) (data not shown).</p><p>For quantitative analysis, 10 optical fields of alveolar area from each animal (4 mice/group), not including major airways or vessels, were randomly chosen at 1,000 &#x000d7; magnification. The numbers of cells with VEGF, VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 positive-staining as well as the total cell nuclei in the chosen fields were counted, respectively, in a double blind fashion. The number of positive-stained cells was expressed as a percentage of the total cells. The staining intensities in bronchial epithelium (ciliated or non-ciliated cells), alveolar epithelium (type I and type II cells), interstitial cells, vascular endothelium and alveolar macrophages were also scored semi-quantitatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Different cell types were identified by their location and morphology. This screening test could provide an overall impression of the changes of VEGF and its receptors in different cell types.</p></sec><sec><title>TUNEL-cytokeratin double fluorescent staining</title><p>Terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining (<italic>In Situ </italic>Cell Death Detection Kit, TMR Red, Roche, Penzberg, Germany) was used to assess cell death in the lung tissues after deparaffinization, dehydration and permeabilization with 10 &#x003bc;g/ml proteinase K in 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4&#x02013;8, for 15 minutes. The slides were then stained for cytokeratin by incubating with an anti-cytokeratin-18 monoclonal antibody (1:25, Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) at 4&#x000b0;C overnight, and with a fluorescent-FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA) at room temperature for 1 h. Label solution without terminal transferase for TUNEL or non-immune serum was used as negative controls. Tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-labeled TUNEL-positive nucleotides and FITC-labeled cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells were detected under fluorescence microscope. Ten fields were randomly chosen from each animal (4 mice/group) at 1,000 &#x000d7; magnification and each field contained approximately the same number of alveoli without major airways or vessels. The number of TUNEL-cytokeratin double positive cells and the total cytokeratin positive cells per optical field were quantified. An epithelial cell death index for each animal was calculated as: (TUNEL-cytokeratin positive cells/cytokeratin positive cells) &#x000d7; 100%.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>The protocols for sample preparation and western blotting of lung tissue lysate have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The protein concentration from homogenized snap-frozen lung samples (four from each group) was determined by the Bradford method. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were boiled in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation of membranes with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in PBS for 60 minutes. Blots were incubated with the designated antibody (VEGF sc-507, VEGFR-1 sc-316, or VEGFR-2 sc-6251 antibodies, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1,000 dilution overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The blots were then washed with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:30,000 dilution) or anti-mouse (1:20,000 dilution) IgG (both from Amersham, Oakville, Canada). After washing, blots were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham). We stripped and reprobed blots with antibody for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a housekeeping control. Autoradiographs were quantified using a densitometer (GS-690; Bio-Rad Laboratories) and normalized to the GAPDH control.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time RT-PCR</title><p>Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of the RNA expression of VEGF, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 was performed on RNA isolated from frozen lung tissues (four animals/group) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The primer sequences are available upon request.</p></sec><sec><title>VEGF and VEGFR-1 knock-down with siRNA in A549 cells</title><p>A549 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum to about 50% confluence in 24-well plates, and then treated with 50 nM of siRNA against either VEGF (M-003550) or VEGFR-1 (M-003136) mRNA, or a non-specific duplex RNA (D-001206-13-05) as negative control (SMARTpool, Upstate, Charlottesville, VA, USA) using oligofectamine as transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). At 24 h after transfection, cell morphology was examined with phase-contrast microscopy, and cell viability was determined with an XTT assay following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche). The knock-down effect at the protein level in the cells was determined by immunofluorescent staining and western blotting with polyclonal antibodies against VEGF or VEGFR-1 (Santa Cruz), respectively. The immunoflurescent staining was visualized with a TMR-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:400) as the secondary antibody. The protocol for immunofluorescent staining has been previously described in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation and were analyzed with JMP software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

The overall survival was 50% in the IIR group, while no mortality was observed in the sham group within the 4 h experimental period. The distributive shock following the release of proinflammatory mediators from the injured intestine may be the cause of this high rate of mortality, as the blood pressure in the IIR group decreased significantly, in comparison with that in the sham group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

The differential cell count showed a significantly higher percentage of neutrophils in the IIR group. A significant increase of total cell counts and protein concentration was also observed in the BAL from the sham group compared to that of control animals, which may be due to the high concentration of oxygen used for ventilation. However, when EBD assay was used to further assess the pulmonary permeability, a significant increase in the BAL/plasma EBD ratio was only detected in the IIR group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Results from two animals are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref> as examples. When quantified with densitometry, no statistical significance was found. We also used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to measure the mRNA levels of VEGF and its receptors. The results are also not statistically significant (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Correlations of VEGF and its receptors with lung injury and epithelial cell death</title><p>We then examined whether the VEGF concentration in the BAL correlates with parameters related to vascular permeability (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The VEGF level was significantly correlated with the total protein concentration in the BAL fluid. A significant correlation was also found between VEGF concentration and total cell count. The differential cell counting further revealed that VEGF was correlated positively with the percentage of macrophages, but inversely with neutrophils (both percentage and cell number) in the BAL (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).</p><p>To verify if epithelial cell death was related to the down-regulation of VEGF and VEGFR-1, TUNEL and cytokeratin double staining was performed. An increased number of TUNEL-cytokeratin double positive cells was found in the IIR group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>), which was statistically significant when quantified and compared with the cell death in the control and sham groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). The number of VEGF positive cells in the alveolar units was negatively correlated with the number of TUNEL-cytokeratin positive cells (<italic>Rho </italic>= -0.87, <italic>p </italic>= 0.001; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). Similarly, the number of VEGFR-1 positive cells was negatively correlated with that of TUNEL-cytokeratin positive cells (<italic>Rho </italic>= -0.74, <italic>p </italic>= 0.011; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>). No significant correlation was found with the number of VEGFR-2 positive cells. These results suggest that reduced VEGF and VEGFR-1 expression in lung tissue may contribute to the death of lung epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Knock-down of either VEGF or VEGFR-1 reduced lung epithelial cell viability</title><p>To further determine the roles of VEGF and VEGFR-1 in lung epithelial cell survival, human lung epithelial A549 cells were pre-treated with pooled siRNAs that contain at least four selected siRNA duplexes specifically against either human VEGF or VEGFR-1. The specificity and efficacy of these siRNAs have been characterized by the manufacturer. In comparison with the non-specific duplex RNA control, reduced cell number and changes in cell morphology was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>), and a significant reduction in cell viability (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>; <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01) was detected by XTT assay at 24 hours after either VEGF or VEGFR-1 siRNA treatment. The protein levels of VEGF or VEGFR-1 were reduced by siRNA treatment, as confirmed by immunofluorescent staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>) and western blotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>) with specific antibodies against VEGF or VEGFR-1, respectively. The non-specific duplex RNA had no effects on cell viability and protein levels of VEGF and VEGFR-1 in comparison with non-treated control.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study is a comprehensive report on the early responses of VEGF and its receptors in an animal model of ALI. We observed an increase of VEGF in the BAL, a decreased expression of VEGF and VEGFR-1, and an altered expression pattern of VEGFR-2 in the lung tissue. The VEGF levels in BAL correlated with pulmonary permeability. Decreased expression of VEGF and VEGFR-1 in the lung tissue negatively correlated with death of alveolar epithelial cells. Using cell culture as a model system, we further demonstrated that VEGF and/or VEGFR-1 may play an important role in lung epithelial cell survival.</p><p>The VEGF levels in the BAL were increased in both sham and IIR groups, which suggests that these changes may be related to hyperoxia and/or MV, applied to animals in both groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Although it is well known that hypoxia is the most potent regulator of VEGF gene expression and protein production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], an oxygen-independent up-regulation of VEGF and vascular barrier dysfunction has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. A rise in VEGF levels in the BAL in a chronic hyperoxia model in piglets has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This could be explained at least partially by the release of VEGF from extracellular matrix through hyperoxia-induced proteolytic cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Although animals in this study were ventilated with low tidal volume, we cannot exclude the contribution of mechanical factors to the release of VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], or an addictive effect between MV and hyperoxia.</p><p>Alveolar macrophages represent a potential source of VEGF in ALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We found a positive correlation between the VEGF levels and percentage of macrophages in the BAL. The granules in the neutrophils also contain VEGF and may represent an additional source of VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]; however, proteases released by these cells may cleave VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], which could explain the negative correlation between VEGF levels and the number or percentage of neutrophils in the BAL. The numbers of observations in these correlation studies are small; thus, these results should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>We noted a significant correlation of the VEGF concentrations with the total protein concentrations and with the total cell counts in the BAL. High concentrations of VEGF within the lung may contribute to the development of pulmonary edema by alternating the state of the adherens junction complexes on the endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. An alternative explanation for this correlation is that the increased VEGF is simply the reflection of increased protein leakage in the lung. In clinical studies, increased VEGF in plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and decreased VEGF in epithelial lining fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], or BAL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], were noted in ARDS patients. The present study was limited to the first four hours of observation, while these clinical studies were performed within the first couple of days after ARDS developed. It is known that C57BL6 mice are very susceptible to lung hyperoxic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. These confounding factors may explain the differences between our observation and those of others. Further investigation is required to address these questions.</p><p>Despite the increased levels of VEGF in the BAL, a decreased expression of VEGF in the lung tissue, as revealed by the IHC staining, was observed specifically in the IIR group. Factors other than hyperoxia, such as IIR-induced acute inflammatory response, should be responsible for this drop in VEGF. Down-regulation of VEGF has been observed in the rat lungs after four hours of lipopolysaccharide challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A down-regulation of VEGF, as well as VEGF receptors, was also found at 24 hours and 72 hours after lipopolysaccharide injection in the mouse lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Cell death is a common feature of ALI and ARDS, contributing to the dysfunction of the alveolar-capillary barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The role of VEGF as a survival factor for endothelial cells is already well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. A correlation between the reduced VEGF levels and endothelial cell death has been found in the lungs of ARDS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The function of VEGF in epithelial cells, however, is largely unknown. Recent evidence suggests that VEGF could also be a survival factor for epithelial cells. VEGF stimulated growth of fetal airway epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and the proliferation of renal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In a rat model of obliterative bronchiolitis, Krebs and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] observed that VEGF either directly promoted epithelial regeneration or inhibited epithelial cell death. Tang and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] observed that a transient ablation of the gene encoding VEGF in the lung was associated with an increased number of TUNEL-positive cells in the alveolar walls. In the present study, we found a negative correlation between the number of VEGF-positive cells and TUNEL-positive epithelial cells. To further determine the role of VEGF in lung epithelial cell survival, we used siRNA to knock-down VEGF expression in A549 cells. This technique has been successfully used to effectively and specifically reduce the expression of other signal transduction proteins in lung epithelial A549 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Our data show that the cell viability was significantly reduced by siRNA for VEGF. Therefore, VEGF could be a survival factor for alveolar epithelial cells. On the other hand, these cells are one of the main sources of VEGF in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, the death of alveolar epithelial cells could be partially responsible for the decreased expression of VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>VEGFR-1 is normally expressed on epithelial and endothelial cells in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Compared with VEGFR-2, the function of VEGFR-1 in the lung is less determined. In the present study, IHC showed a significant decrease in the expression of VEGFR-1 in both the sham and the IIR groups, suggesting that hyperoxia and/or MV may suppress its expression. The decreased expression level of VEGFR-1 was more significant in the IIR group (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01). The significant negative correlation between VEGFR-1 positive cells and epithelial cell death suggests that down-regulation of VEGFR-1 may be due to epithelial cell death. However, when we knocked down the VEGFR-1 protein level with siRNA, the viability A549 of cells was significantly reduced. This observation is intriguing. It suggests that VEGF and VEGFR-1 may modulate survival of lung epithelial cells in an autocrine fashion.</p><p>VEGFR-2, mainly located on endothelial cells, but also on epithelial type II cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], is responsible for most of the known functions of VEGF in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and, in particular, is involved in the anti-apoptotic properties of VEGF on endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In the control and sham-operated animals, the strong staining of VEGFR-2 was found mainly on cells located at the corners of the alveolar space with the appearance of type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. In the IIR group, the number of VEGFR-2 positive cells did not change significantly. The morphological features of cells that expressed VEGFR-2, however, suggest that some of them could be the interstitial monocytes. The accumulation of VEGFR-2-positive inflammatory cells was also noted in a model of Bleomycin-induced lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Moreover, in the IIR group, the expression of VEGFR-2 was localized mainly in the cytoplasm, which was not noted in the other two groups. This phenomenon indicates that the function of VEGFR-2 may be altered by the inflammatory responses in the lung tissue. Further investigation with double immunostaining and confocal microscopy may provide more convincing evidence.</p><p>When using western blotting and real-time quantitative RT-PCR to measure the protein and mRNA levels of VEGF and its receptors, the results are not statistically significant. The expression and distribution of these molecules are scattered in the lung tissue. When total tissue lysates were used as samples for immunoblotting, or as sources for total RNA extraction, the background from surrounding cells and tissues may mask the changes of VEGF, or its receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that significant and dynamic changes of expression of VEGF and its receptors take place during IIR-induced acute lung injury. A rapid release of VEGF into alveolar space may occur as a consequence of hyperoxia and/or MV. Released VEGF may partially contribute to the development of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. VEGF and VEGFR-1 may play important roles in maintaining alveolar epithelial cell survival. Acute inflammatory responses and alveolar epithelial injury may reduce their expression, which may subsequently lead to cell death. Alternatively, death of alveolar epithelial cells may limit the production of VEGF in the lung. Further investigation with more specific tools or transgenic animals may elucidate the intricate role of VEGF system in acute lung injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><p>&#x02022; During the early stage of ALI induced by IIR, the expression of VEGF and its receptors changes in the lung tissue.</p><p>&#x02022; Increased release of VEGF (found in BLF) may contribute to pulmonary permeability.</p><p>&#x02022; Reduced VEGF and its type I receptor in the lung tissue may affect lung epithelial cell survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ALI = acute lung injury; ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; BAL = bronchoalveolar lavage; EBD = Evans Blue Dye; FITC = fluorescein isothiocyanate; GAPDH = glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; IHC = immunohistochemistry; IIR = intestinal ischemia-reperfusion; MV = mechanical ventilation; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; RT-PCR = reverse transcriptase PCR; siRNA = small interference RNA; TMR = tetramethylrhodamine; TUNEL = terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling; VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR = vascular endothelial growth factor receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MM designed the study and carried out most of the animal studies, assessment of lung injury and VEGF related molecules in the lung, and drafted the manuscript.
