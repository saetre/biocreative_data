It is believed that the interacting factors play important roles in determining the functional specificity of RHA. Here we show that RHA directly interacts with double-stranded (ds) nucleic acids (NAs) and assembles complexes with topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. First, electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrate that RHA interacts with dsDNAs of different lengths ranging from 15 to 104 bp. Secondly, the binding of RHA to closed circular dsDNA stimulates the relaxation reaction catalyzed by either calf thymus topoisomerase I or HeLa topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. Thirdly, immunoprecipitation, coupled with western blot analysis using anti-RHA and anti-topoisomerase II&#x003b1; antibodies, shows that RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; assemble a complex in the presence of as yet unknown RNA molecules and additional protein factors such as Ubc9. Our observation suggests physical and functional interaction between RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1;, which, perhaps, play important roles in regulating chromatin structure. The putative role of RHA&#x02013;topoisomerase II&#x003b1; complex in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription is discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA helicase A (RHA) belongs to the asp-glu-ala-his (DEAH) helicase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c1">1</xref>) and unwinds both double-stranded (ds) DNA and dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c5">5</xref>). It has been shown previously that RHA plays a critical role in mammalian development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c6">6</xref>) and that RHA mediates the interaction between CBP&#x0002f;p300 and RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c7">7</xref>). RHA interacts with various nuclear factors, including the tumor suppressor BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c8">8</xref>), HAP95, a newly identified protein with extensive homology to AKAP95, a member of the A-kinase anchoring protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c9">9</xref>), and the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c10">10</xref>). These findings suggest that, in addition to transcription, RHA participates in diverse nuclear processes and that the functional specificity is not inherent but a property endowed by its interacting factors. In particular, the latter possibility can be inferred from MLE (maleless), a <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of RHA that is critical for dosage compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c13">13</xref>). Although present in both female and male flies, MLE increases the transcription activity of X-linked genes only in male flies through the interaction with male-specific lethal (MSL) complexes and regulatory RNA molecules such as <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic> (RNA on X 1 and 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c15">15</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies, employing RHA and MLE carrying mutations in the ATP binding motif (GKT), have shown that ATPase activity is essential for both CREB-dependent pathway in mammals and dosage compensation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c7">7</xref>). Loss of MLE ATPase activity decreases <italic>roX2</italic> RNA levels both in the nucleoplasm and in MSL complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c16">16</xref>), implying that ATPase activity is required either for the association of <italic>roX2</italic> RNA with MSL complexes, for the stability of <italic>roX2</italic> RNA, or both. Similar to the functional interaction of MLE with <italic>roX2</italic> RNA, RHA is also regulated by RNA molecules such as constitutive transport element (<italic>CTE</italic>)-containing RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c17">17</xref>) or <italic>TAR</italic> encoded by type D retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c18">18</xref>). Adenoviral <italic>VA</italic> RNAs suppress the helicase activity of RHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c19">19</xref>), but the functional significance of the interaction remains unknown.</p><p>Although mammalian homologs of <italic>Drosophila roX</italic> RNAs or virally encoded RNAs have yet to be found, the above observations show that RNA molecules can regulate the function of RHA. In addition to the functional interaction of RNA molecules with RHA and MLE, the importance of RNA molecules in the protein&#x02013;protein interaction has been shown for topoisomerase II&#x003b1;, which associates with as yet unidentified complexes in an RNase-sensitive but DNase I-resistant manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c20">20</xref>). This observation raises an intriguing possibility that, like MLE and MSL complexes, topoisomerase II&#x003b1; forms multiprotein complexes containing RNA molecules. However, the identity of RNA molecules interacting with topoisomerase II&#x003b1; and whether RNA binding activity is an intrinsic activity of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; remain undetermined.</p><p>In this report, we show that RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; form complexes containing RNA molecules in the presence of Ubc9, a functional homolog of E2-type ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c22">22</xref>). Like several non-coding (nc) RNA molecules with regulatory function, including <italic>XIST&#x0002f;Xist</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c24">24</xref>), <italic>SRA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c25">25</xref>) and <italic>Air</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c26">26</xref>), there can exist specific RNA molecules that play a role in the RHA&#x02013;topoisomerase II&#x003b1; interaction. Using purified RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1;, we also show that the binding of RHA to dsDNA augments the relaxation activity of topoisomerase II&#x003b1;, whereas topoisomerase II&#x003b1; suppresses the helicase activity of RHA. Our observation suggests that RHA&#x02013;topoisomerase II&#x003b1; complexes might regulate both the superhelicity and helicity of DNA, potentially influencing the stability and transcription activity of chromatin.</p></sec><sec><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Proteins and plasmid DNAs</title><p>Recombinant RHA and MLE used in the present study were essentially the same as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c5">5</xref>). Calf thymus topoisomerase I was commercially obtained (Invitrogen). Topoisomerase II&#x003b1; was purified as follows. In brief, nuclear extracts (2.3 g) prepared from HeLa cells (60 l), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c2">2</xref>), were subjected to ammonium sulfate (AS) fractionation. AS 35&#x02013;65&#x00025; fraction was loaded onto DEAE Sepharose (Pharmacia), followed by heparin Sepharose (Pharmacia), P11 (Whatman), brown agarose (Sigma) and green agarose (Sigma). The final fraction (850 &#x000b5;g) was enriched in topoisomerase II&#x003b1;, which constituted &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of the protein detected on SDS&#x02013;PAGE.

Supercoiled pBluescript IIKS<sup>&#x02013;</sup> (pBS) was prepared using the Qiagen plasmid kit.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA)</title><p>The polylinker region (167 bp) of pBS was amplified by PCR using T7 and T3 primers.

To prepare 10 and 15 bp DNA probes, partial dsDNAs were formed using two sets of synthetic primers, 5&#x02032;-CGACGGTATC-3&#x02032;&#x0002f;5&#x02032;-GATACCG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CGACGGTATCGATAA-3&#x02032;&#x0002f;5&#x02032;-TTATCGATACG-3&#x02032;.

However, 10 and 15 bp dsDNAs were purified by gel-filtration chromatography on G-50 column (5 ml) using a buffer containing 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, 0.1 mM ethylenediamine tetra-acetate (EDTA), 150 mM NaCl and 0.05&#x00025; NP-40, followed by ethanol precipitation. A standard EMSA reaction (20 &#x000b5;l) contained 20 mM HEPES&#x02013;NaOH, pH 7.4, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.05&#x00025; NP-40, 12 nM <sup>32</sup>P-labeled DNA, and varying concentrations (10&#x02013;40 nM) of RHA.

After a 24 h incubation, cells were supplied with fresh DME media containing 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum and incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells, grown in five culture plates, were collected by centrifugation at 1000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and washed once with ice-cold 1&#x000d7; phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5&#x00025; NP-40, 1&#x00025; deoxycholate, 2 mM DTT and 5&#x00025; glycerol. Cell slurries were cleared by centrifugation at 15 000 r.p.m. at 4&#x000b0;C, and the supernatants containing CE were directly stored at &#x02013;70&#x000b0;C.

Other aliquots (25&#x00025;), resolved on a 7.5&#x00025; SDS&#x02013; polyacrylamide gel, were transferred to a nylon filter (Schleicher and Schuell) using the SemiDry system (Bio-Rad). Western blot analysis was performed using rabbit anti-RHA antibody, rabbit anti-Topo II antibody (Topogen) or mouse anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c1">1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>RHA interacts with dsNAs</title><p>RHA is the only known cellular helicase that catalyzes the unwinding of dsRNA, dsDNA and RNA:DNA hybrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c3">3</xref>). Most helicases possess two functional domains, one for interaction with single-stranded nucleic acid (ssNA) and the other with double-stranded nucleic acid (dsNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c30">30</xref>). Although RHA possesses two dsRNA binding motifs at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c31">31</xref>), it has yet to be experimentally proven if RHA interacts directly with dsNA. Therefore, we determined whether RHA binds to dsNA of either linear or circular form. Consistent with its ability to unwind both dsRNA and dsDNA containing a ssNA region, RHA interacted stably with both dsRNA and dsDNA lacking a ssNA region, forming two discernible complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f1">1</xref>A). This result provides evidence that RHA directly interacts with dsNA.</p><p>We also explored whether the length of dsNA quantitatively influences the interaction with RHA. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f1">1</xref>B and C, RHA associated with dsNAs of different lengths (39&#x02013;104 bp) with varying affinities. With dsDNA of 34 and 104 bp, <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>s were estimated to be &#x0223c;5&#x02013;18 nM. RHA formed a complex with a 15 bp dsDNA in a concentration-dependent manner but with almost 50-fold lower affinity. In contrast, a 10 bp dsDNA barely interacted with RHA. These results suggest that the longer the duplex region is, the more efficiently RHA interacts with it. Our observation also implies that the minimal length of dsDNA required for the RHA binding is &#x0223c;15 bp. Multiple complexes formed with 34 bp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f1">1</xref>A) or longer DNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f1">1</xref>B), therefore, might be due to the association of more than one RHA molecule.</p></sec><sec><title>RHA stimulates the relaxation of supercoiled DNAs catalyzed by topoisomerases</title><p>It has been shown previously that the SWI&#x0002f;SNF complex binds and imposes a structural constraint on supercoiled DNAs. In doing so, the SWI&#x0002f;SNF complex assists topoisomerase I in inducing a positive supercoiling in an ATP-independent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c34">34</xref>). We sought to address whether RHA similarly influences the topology of bound dsDNA and consequentially affects the reaction catalyzed by topoisomerases. We first examined whether superhelicity influences the binding of RHA to dsDNA. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f2">2</xref>A, varying amounts (0.25&#x02013;1 &#x000b5;g) of RHA were incubated with 0.2 &#x000b5;g of either linear or supercoiled pBS, and the reaction mixtures analyzed on a native agarose gel. Both circular (lanes 3&#x02013;5) and linear forms (lanes 6&#x02013;8) of pBS exhibited retarded mobility with the increment of RHA. The smeared migration pattern of pBS complexed with RHA appears to be due to the association of varying numbers of RHA molecules (see below). Treatment of reaction mixtures with SDS and proteinase K abrogates the generation of RHA&#x02013;pBS complexes (data not shown). These results suggest that superhelicity does not significantly influence the interaction of RHA with dsDNA and that RHA does not alter the topology of bound pBS.</p><p>Next, we addressed whether the binding of RHA to supercoiled DNA affects the relaxation reaction mediated by topoisomerases. Similar to SWI&#x0002f;SNF complex, RHA stimulated the relaxation reaction mediated by either calf thymus topoisomerase I (Promega) or HeLa topoisomerase II&#x003b1; Increasing amounts (0.125&#x02013;2.0 &#x000b5;g) of RHA progressively activated the relaxation of 3 kb plasmid DNA (pBS) catalyzed by topoisomerase II&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f2">2</xref>B). It was estimated that in a reaction containing 1 &#x000b5;g of RHA and 0.25 &#x000b5;g of supercoiled pBS, RHA could be present at every 50&#x02013;60 bp. Under this condition, the relaxation reaction by topoisomerase I or II&#x003b1; was stimulated &#x0223c;10&#x02013;20-fold, determined by the percent remaining supercoiled DNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f2">2</xref>C). Similar results were obtained with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> topoisomerase I (data not shown). These results suggest that the relaxation reaction is stimulated not by the specific interaction between RHA and topoisomerases but rather by the presence of RHA itself on dsDNA. Similar to SWI&#x0002f;SNF, the stimulatory effect of RHA on the relaxation reaction might be due to its association with dsDNA. Unlike SWI&#x0002f;SNF complex, RHA did not lead to the formation of positively supercoiled DNA in the presence of either topoisomerase I or II (data not shown). Thus, there seems to be a mechanistic difference between RHA and SWI&#x0002f;SNF in activating topoisomerases, which might, in part, be attributed to the ability of RHA to form complexes with topoisomerase II&#x003b1; (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Topoisomerase II&#x003b1; suppresses the helicase activity of RHA</title><p>The above results, together with the observation of RHA&#x02013;topoisomerase II&#x003b1; complexes (see below), prompted us to determine whether the catalytic function of RHA is influenced by topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. For this purpose, unwinding reactions catalyzed by RHA were performed in the presence or absence of topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. In contrast to the stimulatory effect of RHA on the relaxation reaction, topoisomerase II&#x003b1; inhibited the unwinding of dsDNA catalyzed by either RHA or MLE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f3">3</xref>). Though less severe, topoisomerase II&#x003b1; also interfered with the unwinding of dsRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f3">3</xref>B, closed symbols). The result that neither BSA nor HeLa SSB (single-stranded DNA binding protein) significantly influenced the unwinding of dsDNA or dsRNA by RHA (data not shown) suggests that the inhibitory effect of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; on the helicase activity of RHA and MLE is not non-specific. In addition, it is important to note that the inhibitory effect of toposiomerase II&#x003b1; on the helicase activity of RHA is functionally relevant to the activated relaxation of supercoiled DNAs, since both lead to the stabilization of duplex nature of NAs. The possible joint function of RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; during transcription is discussed below.</p></sec><sec><title>RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; assemble a complex <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>In order to gain insights into the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of RHA, we identified RHA-interacting factors by performing a series of IP experiments using anti-RHA antibody and HeLa nuclear extract. The IP pellets were subjected to 7.5&#x00025; SDS&#x02013;PAGE. Coomassie staining revealed several proteins of 300, 170, 100 and 80 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f4">4</xref>A, lane 2). Considering the stimulatory effect of RHA on the relaxation activity of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f2">2</xref>), the presence of a 170 kDa protein among those co-immunoprecipitated with RHA was of great interest since the apparent molecular weight of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; in human is 170 kDa. Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis identified that the 170 kDa protein is indeed topoisomerase II&#x003b1; (data not shown).</p><p>To confirm the above result, IP was repeated using anti-RHA and anti-topoisomerase II&#x003b1; antibodies, and the resulting pellets were analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f4">4</xref>B, both topoisomerase II&#x003b1; and RHA were present in the IP pellets obtained with anti-RHA (lane 3) and anti-topoisomerase II&#x003b1; antibodies (lane 4), respectively. Densitometry analysis of western signals detected in the IP pellet and nuclear extract suggests that &#x0223c;15&#x00025; of nuclear RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; is found in the IP pellets. However, it is presently unknown whether RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; are in direct physical contact. The identification of remaining proteins co-precipitated with RHA (NDs in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f5">5</xref>A) might help address this issue.</p><p>Interestingly, treatment of the IP pellets with RNase A resulted in the dissociation of RHA or topoisomerase II&#x003b1; from the IP pellet containing topoisomerase II&#x003b1; or RHA complex, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f4">4</xref>B, lanes 5 and 6). However, prolonged incubation of the IP pellets in the presence of ATP or DNase I did not disturb the interaction between RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; (data not shown). These results suggest that yet unknown but specific RNA molecules are involved in the assembly of the RHA&#x02013;topoisomerase II&#x003b1; complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Ubc9 induces the association of RHA with topoisomerase II&#x003b1;</title><p>That only a fraction of nuclear RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; exists in a complex may indicate their instability. However, this is unlikely, since prolonged incubation (1 h at 37&#x000b0;C) of the IP pellet obtained with anti-RHA or anti-topoisomerase II&#x003b1; antibody did not lead to the dissociation of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; or RHA (see above). Alternatively, RHA&#x02013;topoisomerase II&#x003b1; complex may be formed in a cell cycle-dependent manner. It is also possible that additional factors involved in the formation of RHA&#x02013;topoisomerase II&#x003b1; complex may be present in limiting concentrations. We explored the above possibilities by determining whether ectopically expressed RHA (flag-tagged RHA) associates with endogenous topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. If additional but limiting factors are required for the formation of RHA&#x02013;topoisomerase II&#x003b1; complex, it can be predicted that unless they are co-expressed, little or no complex will be formed between flag-tagged RHA and endogenous topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. Otherwise, flag-tagged RHA is expected to associate with topoisomerase II&#x003b1; to a certain degree. For this purpose, 293T cells were transfected with a vector expressing flag-tagged RHA and, after 48 h, CEs were prepared using a hypotonic buffer. The remaining nuclear pellet was extracted with 0.45 M NaCl, and the soluble fraction (N450) cleared by centrifugation, as described in Materials and Methods.</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f5">5</xref>A, both CE and N450 contained flag-RHA but endogenous topoisomerase II&#x003b1; was present only in N450, as determined by western blotting using anti-flag (M2, Sigma) and anti-topoisomerase II&#x003b1; antibodies (Topogen) (compare lanes 1 and 3). Thus, only the N450 fraction was subjected to IP using M2 antibody and the resulting pellet was examined for the presence of endogenous topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. Unlike endogenous RHA, flag-RHA did not associate with endogenous topoisomerase II&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f5">5</xref>B, lane 3). This result supports the possibility that additional factors are required for the formation of RHA&#x02013;topoisomerase II&#x003b1; complex in the nucleus, but their availability may be a limiting factor.</p><p>Recently, we have screened a HeLa cDNA library (Clontech) employing the yeast two-hybrid assay using full-length RHA as bait, and we have identified Ubc9, an E2-type enzyme specific for small ubiquitin-like molecule-1 (Sumo-1), as an RHA-interacting factor (K.Zhou, J.Argasinska, R.J.Donnelly, R.T.Hay and C.G.Lee, unpublished data). Our observation, together with the previous report describing a direct interaction between Ubc9 and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; or II&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c35">35</xref>), prompted us to explore whether Ubc9 is required for the association of ectopically expressed RHA with topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. For this purpose, 293T cells were co-transfected with pCDNA3-fhis-RHA and CMV-Ubc9-V5. Western blot analysis using anti-V5 antibody indicated the distribution of V5-Ubc9 in both CE and N450 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f5">5</xref>A, lanes 2 and 4). When subjected to IP using N450 and M2 antibody, as described above, endogenous topoisomerase II&#x003b1; was co-precipitated with flag-RHA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f5">5</xref>B, lane 4).</p><p>In addition to Ubc9, RHA interacts with CBP&#x0002f;p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c7">7</xref>), BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c8">8</xref>) and RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c36">36</xref>). Thus, similar assays were performed with constructs expressing CBP or p300. In contrast to Ubc9, neither CBP nor p300 co-expression supported the interaction between flag-RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; (data not shown). These results indicate that Ubc9 is a limiting factor required for the interaction between RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. As described above, the interaction between Ubc9 and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; has been demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c35">35</xref>). However, we were unable to find any optimal condition for the detection of Ubc9 in the IP pellet obtained with anti-RHA or anti-topoisomerase II&#x003b1; antibody (data not shown). Our result might suggest that the association of Ubc9 with RHA or topoisomerase II&#x003b1; is too weak to be stably detected <italic>in vitro</italic>. Alternatively, Ubc9 might transiently interact with RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; to induce their interaction. The identification of additional factors required for the interaction between RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; will allow us to test the above possibilities.</p></sec><sec><title>The ATPase activity of RHA is dispensable for its interaction with topoisomerase II&#x003b1;</title><p>RHA and MLE interact with topoisomerase II&#x003b1; and MSL complexes, respectively, through the involvement of RNA molecules. A substitution mutation in the Walker motif A of MLE (GKT to GET) leads to its association not only with the male X chromosome but also with autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c31">31</xref>). In addition, such a mutation decreases cellular levels of <italic>roX2</italic> RNA, eliminating both MLE&#x02013;MSL and <italic>roX2</italic> RNA&#x02013;MSL complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c16">16</xref>). These observations illustrate the importance of the ATPase activity of MLE in stabilizing <italic>roX2</italic> RNA as well as in its activity to interact with MSL complexes. Therefore, we explored whether the ATPase activity of RHA is required for the interaction between RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. For this purpose, 293T cells were transfected with a construct, expressing a mutant RHA (RHA<sup>GET</sup>), carrying GET in place of GKT in the Walker motif A, and the N450 extract was prepared and subjected to IP using anti-RHA antibody. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg328f5">5</xref>C, topoisomerase II&#x003b1; was present in both RHA- and RHA<sup>GET</sup>-containing IP pellets (lanes 3 and 4). The association of RHA<sup>GET</sup> with topoisomerase II&#x003b1; was also sensitive to RNase A (data not shown). These results indicate that the ATPase activity of RHA is not required for its association with topoisomerase II&#x003b1; and with RNA molecules.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>There are many parallels between RHA and MLE. Previously, we have shown that the biochemical properties of RHA and MLE are indistinguishable. The present study exhibits an additional similarity between RHA and MLE: the requirement of RNA molecules for their interaction with other proteins. The interaction between RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; resembles the assembly of MLE in MSL complexes containing <italic>roX1&#x0002f;2</italic> RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c31">31</xref>). RNase A treatment dissociates MLE from the male X chromosome without affecting other MSL proteins or RNA polymerase II associated with the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c31">31</xref>). In addition to MLE, at least two other MSL proteins, male-absent on the first (MOF) and MSL-3, are capable of interacting with <italic>roX2</italic> RNA through the chromodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c37">37</xref>). It is, therefore, possible that MLE interacts indirectly with MSL complexes on the X chromosome, bridged by <italic>roX2</italic> RNA.</p><p>Based on a similar scenario, RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; may be brought together by RNA molecules. Obviously, the ability of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; to interact with RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c38">38</xref>) would greatly facilitate this interaction. Alternatively, upon its binding, RNA molecules may induce a conformational change in RHA, which promotes RHA interaction with topoisomerase II&#x003b1; or with other factors. To date, RNA-induced conformational changes have been shown for a few proteins such as the 40S ribosomal subunit interacting with hepatitis C virus <italic>IRES</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c39">39</xref>) and PRK, a protein kinase activated by dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c40">40</xref>).</p><p>The interaction between RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; requires protein factors in addition to RNA molecules. Our study shows that at least Ubc9 needs to be co-expressed to support the interaction between ectopically expressed flag-tagged RHA with topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. A direct interaction has been demonstrated between Ubc9 and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; or II&#x003b2; by yeast two-hybrid assay and GST pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c35">35</xref>). The N&#x02010;terminal 137 amino acids of RHA support the interaction of RHA with Ubc9 (K.Zhou, J.Argasinska, R.J.Donnelly, R.T.Hay and C.G.Lee, unpublished data). Thus, Ubc9 may bridge the interaction between RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. The physical association with Ubc9 at the N&#x02010;terminal domain may activate RHA to recognize and bind both RNA molecules and topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. Alternatively, the association with Ubc9 may enable topoisomerase II&#x003b1; to form a complex with flag-tagged RHA. Identification of various factors associated with the RHA&#x02013;topoisomerase II&#x003b1; complex, including RNA molecules, will provide clues to the molecular nature of the RHA&#x02013;topoisomerase II&#x003b1; interaction.</p><p>The functional significance of RHA&#x02013;topoisomerase II&#x003b1; complex remains to be established. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, topoisomerase II interacts with at least three factors such as supercoiling factor (SCF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c41">41</xref>), chromatin accessibility complex (CHRAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c42">42</xref>) and histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (HDAC1&#x0002f;2) in nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c43">43</xref>). SCF and topoisomerase II function jointly to introduce negative superhelical turns into DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> and co-localize to puffs on polytene chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c2">2</xref>), implying a role for the SCF&#x02013;topoisomerase II complex in gene expression. The role of topoisomerase II in transcription is also implied by the transcriptional repression of genes containing Polycomb group (PcG) target sequences in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In general, the PcG proteins are required to preserve the transcriptionally silenced state of affected chromatin region and this process accompanies the interaction of the PcG protein Polyhomeotic with both topoisomerase II and Barren (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c44">44</xref>). The function of topoisomerase II as a co-repressor is suggested by its interaction with retinoblastoma protein (Rb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c45">45</xref>) and histone deacetylases HDAC1&#x0002f;2 in NuRD complex that mediates histone deacetylation and ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c46">46</xref>).</p><p>As seen with purified RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1;, RHA in complex may stimulate the relaxation reaction either by facilitating the access of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; to chromatin DNA or by directly binding to chromatin DNA. If complexed RHA and topoisomerase II&#x003b1; function in a concerted manner, the affected chromatin region may undergo a significant topological alteration due to the reduction in superhelicity. Mechanistically a similar mode of action has been proposed to explain the stimulatory function of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription on chromatin template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c46">46</xref>). Interestingly, chromatin-dependent transcription is activated when topoisomerase II&#x003b1; is provided during but not after chromatin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c46">46</xref>). This observation suggests that additional factors may be required for the interaction of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; with nucleosomal DNA. If the access of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; to chromatin is facilitated by complexed RHA, it can be predicted that, unlike topoisomerase II&#x003b1; alone, the RHA&#x02013;topoisomerase II&#x003b1; complexes will activate RNA polymersae II-mediated transcription on pre-assembled chromatin template. Moreover, the DNA, once isolated post-transcriptionally, would be highly underwound if RHA&#x02013;topoisomerase II complexes, operating in front of the transcription machinery, remove the positive supercoiling generated downstream of transcription site as a result of the movement of RNA polymerase II.</p><p>Several transcription factors such as ATF-2, CREB, c-Jun and p53 bind and stimulate the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c48">48</xref>). In addition, there is increasing evidence indicating the conjoined function of topoisomerases and helicases. The RecQ family of asp-glu-x-his (DExH) DNA helicases act in concert with topoisomerase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c49">49</xref>). The interactions between two mammalian RecQ-like helicases, Bloom&#x02019;s syndrome gene product (BLM) and Werner&#x02019;s syndrome gene product (WRN), and topoisomerase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg328c51">51</xref>) suggest the conserved conjoined function of RecQ helicases and type I topoisomerases in eukaryotic species. Our observations show that RHA functionally and physically interacts with topoisomerase II&#x003b1;, which suggests that a concerted function might be more general among topoisomerases and helicases. Quantitative isolation and thorough identification of RHA&#x02013;topoisomerase II&#x003b1; complex is underway in an effort to define their biochemical and biological functions in more detail.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg328f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Binding of RHA to dsDNA and dsRNA.
