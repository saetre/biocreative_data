Complete abrogation of HIV transmission and formation of cellular conjugates was only observed when gp120/CD4 interactions were blocked. The dispensable role of LFA-1 in HIV transmission was confirmed using non-lymphoid 293T cells, lacking the expression of adhesion molecules, as HIV producing cells. Moreover, HIV transmission between infected and uninfected primary CD4 T cells was abrogated by inhibitors of gp120 binding to CD4 but was not inhibited by blocking LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 or ICAM-3. Rather, LFA-1 and ICAM-3 mAbs enhanced HIV transfer.

Although free HIV particles are infectious, they show a short lifespan at 37&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and lower infectivity than cell-to-cell HIV transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Cell-to-cell virus transmission occurs through the formation of stable cellular contacts defined as virological synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], that can be formed between a target CD4 T cell and either a dendritic cell (DC) or a productively HIV infected cell. Although both synapses share the common function of transmitting HIV to CD4 T cells, their structures appreciably differ: DC-T cell synapses concentrate TCR/MHC complexes in the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC), while in T cell-T cell synapses the cSMAC is formed by the binding of HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) to CD4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>LFA-1 appears to play a key role in the formation of virological synapses by interacting with its high-affinity ligand CD54/ICAM-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The binding of ICAM-1 to LFA-1 is facilitated by initial low-affinity interactions of LFA-1 with the widely expressed ligand CD50/ICAM-3 at the cSMAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] that leads to LFA-1 activation and clustering in the periphery of the synaptic structures (peripheral supramolecular activation cluster or pSMAC) stabilizing cellular contacts and providing costimulatory signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, recent work suggests that the cSMAC of immunological synapses may be built in the absence of LFA-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The active contribution of LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction to HIV spread has been described during free virus infection of CD4 T cells and infection mediated by DC. In both cases, LFA-1 increases viral infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and directs infection towards CD45RO<sup>+ </sup>memory CD4 T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, the involvement of adhesion molecules in the transmission of HIV between infected and uninfected CD4 T cells is poorly defined: although LFA-1 may modulate the formation of cellular conjugates and synaptic structures, a clear correlation between LFA-1 expression and HIV transmission has not been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Cellular contacts between infected and uninfected primary CD4 T cells lead to the polarization of cell-surface Env expression and viral budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] towards the contact area. Concomitant polarization of CD4 results in the formation of a virological synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This synaptic structure allows high levels of viral transfer between infected and target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] which, aside from increasing viral entry, also activates endocytic mechanisms of HIV capture that require the extracellular but no the intracellular moiety of CD4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>To define the contribution of adhesion molecules to the process of HIV transfer between infected and uninfected CD4 T cells, we have cultured primary CD4 T cells with different productively infected cell lines or primary cells. Our data suggest that, in contrast to other mechanisms of HIV spread, the interaction of LFA-1 with its main ligand ICAM-1 is dispensable for HIV transmission between CD4 T cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The role of adhesion molecules in cell-to-cell contacts between HIV infected and uninfected T cells</title><p>The known role of LFA-1 in HIV attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and formation of synaptic structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] led us to evaluate the role of adhesion molecules in our previously described model of T cell-to-T cell HIV transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. First, we confirmed the expression of LFA-1 (total and activated forms), ICAM-1 and -3 in target purified primary CD4 T cells and effector MOLT cells. All cells stained positive for these antigens with different intensities. Primary CD4 T cells expressed high levels of LFA-1 and lower levels of ICAM-3, ICAM-1 and activated LFA-1. Memory cells showed higher expression of all antigens compared to naive cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). All MOLT cells (uninfected and infected with either NL4-3 or BaL viruses) expressed lower levels of LFA-1 (total and activated forms) than primary CD4 T cells, while ICAM-1 and ICAM-3 expression was comparable to that of naive CD4 T cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The expression of CD4 and HIV Env was also evaluated. Cell surface CD4 staining served to confirm similar levels of expression in naive and memory primary cells, and the complete downregulation in productively infected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Env expression was comparable in both NL4-3 and BaL infected MOLT cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The expression of adhesion molecules in effector and targets cells</bold>. Primary CD4 T cells as well as MOLT cells uninfected or chronically infected with NL4-3 or BaL isolates were analyzed for the expression of ICAM-1, ICAM-3, total LFA-1, the activated form of LFA-1 and CD4. Staining of the cell surface molecules was performed using monoclonal antibodies RM3A5, 140.11, R7.1, mAb24 and Leu3a respectively. The expression of HIV Env was evaluated in MOLT cells using pooled serums from HIV infected individuals.

In these experiments, individual cells could be identified by forward scatter and fluorescence values. Cellular conjugates displayed high levels of fluorescence (given by the labeled CD4 T cells) and forward scatter values similar to the MOLT cell population (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We employed uninfected MOLT cells as control and also analyzed the effects of different inhibitors. MOLT NL4-3 and BaL cells showed higher percentage of cellular conjugates (13% and 8% respectively) than uninfected cells (1%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, Control). Regardless of viral tropism, cellular conjugates were significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.05) inhibited by the anti-CD4 mAb Leu3a or by continuous shacking during incubation as described by Sourisseau et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In contrast, the addition of antagonists of either CXCR4 (AMD3100) or CCR5 (TAK779) and the gp41 inhibitor C34 (at concentrations that completely blocked cell-to-cell fusion) failed to inhibit the formation of cellular conjugates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Similarly, the addition of blocking antibodies against adhesion molecules (LFA-1, ICAM-1 and -3), did not show any significant impact on the formation of cellular conjugates. As a whole, these data suggest that the expression of HIV Env and CD4 are the main determinants of the formation of cellular conjugates between infected and uninfected CD4 T cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Formation of T cell-T cell conjugates</bold>. Panel A shows a representative experiment of quantification of cellular contacts between MOLT cells and purified CMRA-labeled CD4 T cells. MOLT cells appear as an unstained population with high forward scatter values (in orange); while CD4 T cells were identified by fluorescent staining and low forward scatter values (in purple). Events displaying bright fluorescence and forward scatter values consistent with MOLT cells were defined as cellular conjugates (in red, gate MOLT-CD4 in the figure). The percentage of CD4 T cells forming conjugates in the absence or the presence of Leu3a, or under continuous shacking condition is shown in each plot.

To address this possibility in our culture system, we tested the effect of antibodies blocking adhesion molecules in an assay that measures transfer of HIV particles from infected to uninfected T cells. The blockade of the &#x003b1; or &#x003b2; chains of LFA-1 (CD11a and CD18, respectively), the activated form of LFA-1, and ICAM-1 or ICAM-3 did not show any inhibitory effect on the transfer of HIV particles, measured as the percentage of p24 positive target cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Similarly, combinations of anti-ICAM-1 with either anti-ICAM-3 or anti-LFA-1 antibodies failed to block HIV transfer (data not shown). In the search of other adhesion components expressed on the cell surface, which could be involved in the formation of cellular conjugates or HIV attachment, we have also evaluated the role of CD147 and CD29 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Blocking antibodies against these molecules did not inhibit HIV transfer; rather a significant increase was observed in the presence of the anti-CD147 antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>The role of adhesion molecules on T cell-to-T cell HIV transmission</bold>.

Concentrations were 10 &#x003bc;g/mL for all mAbs against cell surface molecules, except for Leu3a (5 &#x003bc;g/mL) and C34 (1 &#x003bc;g/mL).

Therefore, T cell-to-T cell HIV transmission might take place in the absence of LFA-1 interactions with ICAMs. To investigate the requirements of LFA-1 function in HIV transmission, we used 293T cells. First, we confirmed that these cells do not show detectable expression of LFA-1, ICAM-1, -2 and -3 on their surface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Second, we transfected 293T cells with plasmids coding for an <italic>env </italic>deficient genome of HIV (&#x00394;env) together with an <italic>env/rev </italic>cassette (NL4-3 isolate). Of note, 293T cells transfected with the plasmid &#x00394;env alone were used as a control of potential Env-independent nonspecific transmission. Transfected cells were then cocultured with primary CD4 T cells to analyze cell-to-cell viral transfer. HIV was specifically transferred from Env-expressing 293T to CD4 T cells by a mechanism similar to that observed for MOLT infected cells: it was abrogated by Leu3a and unaffected by the addition of C34 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), reasserting that the binding of LFA-1 to its ligands is not necessary to observe an efficient HIV transmission.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>LFA-1 independent cell-to-cell HIV transmission</bold>.

Therefore, we sough to evaluate whether LFA-1-independent HIV transfer between CD4 T cells might present a different target cell selectivity. In this set of experiments, after coculture with HIV producing cells, we gated memory (CD45RO+) and na&#x000ef;ve (CD45RO-) cells and then we calculated the percentage of p24 positive cells in each subset. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> (left) shows that memory CD4 T cells had significantly higher levels of p24 than naive cells when cocultured with both NL4-3 and BaL chronically infected MOLT cells (p &#x0003c; 0.05). This selectivity of HIV transfer towards the memory subset was independent of LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1, as it was not modified by the addition of the anti-ICAM-1 mAb RM3A5 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, right).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Preferential LFA-1-independent transfer of HIV particles to CD45RO+ cells during T cell-T cell synapses</bold>.

Once more, memory T cells showed significant higher values of p24 content than na&#x000ef;ve cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, left).

HIV transfer mediated by ICAM-1 expressing 293T cells was not modified by C34, and was inhibited by Leu3a (data not shown). Consistent with a specific role of ICAM-1 in this cellular model, the anti-ICAM-1 mAb RM3A5 reverted the net increase of HIV transfer and the higher selectivity towards memory cells induced by ICAM-1 expression. However, this antibody was unable to completely block HIV transfer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, right).

In contrast, the expression of ICAM-1 is low in MOLT cells, which in turn express higher levels of HIV Env (RFI values of 2.65 and 6.95 for ICAM-1 and Env, respectively in MOLT NL4-3 infected cells, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). To clearly define the role of ICAM-1 in HIV transmission between primary CD4 T cells, we purified productively infected CD4 T cells from infected cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and used them as effector cells. First, we determined the expression of LFA-1 (mAb R7.1), ICAM-1 (mAb RM3A5) and ICAM-3 (mAb 140.11) in gated CD3+CD8-CD4- T cells of infected PBMC cultures, which represent the productively infected cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The expression of these molecules was compared to the CD3+CD8-CD4+ cells of the same cultures, finding no significant differences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of ICAM-1 and LFA-1 was higher than in MOLT cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Next, we purified productively infected CD3+/CD8-/CD4- T cells that were cocultured with unstimulated uninfected CD4 T cells. Transfer of HIV was again detected in both na&#x000ef;ve and memory subsets, being significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.05) higher in the latter subset and significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.05) inhibited by Leu3A but not C34 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Similarly to MOLT cells, the addition of blocking ICAM-1, LFA-1 or ICAM-3 antibodies did not inhibit HIV transfer; rather significant increases were induced by the 140.11 anti-ICAM-3 or the R7.1 anti-LFA-1 antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). To address the role of antibody mediated cross linking and signaling on these enhancing effects, we compared the effect of Fab fragments of the ICAM-3 mAb 140.11 or a monomeric soluble form of ICAM-1 with the effect of whole IgGs. The increase in HIV transfer induced by anti-LFA-1 R7.1 IgG was significantly lost when LFA-1 was blocked using sICAM-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Similarly, significant differences were observed between the enhancing effect of the anti-ICAM-3 140.11 IgG and its Fab fragment, although the latter still retained some ability to increase HIV transfer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). None of the inhibitors used, unless the anti-CD4 mAb Leu3a, inhibited HIV transfer. In summary, these data support the idea that the binding of HIV Env (gp120) to CD4 governs HIV transfer between CD4 T cells in the absence of LFA-1 interactions with ICAM-1 or -3. Nevertheless, signaling through these adhesion molecules may modulate both the extent and the target cell selectivity of viral transfer.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>The role of adhesion molecules in HIV transmission between primary CD4 T cells</bold>. In panel A the expression of the indicated adhesion molecules was analyzed in the surface of T cells from a representative NL4-3 infected PBMC culture.

Concerning coreceptors, it is well known that CXCR4 is highly expressed in cultured primary T cells, while CCR5 is restricted to a subset of memory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore, a potential active participation of the coreceptor in cellular conjugates should favor X4 Envs. However, we show that both X4 and R5 Envs formed similar amounts of cellular conjugates with primary CD4 T cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Moreover, coreceptor blockade did not inhibit cellular contacts, which were only sensitive to CD4 blockade. Thus, the implication of coreceptors in HIV transmission is subsequent to the cellular contact and determine further cell-to-cell fusion, productive infection or death of target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The potential role of adhesion molecules (mainly LFA-1 and ICAM-1) is unexpectedly secondary for HIV transfer from MOLT cells or primary infected T cells to CD4 T cells. We have observed that Env-independent contacts between uninfected MOLT cells and CD4 T cells are near background levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and that the blockade of adhesion molecules, employing inhibitory specific mAbs, did not significantly modify HIV Env-mediated cellular contacts or HIV transfer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Noteworthy, all antibodies were titrated and added at saturating concentrations in inhibitory experiments. As a positive control, activity was assessed in parallel experiments in which LFA-1 and ICAM-1 antibodies efficiently blocked monocyte aggregation induced by IL-12 and IL-18 (data not shown, G Coma, unpublished results) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Moreover, the anti-ICAM-1 mAb RM3A5 inhibited the modest effect (2-fold increase in HIV transfer to memory cells) observed when ICAM-1 is expressed in 293 T cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).</p><p>The secondary role of ICAM-1 in HIV transfer between CD4 T cells and its limited effect in 293T cells is contradictory with the more relevant role reported in the infection of CD4 T cells by free HIV particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and the complete requirement of this molecule for transinfection induced by DC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Of note, T cell-T cell contacts and DC-T cell contacts are relatively different processes. We have also worked with DC, and we have found that, in contrast to T cell-T cell contacts, high level of DC-T cell contacts are observed in the absence of HIV Env (IP, NIU unpublished results) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In fact, for DC mediated transinfection of CD4 T cells, HIV takes advantage of naturally occurring cellular contacts during DC scanning of T cells or antigen presentation. In contrast, for efficient transmission between T cells, HIV forces the contacts through Env expression on the surface of infected cells, as T cell-T cell contacts are low in the absence of HIV Env. In this regard, Env expression has been recently reported to increase the number of effective contacts between infected DC and T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] despite the relevant role of adhesion molecules in this type of synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It is therefore reasonable that Env plays a key role in the formation of conjugates between CD4 T cells that <italic>in vitro </italic>have shown low levels of Env-independent contacts. <italic>In vivo</italic>, adhesion molecules may also actively participate in antigen-dependent mechanisms of HIV spread between CD4 T cells, involving regulatory mechanisms or antigen presentation. However, the contribution of T cell contacts to regulatory mechanisms is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and antigen presentation is impaired by Nef-induced down regulation of MHC Class II molecules and the fast kinetics of Env expression in infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The contribution of adhesion molecules to HIV spread has been widely studied. Early reports suggest a role in syncytium formation but not in HIV spread or replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Also efficient Env functions, such as cell-to-cell fusion or HIV transfer, have been reported in LFA-1-deficient cells or expressing low affinity forms of this integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A more recent report focused on the formation of virological synapses suggests that cellular conjugates and cell-to-cell HIV transmission were poorly affected by the blockade of adhesion molecules, and that only morphological determinants of virological synapses appear to be inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Our results fully agree with a secondary role for adhesion molecules in the formation of cellular conjugates and the transfer of HIV particles between infected and uninfected T cells, and demonstrate that the binding of Env to CD4 governs the formation of cellular conjugates. Interestingly, signaling through LFA-1 and ICAM-3 appear to modulate the extent and the selectivity of HIV transfer between primary CD4 T cells, an effect that may be relevant for HIV spread <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Our data point to a different role of ICAM-1 in HIV transfer from MOLT or 293T cells to CD4 T cells. One can speculate that cellular contacts and virus transmission are regulated by a balance between the expression of Env and adhesion molecules on effector cells. When HIV is presented by 293T cells we detected additive contributions of both Env and ICAM-1 to HIV transfer, most likely due to the higher expression of ICAM-1, which may increase the number or cellular contacts or alternatively may signal through LFA-1 in target cells. In contrast, during HIV presentation by infected CD4 T cells (primary or MOLT cells), this equilibrium is completely unbalanced towards a full control of HIV transmission by Env binding to CD4.</p><p>By analogy to cell-free HIV attachment, which preferentially targets memory CD4 T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], we have also analyzed the selectivity of cell-to-cell HIV transfer for CD4 T cell subsets. Unexpectedly, MOLT, 293T and primary infected cells targeted CD45RO+ CD4 T cells by a mechanism independent of LFA-1 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). A potential explanation could be associated with the organization of signaling molecules, including ZAP70, which is more efficiently recruited to the immunological synapse in memory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Interestingly, ZAP70 signaling has been also involved in the formation of virological synapses and cell-to-cell HIV spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The transfer of HIV particles between infected and uninfected CD4 T cells is governed by HIV Env binding to CD4 and selectively targets memory cells.
