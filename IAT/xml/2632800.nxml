Whole-cell patch clamp recordings showed that single cysteine substitutions in the N-terminal half of pre-TM2 (Arg<sup>304</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>314</sup>) led to loss of function at Arg<sup>304</sup>, Leu<sup>306</sup>, Lys<sup>308</sup> and Ile<sup>312</sup>. Cysteine substitutions within this region also resulted in a significant reduction in the apparent molecular mass of receptors, due to loss of complex glycosylation at the nearby acceptor site Asn<sup>298</sup>, which was not seen for the C-terminal portion of pre-TM2 (Asp<sup>315</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>328</sup>). The reduction in complex glycosylation was not due to reduced cell-surface presentation, demonstrating that glycosylation at Asn<sup>298</sup> was acting as a sensor of subtle changes in receptor conformation within the pre-TM2 region. When this N-glycan site was repositioned closer to the plasma membrane by mutagenesis (N298S together with G299N, T300N, T301N or T303N), glycosylation was restored at G299N and T300N, but was impaired for T301N and completely absent for T303N. These results suggest that the region in the vicinity of Asp<sup>315</sup> is at the plasma membrane interface and that the N-terminal portion of pre-TM2 (Arg<sup>304</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>314</sup>) is important for the correct conformation of the receptor at the extracellular face of the membrane.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>pre-transmembrane segment 2 (TM2)</kwd><kwd>topology</kwd><kwd>scanning cysteine mutagenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>EndoH, endoglycosidase H</kwd><kwd>HEK, human embryonic kidney</kwd><kwd>TM, transmembrane domain</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><ref-count count="18"/><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>P2X receptors are a family of ligand-gated ion channels that play key roles in diverse physiological processes such as nerve transmission, control of smooth muscle tone and the response to inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Functional P2X receptors are trimers. Each of the three subunits is composed of intracellular N- and C-termini, two TMs (transmembrane domains) and a large ectodomain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. One of the most highly conserved parts of the P2X receptor protein sequence is the final 25 amino acids of the ectodomain which immediately precedes the second TM (pre-TM2; Arg<sup>304</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>328</sup> in the rat P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor sequence). This region has been proposed to be a signal transduction module, linking the conformational change associated with ATP binding to the opening of the channel pore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Residues within this region, in particular Lys<sup>308</sup>, have been implicated in both ATP binding and channel gating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Previous studies using cysteine mutants within the pre-TM2 region of human P2X<sub>1</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and alanine mutants within the pre-TM2 region of rat P2X<sub>4</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] have highlighted the importance of Arg<sup>305</sup>, Lys<sup>309</sup> and Phe<sup>311</sup> in P2X<sub>1</sub> (Arg<sup>304</sup>, Lys<sup>308</sup> and Tyr<sup>310</sup> in P2X<sub>2</sub>) and Tyr<sup>315</sup>, Gly<sup>316</sup> and Arg<sup>318</sup> in P2X<sub>4</sub> (Tyr<sup>310</sup>, Gly<sup>311</sup> and Arg<sup>313</sup> in P2X<sub>2</sub>) for optimal channel function. It has also been proposed that this region of the receptor might contain a membrane-permeant loop similar to that seen in voltage-gated potassium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>N-glycosylation of P2X receptors has been shown significantly to affect both protein folding and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Mature rat P2X<sub>2</sub> receptors are glycosylated at Asn<sup>182</sup>, Asn<sup>239</sup> and Asn<sup>298</sup>; removal of any single glycan by mutagenesis does not significantly impair receptor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], but removal of two or more glycans leads to incorrect folding and loss of surface presentation of the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the present study on the function of rat P2X<sub>2</sub> receptors with cysteine substitutions in the pre-TM2 region, we observed marked differences in the apparent molecular mass of the mutated receptors when expressed in HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells. In the present study, we show that the reasons for these differences have to do with altered complex glycosylation at Asn<sup>298</sup>, reflecting a subtle change in the conformation of the receptor in the pre-TM2 region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Molecular and cell biology</title><p>The wild-type rat P2X<sub>2</sub> cDNA used in the present study has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; it contains a C-terminal EYMPME epitope.

Several mutants displayed a reduced apparent molecular mass compared with wild-type, indicated by a reduction in, or loss of, the upper band representing protein of higher molecular mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B; broken lines); for example, the upper band was almost completely absent in the mutants R304C, L306C, Y310C, I312C and R313C. Scanning densitometry was used to calculate the percentage of upper band density relative to total band density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The percentage of upper band observed for wild-type P2X<sub>2</sub> was 46&#x000b1;1% (<italic>n</italic>=36). Cysteine substitutions in the region Arg<sup>304</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>314</sup> almost all showed a reduced amount of upper band (black bars), whereas those in the region Asp<sup>315</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>328</sup> did not (grey bars), with the exceptions of K324C and F325C.</p><p>We tested the effects of amino acid substitutions other than cysteine on the amount of higher molecular mass form observed in Western blots. P2X<sub>2</sub> receptors with K308A, K308C or K308R have been shown to be significantly impaired in terms of ion-channel function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the proportion of P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor protein running at the higher molecular mass was quite different for each of these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). For K308A the upper band was virtually absent (3&#x000b1;1%, <italic>n</italic>=9; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01 compared with wild-type), for K308C the amount of upper band was also markedly reduced (11&#x000b1;6%, <italic>n</italic>=4; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01), but for K308R it was not different from wild-type protein (45&#x000b1;1%, <italic>n</italic>=4; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). To ensure that the observed differences in the amount of upper band were not due to altered cell-surface expression, we performed cell-surface biotinylation assays to determine the proportion of mutant receptor expressed at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). At the cell surface, the band profile of wild-type P2X<sub>2</sub> was somewhat altered; it appeared that a greater proportion of uppermost band was present in this sample. The mutant K308A was efficiently expressed at the cell surface, but displayed a complete absence of upper band, demonstrating that the presence of the upper band was not a requirement for cell-surface expression. Interestingly, the proportion of upper band present in the mutant K308C was much greater at the cell surface than in the total protein sample, suggesting that the high-molecular-mass form of this mutant was more efficiently expressed at the cell surface than the lower molecular mass forms. The cell-surface expression of K308R was identical with wild-type (results not shown). We quantified these data over several experiments using scanning densitometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). For each mutant, the proportion of receptor at the cell surface was not significantly different from wild-type, even though the upper band was partially or fully absent. This data demonstrated that the reduction in the amount of higher-molecular-mass protein was not due to reduced cell-surface presentation, but that it reflected a disruption in protein conformation, the severity of which was dependent on the identity of the amino acid substituted.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Effect of different substitutions at Lys<sup>308</sup> on receptor glycosylation</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot of total protein from HEK-293 cells expressing wild-type (WT), K308A, K308C or K308R mutant P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor.

To test this, we compared the expression of K308A, the N-glycan mutant N298S, and the double mutant N298S/K308A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). We observed a significant but differential loss of mass in both K308A and N298S; the mutant N298S induced a greater loss of mass than K308A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A; lane 2 compared with lane 3). Interestingly, the reduction in mass observed in the double mutant N298S/K308A was the same as that of N298S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A; lane 4 compared with lane 2). This result demonstrated that the mutation of Lys<sup>308</sup> in the mutant N298S induced no further loss of mass, implying that the loss of mass seen in the mutant K308A was most probably due to an alteration in N-glycosylation at Asn<sup>298</sup>, leading to a reduction in the mass of the glycan chain.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Difference in molecular mass is due to loss of complex glycosylation at Asn<sup>298</sup></title><p>Western blot analysis of total protein from HEK-293 cells expressing wild-type or mutant rat P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor.

Mutation of Lys<sup>308</sup> to alanine (K308A; lane 3) also induced a reduction in mass; however, this was less than that induced by the mutant N298S. The double mutation N298S/K308A (lane 4) led to the same reduction in molecular mass as N298S, demonstrating that glycosylation at Asn<sup>298</sup> was altered, but not completely abolished, in the single point mutant K308A.

However, both point mutants N298S (lane 6 compared with lane 5) and K308A (lane 4 compared with lane 3) were fully cleaved, indicating that both mutants had lost complex glycosylation.

Each of the three N-glycan acceptor sequences in rat P2X<sub>2</sub> (Asn<sup>182</sup>, Asn<sup>239</sup> and Asn<sup>298</sup>) were mutated with or without K308A and the changes in molecular mass were analysed. The nature of the three distinct wild-type P2X<sub>2</sub> glycoforms (bands a, b and c) was deduced from the numbers of bands present in lanes corresponding to N182S (lane 3), N239S (lane 5) and N298S (lane 7) and the K308A double mutants (lanes 4, 6 and 8 respectively).

EndoH only cleaves core, high-mannose N-glycan chains; complex glycosylation acquired in the Golgi body is resistant to cleavage. Wild-type P2X<sub>2</sub> displayed partial resistance to EndoH treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B; lane 2 compared with lane 1). In this blot the protein loading is lower than that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>(A), and it can be observed that wild-type P2X<sub>2</sub> expressed in HEK-293 cells presents as three bands, reflecting different glycosylation states. Upon EndoH treatment, the upper band was lost, and a lower band at approx. 53&#x000a0;kDa (representing fully deglycosylated P2X<sub>2</sub>) appeared. Additionally, a band of mass approx. 5&#x000a0;kDa lower than the uppermost band in the wild-type lane was present, representing EndoH-resistant protein. This result demonstrates that a proportion of rat P2X<sub>2</sub> expressed in HEK-293 cells acquires complex glycosylation. In contrast, the mutant N298S was fully cleaved by EndoH (lanes 5 and 6), demonstrating that, in this mutant, no complex glycosylation is present, and implying that Asn<sup>298</sup> is likely to be the only site of complex glycosylation in the rat P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor. The loss of mass induced by EndoH treatment of wild-type P2X<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B; lane 2) was slightly less than would be expected for the full cleavage of two core N-glycans (6&#x000a0;kDa). This might reflect anomalous running of this particular glycoform of P2X<sub>2</sub>; it might be possible that full EndoH cleavage was not achieved in this sample or, alternatively, complex glycosylation might be added to Asn<sup>182</sup> or Asn<sup>239</sup>, but only when Asn<sup>298</sup> contains complex glycosylation. However, the important finding of this experiment was that K308A was fully cleaved by EndoH treatment, demonstrating a loss of complex glycosylation in this mutant, and implying that the loss of the upper band in this mutation was due to loss of complex glycosylation at Asn<sup>298</sup>.</p><p>Rat P2X<sub>2</sub> contains three N-glycan acceptor sequences, which may or may not be fully used when the protein is expressed in HEK-293 cells, and characterizing the glycosylation sites might help us to understand the Western blot profile. We expressed serine mutants at each site (N182S, N239S and N298S) with or without the K308A mutation to determine how each site was utilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). We intentionally loaded low amounts of protein (1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of protein per lane) to enable visualization of each glycoform. Mutants N182S (lane 3), N239S (lane 5) and N298S (lane 7) each displayed a reduction in overall mass. A faint upper band was also lost from both N182S and N239S when the mutation K308A was introduced (lanes 4 and 6), whereas N298S and N298S/K308A were unchanged (lanes 7 and 8). We argue that this faint upper band represents complex glycosylation at Asn<sup>298</sup> which is lost in the mutant K308A. It was interesting to note that N182S presented as one major band with a faint upper band, N239S presented as two major bands with a faint upper band, and N298S presented as two major bands only. This result tells us that the N-glycan site at Asn<sup>182</sup> is only used in a proportion of P2X<sub>2</sub> receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells, whereas Asn<sup>239</sup> and Asn<sup>298</sup> are always glycosylated (since mutation of Asn<sup>182</sup> leads to a reduction in the number of bands observed, what has been lost is a site that is only used in a proportion of receptors). The results of our EndoH studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) showed that the complex glycosylation at Asn<sup>298</sup> is only present in a proportion of receptors, and therefore we can assign each of the three bands observed for wild-type rat P2X<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lane 1). Band (a) corresponds to fully glycosylated protein; band (b) is a mixture of core-glycosylated protein and protein which lacks glycosylation at Asn<sup>182</sup>, but contains complex glycosylation at Asn<sup>298</sup>; and band (c) corresponds to protein which is core-glycosylated at Asn<sup>239</sup> and Asn<sup>298</sup>, but which lacks both glycosylation at Asn<sup>182</sup> and complex glycosylation at Asn<sup>298</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>The distance of glycoslyation site Asn<sup>298</sup> from the plasma membrane</title><p>We next examined the effect of moving the glycosylation acceptor sequence at Asn<sup>298</sup> nearer to the plasma membrane. Second mutations in N298S were made so as to re-introduce the N-glycan acceptor sequence at positions 299, 300, 301 and 303 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). All sites were indicated to be good candidates for glycosylation using NetNGlyc (Expasy), and all constructs displayed channel function similar to wild-type P2X<sub>2</sub> receptors (results not shown). Analysis of total protein expression by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B; summary histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C) showed that moving the position of the N-glycan acceptor site to position 299 or 300 had no effect on full glycosylation. In contrast, moving the site to position 301 led to a reduction in full glycosylation of approx. 60%; this could either represent loss of complex glycosylation at position 301, or a reduction in the efficiency of core glycosylation at this residue. Moving the site to position 303 (N298S/T303N) gave rise to a band profile similar to that of the point mutant N298S (lane 6 compared with lane 2), implying that there was a complete absence of glycosylation at this residue. Previous work has demonstrated that the N-glycosylation acceptor sequence must be a minimum of 12&#x02013;14 residues [or 30 &#x000c5; (1 &#x000c5;=0.1&#x000a0;nm)] away from the membrane to be efficiently core glycosylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Because core glycosylation was effectively abolished at position 303, we interpret that this position is 12&#x02013;14 residues from the membrane, placing the region around Asp<sup>315</sup> at the membrane interface.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>N-glycosylation is reduced by decreasing the number of residues between the glycosylation site (Asn<sup>298</sup> or equivalent) and the membrane</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Point mutations in P2X<sub>2</sub> N298S used to move the position of the N-glycan acceptor sequence towards the C-terminus by one, two, three or five amino acids.

This region is highly conserved in all mammalian P2X receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and we found that several residues were critical for efficient receptor function. In particular, cysteine substitution at Arg<sup>304</sup>, Leu<sup>306</sup>, Lys<sup>308</sup> and Ile<sup>312</sup> gave rise to non-functional channels, and substitution at Arg<sup>313</sup> led to a significant reduction in ATP potency. Our results correlate partially with those of Roberts and Evans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], who showed that cysteine substitutions at Arg<sup>305</sup>, Lys<sup>309</sup> and Phe<sup>311</sup> in the human P2X<sub>1</sub> receptor (corresponding to Arg<sup>304</sup>, Lys<sup>308</sup> and Tyr<sup>310</sup> in the rat P2X<sub>2</sub> sequence) significantly impaired receptor function. A study of the pre-TM2 region of rat P2X<sub>4</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] also showed that alanine substitutions at Tyr<sup>315</sup>, Gly<sup>316</sup> and Arg<sup>318</sup> (Tyr<sup>310</sup>, Gly<sup>311</sup> and Arg<sup>313</sup> in the rat P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor) also inhibited receptor function. Taken together this work highlights the importance of the conserved pre-TM2 region centred on Arg<sup>304</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>314</sup> for correct P2X receptor function.</p><p>A striking finding of the present study was that all but one (A309C) of the cysteine substitutions made in the region Arg<sup>304</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>314</sup> led to substantial loss of complex glycosylation from Asn<sup>298</sup>. Asn<sup>298</sup> itself is not required for either channel function or cell-surface presentation of the rat P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and we have demonstrated that the K308A mutation (which gives rise to loss of complex glycosylation from Asn<sup>298</sup>) is expressed at the cell surface in amounts similar to wild-type P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor; this implies that the loss of complex glycosylation does not indicate loss of cell-surface expression. The present study therefore suggests that complex glycosylation at Asn<sup>298</sup> is acting as a reporter of a subtle change in the conformation of the receptor, and does not necessarily correlate with loss of ion-channel function (EC<sub>50</sub> values of the mutants T305C, I307C, Y310C, G311C and I314C were not significantly different to wild-type, whereas each mutant construct displayed significant reductions in levels of complex glycosylation).</p><p>It is clear from the present results that most of the mutations within the pre-TM2 region which affected channel function and/or complex glycosylation were N-terminal to Asp<sup>315</sup>; mutations within the C-terminal half of pre-TM2 had a much lesser effect. This suggests that the N-terminal half of pre-TM2 may be in an environment where tight structural contacts are more important for correct protein conformation, distinct from the environment occupied by the C-terminal half. We probed the environment of the pre-TM2 region by moving the position of the N-glycosylation acceptor sequence at Asn<sup>298</sup> closer to the membrane. Our finding that Asn<sup>298</sup> is approx. 15&#x02013;17 residues distant from the membrane would indicate that the region encompassing Asp<sup>315</sup> is at the membrane interface. We do not believe that this region marks the start of TM2 in the P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor, as previous work demonstrates that the mutant V48C is able to form an intermolecular disulfide bond with the mutant I328C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Val<sup>48</sup> is most probably positioned near the C-terminal end of TM1, and this would therefore position the N-terminal end of TM2 at or around Ile<sup>328</sup>. An intermolecular disulfide bond has also been demonstrated between the P2X<sub>1</sub> mutants K68C and F291C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; these residues correspond to Lys<sup>69</sup> and Arg<sup>291</sup> in the rat P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor. Val<sup>48</sup> and Lys<sup>69</sup> are 21 residues apart, whereas Arg<sup>291</sup> and Ile<sup>328</sup> are 37 residues apart; in crude linear terms an additional 16 residues must be fitted inbetween Arg<sup>291</sup> and Ile<sup>328</sup>, and this is consistent with our observation that Asn<sup>298</sup> is 15&#x02013;17 residues from the membrane, with approx. 30 residues between Asn<sup>298</sup> and Ile<sup>328</sup>. It is important to note that Newbolt et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] demonstrated an increase in N-glycosylation in the mutation K324N, using this result as evidence that Lys<sup>324</sup> was on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. However, in our studies the double mutant N298S/K324N appeared similar to N298S alone (results not shown), implying that glycosylation is not added to the asparagine residue at position 324 in this mutant.</p><p>Such a &#x02018;pairing-off&#x02019; of the lengths of the polypeptide chain external to TM1 and external to TM2 would require approx. 14 &#x02018;additional&#x02019; amino acids between Asn<sup>298</sup> and Ile<sup>328</sup>. For example, the region between Asp<sup>315</sup> and Ile<sup>328</sup> may form a membrane-parallel structure (for example, an &#x003b1;-helix) which leads into TM2, thus holding the region Arg<sup>304</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>314</sup> near the membrane. In an homology model of a fragment of the P2X<sub>4</sub> ectodomain based upon class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, this portion of pre-TM2 is modelled as a helix extending from TM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The residue Arg<sup>318</sup> (corresponding to Arg<sup>313</sup> in rat P2X<sub>2</sub>) is placed towards the top of this helix, which is inconsistent with our observation that Arg<sup>313</sup> is very close to the membrane interface. One possible explanation, assuming that the model is reasonably accurate, is that, as this model did not include the TM2 region of P2X<sub>4</sub>, there might be a bend between the helix and TM2, allowing placement of this helix parallel to the membrane. However, our finding that cysteine substitutions within the region between Asp<sup>315</sup> and Ile<sup>328</sup> were well tolerated, both in terms of channel function and protein conformation as measured by the degree of complex N-glycosylation, suggests that this region of the molecule may not play a significant role in maintaining channel integrity, and is therefore unlikely to be in such a rigid conformation.</p><p>An intriguing possibility is that the region Asp<sup>315</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>328</sup> forms a membrane-permeant loop, proposed by Brake et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] when describing the cloning of rat P2X<sub>2</sub>. This arrangement might explain why the mutants K324C and F325C displayed impaired complex glycosylation, because these residues would be placed at the membrane interface in a similar environment to the Arg<sup>304</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>314</sup> region, which we have demonstrated to be important for correct protein conformation and function. To test this hypothesis, we aimed to probe the environment of the individual cysteine mutants in pre-TM2 using biotin-maleimide labelling. Unfortunately, and in contrast with P2X<sub>1</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], wild-type P2X<sub>2</sub> was efficiently labelled by maleimide (results not shown), meaning that there was no suitable negative control for this experiment. Roberts and Evans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] demonstrated that ATP-induced currents in the human P2X<sub>1</sub> receptor mutant G321C (corresponding to Gly<sup>320</sup> in rat P2X<sub>2</sub>) were markedly impaired upon labelling with thiol-reactive agents, and suggested that this residue might be involved in ion permeation. In agreement with this result, we also saw a similar effect for rat P2X<sub>2</sub> G320C labelled with methyl methanethiosulfonate (results not shown). Furthermore, Cao et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] have recently shown that Lys<sup>308</sup> has a critical role in channel gating: this might be more readily interpreted if the first half of the pre-TM2 region was very near to the membrane, enabling it to have a direct influence on the permeation pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Whether or not this &#x02018;loop region&#x02019; is truly membrane-permeant might be tested by looking for intramolecular disulfide bond formation in double cysteine mutants around Gly<sup>320</sup> and residues in TM1 or TM2.</p><p>In summary, we have exploited alterations in complex glycosylation at Asn<sup>298</sup>, induced by subtle changes in receptor conformation, to demonstrate that the region encompassing Arg<sup>304</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>314</sup> in the rat P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor is important both for maintenance of correct receptor conformation and ion-channel function, and that it is likely to be positioned near to the plasma membrane. This finding should contribute to the evolving understanding of the structure&#x02013;function relationship of the P2X receptors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Laura Smith for assistance with cell culture.
