Very recent structural data obtained from <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic> Fen1 suggest that an extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket is responsible for substrate specificity, by binding to the unpaired 3&#x02032;-flap and by opening and kinking the DNA. Since the extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket in archaeal Fen1 contains seven amino acids that are conserved to a great extent in human Fen1, we have mutated the four conserved or all seven amino acids in the human Fen1 extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket to alanine. Our data suggest that the human extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket mutants have lost substrate specificity to the double-flap DNA. Moreover, loss of high affinity for the unpaired 3&#x02032;-flap suggests that the extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket is essential for recognition and processing of the &#x02018;physiological&#x02019; template. Human PCNA could stimulate the human Fen1 extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket mutants but not restore their specificity. Thus the substrate specificity of Fen1 has been functionally conserved over a billion years from archaea to human.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1) belongs to a family of structure-specific nucleases that are evolutionarily conserved between Archaea and Eukarya (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c4">4</xref>). Its flap endonuclease activity as well as its 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonuclease activity allows Fen1 to remove the RNA primers during lagging strand synthesis and damaged DNA fragments in various DNA repair pathways (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c4">4</xref>). Based on protein sequence comparison and biochemical assays, two major conserved motifs, the N (N-terminal) and I (intermediate) motifs, were found to be essential for the nuclease activities of Fen1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c5">5</xref>). A third motif at the C-terminal end is involved in the interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c7">7</xref>). All crystal structures of Fen1 homologs solved to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c11">11</xref>) showed a conserved helical arch located above the globular domain that contains the active site. This flexible loop, in addition to the catalytic site, was shown to be essential for flap cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c12">12</xref>) and it has been proposed that the 5&#x02032;-end of the DNA flap could thread through the hole of the loop tracking the length of the 5&#x02032;-tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c13">13</xref>).</p><p>The cleavage rate on a single-5&#x02032;-flap substrate, which is usually used to measure Fen1 endonuclease activity, is significantly increased by the presence of a 1 bp overlap between the upstream and downstream duplex regions. This stimulatory effect has been reported previously for Fen1 homologs from Archaea to Eukarya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c19">19</xref>). When the cleavage specificity of Fen1 nucleases was analyzed on a single-5&#x02032;-flap substrate, the heterogeneity in cleavage position encountered (either at the junction or 1 nt into the annealed region) seemed to be inconsistent with the proposed roles of Fen1 in DNA replication and repair. In the case of the substrate with an overlap between the upstream and downstream duplexes (also called the double-flap substrate), the site of cleavage was found to be exclusively 1 nt into the annealed region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c19">19</xref>), allowing DNA ligase I to seal the resulting nicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c18">18</xref>). In contrast, a portion of the products from the &#x02018;traditional&#x02019; single-5&#x02032;-flap substrate was not ligated. This led to the proposition that there is a region or pocket in the enzyme that specifically recognizes that 3&#x02032;-flap nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c16">16</xref>). A study of the T5 5&#x02032;-nuclease also suggested that there could be room for an additional base at the primer terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c10">10</xref>), and analysis of the interaction between the 5&#x02032;-nuclease domain of bacterial DNA polymerase I and different 3&#x02032;-tailed substrates also supported the binding of 1&#x02013;2 nt at the 3&#x02032;-terminus into an enzyme binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c20">20</xref>).</p><p>Two additional findings suggest that a double-flap is formed and cleaved during eukaryotic DNA replication <italic>in vivo</italic>. Firstly, a rad27p G240D mutant (rad27p is the <italic>Saccharomyves cerevisiae</italic> homolog of Fen1) exhibited very low endo- and exonuclease activities on a conventional single-flap substrate, however, it efficiently cleaved a double-flap substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c18">18</xref>). The mutant showed a mutator phenotype but it could grow with almost equal efficiency as the wild-type. Secondly, a dual mode of binding was shown for human Fen1 to a double-flap substrate at a 1:1 molar ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c19">19</xref>), whereas a 100-fold excess of Fen1 to a single-flap substrate was required to obtain complex formation.</p><p>Very recently, the structure of the archaeon <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic> Fen1 bound to a duplex DNA was solved, and FRET experiments and modeling suggest that <italic>A.fulgidus</italic> Fen1 binds to the unpaired DNA 3&#x02032;-end (3&#x02032;-flap), opens and kinks the DNA and promotes conformational closing of the flexible helical clamp to facilitate 5&#x02032; cleavage specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c11">11</xref>). This led us to analyze whether the extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket is also conserved in human Fen1 and to study the effect of replacing the seven amino acids, which comprise this extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket, by alanine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Nucleic acid substrates</title><p>Oligonucleotides used to prepare the substrates for Fen1 nuclease assays were purchased from Microsynth GmbH (Balgach, Switzerland) and their sequences are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh576tb1">1</xref>.

T4 polynucleotide kinase was heat-inactivated at 80&#x000b0;C for 15 min and free ATP was removed on Microspin&#x02122; G-25 columns. To generate the substrates for the nuclease assays, the appropriate oligonucleotides were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, heated to 75&#x000b0;C and slowly cooled to room temperature. The substrates for the electromobility shift assays were prepared according to the same protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzymes and proteins</title><p>Human Fen1 cDNA was cloned into the pET 23d vector (Novagen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c6">6</xref>).

The enzyme titration assays were performed in a final volume of 12.5 &#x000b5;l containing the following ingredients: 40 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 200 &#x000b5;g/ml bovine serum albumin and 50 fmol DNA substrate.

Products were separated on 19&#x00025; denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. For all experiments, the product size was determined by using appropriate radioactively labeled oligonucleotides (nt) of identical sequence to the template. For PCNA stimulation of Fen1, reactions were performed as described above except that the buffer was replaced by 50 mM Bis&#x02013;Tris (pH 6.5) and 100 mM NaCl was added (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c22">22</xref>). For calculation of PCNA stimulation, the gels were quantified on a PhosphorImager using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The SEM was calculated from the results of three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) for Fen1</title><p>Assay conditions were the same as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c19">19</xref>).

The human amino acids L53, Q54, T61, K314, F316, S317 and R320 are all in the extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f1">1</xref>B) and correspond to the amino acids L47, K48, T55, H308, F310, S311 and R314 of <italic>A.fulgidus</italic> (see fig. 1C in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c11">11</xref>). We have constructed two mutants of human Fen1. First, the four conserved amino acids L53, T61, F316 and R320 and, second, the seven amino acids L53, Q54, T61, K314, F316, S317 and R320 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f1">1</xref>A) were mutated to alanine, since these amino acids are important for <italic>A.fulgidus</italic> Fen1 binding to the unpaired DNA 3&#x02032;-end. The two mutants carrying a His tag, called Fen1 (LTFR) and Fen1 (LQTKFSR), respectively, were produced in bacteria and purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f1">1</xref>C). The preparations were free of contaminating nucleases, as tested on linear and supercoiled plasmid DNA (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Human Fen1 extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket mutants have reduced exonuclease activities and a less stringent cleavage pattern</title><p>First we tested exonuclease activities on a nicked DNA substrate and on a nicked substrate containing an unpaired 3&#x02032;-end. From Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f2">2</xref> it is evident that both mutants had a greatly reduced activity compared to Fen1 wt (compare lanes 4&#x02013;6 to 7&#x02013;9 and 10&#x02013;12, respectively). In addition, both mutants synthesized a two base product compared to the one base product of Fen1 wt. Furthermore, the activity of Fen1 (LQTKFSR) is considerably lower than the four amino acid mutant Fen1 (LTFR). This result is surprising since we would expect no effect on a substrate lacking a 3&#x02032;-flap when the 3&#x02032;-flap pocket is mutated. This might be explained by a tendency of Fen1 wt to bind to the 3&#x02032;-end of the nick and to induce a 3&#x02032;-flap. A similar activity profile was found with the unpaired DNA 3&#x02032;-end substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f2">2</xref>, lanes 13&#x02013;22) and the previously observed stimulation of Fen1 wt by the unpaired 3&#x02032;-flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c19">19</xref>) is lost in both mutants. In summary, the two extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket mutants have reduced exonuclease activities, which are coupled with a loss of product specificity. The effect was more pronounced with Fen1 (LQTKFSR), suggesting that the extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket is important for the exonuclease activity of human Fen1.</p></sec><sec><title>Human Fen1 extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket mutants have reduced endonuclease activities and a less stringent cleavage pattern</title><p>It has been found that Fen1 has high cleavage specificity for double-flap DNA substrates and this specificity suggests that Fen1 contains a region or pocket that can specifically bind to the 3&#x02032;-flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c16">16</xref>). This has been confirmed at the structural level for archaeal Fen1, where this binding induces a kinking of the DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c11">11</xref>). We therefore next tested different flap DNA substrates and compared the two extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap Fen1 mutants with their wild-type counterpart. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f3">3</xref>A shows that Fen1 wt has a clear preference for double-flap substrates (compare lanes 4&#x02013;6 with lanes 8&#x02013;10 and 12&#x02013;14 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f3">3</xref>A). A 2 nt non-complementary flap mainly resulted in a 1 nt longer product (22 nt), likely due to the transition to the optimal one nt 3&#x02032;-flap (lanes 16&#x02013;18). When the four amino acid extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket mutant Fen1 (LTFR) was tested with four DNA substrates we found that, first, &#x0003e;100 times more molecules of Fen1 were required for cutting, second, two bands appeared with all four substrates tested and, third, the previously observed stimulation by the unpaired 3&#x02032;-flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c19">19</xref>) is lost (compare lanes 4 and 8 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f3">3</xref>B with lanes 4 and 8 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f3">3</xref>A). With the &#x02018;physiological&#x02019; complementary 3&#x02032;-flap substrate the product was mainly 1 nt longer (22 nt) than with Fen1 wt and only a small proportion of the correct 21 nt product was made (compare lanes 12&#x02013;14 of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f3">3</xref>A and B). For the single-flap and non-complementary 3&#x02032;-flap substrates two products appeared (21 and 22 nt), whereas the wild-type showed a clear preference for the 21 nt product (compare lanes 4&#x02013;6 and 8&#x02013;10 of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f3">3</xref>B with lanes 4&#x02013;6 and 8&#x02013;10 of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f3">3</xref>A). This suggests that substrate specificity was severely hampered in this mutant. Finally, the seven amino acid extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket mutant Fen1 (LQTKFSR) showed a similar altered cleavage pattern to the Fen1 (LTFR) mutant and with the &#x02018;physiological&#x02019; complementary 3&#x02032;-flap substrate the product was exclusively 1 nt longer (22 nt) than with Fen1 wt (lanes 12&#x02013;14 of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f3">3</xref>C). Only the 2 nt non-complementary 3&#x02032;-flap substrate showed the expected product of 22 nt (lanes 16&#x02013;18 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f3">3</xref>C). These data suggest that replacement of only the four conserved amino acids L53, T61, F316 and R320 resulted in a severe loss of substrate specificity, while replacement of all seven conserved amino acids L53, Q54, T61, K314, F316, S317 and R320 resulted in complete loss of the 3&#x02032;-flap specificity.</p></sec><sec><title>Human Fen1 extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket mutants have lost the specific binding to double-flap DNA</title><p>EMSA recently showed two binding modes of human Fen1, but only with the double-flap DNA structure containing a 3&#x02032;-flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c19">19</xref>). Using gel filtration experiments we could show that the faster migrating complex had a molecular weight which corresponded to a 1:1 complex between Fen1 and the double-flap DNA (data not shown). Again as expected, Fen1 wt revealed two binding modes on both double-flap substrates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f4">4</xref>A, lanes 7&#x02013;10 and 12&#x02013;15). This dual binding mode was lost with both extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f4">4</xref>B and C). In contrast to a Fen1 mutant lacking the C-terminal 20 amino acids, which is completely unable to bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c6">6</xref>), these two mutants have not lost the property of general DNA binding, but rather DNA-specific binding. Although the slightly weaker binding of the Fen1 (LTQKFSR) mutant to the different DNA flap substrates may indicate a perturbation of its structure by the seven amino acid replacements, our data in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f3">3</xref> show that this mutant is still enzymatically active. Therefore, we conclude that the Fen1 (LQTKFSR) mutant has not lost its general DNA binding ability. These data suggest that the mutant Fen1 proteins could still bind to DNA but were no longer able to properly accommodate the 3&#x02032;-flap and kink the DNA substrate. Fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments with <italic>A.fulgidus</italic> Fen1 are in agreement with these observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c11">11</xref>). In conclusion, the extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket mutant Fen1 enzymes were no longer able to distinguish the &#x02018;physiological&#x02019; substrate from other ones.</p></sec><sec><title>Human Fen1 extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket mutants can interact and are stimulated by PCNA, but the normal cleavage pattern cannot be restored by PCNA</title><p>PCNA has been shown to bind to Fen1 and to stimulate its activity by &#x0003e;50 times under physiological salt conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c25">25</xref>). We therefore tested the two extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket mutants for their capacity to bind PCNA. Both mutants bound PCNA, the four amino acid mutant Fen1 (LTFR) as strongly as Fen1 wt, while the binding of the seven amino acid mutant Fen1 (LQTKFSR) to PCNA was reduced by 50&#x00025; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f5">5</xref>A). These binding experiments were nicely confirmed in a PCNA stimulation assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f5">5</xref>B&#x02013;D). On a single-flap DNA substrate, Fen1 wt was stimulated by PCNA in a dose-dependent manner and this stimulation was specific, since BSA showed no stimulatory effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f5">5</xref>B, compare lanes 5&#x02013;9 with lanes 10&#x02013;14). Both extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket mutants were stimulated by PCNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f5">5</xref>C), although 100 times more Fen1 (LTFR) or 250 times more Fen1 (LQTKFSR) had to be included to see a similar effect (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f5">5</xref>C with B). Quantification of the stimulation showed that the four amino acid mutant Fen1 (LTFR) was stimulated by PCNA to the same extent as Fen1 wt, whereas the seven amino acid mutant Fen1 (LQTKFSR) was stimulated to a lesser extent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f5">5</xref>D), probably due to its reduced interaction with PCNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f5">5</xref>A). Finally, we analyzed whether PCNA could restore the substrate specificity of the mutant Fen1 enzymes. As seen from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f5">5</xref>B, Fen1 wt mainly synthesized a product of 21 nt, while the two mutants produced about equal amounts of the 21 and 22 nt cleavage products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f5">5</xref>C). These data are in agreement with those seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh576f3">3</xref>. In summary, the extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket mutant Fen1 enzymes could be stimulated by PCNA but the substrate specificity could not be restored.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>The substrate specificity of Fen1 is evolutionarily conserved</title><p>The data presented in this work clearly indicate that the substrate specificity of Fen1 is conserved through evolution in an extraordinary way and that this conservation is seen in the structural similarity of the hydrophobic wedge in general and the extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket in particular. The biochemical and functional data presented in this paper suggest that the extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket, as structurally identified in the archaeon <italic>A.fulgidus</italic> Fen1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c11">11</xref>), appears to be almost identical to human Fen1. The observation that a 1 nt double-flap structure is the optimal substrate for human Fen1 and that with this substrate a DNA&#x02013;protein complex could be observed at a 1:1 molar ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c19">19</xref> and data not shown) suggested that a double-flap substrate containing a 1 nt 3&#x02032;-tail is the <italic>in vivo</italic> substrate for human Fen1. This has been described previously for the Fen1 homolog in yeast, rad27p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c18">18</xref>). This double-flap substrate could also reflect an <italic>in vivo</italic> intermediate between two conformations that would be interchangeable from a double-flap to a single-flap containing a &#x0002b;1 5&#x02032;-flap, pro vided the single 3&#x02032;-flap is complementary. The 3&#x02032;-terminal nucleotide is recognized by a region or hydrophobic pocket in the Fen1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c16">16</xref>) that could accommodate a mononucleotide. Our results suggest that, as proposed recently for the archaeal <italic>A.fulgidus</italic> Fen1, binding to the 3&#x02032;-flap anchors the DNA in a defined orientation and positions the scissile phosphate near the active site. The kink promotes conformational closing of the flexible helical clamp and thus can facilitate the cleavage specificity at the 5&#x02032;-flap to be cleaved.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications of a double-flap structure for DNA transactions carried out by Fen1 <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>A double-flap DNA structure ensures specific recognition of an unpaired 3&#x02032; nucleotide at a junction in DNA replication. Due to the universal directionality of any DNA polymerase, replication at the lagging strand is discontinuous (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c26">26</xref>). This occurs every 200 bases, thus resulting in more than 10<sup>7</sup> Okazaki fragment maturation events per replication of the human genome. During their maturation, the DNA polymerase &#x003b4; holoenzyme performs strand displacement synthesis and the Okazaki fragment is processed by the concerted action of replication protein A, PCNA, Fen1 and subsequent ligation by DNA ligase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c28">28</xref>). &#x02018;Freezing&#x02019; of the double-flap structure for Fen1 is likely guaranteed by the concerted action of these proteins, but how they are positioned around PCNA is not known. In <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>, where PCNA is a heterotrimer, one subunit binds Fen1, the second DNA polymerase and the third DNA ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c29">29</xref>). This suggests that kinking the DNA at the physiological double-flap DNA would guarantee concomitant binding of Fen1 endonuclease, DNA polymerase &#x003b4; and DNA ligase I to precisely coordinate DNA synthesis, flap cutting and DNA ligation. A frozen double-flap structure would be the optimal contribution from the DNA side to precisely perform the many millions of Okazaki fragment processing events.</p><p>In long patch base excision repair it has been proposed that DNA ligase I can act as a patch size mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c30">30</xref>) that can obviously determine proper Fen1 positioning for 5&#x02032;-flap cleavage in the presence of the DNA polymerase &#x003b4; holoenzyme (DNA polymerase &#x003b4;, PCNA and replication factor C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh576c31">31</xref>). Again, &#x02018;freezing&#x02019; of the double-flap DNA would guarantee proper ligation, regardless of the size of the base excision repair patch.</p><p>Uncovering how cleavage specificity is guaranteed by means of the extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket which positions the DNA to allow precise cleavage may explain how Fen1 deals with its paramount role in DNA replication and in preventing a situation in the genome that leads to unwanted genetic exchanges and eventually to a cancerous phenotype.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh576f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The amino acids in the extrahelical 3&#x02032;-flap pocket of human Fen1.
