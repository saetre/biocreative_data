Interestingly, mutants of THO, a transcription complex involved in maintenance of genome integrity, mRNP biogenesis and export, were recently found to be deficient in nucleotide excision repair. In this study we show by molecular DNA repair analysis, that Sub2-Yra1 and Thp1-Sac3, two main mRNA export complexes, are required for efficient TCR in yeast. Careful analysis revealed that THO mutants are also specifically affected in TCR. Ribozyme-mediated mRNA self-cleavage between two hot spots for UV damage showed that efficient TCR does not depend on the nascent mRNA, neither in wild-type nor in mutant cells. Along with severe UV damage-dependent loss in processivity, RNAPII was found binding to chromatin upon UV irradiation in THO mutants, suggesting that RNAPII remains stalled at DNA lesions. Furthermore, Def1, a factor responsible for the degradation of stalled RNAPII, appears essential for the viability of THO mutants subjected to DNA damage. Our results indicate that RNAPII is not proficient for TCR in mRNP biogenesis and export mutants, opening new perspectives on our knowledge of TCR in eukaryotic cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is an evolutionarily conserved DNA repair pathway that deals with severely distorting DNA lesions including intrastrand crosslinks such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>)]. Within NER two damage-sensing pathways are recognized: one for the entire genome, global genome repair (GGR), and one for the transcribed strand of active genes, transcription-coupled repair (TCR). In yeast, GGR requires Rad7, a protein carrying leucine-rich repeats, and Rad16, a member of the SWI2/SNF2 subfamily of putative helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). These proteins presumably act in a complex that might be required in chromatin remodeling to facilitate damage recognition by Rad4/Rad23 [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>)]. As ongoing transcription is required for TCR, damage recognition is likely done by the elongating RNA polymerase (RNAP) itself. RNAP arrests at injuries in the template strand triggering, likely via additional specific factors, the recruitment of the DNA repair machinery [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>)]. Interestingly, TCR appears to be functional once a low and basal rate of transcription is achieved, beyond which there is no simple correlation between transcription and repair rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the stalled RNAP leads to the recruitment of the transcription-repair coupling factor (TCRF) Mfd, allowing for the release of RNAP and further recruitment of the repair factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In eukaryotes the precise mechanism of TCR remains poorly understood. Mutations in proteins required for NER lead to severe disorders known as Xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>)]. One of these proteins, Cockayne syndrome B protein (CSB), and its yeast ortholog Rad26, share conserved functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and represent putative eukaryotic TCRF candidates. CSB and Rad26 belong to the SWI2/SNF2 helicase superfamily. Although CSB has been shown to have DNA-dependent ATPase activity, an ATPase-deficient mutant partially restores CSB activity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The putative function of CSB as a TCRF has been substantiated by <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of the TCR initiation steps, in which an elongating RNAPII arrested at a DNA lesion was shown to mediate an ATP-dependent incision of the damaged DNA only in the presence of CSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). XPG, one of the structure-specific DNA endonuclease responsible for the removal of an oligonucleotide containing the DNA lesion in NER, is another protein involved in TCR. Recent results imply a coordinated recognition of stalled RNAPII by XPG and CSB in TCR initiation in mammalian cells and suggest that TFIIH-dependent remodeling of stalled RNAPII without release may be sufficient to allow repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In yeast, the Rpb9 subunit of RNAPII has also been shown to contribute to TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Alternatively, and analogous to the mRNA-dependent loading of termination factors in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), it is also conceivable that the nascent mRNA, or proteins bound to it, may be required to load repair enzymes at stalled polymerases.</p><p>On the other hand, RNAPII is subject to ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation in response to UV-generated DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23 B24">21&#x02013;24</xref>). It has been proposed that degradation of damage-stalled RNAPII complexes might be an alternative to TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Indeed, recent studies have shown that arrested RNAPII elongation complexes are the preferred substrate for ubiquitylation, which is dependent on the C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of RNAPII and on the Def1 protein in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotic cells, export of nuclear mRNA to the cytoplasm requires correct RNA-processing and the association of a number of RNA-binding proteins to form export-competent ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNP) [for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30">28&#x02013;30</xref>)]. Although there is growing evidence for transcription-coupled mRNA export, the physical nature of this coupling is not known. A connection between mRNP biogenesis and transcription is provided by THO, a conserved four-protein complex composed of stoichiometric amounts of Tho2, Hpr1, Mft1 and Thp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) that is recruited to active chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Null mutation of any component of THO leads to similar phenotypes of transcription impairment and mRNA export defects, as well as to a strong transcription-associated hyper-recombination phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34 B35 B36">34&#x02013;36</xref>). Together with the mRNA export proteins Sub2/UAP56 and Yra1/Aly, THO forms a larger complex termed TREX in yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However, even though deletion of any of the THO genes leads to complete depletion of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), THO remains stable <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>sub2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), indicating that it forms a core complex independently of Sub2. Strikingly, mutants of the Mex67-Mtr2 mRNA export factor&#x02014;a heterodimer that mediates the interaction of the mRNP with the nuclear pore complex (NPC)&#x02014;show THO-like gene expression and recombination phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The idea of THO being functionally involved in mRNP biogenesis and export is further strengthened by the observation that mutants of the Thp1&#x02013;Sac3 complex, which has been shown to function in mRNA export by docking the mRNP to specific nucleoporins at the nuclear pore entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) confer the same transcription, mRNA export, and hyper-recombination phenotypes as do THO/TREX mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we showed that null mutations of the <italic>HPR1</italic> and <italic>THO2</italic> genes confer defects in NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). With this precedent and considering that RNA-binding proteins are concomitantly assembled on the nascent mRNA to generate a stable and export-competent mRNP [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>)], we studied whether TCR might be connected to mRNP biogenesis and export. We found that THO, Sub2-Yra1, Mex67-Mtr2 and Thp1-Sac3 are required for efficient TCR in yeast, thus linking mRNP biogenesis and export to TCR. Using a construct in which a self-cleaving Hammerhead ribozyme was cloned between two hot spots for UV damage, we demonstrate that TCR does not depend on the nascent mRNA, neither in wild-type nor in THO and Thp1-Sac3 deficient strains. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses revealed that, beside a severe UV damage-dependent loss in processivity, RNAPII is found to be bound to chromatin upon UV irradiation in THO mutants. Interestingly, Def1, a factor responsible for the removal of stalled RNAPII from a DNA template, is essential for the viability of THO mutants subjected to DNA damage. Our results support a model in which mRNP biogenesis and export is required for efficient TCR by preventing the occurrence of defective RNAPII complexes, which may remain stalled at a DNA lesion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>We used strains W303-1A, <italic>rad1&#x00394;::LEU2</italic> (W839-5D, R.

Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR green dye in the 7500 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Standard curves for all three pairs of primers were performed for each PCR analysis, all PCR reactions being performed in triplicate. The enrichment of each PCR amplification of interest was calculated as the ratio between the region-specific signal and the intergenic signal of the precipitated fractions normalized with respect to the corresponding ratios of the input fractions.

In wild-type cells, we observed a drop in the overall amount of RNAPII after UV irradiation that was accompanied by a significant loss of processivity along the transcribed unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Recovery of both the amount of RNAPII and processivity occurred at similar rates and were nearly complete 90&#x02009;min after UV irradiation. In <italic>hpr1&#x00394;</italic> cells, a drop in the overall amount of RNAPII was observed after induction of UV lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Both the drop in RNAPII density and its recovery were comparable to wild-type cells. However, the loss of processivity observed in <italic>hpr1&#x00394;</italic> cells was much stronger than in wild-type cells and its recovery very slow, 50% of the polymerases being lost between the 5&#x02032;- and the 3&#x02032;-end of the gene 90&#x02009;min after UV irradiation.

The obligatory passage of eukaryotic mRNA through the nuclear envelope to reach protein translation machineries is tightly controlled by mRNA export systems. TCR has to cope with mRNA export in eukaryotes, possibly explaining why it cannot take advantage of one transcription-repair coupling factor as found in prokaryotic cells. This study unveils that the repair of active genes indeed depends on the correct interplay between transcription and mRNA export. We found that removal of proteins all along the mRNP export route, including the transcription-associated THO and Sub2&#x02013;Yra1 complexes, the Mex67-Mtr2 export receptor as well as the Thp1-Sac3 nuclear pore-associated complex, confer TCR-deficient phenotypes. Thus, our results establish a general dependency of TCR on proficient mRNP biogenesis and export.</p><p>The inability of human Cockayne's syndrome cells to recover RNA synthesis after DNA damage was recently found not to be due solely to the failure of these mutants to remove lesions in the transcribed strand of active genes, but to defects in the re-initiation of the transcriptional program after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Although TCR of the constitutively expressed <italic>RPB2</italic> gene is strongly affected in cells depleted of Rad26&#x02014;the yeast CSB homologue&#x02014;we found that, in <italic>rad26</italic> mutants, mRNA recovery is much faster as compared to THO, Sub2-Yra1 and Thp1-Sac3 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The mRNA export-dependent TCR-deficient phenotype could reflect a substantial lag in transcription initiation. This is not the case, as ChIP analysis indicated that, in contrast to CSB, RNAPII loading after UV irradiation was not affected in THO mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). However, the amount of polymerases reaching the 3&#x02032;-end of the <italic>YLR454w</italic> gene was substantially lower in <italic>hpr1</italic>. Thus, the RNAPII processivity defects of <italic>hpr1</italic> appear to be strengthened upon UV-irradiation, presumably leading to severe delays in mRNA recovery. Even though it is <italic>a priori</italic> conceivable that poor transcription rate and/or low RNAPII processivity alone might lead to defective TCR, several lines of evidence argue against this possibility. First, no simple correlation could be found between repair and transcription rates neither in different mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) nor at different <italic>loci</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Second, transcription-elongation mutants like <italic>spt4</italic>, in which transcription elongation is impaired and RNAPII processivity significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>), do not show defects in TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). On the contrary, <italic>spt4</italic> suppresses the TCR defects of <italic>rad26</italic>, indicating that reduced RNAPII processivity can even act positively on TCR.</p><p>There is growing evidence for transcription-coupled mRNA export [for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30">28&#x02013;30</xref>)], though the physical nature of this coupling is not known. The possible functional and physical connection between a subset of transcribed genes and the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58 B59 B60">58&#x02013;60</xref>) suggest that deficient mRNA export could negatively affect RNAPII transcription. Our results, providing evidence for a functional link between TCR and mRNA export, support the existence of such a feedback mechanism, which would alter transcription so that it is no longer proficient for TCR. A major player in the coupling of transcription and mRNA processing is the CTD of the largest subunit of RNAPII, which acts as a loading platform for pre-mRNA processing factors [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>)].

Furthermore, our results indicate that RNA 5&#x02032;-capping is dispensable for TCR. Thus, our results support the idea of the RNAPII machinery being the main mediator for an active DNA damage response.</p><p>Different evidence led to the proposal that the hyper-recombination phenotype of THO mutants is mediated by the formation of R-loops (RNA:DNA hybrids) behind the elongating RNAPII, as well as impaired replication fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>). Here, we show that ribozyme-mediated cleavage of the nascent mRNA does not suppress the TCR deficiency of <italic>tho2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that the hyper-recombination and TCR phenotypes might be mediated by different intermediates. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that the non-hyper-recombinant <italic>hpr1-101</italic> allele shares the transcription, mRNA export and TCR phenotypes of <italic>hpr1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Def1 is required for removal of defective RNAPII complexes in THO mutants</title><p>Recently, RNAPII processivity has been shown to be significantly reduced in THO mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Our ChIP analysis of UV-irradiated cells revealed that RNAPII processivity was further impaired while RNAPII loading remained unaffected in <italic>hpr1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). A conclusion of these findings is that the TCR defect of <italic>hpr1</italic> cells is a consequence of damage-trapped RNAPII. Since transcription is a one-track copying process, a trapped RNAPII can only be resolved by repairing the damage so that transcription can resume or by physically removing the stalled RNAPII [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>)]. Thus, it is understandable that RNAPII degradation activities, such as Def1, might be important in backgrounds in which aberrant stalled RNAPII are formed. Indeed, we observed that the <italic>hpr1 def1</italic> mutant exhibited profound growth defects and was highly temperature- as well as UV-sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast to wild-type and <italic>hpr1</italic> cells, RNAPII accumulated at the 5&#x02032;-end of <italic>YLR454w</italic> upon UV-irradiation in <italic>def1</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Hence, Def1-mediated RNAPII degradation appears to be important for the removal of stalled RNAPII after UV damage, in agreement with previous works showing that UV-dependent RNAPII ubiquitylation depends on Def1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Worthy of note, we find that the amount of RNAPII tends to decrease 90&#x02009;min after UV irradiation in backgrounds in which TCR or RNAPII degradation is compromised. This decrease might reflect the physiological turnover of stalled RNAPII in yeast cells. Such an interpretation implies that endogenous dissociation of stalled RNAPII would be much faster <italic>in vivo</italic> than <italic>in vitro</italic>, where human RNAPII stalled at a CPD remains stable for days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>). Alternatively, the reduction in the amount of RNAPII at 90&#x02009;min could be due to a down-regulation of the promoter activity or to the action of alternative RNAPII degradation activities.</p><p>Given that RNAPII distribution obtained at the 5&#x02032;-end of <italic>YLR454w</italic> was similar in <italic>def1</italic> and <italic>hpr1 def1</italic> mutants, it is conceivable that RNAPII removal by Def1 serves as an essential backup mechanism to allow repair of active genes in <italic>hpr1</italic> mutants. Our results suggest that the low processivity and mRNA export defects of <italic>hpr1</italic> mutants lead to stalled RNAPII-complexes in adverse transcription conditions, which are subjected to Def1 mediated degradation if transcription elongation cannot be rescued. Further investigation of the <italic>hpr1 def1</italic> mutants will help us to understand the mechanisms of the different phenotypes of THO mutants, from hyper-recombination to DNA polymerase stalling, and how they might depend on each other.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUDING REMARKS</title><p>Our results present a model by which TCR-deficient RNAPII complexes remain stalled at DNA lesions in THO, Sub2-Yra1, Mex67-Mtr2 and Thp1-Sac3 mutants, thereby preventing repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). On the mRNA export route, THO works in immediate proximity to the ternary complex formed by the polymerase holoenzyme, template DNA and nascent RNA, whereas Sub2-Yra1, Mex67-Mtr2 and Thp1-Sac3 work downstream in the mRNP biogenesis and export route. Here, we show that cleavage of the nascent mRNA, which is the only known physical link between all these complexes, is not sufficient to rescue TCR. Thus, yet to be discovered bridging factors, whether or not functionally connected to the RNAPII, could mediate the TCR phenotype of mRNA export mutants. Alteration of these factors might result in an incomplete or modified transcription apparatus, which in turn would be incompetent to promote TCR, possibly as a consequence of its impaired transcription processivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). A future new challenge will be to unravel the configuration of the RNAPII machinery in mRNP biogenesis and export mutants. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Model to explain the response to UV damage within a transcribed gene both in wild-type and in mRNA export mutants. In wild-type, mRNP biogenesis and export occur co-transcriptionally. RNAPII encountering a UV damage gets stalled, triggering the TCR reaction by yet unknown mechanisms. Alternatively, the stalled RNAPII might get ubiquitylated and degraded via Def1. In mRNA export mutants, co-transcriptional mRNP biogenesis fails and mRNA are not exported. A feedback effect acts on RNAPII, impeding it to trigger TCR in the case of encountering a UV lesion, possibly as a consequence of impaired transcription processivity. The stalled TCR-deficient RNAPII has to be removed by Def1-mediated degradation to allow accessibility of the damage to repair enzymes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm373f8"/></fig></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>Research was funded by grants from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Education (SAF2003-00204 and BFU2006-05260) and from the Junta de Andalucia (CVI102).
