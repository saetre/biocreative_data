In muscle fibers, it is thought to provide an essential mechanical link between the intracellular cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix and to protect the sarcolemma during muscle contraction. Mutations affecting the DGC cause muscular dystrophies. Most members of the DGC are also concentrated at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where their deficiency is often associated with NMJ structural defects. Hence, synaptic dysfunction may also intervene in the pathology of dystrophic muscles. Dystroglycan is a central component of the DGC because it establishes a link between the extracellular matrix and Dystrophin.

We also found that synaptic Dg controlled the amount of postsynaptic 4.1 protein Coracle and alpha-Spectrin, as well as the relative subunit composition of glutamate receptors. In addition, both Dystrophin and Coracle were required for normal Dg concentration at the synapse. In electrophysiological recordings, loss of postsynaptic Dg did not affect postsynaptic response, but, surprisingly, led to a decrease in glutamate release from the presynaptic site.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>Altogether, our study illustrates a conservation of DGC composition and interactions between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates at the synapse, highlights new proteins associated with this complex and suggests an unsuspected trans-synaptic function of Dg.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In muscle fibers, the Dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) is thought to provide an essential mechanical link between the intracellular cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. This complex comprises Dystroglycan subunits (&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;), Dystrophin or Utrophin, sarcoglycans subunits, syntrophin subunits, and dystrobrevin subunits. Dystroglycan (Dg) is a central component of the DGC because it establishes the transmembrane link between Laminins and Dystrophin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002084-Ervasti1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002084-IbraghimovBeskrovnaya1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Dg is encoded by a single gene (<italic>dag1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002084-IbraghimovBeskrovnaya2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, and is expressed as a propeptide that gets cleaved in two fragments: &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;-Dg, which associate non-covalently in mature skeletal muscle. The extracellular Dg &#x003b1;-subunit is heavily glycosylated, and interacts with extracellular Laminin, whereas the transmembrane &#x003b2;-subunit interacts with subsarcolemmal Dystrophin, which itself links the actin network. The maintenance of this structural link provides stability of the sarcolemma, especially upon muscle contraction. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, mutation and subsequent loss of Dystrophin destabilizes the other DGC members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002084-Ohlendieck1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, which further leads to mechanical damage of the muscle cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002084-Pasternak1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002084-Petrof1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. There are no known dystrophies associated with a mutation in the dystroglycan gene, probably because of the importance of the encoded protein in other cellular types. Indeed, loss of Dg in mice leads to early embryonic death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002084-Williamson1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

Finally, electrophysiological analysis shows that loss of muscle Dg leads to a functional defect, i.e. a decrease in presynaptic glutamate release.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>yw<sup>CS</sup> flies were used as a control in all experiments with <italic>dg</italic> or <italic>cora</italic> mutants. <italic>dg</italic>-RNAi/&#x0002b; or UAS-Dg-C/&#x0002b; flies were used as controls when studying crosses with these transgenes.

Since the C-terminal residues are common to the three known <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dg isoforms, this antibody certainly recognizes them all.

This indicated that the antibody staining at the NMJ was specific, and that Dg was indeed expressed in the muscles. The presence of Dg at the NMJ was further supported by the analysis of <italic>dg</italic> mutants.

We tested if this was also the case at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> glutamatergic NMJ. First, we investigated whether Laminin was indeed present at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ. Laminin is a heterotrimer consisting of three chains, A, B1 and B2. We used a polyclonal antibody against Laminin heterotrimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002084-Fessler1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

At this level of optical resolution, the NMJ localization of Lam fits with a trans-synaptic localization of this component of the extracellular matrix. Costaining with the active zone marker Bruchpilot revealed that, like Dg, Lam was excluded from synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002084-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and restricted to the perisynaptic zones. Lam was present around varicosities as well as around the inter-varicosities connectives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002084-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). In larvae expressing dg-RNAi in muscles, the Lam content around the varicosities was decreased so that the varicosities were less distinguishable compared to the connectives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002084-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).

We also analyzed the consequences of Dg overexpression in the muscle cell on the amount and localization of Lam.

This indicated that the Dg-C isoform could indeed recruit Lam in the muscle cell. At the NMJ, the pattern of Lam localization was more irregular, with some perisynaptic areas larger, and more intense in Lam immunoreactivity, compared to a more homogenous situation in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002084-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we tried to look at the postsynaptic F-actin cytoskeleton with rhodamine-phalloidin staining, but could not reliably see its size due to the underlying actin-myosin contractile apparatus. Still, some postsynaptic F-actin cytoskeleton could be observed in <italic>dg</italic> mutants (data not shown). We thus tested whether the loss of Dystrophin also led to a decrease in Cora and alpha-Spectrin postsynaptic immunoreactivity. We performed this experiment, keeping in mind that the loss of Dystrophin also affected Dg immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002084-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). We could see that an almost complete loss of NMJ Dystrophin obtained when expressing a Dys RNAi construct always had smaller effects on Cora and &#x003b1;-Spectrin immunoreactivity compared to a loss of Dg function, which affected only partially Dys staining (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002084-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002084-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).

Such a presynaptic effect associated with postsynaptic modifications is not new, since the NMJ function displays homeostasis, and that decrease in postsynaptic responsiveness is often associated to increase in neurotransmitter release and vice-versa in order to maintain constant EJCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002084-Macleod1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. The molecular mechanisms involved in this homeostatic control are largely unknown. Here, in <italic>dg</italic> mutants, homeostatic control is likely absent since mini amplitude (receptor field) is not altered in absence of postsynaptic Dg, but glutamate release is modified. This suggests that Dg-deficient muscles inappropriately signals to the presynaptic release machinery. A similar trans-synaptic effect of loss of muscle Dystrophin onto presynaptic quantal content was observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002084-vanderPlas1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. What can be the mechanisms involved? One possibility is that postsynaptic Dg directly controls the levels of synaptic ECM molecules such as Laminin. These proteins, by interacting with presynaptic receptors, would affect the structure of the presynapse, e.g. the amount, size or molecular composition of active or periactives zones. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the finding in mouse, that a synaptic Laminin-calcium channel interaction organizes active zones in motor nerve terminals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002084-Nishimune1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. Another presynaptic Laminin receptor could be the synaptic vesicle protein SV2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002084-Son1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. Looking for modifications at the presynapse, we did not detect any obvious change in the number and size of active zones, using Bruchpilot immunoreactivity as a marker (unpublished observations) and did not detect any modification in the immunoreactivity of the periactive zone marker Fas2 (unpublished observations). Still, the regulation of synaptic Laminin by Dg that we demonstrate here, together with the presynaptic electrophysiological phenotype we observed, make the hypothesis of Laminin bridging postsynaptic Dg and the presynapse, at least in periactive zones, very likely.</p><p>These findings, i.e. the new components of a Dystroglycan complex, as well as the unexpected trans-synaptic role of Dg pave the way for understanding the role of the DGC in the formation, maintenance and plasticity of glutamatergic synapses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002084.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>dg gene structure, dg mutants and qRT-PCR analysis A) Gene structure of dg gene compiled from flybase data and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002084-Deng1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.
