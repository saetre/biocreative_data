In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> most of the cellular responses to hyper-osmotic stress is regulated by two interconnected pathways involving high osmolarity glycerol mitogen-activated protein kinase (Hog1p) and Calcineurin (CAN), a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase 2B. In this study, we report that heterologous expression of CaZF provides osmotolerance in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> through Hog1p and Calcineurin dependent as well as independent pathways. CaZF partially suppresses salt-hypersensitive phenotypes of <italic>hog1</italic>, <italic>can</italic> and <italic>hog1can</italic> mutants and in conjunction, stimulates HOG and CAN pathway genes with subsequent accumulation of glycerol in absence of Hog1p and CAN. CaZF directly binds to stress response element (STRE) to activate STRE-containing promoter in yeast. Transactivation and salt tolerance assays of CaZF deletion mutants showed that other than the transactivation domain a C-terminal domain composed of acidic and basic amino acids is also required for its function. Altogether, results from this study suggests that CaZF is a potential plant salt-tolerance determinant and also provide evidence that in budding yeast expression of HOG and CAN pathway genes can be stimulated in absence of their regulatory enzymes to provide osmotolerance.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants have to cope with several types of environmental stress conditions.

An EST encoding a putative zinc finger protein expressing more in BGD72 than in ICCV2 at different points of stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005154-g001">Figure 1</xref>) was taken for further studies. Full-length cDNA (<italic>CaZF</italic>) constructed by 5&#x02032; RACE was 1185 bp in length (GenBank accession EU513298). Sequence analysis revealed an 843 bp open reading frame (ORF) of 280 amino acid, 139 bp long 5&#x02032; and 203 bp long 3&#x02032; untranslated region. Deduced amino acid sequence shows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005154-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) CaZF is an EPF type C2H2 zinc finger protein having two canonical TFIIIA-type zinc finger motifs (CX<sub>2</sub>CX<sub>3</sub>FX<sub>5</sub>LX<sub>2</sub>HX<sub>3</sub>H). Both the zinc finger motifs contain conserved QALGGH sequence. A short spacer sequence of 28 amino acids separates two zinc fingers. Among the studied proteins PIF1 (GB: AAQ54302), a pathogen inducible zinc finger protein from capsicum shows maximum sequence similarity with CaZF of only about 55&#x00025; homology (expect&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5e-45).

Detailed comparisons of the amino acid sequences among plant zinc finger proteins revealed three conserved regions other than the zinc fingers. CaZF contains a short basic region with a consensus of KXKRSKRXR (B-box), near the N-terminus, which may function as a potential nuclear localization signal (NLS) and/or may participate in DNA binding. Another is a region, consisting of three acidic residues followed by hydrophobic residues rich in leucine, with a consensus of EXEXXAXCLXXL (L-box) located between B-box and the first zinc-finger. The other is a short hydrophobic region containing a highly conserved DLNL sequence as a core (DLN-box) close to the C-terminus. The latter two may play a role in protein-protein interactions or in maintaining the folded structure. CaZF possesses a serine-glutamine rich region at the N-terminus, between L-box and first zinc-finger, which might function as a transactivation domain as suggested for ZPT2-1 and Pszf1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005154-Takatsuji1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005154-Michael1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> or might be a phosphorylation site for post-translational modification; and an asparagine rich stretch after the second zinc finger at the C-terminus.

EP1S is a 13 bp sequence with an inverted repeat of TGACA separated by a G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005154-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

Increase in transactivation activity after C-terminal deletion of CaZF is most likely due to removal of DLN-box mediated repression.

However, salinity-induced loss of chlorophyll was much lower in CaZF overexpressing lines (average 13.2&#x00025; and 23.1&#x00025; for L1/L21, and 27.8&#x00025; and 51.2&#x00025; for L17/L46 at 150 mM and 300 mM NaCl respectively) compared with that in the vector control (average 62.3&#x00025; and 76.4&#x00025; at 150 mM and 300 mM NaCl respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005154-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). From the damage caused by salt stress it was evident that CaZF overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants have a better ability to tolerate salinity stress as compared to vector control plants. The degree of bleaching (yellow color) observed in leaf disks after 72 h can reflect the extent of damage caused by stress.

To investigate whether the C-terminal domain has any role in its activity, we made serial deletion constructs from the C-terminal end of the protein. Removal of last 22 amino acids did not make any difference in the activity of CaZF. However, further removal of 33 amino acids totally abolished the capability of CaZF to provide any salt-tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005154-g010">Figure 10</xref>). A close analysis of the amino acid sequence reveals that this domain contains apart from alternate stretches of basic and acidic amino acids, a potential site for protein kinase C phosphorylation (SKK) and a potential site for cAMP/cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation (KKKS). In yeast, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is an essential component of general stress response pathway. In normal growth condition PKA phosphorylates C2H2 zinc finger proteins Crz1p, Msn2p and Msn4p to prevent their nuclear localization. Upon inactivation of PKA or activation of the phosphatase calcineurin during stress those proteins get dephosphorylated and are accumulated in the nucleus to activate their target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005154-Smith1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005154-Cyert2">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>.

We raised tobacco transgenics overexpressing CaZF showing tolerance to high salinity.</p><p>Most likely, in yeast, CaZF does not function at the level of Hog1p; rather it works downstream to it. The reasons being, CaZF structurally resembles a transcription factor and expression of <italic>CaZF</italic> is not toxic like expression of ASR1. ASR1 expression in control condition was growth-inhibitory like a constitutively active Hog1p mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005154-Moretti1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005154-Maskin1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. In spite of inducing gene expression and glycerol production, expression of CaZF could not provide equivalent salt-tolerance to <italic>hog1</italic> and <italic>cnb</italic> mutants as it did in wild type cells. There might be several reasons for that. We have analyzed expressions of only a few genes while Hog1p and Calcineurin together regulate expression of a wide number of genes involved in several pathways. Secondly, Hog1p-mediated stress relief mechanism begins much before of Hog1p-regulated transcriptional induction of downstream genes. Osmotic stress-activated Hog1p phosphorylates Nha1 Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> antiporter, which is crucial for rapid reassociation of those proteins, which were dissociated from the chromatin due to stress, with their target sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005154-Alepuz1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005154-Proft5">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. Apart from that, HOG pathway shares kinases and phosphatases with a lot of interconnecting pathways &#x0005b;for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005154-Hohmann1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>&#x0005d;, which cannot be replaced totally by heterologous expression of one transcription factor.</p><p>In conclusion, expression of <italic>CaZF</italic> in yeast provides evidence that at least some of the crucial stress tolerance determining genes, which are regulated by Hog1p MAP kinase, Calcineurin protein phosphatase and their target transcription factors during osmotic stress, can also be activated to the same extent in absence of their regulatory enzymes/transcriptional activators. Activation of those genes by a heterologous gene leads to production of the HOG pathway end product i.e. glycerol. In at least one previous instance it was shown that a plant gene (<italic>ASR1</italic>) could induce synthesis of glycerol in salt stress in absence of Hog1p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005154-Moretti1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005154-Maskin1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. The level of dependence of yeast cells on <italic>Hog1</italic> differs with intensity and extent of stress conditions. After 20 min of exposure at 800 mM NaCl, 75&#x00025; of salt stress-responsive genes are strongly dependent on <italic>Hog1</italic> while only 32&#x00025; of them are strongly dependent on <italic>Hog1</italic> after 10 min exposure at 400 mM NaCl exposure. At 400 mM NaCl 36&#x00025; of salt-induced genes are independent of <italic>Hog1</italic> in contrast to only 3&#x00025; at 800 mM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005154-Posas1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, influence of Hog1p on expression of genes is relative to the experimental condition. We have analyzed gene expression and glycerol estimation at 500 mM NaCl and so there may be a possibility that in this experimental condition influence of Hog1p is relatively less in providing salt-adaptation. A salt-inducible but Hog1p and Calcineurin-independent pathway definitely uses CaZF as a substrate for post-translational modification and/or target for protein-protein interaction, because it can induce gene expression and consequently provide growth advantage only in presence of stress; and secondly it requires its C-terminal domain, which is not required for its transcription activation property, for its function. CaZF might be a potential target for cyclic AMP-dependent protein Kinase such as protein kinase A. Altogether our experiments in tobacco and in yeast demonstrate that CaZF, a C2H2 zinc finger protein from chickpea is a potential salt tolerant determinant in plant. Unlike several other zinc finger proteins having &#x02018;DLNL&#x02019; motif and acting as transcription repressor, CaZF acts as transcription activator. Other than its transactivation domain, which resides at its N-terminus, the C-terminal aminoacids also play a major role in its activity. CaZF requires post-translational modification and/or interaction with other stress-inducible proteins for its full activity. Our results in yeast model suggest that CaZF can act as a general osmotolerance-determinant by inducing the production of osmolytes by directly activating their promoters.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Yeast Strains and Culture Conditions</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are BCY123, BY4742 and PJ69-4A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005154-t001">Table 1</xref>).
