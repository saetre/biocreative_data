While both are required for normal humoral immune responses, the relationship between these two processes is unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that following receptor ligation, a small subpopulation of B cell antigen receptors are inductively phosphorylated and selectively retained at the cell surface where they can serve as scaffolds for the assembly of signaling molecules. In contrast, the larger population of non-phosphorylated receptors is rapidly endocytosed. Each receptor can undergo only one of two mutually exclusive fates because the tyrosine-based motifs that mediate signaling when phosphorylated mediate internalization when not phosphorylated. Mathematical modeling indicates that the observed competition between receptor phosphorylation and internalization enhances signaling responses to low avidity ligands.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The B cell receptor (BCR) is responsible for both the internalization of pathogens by B cells and for B cell activation signaling; internalization and activation signaling are mutually exclusive events for an individual BCR.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The recognition of polyvalent antigens by the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) initiates a complex web of signaling events that determine cellular responses &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;.

This scaffolding molecule probably contributes to endocytosis by regulating Rac1 and the remodeling of actin. The molecular linkage between these signaling pathways, clathrin and the BCR remains enigmatic. It has been postulated that lipid rafts are the intermediate between the BCR and clathrin &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.

This finding suggested that phosphorylated, and therefore actively signaling receptor complexes, are preferentially retained on the cell surface. This prediction was confirmed in both biochemical and confocal microscopy studies. Based on these results, we developed a mathematical model of the observed exclusive relationship between receptor internalization and phosphorylation that was then compared to a hypothetical non-exclusive model. Analysis of the exclusive model indicated that it could account for previous seemingly contradictory observations on the relationship between BCR internalization and signaling. Furthermore, it revealed that retaining phosphorylated BCRs on the cell surface should preferentially enhance signaling responses to low avidity ligands.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Tyrosines within Ig&#x003b1; Are Required for Internalization</title><p>Tyrosine-based motifs consisting of YXX&#x003c6; are well described binding sites for AP (adaptor protein)-2, and other adaptors, which mediate receptor endocytosis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. Surprisingly, there has been no systematic examination of the role of the Ig&#x003b1;/Ig&#x003b2; cytosolic tyrosines in BCR internalization. Therefore, we undertook such an analysis with a focus on Ig&#x003b1; because it is the main signaling chain of the BCR &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;, and it has been implicated in constitutive receptor internalization &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>To simplify our initial analysis, we chose to examine the cytosolic tail of Ig&#x003b1; in isolation as a chimera with the extracellular and transmembrane domains of human platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. For these experiments, we derived chimeras containing several Ig&#x003b1; cytosolic mutants. DNA fragments encoding each PDGFR&#x003b2;/Ig&#x003b1; chimera were cloned into a retroviral vector (MIGR1) containing an IRES/EGFP cassette. The murine FcR <sup>&#x02212;</sup> B cell lymphoma A20IIA1.6 was infected with viral stocks encoding each chimera, and cell populations expressing similar surface levels of each receptor were isolated by flow cytometry (unpublished data). We first compared the internalization of wild-type Ig&#x003b1; (Ig&#x003b1; <sup>wt</sup>) to Ig&#x003b1; in which the ITAM tyrosines were mutated to either phenylalanines (Ig&#x003b1; <sup>Y&#x00394;F182,193</sup>) or alanines (Ig&#x003b1; <sup>Y&#x00394;A182,193</sup>). Conservative mutations to phenylalanines prevent Syk recruitment &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; but should not interfere with the recruitment of putative adaptors involved in receptor internalization &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, mutations to alanine should prevent the recruitment of both Syk and any adaptor molecules &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. Endocytosis of each ligated chimera was assayed by flow cytometry and the percent of internalized receptor was plotted as a function of time. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, mutation of the ITAM tyrosines to phenylalanines had little effect on receptor endocytosis while mutation to alanines slightly delayed receptor internalization ( <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4). Endocytosis of the endogenous BCR on each test cell population was similar (unpublished data) confirming that there were no clonal differences in internalization capacity. These data indicate that the Ig&#x003b1; ITAM tyrosines make a modest contribution to receptor internalization. </p><p>We next derived and analyzed additional Ig&#x003b1; mutants to examine if the non-ITAM tyrosines contributed to receptor internalization (Ig&#x003b1; <sup>Y&#x00394;A176,182,193,204</sup>) and if the cytosolic tail contained other functional domains (Ig&#x003b1; <sup>&#x00394;C</sup>). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, additive mutation of the non-ITAM tyrosines inhibited both the rate and magnitude of internalization by approximately 70&#x00025;. Single additive mutation of Y <sup>176</sup> (Ig&#x003b1; <sup>Y&#x00394;A176,182,193</sup>) or Y <sup>204</sup> (Ig&#x003b1; <sup>Y&#x00394;A182,193,204</sup>) revealed that each contributed to efficient receptor internalization (unpublished data). As mutation of the non-ITAM tyrosines alone has little effect on receptor internalization &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, we conclude that both the ITAM and non-ITAM tyrosines contribute to BCR internalization. </p><p>Interestingly, truncation of the Ig&#x003b1; cytosolic tail completely inhibited internalization. These data indicate that additional, unidentified domains within the cytosolic tail contribute to BCR internalization. However, as demonstrated below, it is the tyrosine-based motifs that determine which BCR complexes are internalized.</p><p>Recent observations suggest that actin cytoskeleton remodeling is important for BCR internalization &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, we assayed whether tyrosine-mediated Ig&#x003b1; internalization was dependent or independent of actin polymerization. Cells expressing Ig&#x003b1; <sup>wt</sup> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) or Ig&#x003b1; <sup>Y&#x00394;A176,182,193,204</sup> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g001">Figure 1</xref>D) were stimulated as above in the presence of Latrunculin A.

These data indicate that tyrosine-mediated internalization depends on actin polymerization. The mechanisms underlying the residual tyrosine-independent and actin-independent receptor internalization are not known. </p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Phosphorylated BCR Complexes Are Retained on the Cell Surface</title><p>With other receptors that depend upon tyrosine-based motifs for internalization, phosphorylation at these residues impedes endocytosis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, our data predicted that following engagement, phosphorylated BCR complexes would be preferentially retained on the cell surface while non-phosphorylated complexes would be internalized. To test this prediction, resting wild-type A20IIA1.6 cells were surface labeled on ice with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin, a reagent that attaches biotin to surface proteins through a linker containing a thiol-cleavable bond. Cell aliquots were either left unstimulated or stimulated through the BCR for the indicated times at 37 <sup>&#x000b0;</sup>C. Cells were then treated on ice with reduced glutathione which is a cell impermeable reducing agent that strips biotin from surface, but not internalized, receptor complexes. Lysates from each sample were sequentially precipitated with strepavidin-Sepharose followed by anti-Ig&#x003b1; antibodies. Precipitations were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes and then probed with either anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) or anti-Ig&#x003b1; antibodies ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). In the strepavidin precipitations, little Ig&#x003b1; was precipitated from resting cells, but progressively more material was detected over time, reflecting progressive internalization of the stimulated BCR. Although Ig&#x003b1; was readily detected in these precipitations, there was essentially no phosphorylated Ig&#x003b1; detected. In contrast, phosphorylated Ig&#x003b1; was readily detected in subsequent anti-Ig&#x003b1; immunoprecipitations ( <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5). </p><p>The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g002">Figure 2</xref>A could have been obtained if surface-labeled complexes were not phosphorylated following BCR ligation or if they were not efficiently precipitated with strepavidin. Therefore, cells were stimulated as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g002">Figure 2</xref>A but without subsequent incubation with glutathione. Stepavidin precipitations were then sequentially Western blotted with 4G10 followed by anti-Ig&#x003b1; antibodies. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, phosphorylated Ig&#x003b1; was readily detected in the strepavidin precipitations.

Approximately 50&#x00025; of the detectable Ig&#x003b1; was present in the strepavidin precipitations indicating that Ig&#x003b1; was efficiently labeled on the cell surface. </p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Direct Visualization of Phosphorylated BCR Complexes</title><p>Previously, we had demonstrated in pull-down and far Western assays that the BLNK SH2 domain bound directly and specifically to phosphorylated Y <sup>204</sup> Ig&#x003b1; &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.

To test this idea, we first coupled a GST fusion protein containing the BLNK-SH2 domain &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; to phycoerythrin (PE). A20IIA1.6 cells expressing PDGFR chimeric receptors containing the cytosolic tail of either Ig&#x003b1; or Ig&#x003b1; <sup>Y&#x00394;F204</sup> were stimulated through the chimera with FITC-conjugated antibodies for 10 min; fixed, permeablized, and counterstained with PE-BLNK-SH2. Staining was only observed in those cells stimulated with a receptor containing an intact Ig&#x003b1; cytosolic tail ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Although specific staining was observed, there was also significant background. We postulated that this could be due to competition with endogenous BLNK. Therefore, we derived A20IIA1.6 cells in which BLNK had been knocked down with shRNA (BLNK <sup>kd</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). </p><p>BLNK <sup>kd</sup> cells were stimulated with Cy5-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies for 10 min.

As can be seen, there was no PE-BLNK-SH2 staining in unstimulated cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). In contrast, specific co-localization with surface BCR complexes was seen in stimulated cells. Only surface-retained BCR patches were phosphorylated while no internalized BCR complexes were detectably phosphorylated ( <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 150 cells, with internalized BCR complexes from three independent experiments). Similar results were obtained when cells were stimulated for 15 min while by 30 min after stimulation, phosphorylated complexes were no longer detectable (unpublished data). </p><p>We next sought to extend our studies to splenic B cells. In BLNK <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, there is a partial block in B cell development &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. However, peripheral IgM <sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cell populations accumulate after birth &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d; (unpublished data). Therefore, purified BLNK <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenic B cells were stimulated with FITC-conjugated anti-IgM F(ab) <sub>2</sub> fragments for 10 or 15 min and then fixed, permeabilized, and counterstained with PE-BLNK-SH2. In contrast to A20IIA1.6 cells, ligation of the BCR on BLNK <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenic B cells rapidly induces a single cap containing most of the ligated BCR complexes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). However, only a fraction of the receptors in each cap were phosphorylated and no internalized BCR complexes were demonstrably phosphorylated as measured by BLNK-SH2 binding ( <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 100, four experiments). From these studies, we conclude that following BCR stimulation, phosphorylated BCRs are retained on the cell surface and are not internalized. </p><p>Interestingly, only a minority of surface BCRs were phosphorylated. This is most clearly seen in the A20IIA1.6 cell line in which only 10&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025; of surface patches, or approximately 1 to 2 surface patches per cell, contained detectably phosphorylated BCR complexes. These results suggest that only rare surface BCR complexes initiate signaling and that these then segregate into common patches. Therefore, we next quantitated the fraction of surface Ig&#x003b1; that was phosphorylated following BCR engagement. Aliquots of wild-type A20IIA1.6 cells were surface-biotinylated and then stimulated through the BCR for the indicated times ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Following lysis, cells were precipitated with anti-Ig&#x003b1; antibodies, strepavidin, or 4G10. Precipitations were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and immunoblotted sequentially with 4G10 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) and then anti-Ig&#x003b1; antibodies ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Precipitation with either strepavidin or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies readily captured phosphorylated Ig&#x003b1; ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g004">Figure 4</xref>, upper panel) with the 4G10 immunoprecipitations being slightly more efficient. As expected, phosphorylation of Ig&#x003b1; was greatest at 2 min with substantial decay at 10 and 15 min. To determine what fraction of surface Ig&#x003b1; was phosphorylated, membranes were stripped and immunoblotted with anti-Ig&#x003b1; antibodies. As can be seen, precipitation with either anti-Ig&#x003b1; antibodies or strepavidin precipitated readily detectable amounts of Ig&#x003b1;. In marked contrast, very little Ig&#x003b1; was present in the corresponding 4G10 immunoprecipitation. Comparison of the Ig&#x003b1; 32-kDa band densities at the 2-min stimulation time point revealed that 5&#x00025; &#x02212;10&#x00025; of surface Ig&#x003b1; was phosphorylated following BCR stimulation (typical results, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4). As the 4G10 immunoprecipitations were more efficient than the strepavidin precipitations, this may be a slight overestimation. Regardless, these results are consistent with those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g003">Figure 3</xref>B indicating that signaling is propagated by a small minority of surface-retained BCR complexes. </p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Inhibiting BCR Endocytosis Has a Modest Effect on Signal Propagation</title><p>Given that phosphorylated, and therefore signaling, receptor complexes are normally retained on cell surface, we predicted that inhibiting receptor internalization would not directly modulate receptor initiated signaling.

These cells were used to assess the effect of internalization on BCR-initiated signaling. </p><p>Aliquots of cells expressing either dn-dynamin or empty vector were stimulated with anti-IgG antibodies for the indicated times, and total inductive tyrosine phosphorylation was assayed in Western blots with 4G10. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, blocking receptor internalization led to a modest decrease in global tyrosine phosphorylation without an appreciable change in activation kinetics. We then examined the inductive phosphorylation of specific substrates. Cell aliquots were stimulated as before and immunoprecipitates of Ig&#x003b1;, BLNK, or PLC&#x003b3;2 were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with 4G10. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, there was an approximate 60&#x00025; decrease in inductive BLNK phosphorylation at all time points examined. There was a more modest but reproducible ( <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4) decrease in Ig&#x003b1; phosphorylation in cells expressing dn-dynamin. In contrast, there was no significant change in PLC&#x003b3;2 phosphorylation. </p><p>To assess if downstream signaling pathways were affected, cell aliquots were stimulated for the indicated times and total cell lysates were immunoblotted with either anti-phospho Erk, Jnk, or p38 antibodies. Blots were then stripped and immunoblotted with antibodies to detect the total amount of kinase in each lane. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g005">Figure 5</xref>C, there were no significant differences in the magnitude or duration of Erk, Jnk, or p38 activation. It is possible that subtle differences in mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation were obscured because the BCR was maximally stimulated in these experiments. However, when we titered the stimulating antibody over a 200-fold range, no differences were observed in Erk activation between dn-dynamin and control cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Consistent with our model in which internalization per se does not directly attenuate BCR signaling, expression of dn-dynamin modestly inhibited some aspects of proximal BCR signaling and had little effect on distal MAP kinase activation. </p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Modulation of BCR Signaling through the Internalization of Non-Phosphorylated Receptor Complexes</title><p>To explore the functional consequences of the observed competition between phosphorylation and internalization, we constructed a mathematical model ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). In this model, when the BCR engages antigen, one of two things can happen. One possible fate is that the engaged receptor is phosphorylated. For simplicity, the kinase-mediating receptor phosphorylation is Syk bound to another phosphorylated BCR (BCRp). The Src kinases also contribute to BCR phosphorylation &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. However, recent observations suggest that this contribution is minor &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d; (Clark, et al., unpublished data). Generating more phosphorylated BCRs, which can then bind and activate more Syk &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b009">9</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, amplifies signaling through a positive feedback mechanism &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. The other possible fate is that the engaged receptor associates with an AP which sequesters and then removes the receptor from the cell surface. </p><p>Sequestered BCRs are assumed to hinder the propagation of phosphorylation and are thus modeled as competitive inhibitors of the kinase, although they are not in fact expected to interact with it directly. Including this ansatz enables the model to account for some seemingly contradictory results that have been obtained using different strategies to inhibit BCR endocytosis. For example, in our experiments, expression of dn-dynamin slightly attenuated proximal signaling while deletion of clathrin has been reported to augment signaling &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Because dn-dynamin inhibits receptor internalization after receptors fated for endocytosis are already segregated into clathrin-coated pits &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;, in the model the dn-dynamin mutant corresponds to inhibiting the removal of sequestered BCRs. As a result, receptors accumulate in the sequestered state, which limits the spread of phosphorylation. In contrast, in the absence of clathrin, coated pits cannot form, and the signal propagates freely through the receptor population ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). </p><p>We next examined how the observed mechanism of internalization might influence signaling responses to ligands of different avidity. For these studies, we compared the exclusive model to a conventional non-exclusive model in which phosphorylation and internalization were independent events (boxed reactions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g006">Figure 6</xref>A; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for a discussion of necessary modifications to the equations and parameters). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, when signaling and internalization are mutually exclusive, signal intensities in response to low avidity ligands are preferentially enhanced as compared to the non-exclusive model. This effect derives from the fact that, in the former model, BCRp complexes are not removed from the surface, which makes it easier to overcome the action of phosphatases when relatively few receptors are engaged. On the other hand, at high avidities, the signal is lower relative to that predicted by the non-exclusive model. When phosphorylation and internalization are exclusive, the signal can only propagate to the relatively few BCRs not bound by an AP at any given time. The latter trend is more pronounced if one examines phosphorylation integrated over time (unpublished data). The essential difference between the low and high avidity regimes is that in the former, BCRp&#x000b7;Syk (the active catalyst) is limiting, while in the latter, Ag&#x000b7;BCR (the substrate) is limiting. These calculations thus indicate that the exclusive mechanism enhances the responses to low avidity ligands, which is likely to be important for initial detection in physiological contexts. </p><p>Interestingly, the exclusive model predicts that the time required to reach peak signal intensity will significantly vary with ligand avidities ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, inset). The effect is predicted to be especially pronounced at low avidities where the time to peak signal intensity should be significantly delayed. The physical basis for the delay is that selective endocytosis leaves BCRp on the surface to amplify the signal, but the signal spreads slowly due to the fact that relatively few BCRs are productively engaged by antigen. The non-exclusive model does not as readily support this scenario because BCRp does not persist on the surface. This predicted delay in peak-signaling intensity in response to low avidity ligands is a well-described feature of signaling through the BCR &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. </p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we provide direct evidence that once a BCR engages antigen it is either phosphorylated (and retained at the cell surface) or it is internalized. This was demonstrated using both biochemical and confocal microcopic techniques. The latter experiments made use of the unique binding specificity of the BLNK SH2 domain which allowed us to directly visualize the phosphorylated BCR. Within the sensitivity limits of our experiments, we never detected internalized phosphorylated receptors. Signaling and internalization are mutually exclusive events because the tyrosine-based motifs that mediate signaling when phosphorylated, mediate internalization when they are not phosphorylated.</p><p>It is well known that receptor endocytosis mediated by tyrosine-based motifs is subject to regulation by phosphorylation. The best-characterized example in lymphocytes is CTLA-4, where tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytosolic tail leads to the accumulation of CTLA-4 on the cell surface &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. Surface expression of the adhesion molecule L1 is regulated in a similar manner &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>However, in contrast to CTLA-4 and L1 in which single tyrosines determine receptor endocytosis, multiple tyrosines within Ig&#x003b1;, and probably Ig&#x003b2;, contribute to internalization of the ligated receptor. Conservative mutations to phenylalanines had no detrimental effect on internalization while non-conservative mutations to alanine abrogated receptor internalization. These findings are consistent with recognition by an AP-2-like adaptor complex &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Both of the Ig&#x003b1; ITAM tyrosines and the non-ITAM Y <sup>204</sup> tyrosine are within predicted AP-2 binding sites (YXX&#x003a6;, where &#x003a6; is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid)&#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;. The second non-ITAM tyrosine at Y <sup>176</sup> has a glutamate at the Y &#x0002b; 3 position that should preclude recognition by AP-2 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b062">62</xref>&#x0005d;.

These latter observations suggest that the regulation of receptor internalization is complex and is not simply determined by the presence or absence of potential AP-2 binding motifs. </p><p>Indeed, even with mutation of all the Ig&#x003b1; tyrosines there was some residual receptor internalization. It might have been predicted that this secondary mechanism of receptor internalization would lead to the endocytosis of some phosphorylated receptor complexes. However, in all of our biochemical ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and confocal ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g003">Figure 3</xref>) studies, this was never observed. This might be due, in part, to the slower kinetics of these secondary endocytosis mechanisms. Another possibility is that our mutational analysis underestimated the importance of the tyrosines as determiners of internalization. In the activated receptor complexes, these tyrosines would not only be phosphorylated but would be bound to multimeric signaling complexes, which could limit the effectiveness of other secondary internalization mechanisms. </p><p>Previous studies examining the role of the Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2; ITAM tyrosines in receptor endocytosis have concluded that they did not make a significant contribution &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. Indeed, in our own studies, isolated mutation of the ITAM tyrosines had only a modest effect on receptor internalization. However, when mutated in combination with the non-ITAM tyrosines, endocytosis was significantly inhibited. The importance of the non-ITAM tyrosines had been overlooked until it was demonstrated that Y <sup>204</sup> was robustly phosphorylated in vivo and that it served to directly recruit the SH2 domain of BLNK &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition to a role in activating BLNK-dependent pathways, Y <sup>204</sup> is required for normal receptor endocytic trafficking &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d; and for peripheral B cell selection (A.B. Cooper, L.D. Wang, and M.R. Clark, unpublished data). Therefore, the tyrosines within the BCR complex that mediate receptor internalization are of demonstrated functional and biological importance. </p><p>It has been suggested that lipid rafts may play a role in BCR endocytosis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.

The mechanisms resulting in the local concentrations of phosphorylated BCRs are not known. However, it is unlikely to simply arise from passive exclusion from clathrin-coated pits. </p><p>Retention of Ig&#x003b1;/Ig&#x003b2; on the cell surface might be advantageous for propagating signals, but it would apparently impede the other function of the BCR, which is to capture antigen for processing and presentation to cognate T cells. However, it has been reported that following receptor stimulation, the BCR can become destabilized and that Ig&#x003b1;/Ig&#x003b2; can dissociate from mIg &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b075">75</xref>&#x0005d;. Although originally reported in the context of anergy &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b076">76</xref>&#x0005d;, it has recently been reported to occur in response to activating ligands &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b077">77</xref>&#x0005d;. Once disassociated, mIg and Ig&#x003b1;/Ig&#x003b2; are endocytosed separately &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b077">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b078">78</xref>&#x0005d;. Given the infrequency of inductive BCR phosphorylation, it is likely that only a small fraction of engaged BCRs are destabilized. This conclusion is consistent with recent elegant studies demonstrating that the bulk of surface BCR complexes remain intact following ligation &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b079">79</xref>&#x0005d;. However, for those receptors that have productively engaged antigen, dissociation into antigen binding and signaling subunits would allow each to adopt different subcellular fates better suited for their intrinsic function. </p><p>Mathematical analysis of the exclusive model allowed us to relate our findings to the wider body of experimental observations concerning the relationship between BCR signaling and internalization. This was particularly helpful in understanding how blocking endocytosis at different steps could result in dramatically different signaling phenotypes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d; ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Our analysis also provided insights into other observed behaviors of the BCR including the attenuation of signaling in response to high avidity ligands &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b080">80</xref>&#x0005d;.

This is because BCRs following either exclusive or non-exclusive mechanisms of internalization cannot be derived. However, such comparisons are necessary for understanding how a particular internalization mechanism could influence signaling in response to ligands of varying avidity ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). </p><p>Through the studies presented in this paper, we provide a new model for dissecting the complex dynamics of BCR internalization and signaling. As described above, this model may help explain seemingly disparate observations in the literature on how the BCR is spatially regulated. Furthermore, by identifying how receptors are selected for internalization, one can then begin to address how signaling is modulated by ligands of different avidity and how this translates into different cell fates during peripheral immune responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmid construction and derivation of cell lines.</title><p>Construction of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor &#x003b2; (PDGFR&#x003b2;)/Ig&#x003b1; chimera has been previously described &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040200-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.

We thus adjusted the values of <italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>a</sub> with remainder of the parameters set to values on the order of one, so that they were not rate-limiting; <italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub> was varied to make the peak in phosphorylation comparable to the observed level (about 10&#x00025;), and <italic>k</italic><sub>a</sub> was varied to match the overall experimental time course of phosphorylation (about 10 min). The remaining parameters were then adjusted by trial-and-error to refine the wild-type phosphorylation profile for better agreement with the experimental data. Clearly, this procedure does not define a unique set of parameter values, but our objective in exploring the model is to obtain qualitative insight rather than to extract quantitative estimates for the kinetics of specific processes. </p><p>To validate the above procedure, we varied the rate constants from 0.1 to 100 min <sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and examined the effects on the phosphorylation peak height and time ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). In the case of reversible processes (binding, phosphorylation, and sequestration), the kinetic parameters for the forward and backward reactions were changed together to maintain their ratio; otherwise (removal), parameters were changed individually. The remaining parameters were held fixed at their values in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040200-g006">Figure 6</xref> legend.
