We report here the novel finding that human erythrocytes present Coxsackie virus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) providing an Ad5 sequestration mechanism that protects against systemic infection. Interestingly, erythrocytes from neither mice nor rhesus macaques present CAR. Excess Ad5 fiber protein or anti-CAR antibody inhibits the binding of Ad5 to human erythrocytes and cryo-electron microscopy shows attachment via the fiber protein of Ad5, leading to close juxtaposition with the erythrocyte membrane. Human, but not murine, erythrocytes also present complement receptor (CR1), which binds Ad5 in the presence of antibodies and complement. Transplantation of human erythrocytes into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice extends blood circulation of intravenous Ad5 but decreases its extravasation into human xenograft tumors. Ad5 also shows extended circulation in transgenic mice presenting CAR on their erythrocytes, although it clears rapidly in transgenic mice presenting erythrocyte CR1. Hepatic infection is inhibited in both transgenic models. Erythrocytes may therefore restrict Ad5 infection (natural and therapeutic) in humans, independent of antibody status, presenting a formidable challenge to Ad5 therapeutics. &#x0201c;Stealthing&#x0201d; of Ad5 using hydrophilic polymers may enable circumvention of these natural virus traps.</p></abstract><contract-sponsor id="CS200" xlink:href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adenovirus is a respiratory and intestinal pathogen that causes diseases ranging from pharyngitis to childhood pneumonia, readily transmitted between persons by coughs and sneezes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup> In severely immune suppressed patients, adenovirus can cause fatal systemic viremia, although in most persons it mediates relatively mild clinical pathologies. The recent observation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> that type 5 adenovirus (Ad5) binds coagulation factors to enable entry into hepatocytes suggests the virus may have evolved toward systemic infection, although the advantage of hepatic infection for a virus that is normally transmitted by respiratory droplets is unclear. Here we report the unexpected presence of high affinity Ad5 receptors on human erythrocytes, which may function as decoys to protect against systemic virus infection, perhaps representing an evolutionary response to the challenge of widespread adenovirus pathology.</p><p>There are at least 51 serotypes of human adenovirus, and Ad5 has been particularly widely studied in biology and medicine. Recombinant Ad5 has been used in studies of cancer gene therapy and virotherapy, and 2 Ad5-based products have now been licensed in China for treatment of cancer by direct injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> Ad5 infects cells via at least 4 distinct cell surface receptor-binding pathways. These include binding of Ad5 fiber protein to Coxsackie virus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) and/or heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), binding of penton-base protein to integrins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> as well as the recently identified pathway mediated by binding of coagulation factors to hexon protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup></p><p>Here we define the mechanism of Ad5 binding to human erythrocytes and document presentation of CAR and complement receptor 1 (CR1), which efficiently sequester Ad5 in the absence and presence of anti-Ad5 antibodies, respectively. We demonstrate that erythrocyte binding alters the blood circulation profile of intravenously administered Ad5 and dramatically reduces its extravasation and infectivity. These findings suggest that human, but not murine, erythrocytes may have a function in preventing systemic Ad5 infection, acting as circulating &#x0201c;virus traps.&#x0201d; They also raise important questions over the use of murine models to predict clinical behavior of systemic Ad5 and suggest that, in humans, intravenous Ad5 therapeutics probably don't infect target disease tissues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>A431, A549, SKOV-3, and HT29 carcinoma cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA).

After centrifugation (2000<italic>g</italic>, 5 minutes), plasma and cells were separated and the plasma placed on ice or subjected to heat treatment (56&#x000b0;C, 30 minutes) or cobra venom factor (CVF) treatment (25 units/mL plasma; Quidel, San Diego, CA). The leukocytes layer were removed and the erythrocytes washed (4 times with a 10&#x000d7; volume of phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]). Erythrocytes were resuspended in PBS or experimental plasma at physiologic concentrations (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> cells/mL) and 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> Ad5 particles per milliliter were added. Incubation was performed at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. Inhibition studies used polyclonal rabbit anti&#x02013;human C1q IgG, Fab fragment (Medical Research Council Immunochemistry Unit, Oxford, United Kingdom) at 600 ng/mL, rabbit anti&#x02013;human CR1 IgG antibody (R223), or isotype control rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at 250 &#x003bc;g/mL.

For studies using whole blood, fractionation after exposure to Ad5 was achieved using CPT vacutainers (code 362760; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). This allowed the plasma, platelets, monocyte/lymphocyte, and erythrocyte/neutrophil fractions to be isolated from 4 mL of whole blood incubated with 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> copies of Ad5. The erythrocyte/neutrophil fraction was separated by performing erythrocyte lysis (2&#x000d7; wash in 5&#x000d7; excess of 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 150 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid).

CR1 transgenics showed a similar clearance profile. In contrast, CAR transgenics showed extended circulation, with approximately 70% of Ad5 detectable in circulation after 6 hours. Because Ad5 is associated with erythrocytes in both transgenic models, this suggests that the nature of binding is crucial, with CAR-bound Ad5 remaining in the bloodstream, whereas CR1-bound Ad5 is targeted for rapid clearance. This agrees with the reported mechanism of processing of CR1-bound antigen, which involves deposition in hepatic and splenic macrophages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref></sup></p><p>The modified circulation profile in the transgenic mice was reflected in substantial differences in liver transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C), which was decreased more than 800-fold in CAR mice compared with WT.

Similarly, CR1 transgenics showed 16-fold less hepatic transduction than WT mice, compatible with the role of CR1 sequestration in accelerating delivery to macrophages for degradation rather than allowing hepatocyte infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Cryo-electron microscopy of Ad5 binding to erythrocytes</title><p>The interaction of Ad5 with human and murine erythrocytes was characterized using cryo-electron microscopy.

Ad5 was also closely associated with ghosts from CAR transgenics in PBS (Figure S9) and with ghosts from CR1 transgenics in the presence of plasma.

However, genetic modification of Ad5 to avoid both CAR and CR1-mediated human erythrocyte binding requires modification of the CAR-binding domain and all B-cell epitopes on the capsid because approximately 90% of the population have anti-Ad5 antibodies. Even if this were possible, it would raise significant safety concerns. Physical &#x0201c;stealthing&#x0201d; of Ad5 provides a safer and more practical strategy, and we have shown previously that HPMA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref></sup> has great potential for coating adenovirus. In this study, we used a new generation of EGF-targeted, positively charged, HPMA polymer (EGF-P; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). The ability of this polymer to coat Ad5 was verified by zeta potential analysis (Figure S10). In infection studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), activity of Ad5 was decreased 10<sup>5</sup>-fold by a 1 in 100 dilution of anti-Ad5 antiserum, whereas EGF-P-Ad5 showed only a 10-fold decrease in activity, suggesting good antibody protection. Indeed, in separate experiments, EGF-P-Ad still maintained 10% of its activity even when neat serum was used (Figure S11). We also assessed whether polymer coating would prevent sequestration onto human erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C) and found that EGF-P-Ad5 showed no binding to human erythrocytes in either PBS or human plasma (&#x0223c; 100% recovered in liquid fraction), indicating that CAR and antibody-binding epitopes were fully shielded. Finally, we assessed whether EGF-P-Ad5 could infect an EGF receptor&#x02013;expressing cancer cell line in the presence of human erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). Whereas CAR-mediated infection of Ad5 in PBS was decreased 10-fold by the inclusion of erythrocytes, EGF-P-Ad5 showed no inhibition, reflecting coverage of CAR-binding epitopes by the polymer and retargeting through EGF. In plasma, Ad5 mediated no detectable infection with or without erythrocytes. Conversely, EGF-P-Ad5 activity was reduced less than 10-fold even in the presence of both plasma and erythrocytes.

This uptake pathway is responsible for the high levels of hepatic infection seen in mice after intravenous administration of Ad5. This suggests that adenovirus has adapted to exploit cell entry mechanisms based on receptors for clotting factors and, accordingly, that its infectious niche includes exposure to plasma proteins. However, we show here that CAR and CR1 on human erythrocytes provide a formidable defense against blood-borne infection. Our studies transplanting washed human erythrocytes into NOD-SCID mice (with non&#x02013;Ad5-neutralizing plasma) showed that human erythrocytes sequester Ad5 in the mouse bloodstream and abolish extravasation, thereby preventing access to extravascular targets. This compounds our observations that sequestration of Ad5 by washed human erythrocytes ablates both CAR and FX-mediated infection of tumor cell lines in vitro, indicating inhibition of infection even when the virus can make contact with the target cells. Similarly, after systemic administration of Ad5 in CAR transgenic mice, the virus is sequestered onto erythrocytes and fails to infect the liver, including by the FX-binding pathway.</p><p>CR1-bearing erythrocytes from CR1 transgenic mice also showed extensive Ad5 binding in human plasma and, to a lesser extent, in non-neutralizing murine plasma in vitro. As a consequence of such binding, liver infection after intravenous administration of Ad5 was significantly lower in CR1 mice than in WT mice. In human plasma, the CR1 interaction involves complement component C1q, suggesting involvement of the classic complement pathway and anti-Ad5 antibodies as previously reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref></sup> although in mouse plasma the mechanism is unclear. Direct binding of C3 (the alternative pathway) has been proposed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref></sup> although Xu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref></sup> showed recently that murine plasma contains natural IgM that can mediate opsonization of Ad5 for phagocytosis. It is known that these innate antibodies are capable of activating complement. In either case, it seems probable that Ad5 will bind to CR1 on human erythrocytes when administered intravenously in all patients. Whether it binds also to CAR appears to depend on the presence or absence of antibodies capable of blocking the CAR-binding epitopes of the fiber.</p><p>Cryo-electron microscopy analysis showed that Ad5 binds human erythrocyte membranes in PBS both via fiber-CAR and also through a second receptor that mediates a closer interaction, apparently mediated through the penton base.

It is possible that the need for erythrocyte CAR &#x0201c;decoys&#x0201d; is less important in mice because they are not normally subject to infectious pathology from CAR-infecting adenoviruses; nevertheless, mice are very sensitive to Coxsackie virus infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref></sup> Indeed, Asher et al showed that expression of CAR on transgenic murine erythrocytes provided effective protection against challenge with Coxsackie virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup> The effect of adenovirus in immunosuppressed patients undergoing stem cell transplantion provides information regarding the protective effect of erythrocyte CAR in humans.

The remarkable absence of hepatic toxicity in clinical trials, even after delivery of Ad5 via the hepatic artery, has already led others to question whether Ad5 infects the liver in humans as well as it does in preclinical models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref></sup> The human erythrocyte-based sequestration mechanisms outlined here may accompany adaptive antibody responses to significantly restrict Ad5 infection irrespective of prior Ad5 exposure.</p><p>The use of physical coating strategies to protect therapeutic viruses from unwanted interactions with antibodies and cells provides a way forward. Whereas genetic modification of viruses to evade the immune system is a daunting challenge and could yield hazardous variants, physical coating provides a simple &#x0201c;cover-all&#x0201d; that is not inherited by progeny viruses. This approach may protect Ad5 against binding to antibodies and erythrocytes, improving extravasation and allowing access to disseminated disease targets, while ensuring that any progeny virus produced in vivo will be rapidly inactivated when it reenters the bloodstream. Therefore, the absence of erythrocyte binding we observed with Ad5 coated with the latest generation of HPMA polymers represents a significant step forward.</p><p>Expression of CR1 on human erythrocytes also represents an important species difference that impinges on &#x0201c;translation&#x0201d; of murine data using any microorganism for human medication because even low affinity antibodies will probably sequester the microorganism onto human, but not murine, erythrocytes. Conventional murine preclinical models are therefore doubtful to be useful for testing therapeutic microorganisms intended to contact the bloodstream, even if the animals are preimmunized to reflect human adaptive immune status. Identification of preclinical systems capable of accurately predicting performance of therapeutic microorganisms in humans is a rather underdeveloped area.</p><p>Viruses have a distinguished medical history as vaccines and are beginning to show therapeutic activity in other disciplines ranging from the use of retroviruses to express immune components in bone marrow precursor cells in congenital immune deficiencies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref></sup> parvoviruses for retinal treatment of Leber congenital amaurosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref></sup> through to use of &#x0201c;oncolytic&#x0201d; viruses for experimental treatment of advanced cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref></sup> These agents promise versatile treatment innovations; however, given the species-specific defenses observed here for Ad5, it seems wise that clinical translation of therapeutic viruses should maximize the use of human cells and tissues to predict clinical activity and toxicity, and not rely too heavily on preclinical animal models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Figures]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="blood-2008-09-178459_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="blood-2008-09-178459_FigureS01.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="blood-2008-09-178459_FigureS02.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="blood-2008-09-178459_FigureS03.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="blood-2008-09-178459_FigureS04.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="blood-2008-09-178459_FigureS05.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="blood-2008-09-178459_FigureS06.jpg"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="PMC_2" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Additional Supplemental Figures]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="blood-2008-09-178459v2_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="blood-2008-09-178459v2_FigureS07.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="blood-2008-09-178459v2_FigureS08.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="blood-2008-09-178459v2_FigureS09.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="blood-2008-09-178459v2_FigureS10.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="blood-2008-09-178459v2_FigureS11.jpg"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>The online version of this article contains a data supplement.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.
