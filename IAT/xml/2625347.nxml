Together with <italic>Hendra virus </italic>(HeV), they comprise the genus <italic>Henipavirus </italic>in the family <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>. Recombinant expression systems have played a crucial role in studying the cell biology of these Biosafety Level-4 restricted viruses. <italic>Henipavirus </italic>assembly and budding occurs at the plasma membrane, although the details of this process remain poorly understood. Multivesicular body (MVB) proteins have been found to play a role in the budding of several enveloped viruses, including some paramyxoviruses, and the recruitment of MVB proteins by viral proteins possessing late budding domains (L-domains) has become an important concept in the viral budding process. Previously we developed a system for producing NiV virus-like particles (VLPs) and demonstrated that the matrix (M) protein possessed an intrinsic budding ability and played a major role in assembly. Here, we have used this system to further explore the budding process by analyzing elements within the M protein that are critical for particle release.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using rationally targeted site-directed mutagenesis we show that a NiV M sequence YPLGVG is required for M budding and that mutation or deletion of the sequence abrogates budding ability. Replacement of the native and overlapping Ebola VP40 L-domains with the NiV sequence failed to rescue VP40 budding; however, it did induce the cellular morphology of extensive filamentous projection consistent with wild-type VP40-expressing cells. Cells expressing wild-type NiV M also displayed this morphology, which was dependent on the YPLGVG sequence, and deletion of the sequence also resulted in nuclear localization of M. Dominant-negative VPS4 proteins had no effect on NiV M budding, suggesting that unlike other viruses such as Ebola, NiV M accomplishes budding independent of MVB cellular proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data indicate that the YPLGVG motif within the NiV M protein plays an important role in M budding; however, involvement of any specific components of the cellular MVB sorting pathway in henipavirus budding remains to be demonstrated. Further investigation of henipavirus assembly and budding may yet reveal a novel mechanism(s) of viral assembly and release that could be applicable to other enveloped viruses or have therapeutic implications.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p><italic>Nipah virus </italic>(NiV) and <italic>Hendra virus </italic>(HeV) are emerging members of the family <italic>Paramyxoviridae </italic>that are distinguished by their ability to cause fatal disease in both animal and human hosts, and comprise the genus <italic>Henipavirus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. HeV was recognized as a novel paramyxovirus in 1994 during an outbreak in eastern Australia that resulted in the death of one human as a consequence of virus transmission from infected horses. Another person later died from relapsed encephalitis as a result of HeV infection that was identified retrospectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Repeated HeV spillover events have since occurred five times, all involving horses, with the most recent occurrence in July 2008 which also involved two human cases, one of which was fatal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. NiV was identified during an outbreak of severe encephalitis in Malaysia and Singapore that began in 1998 and continued into 1999. In contrast to the HeV outbreak, this NiV episode involved hundreds of people and more than 100 deaths, with pigs serving as the intermediate amplifying host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Since 1998 there have been 9 recognized occurrences of NiV infection of people, primarily in Bangladesh and India with the most recent in March 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The mortality in humans has been higher (~75%) in these spillover events, along with evidence of human-to-human transmission and the apparent lack of an intermediate host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Several species of fruit bats (flying foxes) of the <italic>Pteropus </italic>genus serve as the primary natural reservoirs of HeV and NiV, although to date evidence of henipavirus infection in 5 other bat species across 5 genera has been reported (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]). NiV has been isolated from bat urine and partially eaten fruit, which suggests that it is relatively easy to obtain from the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Indeed, direct transmission of NiV from flying foxes to humans from contaminated food sources has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) have classified HeV and NiV as priority pathogens, and work with live virus requires Biosafety Level-4 (BSL-4) containment.</p><p>Paramyxoviruses are enveloped viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm and contain a genome consisting of single-stranded negative-sense RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The genome contains 6 principle genes: nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), the fusion (F) and attachment (HN, H, or G) proteins, and the polymerase (L), along with accessory proteins that vary according to viral species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The requirement for high containment conditions for working with live HeV or NiV has necessitated the development of recombinant protein expression systems as tools for elucidating details of the henipavirus life cycle. We previously established a virus-like particle (VLP) system in order to study the assembly and budding process of NiV, and determined that the M protein plays a central role in NiV assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We also observed that expression of M alone resulted in the release of VLPs, as was also reported by Ciancanelli and Basler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Other paramyxovirus M proteins with this property include Sendai virus (SeV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], human parainfluenza virus type 1 (hPIV-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In contrast, simian virus 5 (SV5) (parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] requires expression of M along with N and either F or HN to produce VLPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The mechanism(s) that govern the budding of M remain unknown. A current area of interest in enveloped virus assembly and morphogenesis is the contribution of L-domains, which are protein motifs first identified in retroviral Gag precursor molecules that are important for late steps in assembly and budding (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]). L-domains interact with components of cellular machinery involved in multivesicular body (MVB) formation and are thought to commandeer those proteins for use in viral budding. The involvement of L-domains in virus assembly and budding has been extended to other enveloped virus families including arenaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], filoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], rhabdoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and paramyxoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In certain cases, different L-domains can be functionally interchanged or mediate their activity in a position-independent manner within the protein molecule; however, these properties are not universal and it is now apparent that the surrounding regions or context within which the L-domain motif lies can be important for its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. There are several well-characterized examples where the mutation or removal of a viral L-domain motif within, for example, the M protein, will abrogate the protein's ability to bud from expressing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>L-domain amino acid motifs that have been identified (along with the MVB protein each interacts with) include: P(T/S)AP (Tsg101), PPxY (Nedd4-like E3 ubiquitin ligases), YP(x)<sub>n</sub>L (AIP1/Alix), and &#x000d8;PxV (none identified), where x is any amino acid and &#x000d8; is any aromatic amino acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Until the identification of the novel FPIV sequence in SV5 M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], paramyxoviruses were not known to utilize L-domains in their assembly and morphogenesis. However, the M protein of many paramyxoviruses, including NiV and HeV, do not contain any identified L-domains, including the SV5 FPIV motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The MVB protein AIP1/Alix was shown to help facilitate SeV virion and VLP release through interactions with an undetermined sequence in the C protein, as well as through a recently identified YLDL sequence in the M protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]; however, a conflicting study failed to find a role for AIP1/Alix in SeV virion production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Ciancanelli and Basler reported that NiV M contains a sequence, YMYL, that is required for VLP budding and, based on its ability to complement Ebola VP40 VLP formation, suggested that this sequence serves as an L-domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we report the identification of an amino acid sequence motif (YPLGVG) that is required for NiV and HeV M budding, and that appeared to partially complement the native Ebola VP40 phenotype but was VPS4-independent. However, complementation of the Ebola VP40 mutant was observed only in its effects on cellular morphology, characterized by extensive filamentous projections, and not in Ebola VP40 budding. In addition, cells expressing wild-type NiV M were noted to have a cellular morphology similar to that of VP40 expressing cells, and deletion of the YPLGVG sequence resulted in abrogation of this morphology and nuclear localization of M.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Mutation of the YPLGVG motif in NiV matrix abrogates budding</title><p>Most L-domains described to date contain one or more proline residues. Because the NiV M protein does not contain any of the exact known L-domain motifs, we examined the entire M protein sequence for proline residues with surrounding amino acids that we considered to be similar to known L-domains. Following this analysis, we identified 3 sequences of interest with the intent of mutating the proline residues within these putative motifs to alanine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Residue P35 was targeted because it aligned closely to the SV5 FPIV (&#x000d8;PxV) motif, although there were no further sequence similarities. P93 is located in a sequence similar to the YP(x)<sub>n</sub>L motif, and the P329 and P332 residues were targeted because of sequence similarity to the P(T/S)AP motif. It was also noted that P93, P329 and P332 are all well conserved among paramyxovirus M proteins but are absent in SV5 M (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), which further suggested that these proline residues might be part of an L-domain.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Site-directed proline mutagenesis</bold>.

The result of this comparison revealed that each of the mutant M proteins retained budding ability except for the P93A mutant, which exhibited a marked reduction in M protein release (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The P93 residue is part of an amino acid sequence (YPLGVG) that resembles the YP(x)<sub>n</sub>L motif and also contains residues that are well conserved among paramyxovirus M proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). To confirm this observation and further characterize the role of this sequence in M protein release, additional M mutants were constructed: Y92A, L94A, and &#x00394;92&#x02013;97 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), that were then tested in the budding assay. The result of this experiment revealed that none of the additional mutant M proteins, with the exception of the P93A mutant, which sometimes retained a low level of budding activity, were released from expressing cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). All of the mutants were expressed at levels similar to wild-type NiV M, and these findings confirm the importance of this motif. We previously observed that HeV M is also released into the culture supernatant when expressed alone, although less efficiently than NiV M (unpublished observation). To determine whether the conserved YPLGVG sequence is required for HeV M release, we constructed HeV M P93A and &#x00394;92&#x02013;97 mutants and tested them in the budding assay. In contrast to wild-type HeV M, which was released into the supernatant, we did not detect release of the P93A mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). We were unable to detect expression of HeV M &#x00394;92&#x02013;97 (data not shown), possibly due to mis-folding and degradation. These data suggest that the YPLGVG sequence is required for NiV and HeV M budding, and may also play a role in HeV M stability.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>NiV M sequence required for budding and possible late domain element</bold>.

Therefore, we sought to determine whether this newly identified NiV M sequence could impart budding activity within the context of a different viral background. The Ebola VP40 protein contains two overlapping L-domain motifs, the PTAPPEY sequence, and deletion of these L-domains renders the protein defective in release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A VP40 mutant was constructed in which we replaced the native L-domains and flanking residues with the NiV M protein YPLGVG motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), and this mutant was tested for budding activity. The results of this experiment revealed that, although some budding was evident, the NiV M sequence failed to rescue VP40 budding above the basal level observed for the VP40 deletion mutant (data not shown). However, immunofluorescent confocal microscopy revealed that cells expressing VP40-NiV that contained the YPLGVG motif had a similar morphology to those expressing wild-type VP40, which was characterized by extensive filamentous projections that were frequently branching and fragmented (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Martin-Serrano and co-workers, as well as others, previously observed this phenotype in cells expressing VP40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. This cellular morphology was not observed when the native overlapping L-domains were deleted from VP40 (VP40 &#x00394;PT/PY) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). However, cells expressing wild-type NiV M showed a filamentous phenotype similar to those expressing VP40 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In contrast, the NiV M &#x00394;92&#x02013;97 mutant, that was totally defective in budding, had an absence of the filamentous structures and appeared to localize at the nucleus. Cells expressing NiV M P93A displayed a somewhat intermediate phenotype with less pronounced filamentous structures and this phenotype also corresponded to the partial budding-defective phenotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Together, these results support the hypothesis that the NiV M-YPLGVG amino acid motif plays an important role in NiV M budding, and that it acts through a mechanism that is, in part, transferable to other viruses.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>NiV sequence can rescue Ebola VP40-induced cellular morphology</bold>.

A powerful technique that has helped facilitate the demonstration of these relationships has been the use of dominant-negative mutant versions of one or more of the protein components of the MVB complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Dominant-negative (DN) mutants of the paralogous MVB proteins VPS4A and VPS4B have been shown to impair release of most viruses that use L-domains to accomplish budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. To determine whether VPS4A has a functional role in NiV M VLP egress, we evaluated NiV M release in the presence of VPS4A-E228Q, a DN VPS4A mutant. SV5 VLP release, which is significantly reduced in the presence of DN VPS4A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], was evaluated in parallel as a control. Cells were transfected with expression plasmids for SV5 proteins (M, N, F, and HN) or NiV M, along with 100 ng (per well) of plasmid containing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) fused to either wild-type or DN VPS4A. The quantities of the SV5 plasmids used were as described by Schmitt and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] (N: 50 ng; M: 0.4 &#x003bc;g; F: 0.75 &#x003bc;g; HN: 0.75 &#x003bc;g), and 0.4 &#x003bc;g (per well) of NiV M was used along with empty vector for equivalent total DNA. Culture supernatants were clarified, and VLPs were centrifuged through a 10% sucrose cushion. Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analysis of the pellet revealed that SV5 VLPs (as indicated by M detection) were released in the presence of wild-type VPS4A, but not in the presence of DN VPS4A, as expected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). In contrast, DN VPS4A had no effect on NiV M release (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The difference observed between SV5 and NiV M release was not due to unequal VPS4A expression, which was equivalent in each group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). NiV M release was similarly unaffected in the presence of DN VPS4B or both DN VPS4A and DN VPS4B (data not shown). These results suggest that NiV M VLP formation is not dependent on functional VPS4 proteins.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>NiV M release is insensitive to VPS4A inhibition</bold>.

In the present study we sought to characterize the NiV M protein further and explore whether NiV M possessed a classic L-domain motif that was required for efficient budding. Noting that all well-defined L-domains contain at least one proline residue, we initiated a mutagenesis strategy whereby individual proline residues in NiV M were mutated to alanine. We identified 3 sequences (4 proline residues, total) of interest because of their similarity to known L-domain motifs, or close alignment to the SV5 FPIV motif. Using this mutagenesis approach coupled with our NiV VLP budding assay, we identified one particular M mutant (P93A) that was defective in budding. To confirm this observation and further characterize the surrounding amino acids, we targeted the YPLGVG sequence within the M protein and additional alanine mutants were made (Y92A and L94A), as well as a deletion mutant (&#x00394;92&#x02013;97), which were then tested for budding ability. Whereas a low level of P93A release could sometimes be detected, we found the other YPLGVG mutants were completely defective in budding. This sequence motif is conserved in HeV and a P93A mutation in HeV M resulted in diminished budding ability.</p><p>To determine whether this sequence has transferable activity, the L-domain motifs and flanking residues of Ebola VP40 were replaced with the YPLGVG motif along with the appropriate NiV M flanking amino acids. Although budding of the VP40-NiV M recombinant containing the YPLGVG motif was not significantly restored, staining with anti-VP40 mAb and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that cells expressing the VP40-NiV M recombinant containing YPLGVG displayed a morphology consistent with those expressing wild-type VP40 that was characterized by fragmented and branching filamentous structures. Similar morphology was observed for cells expressing wild-type NiV M, whereas mutation or deletion of the YPLGVG motif resulted in either less pronounced or an absence of the filamentous structures accompanied by nuclear localization of the mutant M protein. These data suggest that the YPLGVG sequence motif is important for proper NiV M cellular location and budding and can partially substitute for the native VP40 L-domain sequence. VPS4A and VPS4B are paralogous ATPases that are responsible for disassembly of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) complexes involved in MVB formation, and mutations that destroy their ability to bind or hydrolyze ATP result in the ability to dominantly inhibit cellular VPS4A or VPS4B. These DN mutants inhibited the budding and release of most viruses that use L-domains and are thought to provide a method of global inhibition of class E Vps proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Notably, we found that NiV M budding and release was unchanged in the presence of DN VPS4A, while in parallel, SV5 VLP release was greatly reduced, in agreement with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, NiV M protein release was also unchanged in the presence of DN VPS4B, or in the presence of both DN VPS4A and DN VPS4B, thus eliminating the possibility that NiV M protein release was accomplished by VPS4B or that the wild-type cellular paralogs were rescuing release. We also observed that NiV M release is relatively insensitive to proteasome inhibition and unaffected by AIP1/Alix over-expression (data not shown), further suggesting that NiV M budding is independent of MVB components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>We took note of the YPLGVG sequence motif because of its similarity to the known L-domain YP(x)<sub>n</sub>L. This motif was first discovered in the Gag p9 protein of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) as YPDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and then later identified in the p6 domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag protein (YPLTSL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Initial characterization of this motif in EIAV determined that the Y, P, and L residues were critical for virus particle budding; however, the motif was designated YxxL because of the similarity to the YxxL endocytosis motif, and it was hypothesized that the EIAV motif interacted with cellular endocytosis machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. However, it appears that AIP1/Alix is the primary protein that interacts with this L-domain, and the EIAV motif is now usually designated as YP(x)<sub>n</sub>L or YPxL because the proline residue is critical for AIP1/Alix binding and virus particle budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Both HIV-1 and EIAV Gag proteins contain a sequence just downstream of the YP(x)<sub>n</sub>L motif that is also important for AIP1/Alix binding, and it has been suggested that the two motifs are actually a single motif that can be summarized as (L) [F/Y]Px<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>LXX [I/L] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>Using the YxxL designation as a guide, Ciancanelli and Basler identified 62-YMYL-65 as a sequence important for NiV M budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Their study found that alanine mutation of Y62, Y62 and L65, or deletion of the whole sequence resulted in defective M protein budding, with deletion mutants exhibiting nuclear localization. They also established the functional rescue of L-domain-mutant VP40 budding by appending the YMYL sequence motif, with flanking elements to the C-terminus of VP40. We attempted to use this observation as a control for our experiments here by directly replacing the native VP40 L-domain with the identical NiV sequence used in that study, as we did with the present YPLGVG motif, rather than appending it to the C-terminus. However, this construct was also unable to restore budding of the L-domain-mutant VP40 (data not shown). The reason for the difference is not known; however, L-domains can be context-dependent, which may account for our differing result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Interestingly, the equivalent sequence in HeV M is YMYM, and mutation of the NiV YMYL to the HeV sequence does not appear to adversely affect NiV M release (data not shown).</p><p>Based on their observation of nuclear localization of NiV M YMYL mutant, Ciancanelli and Basler speculated that NiV M contains competing trafficking signals, and that disruption of targeting to the plasma membrane resulted in the redirection of the protein to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Indeed, our observation of nuclear localization of the NiV M YPLGVG motif deletion mutant used here would be in agreement with this hypothesis, and we speculate that both sequences interact with one or more proteins in a common pathway, resulting in proper targeting of M. However, the mechanistic roles of either of these sequences in henipavirus budding remain to be clarified.</p><p>L-domains and their interactions with cellular MVB machinery, most likely represent a subset of protein domains involved in virus budding. An early observation made regarding Gag truncation mutants of HIV-1, which did not express the L-domain-containing p6 protein, was the apparent tethering of budding virions to the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. This phenotype appears to represent a defect in the final step of virus-cell separation and suggests that mechanisms other than those underlying L-domain function also play an important role in HIV-1 budding. In addition, deletion of the Ebola virus overlapping L-domains in VP40 results in a modest defect in replication competent virus production and suggests that mechanisms independent of MVB machinery may play a dominant role in Ebola virus budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The NiV YPLGVG sequence motif may facilitate budding of NiV M via interactions with non-MVB-associated cellular proteins, which enable the associated cellular morphology characterized by extensive filamentous projections that is also seen with VP40, by this alternative mechanism. The observation that NiV M release is insensitive to DN VPS4 proteins and proteasome inhibition lends some support to this interpretation. However, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been reported to be insensitive to DN VPS4A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], and EIAV is insensitive to proteasome inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Thus, insensitivity to DN VPS4 proteins and proteasome inhibitors may not be sufficient grounds to rule out L-domain activity. Further, it also remains a formal possibility that the NiV M protein YPLGVG sequence motif failed to rescue VP40 budding while restoring the filamentous cellular morphology because of the context of the flanking amino acids rather than a lack of intrinsic L-domain function.</p><p>Although studies with SeV have yielded conflicting results, Gosselin-Grenet and co-workers failed to find a reduction in SeV virion production in the presence of DN VPS4A or during suppression of AIP1/Alix expression. These results suggest that SeV budding also occurs independent of cellular MVB proteins, and are in agreement with the present observations on NiV M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Chen and Lamb highlighted the reported VPS4 independence of VSV, SeV, and influenza virus and suggested that additional VPS4-independent viruses will serve as tools in uncovering the details of these additional mechanisms of virus budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], and our results suggest that NiV may also be a useful system to explore such alternative mechanisms. Further characterization of the YPLGVG sequence and whether there are any interactions with MVB cellular components in the context of both VLPs and live virus will be needed to definitively establish whether this element possesses classical L-domain activity or functions through some alternative mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using a recombinant expression system the budding process of the NiV M protein was examined and the amino acid motif YPLGVG within the M protein was found to be essential for M budding. Mutation or deletion of the YPLGVG motif also resulted in nuclear localization of NiV M. The transfer of the YPLGVG motif to an Ebola virus VP40 L-domain mutant did not restore its budding efficiency to wild type levels, but did restore the branched filamentous cell morphology characteristic of VP40 expressing cells. NiV M expression also resulted in the branched filamentous cell morphology, and YPLGVG motif NiV M mutant did not. Unlike classic L-domain containing proteins, we found no evidence of a role for MVB proteins in henipavirus budding. The data here suggest that whatever the specific role of the YPLGVG sequence has in NiV budding it appears distinct from the similar YP(x)<sub>n</sub>L sequence motif represented by EIAV. Further investigation of henipavirus assembly and budding may reveal a new mechanism of viral assembly and release that could be applicable to other enveloped viruses or have therapeutic implications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Quality Biologicals, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Quality Biologicals, Gaithersburg, MD) (DMEM-10).
