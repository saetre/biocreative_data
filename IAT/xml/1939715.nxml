Prolactin receptor exists as two isoforms: long and short, which activate different transduction pathways including the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PKC-signaling. No information exists on the role of prolactin in the regulation of the growth of female cholangiocytes. The rationale for using cholangiocytes from female rats is based on the fact that women are preferentially affected by specific cholangiopathies including primary biliary cirrhosis. We propose to evaluate the role and mechanisms of action by which prolactin regulates the growth of female cholangiocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Normal cholangiocytes express both isoforms (long and short) of prolactin receptors, whose expression increased following BDL. The administration of prolactin to normal female rats increased cholangiocyte proliferation. In purified normal female cholangiocytes, prolactin stimulated cholangiocyte proliferation, which was associated with increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>levels and PKC&#x003b2;-I phosphorylation but decreased PKC&#x003b1; phosphorylation. Administration of an anti-prolactin antibody to BDL female rats decreased cholangiocyte proliferation. Normal female cholangiocytes express and secrete prolactin, which was increased in BDL rats. The data show that prolactin stimulates normal cholangiocyte growth by an autocrine mechanism involving phosphorylation of PKC&#x003b2;-I and dephosphorylation of PKC&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We suggest that in female rats: (i) prolactin has a trophic effect on the growth of normal cholangiocytes by phosphorylation of PKC&#x003b2;-I and dephosphorylation of PKC&#x003b1;; and (iii) cholangiocytes express and secrete prolactin, which by an autocrine mechanism participate in regulation of cholangiocyte proliferation. Prolactin may be an important therapeutic approach for the management of cholangiopathies affecting female patients.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cholangiocytes have a low replicative activity in the normal state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], but they proliferate or undergo apoptosis in cholangiopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], progressive liver disorders characterized by an abnormal balance between cholangiocyte proliferation and death, leading to vanishing of intrahepatic bile ducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that sex hormones play a role in the pathogenesis of some cholangiopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In particular, the most common of them, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), is more common in women, and its clinical outbreak is typically after menopause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The low expression of estrogen receptor alpha in PBC and their disappearance in the advanced histological stages of this disease suggests that an estrogenic deficiency could favor the evolution of PBC toward ductopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, a study demonstrated that: (i) ovariectomy to BDL female rats induced a decrease in intrahepatic ductal mass; and (ii) administration of 17-&#x003b2; estradiol during BDL to ovariectomized rats prevented the decrease in the number of bile ducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Prolactin is a pituitary hormone and a pleiotropic cytokine that promotes cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival in a number of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Two different isoforms of the prolactin receptor exist: they are both encoded by a single gene, by which the two isoforms (a short and a long form) are obtained by alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The long and short forms are both membrane bound receptors with an identical binding site for prolactin, but differ in the length of their cytoplasmic tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Prolactin binding to the long or short form of prolactin receptors activates different signaling pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], JAK/STAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. While long prolactin receptors activate several signaling pathways including JAK/STAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the short isoform of prolactin receptor activates various kinases and interacts with 17-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The long form of the prolactin receptor mediates activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PKC signaling in a number of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Although studies have shown differences in the expression of prolactin receptors between hepatocytes and cholangiocytes of normal and cholestatic livers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], no information exists on the role of prolactin on the regulation of cholangiocyte growth. The rationale for using cholangiocytes from female rats is based on the fact that women are preferentially affected by specific cholestatic liver diseases including PBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

(ii) Does <italic>in vivo </italic>administration of prolactin to normal female and male rats increase cholangiocyte proliferation? (iii) Are prolactin effects on normal cholangiocyte proliferation of female rats associated with increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) levels and differential phosphorylation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PKC isoforms (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-I, &#x003b2;-II and &#x003b3;, which are important in the regulation of biliary functions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]?

We first demonstrated in liver sections that cholangiocytes from normal and BDL female and male rats express prolactin receptors. By real time PCR: (i) normal female cholangiocytes expressed both the short and long form of prolactin receptor mRNA; and (ii) following BDL, the expression of the short and long form of prolactin receptors increased in female cholangiocytes. Our data on cholangiocyte prolactin receptor expression are slightly different to those of previous studies in albino mongrel rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] showing that: (i) normal isolated intrahepatic bile duct units (IBDU) predominantly express the message for the long form of the prolactin receptor, whereas the expression of the short form of the prolactin receptor is very low or absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; and (ii) following BDL, the genetic expression of the long form markedly increases in IBDU whereas the short form of prolactin receptor slightly increased in IBDU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The slight difference between these data is presumably due to the different strain of rats used in our studies (female 344 Fischer) and the other studies (albino mongrel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Prolactin receptors are expressed by rat hepatocytes in the sinusoidal domain of cellular membranes and in perinuclear areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Prolactin receptors are also expressed by human hepatocytes of patients with obstructive jaundice of different etiology, but prolactin receptor expression is lower in hepatocytes compared to human cholangiocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although these previous studies have shown that cholangiocytes express prolactin receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], no information exists on the role of prolactin in the regulation of cholangiocyte hyperplasia.</p><p>We next performed <italic>in vivo </italic>studies and demonstrated that the administration of: (i) prolactin to normal female rats induces cholangiocyte hyperplasia devoid of portal inflammation and hepatic damage; and (ii) anti-prolactin antibody to BDL female rats decreases cholangiocyte proliferation and ameliorates portal inflammation and hepatic damage. The most likely explanation why prolactin increased cholangiocyte growth but not portal inflammation and hepatic damage in normal rats is that prolactin induces cholangiocyte hyperplasia as a direct effect and not as a consequence of obstructive cholestasis (i.e., BDL), a pathological condition associated with increased portal inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In support of our findings, a number of studies have shown that certain bile acids, vascular endothelial growth factor and forskolin induce cholangiocyte hyperplasia devoid of apoptosis, necrosis, hepatic damage or portal inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, in BDL, which is accompanied by an inflammatory response along with cholestasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], the blocking of prolactin with an antibody reduces hepatic damage and cholangiocyte proliferation along with suppression of some inflammatory responses.</p><p>Concomitant with enhanced ductal hyperplasia, there was increased prolactin serum levels in normal female rats treated with prolactin compared to NaCl treated rats. In BDL female rats, the serum levels of prolactin increased approximately 15-fold as compared to the levels of normal female rats. Moreover, the administration of anti-prolactin antibody to BDL rats reduces not only cholangiocyte proliferation but also prolactin serum levels. We suggest that changes in prolactin serum levels may be important in the regulation of cholangiocyte growth in chronic cholestatic liver diseases.</p><p>In different cell types, prolactin effects are mediated by an increase in Ca<sup>2+ </sup>levels and PKC activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Thus, we evaluated the role of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKC signaling pathway in prolactin regulation of cholangiocyte hyperplasia. Our results show that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>levels are increased in normal female cholangiocytes after <italic>in vitro </italic>prolactin stimulation as compared to cholangiocytes stimulated with BSA. From our previous experience with purified cholangiocytes and cholangiocarcinoma cell lines we do not expect a traditional calcium spike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], we demonstrated that the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>dynamics of cholangiocytes are in general slower and not characterized by a Ca<sup>2+ </sup>spike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The method that we currently employ results in Ca<sup>2+ </sup>measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], which are an average signal of 400,000 cells rather than typical single cell measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. This approach gives us similar data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] to that obtained with measurements, which were made in single cells loaded with Fluo-3AM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Since the measurements are taken in a large number of cells the cellular response to prolactin is not synchronized in the studies. Thus, any peak(s) present will be muted and spread out over time, which is a factor contributing to the slow drift observed. In support of our finding, Ducret <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated a similar slow response calcium wave due to prolactin in glia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>We next evaluated if prolactin stimulation of cholangiocyte proliferation was coupled with phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of specific Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PKC isoforms. Our finding that prolactin stimulation of normal female cholangiocyte proliferation is associated with concomitant increased (PKC&#x003b2;-I) and decreased (PKC&#x003b1;) PKC phosphorylation suggests that a counterbalancing system between PCK&#x003b2; isoform and PKC&#x003b1; may regulate cholangiocyte proliferation following prolactin stimulation. In support of this concept, while enhanced phosphorylation of PKC&#x003b2;-II mediates the activation of secretin-stimulated ductal secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] (a functional marker of cholangiocyte growth) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] of BDL rats, increased phosphorylation of PKC&#x003b1; (which is inversely related to cholangiocyte growth) is associated with reduced cholangiocyte growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In agreement with the view, in hematopoietic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] cells, the activation of PKC&#x003b2;-I and &#x003b2; II isoforms leads to an increase in cell proliferation. Furthermore, in intestinal cell lines the overexpression and/or activation of PKC&#x003b1; decreases cell growth and tumorigenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Taken together, our studies show that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKC&#x003b2;-I and &#x003b1; signaling pathway is one of the players involved in prolactin regulation of cholangiocyte proliferation, but did not evaluate if other pathways (e.g., JAK/STAT and 17-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase) modulate prolactin effects on cholangiocyte growth. Also, our studies do not establish which isoform (short or long) of the prolactin receptor mediates the effects of prolactin on cholangiocyte growth. However, based upon previous studies showing that the long form of prolactin receptor mediates increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>in other cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], we propose that the long form of the prolactin receptor may be the major player in prolactin modulation of cholangiocyte growth.</p><p>Next, we demonstrated that normal and BDL female cholangiocytes express the message and protein for prolactin and secrete prolactin in primary cultures. The reason why prolactin secretion is similar in normal and BDL female cholangiocytes (although prolactin message expression increases in BDL cholangiocytes) may be due to post-transcriptional events (e.g., message stability/degradation) affecting the translation of the prolactin message. On the basis of these findings, although our studies do not provide direct evidence for the following concept, we propose that prolactin may regulate cholangiocyte proliferation by an autocrine mechanism (in addition to a paracrine pathway). In agreement with the latter concept, a number of cells including mammary epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] secrete prolactin, thus regulating their functions. Furthermore, in support of the concept that prolactin regulates cholangiocyte proliferation by an autocrine mechanism, we have previously shown that cholangiocytes express/secrete neurotrophins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], vascular endothelial growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and serotonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], thus regulating intrahepatic ductal mass by an autocrine mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary this study has shown that: (i) cholangiocytes express both isoforms (long and short) of the receptor for prolactin; (ii) prolactin has a trophic effect on the growth of normal female cholangiocytes by phosphorylation of PKC&#x003b2;-I and dephosphorylation of PKC&#x003b1;; and (iii) cholangiocytes express the message/protein for and secrete prolactin, findings suggesting that prolactin participates, by an autocrine mechanism, in the modulation of cholangiocyte proliferation.

Following purification, cholangiocytes were incubated for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C to regenerate membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] damaged by proteolytic enzymes during isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] prior to loading with Fluo-3AM before [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>measurements. A number of studies have demonstrated that following the incubation time of 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C cholangiocytes are functionally responsive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>fluorescence measurements in cholangiocytes were performed using fluo-3 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) and a Fluoroskan Ascent FL (ThermoLabsystems, Helsinki, Finland) microplate reader equipped with three injectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Cholangiocytes (4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>per well) were loaded for 1 hour at room temperature with 5 &#x003bc;M of fluo-3 AM in Tyrode's salt solution (TSS, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 12 mM NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>and 5.5 mM glucose) with O.1% Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon). After washes with TSS, the loaded cells were added to a 96 well black microplate. The baseline fluorescence was measured 50 times after 1 second at 2-second intervals. TSS alone or prolactin (100 nM) dissolved in buffer was injected sequentially into separate wells, and the fluorescence intensity was measured at 538 nm for 3 minutes at 1-second intervals. The excitation wavelength was 485 nm. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>concentration was calculated as follows: [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>= K<sub>d</sub>(F-F<sub>min</sub>)/(F<sub>max</sub>-F). F<sub>max </sub>refers to fluorescence intensity measured after permeabilization of the cells with 1% NP-40. Then, 0.1 M EGTA was added to chelate Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and minimum fluorescence intensity (F<sub>min</sub>) was obtained. Ionomycin (10 &#x003bc;M) was utilized at the end of each calcium determination to ensure cholangiocyte responsiveness.</p><p>Purified normal female cholangiocytes were stimulated for 90 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] at 37&#x000b0;C with 0.2% BSA (basal) or prolactin (100 nM) with 0.2% BSA, and analyzed for protein expression of the phosphorylated form (expressed as ratio to total protein expression of the corresponding PKC isoform) of the selected PKC isoform by immunoblots.
