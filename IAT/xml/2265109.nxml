The MDM2&#x02013;p53 interaction is well characterized, but the mechanisms that regulate the interaction are not well understood. Here, we show that PA28&#x003b3;, a proteasome activator that inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell cycle progression through unknown mechanisms, exerts an effect as a cofactor in the MDM2&#x02013;p53 interaction. The polymer form of PA28&#x003b3; interacts with both MDM2 and p53 proteins and facilitates their physical interaction. This promotes ubiquitination- and MDM2-dependent proteasomal degradation of p53, limiting its accumulation and resulting in inhibited apoptosis after DNA damage. Elimination of endogenous PA28&#x003b3; in human cancer cells abrogates MDM2-mediated p53 degradation, increases the activity of p53, and enhances apoptosis. These findings reveal the mechanism by which PA28&#x003b3; affects apoptosis and proliferation. Manipulation of the level of PA28&#x003b3;, an approach that would regulate the cellular content of p53, may improve the efficacy of current cancer therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>MDM2</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>PA28&#x003b3;</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumor suppressor p53 is involved in controlling cell growth and differentiation and in the maintenance of genomic integrity, with high levels of p53 activity inducing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, or senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Lane, 1992</xref>). The regulation of p53 protein expression and activity in cells is of particular interest in the field of cancer research, both for the development of more effective therapeutic strategies and for ongoing efforts to gain a better understanding of tumorigenesis. The level of p53 protein is elevated upon exposure of cells to stress, such as DNA damage, hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, or oncogene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Levine, 1997</xref>). In unstressed cells, the level of p53 (hence its activity) is largely controlled by MDM2, an oncoprotein containing an ubiquitin E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Haupt <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Brooks and Gu, 2006</xref>).

It was suggested that a cofactor may be required for MDM2-mediated p53 degradation because low levels of MDM2 fail to catalyse polyubiquitination of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>PA28&#x003b3; (REG&#x003b3;, PSME3, Ki antigen) belongs to a family of activators of the 20S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Rechsteiner and Hill, 2005</xref>). Unlike its family members, PA28&#x003b1; and PA28&#x003b2;, PA28&#x003b3; is localized within the nucleus and forms a homoheptamer (rather than a heterocomplex). PA28&#x003b3; has been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis, and embryonic fibroblasts of PA28&#x003b3; nullizygous mice demonstrate spontaneous apoptosis and G1 arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Rechsteiner and Hill, 2005</xref>). These mice also have a reduced adult body mass and show growth retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Rechsteiner and Hill, 2005</xref>). The mechanism by which PA28&#x003b3; exerts these effects has not been elucidated. These findings prompted us to explore the possibility that PA28&#x003b3; may regulate p53. Here, we report that PA28&#x003b3; has an integral function in the degradation of p53, and that it does so by acting as an essential cofactor that promotes the binding of MDM2 and p53.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>PA28&#x003b3; negatively regulates p53</title><p>Overexpression of PA28&#x003b3;, but not PA28&#x003b2;, reduced the level of p53 protein and its transactivational activity (measured by p21<sup>Waf1</sup> protein) in LNCaP, MCF-7, and U2OS cells (p53 wild type), but not in PC3 cells (p53 null) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). Knockdown of endogenous PA28&#x003b3; using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) pool (Dharmacon) increased the levels of endogenous p53 and p21<sup>Waf1</sup> in LNCaP, HCT116, A549, MCF-7, and MCF10A (a normal breast epithelial line) cells, but not PC3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1B&#x02013;D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).

Furthermore, an increase in p21<sup>Waf1</sup> mRNA after PA28&#x003b3; knockdown by siRNA was observed in HCT116 cells, but not in p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). At the post-translational level, the extent of the induction of p21<sup>Waf1</sup> in p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> HCT116 cells was much less than in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggest that the induction of p21<sup>Waf1</sup> after PA28&#x003b3; knockdown occurs largely through p53. However, modulation of p21<sup>Waf1</sup> directly by PA28&#x003b3; at the post-translational level is also possible.</p><p>Two individual PA28&#x003b3; siRNA duplexes and one control siRNA duplex were randomly selected from the previous siRNA pools to confirm that PA28&#x003b3; negatively regulates p53. Each of the PA28&#x003b3; siRNA duplexes was capable of downregulating endogenous PA28&#x003b3;, resulting in dose-dependent accumulation of p53 in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1E</xref>, left panel). In contrast, randomly selected PA28&#x003b2; siRNA duplexes from the PA28&#x003b2; siRNA pool (Dharmacon) did not affect the level of p53, although endogenous PA28&#x003b2; was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1E</xref>, right panel). Additionally, p53 was elevated in PA28&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (with low passage numbers) compared with wild-type MEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref>).

In HCT116 cells, knockdown of PA28&#x003b3; led to induction of p53 at the protein level and increases in p21<sup>Waf1</sup>, Puma, and 14-3-3&#x003c3; at both the mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1I</xref>). Similar results were obtained in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Overexpression of PA28&#x003b3;, but not PA28&#x003b2;, in MCF-7 cells co-transfected with a luciferase reporter under the control of the p21<sup>Waf1</sup> promoter, inhibited p53-dependent transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1J</xref>, left panel).

The 20S proteasome alone did not degrade ubiquitinated p53, and PA28&#x003b3; did not activate the 20S proteasome to degrade ubiquitinated p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>, upper panel). Although the 26S proteasome degraded ubiquitinated p53, PA28&#x003b3; did not enhance this activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>, lower panel). In contrast, PA28&#x003b3; enhanced the degradation of p21<sup>Waf1</sup> by the 20S proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PA28&#x003b3; is a cofactor for MDM2-mediated p53 degradation</title><p>The PA28&#x003b3; protein does not have a motif characteristic of an ubiquitin E3 ligase, suggesting that PA28&#x003b3; may promote the ubiquitinating activity of another molecule. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether PA28&#x003b3; promotes MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Co-transfection of low amounts of MDM2 and PA28&#x003b3; into MCF-7 cells enhanced the downregulation of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Although low amounts of PA28&#x003b3; or MDM2 transfected alone into LNCaP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>) or A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>) minimally induced p53 ubiquitination, co-transfection with both PA28&#x003b3; and MDM2 enhanced its ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3B and C</xref>). The possibility that the enhanced ubiquitination was a result of changes in the pool of cellular-free ubiquitin, E1 or E2 was excluded using purified recombinant proteins in <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assays. Incubation of a lower amount of MDM2 protein with purified p53 protein, along with purified E1, E2 and ubiquitin <italic>in vitro</italic>, resulted in minimal ubiquitination of the p53 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). When recombinant PA28&#x003b3; was included in the reaction, the ubiquitination of p53 was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>Exposure to a high concentration of Nutlin-3 (10 &#x003bc;M), a known inhibitor of the MDM2&#x02013;p53 interaction, 12 hours after transfection of MCF-7 cells with PA28&#x003b3; reversed the effects of PA28&#x003b3; on p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>). Exposure of LNCaP cells to an anti-MDM2 antisense oligonucleotide (AS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), but not its mismatch control (ASM), prevented the induction of p53 degradation by PA28&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>). Co-transfection of U2OS cells with MDM2 ASM or AS and various amounts of PA28&#x003b3; further indicated that the PA28&#x003b3;-mediated reduction in the p53 level is dependent on the presence of MDM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3G</xref>). When PA28&#x003b3; was knocked down in A549 cells by siRNA prior to transfection with MDM2, the downregulatory effect of MDM2 on p53 was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p><p>The kinetics of the changes in expression and transactivational activity of p53 after &#x003b3;-irradiation were compared in A549 cells overexpressing either MDM2 or PA28&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3I</xref>). Both MDM2 and PA28&#x003b3; limited the accumulation of p53 and the elevation of p53 activity (manifested by the level of p21<sup>Waf1</sup>) with similar kinetics after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3I</xref>), indicating that they work via the same pathway. When PA28&#x003b3; was pre-knocked down by siRNA, neither a low concentration of Nutlin-3 (3 &#x003bc;M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3J</xref>) nor overexpressed p14<sup>Arf</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3K</xref>) led to modulation of the level of p53. This is likely due to the fact that the MDM2&#x02013;p53 interaction (the target of both Nutlin-3 and p14<sup>Arf</sup>) is disrupted by the absence of PA28&#x003b3;. Another cofactor for the MDM2&#x02013;p53 interaction, Daxx, also lost its capacity to downregulate p53 in the absence of PA28&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3L</xref>). In contrast, YY1 retained its capacity for downregulating p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3M</xref>), indicating that the mechanism by which YY1 enhances the MDM2&#x02013;p53 interaction is different from that of PA28&#x003b3;.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PA28&#x003b3; binds to MDM2 and p53, and promotes the MDM2&#x02013;p53 interaction</title><p>The stability of MDM2 did not change in PC3 cells transfected with either PA28&#x003b3; or the control vector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>), suggesting that it is unlikely that PA28&#x003b3; modulates the level of p53 by inhibiting the capacity of MDM2 to catalyse self-ubiquitination.

Confirmation of these direct interactions was obtained by use of pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>), and immunoprecipitation with overexpressed PA28&#x003b3;-GFP and p53-HA (haemagglutinin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>, upper panel) and PA28&#x003b3;-GFP and MDM2-T7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>, lower panel) in COS7 cells.</p><p>To determine if PA28&#x003b3; promotes the MDM2&#x02013;p53 interaction, lysates from U2OS cells overexpressing different amounts of PA28&#x003b3; were immunoprecipitated with p53 antibody, and it was observed that the MDM2 level was higher in the p53 immunoprecipitates from cells that were transfected with PA28&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>, left panel). Moreover, the amount of MDM2 in p53 immunoprecipitates from A549 cells treated with the PA28&#x003b3; siRNA pool was lower than that from cells treated with the control siRNA pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>, right panel).

Moreover, GFP-PA28&#x003b3; barely appeared in the fractions with molecular weights less than 232 kDa, suggesting that GFP-PA28&#x003b3; primarily exists in the polymer form in cells.

The tested cancer cell lines included: A549 (wt p53); a pair of MCF-7 cell lines (one with wt p53 (p53<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>) and one nullizygous for p53 (p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) by stable knockdown of p53 by siRNA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>); a pair of HCT116 cell lines (one with wt p53 (p53<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>) and one nullizygous for p53 (p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) by deletion of p53 through homologous recombination); and PC3 cells (p53 null). Knockdown of PA28&#x003b3; resulted in a reduction in the survival of A549, MCF-7 (p53<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>), and HCT116 (p53<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>) and in higher numbers of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). In contrast, there were no effects on the survival or apoptosis of MCF-7 p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, HCT116 p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, or PC3 (p53<sup>null</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figures 6A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, &#x003b3;-irradiation-induced accumulation of p53 was reduced by overexpression of PA28&#x003b3; in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>), and overexpressed PA28&#x003b3; stabilized the MDM2&#x02013;p53 interaction in the presence of &#x003b3;-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D</xref>). The extent of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells with overexpressed PA28&#x003b3; was also lower than in control cells following &#x003b3;-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6E</xref>), and knockdown of p53 in HCT116 cells inhibited the radiosensitizing effect of PA28&#x003b3; siRNA on cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>MDM2 is considered a target for human cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Bond <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Poyurovsky and Prives, 2006</xref>). Several experimental therapeutic molecules, including a specific anti-MDM2 antisense oligonucleotide (AS), have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">2005</xref>). However, the response of p53 to inhibition of MDM2 by AS varies in different cell lines. These differences might reflect variations in the basal levels of endogenous PA28&#x003b3;. Analysis of the basal expression of PA28&#x003b3; in six cancer cell lines with wild-type p53 demonstrated that U2OS cells had the lowest level of PA28&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6G</xref>). Interestingly, MDM2 inhibition in U2OS cells did not result in any appreciable enhancement of the level of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6H</xref>). In contrast, p53 accumulated following inhibition of MDM2 in the other cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6H</xref>).</p><p>To examine whether downregulation of PA28&#x003b3; enhances the effects of MDM2 inhibition in cancer cells with a high level of PA28&#x003b3;, HCT116 and A549 cells were exposed to a combination of Nutlin-3 (3 &#x003bc;M) and PA28&#x003b3; siRNA. The combination led to a synergistic upregulation of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6I</xref>), inhibited survival, and enhanced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6J</xref>). This suggests a new strategy for sensitizing human cancers to MDM2 inhibitors.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The role of MDM2 in regulating p53 is supported by transgenic animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Jones <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Montes de Oca Luna <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). Several regulators of the MDM2&#x02013;p53 interaction have been identified, including p14<sup>Arf</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Pomerantz <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 1998a</xref>), YY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Sui <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), MDMX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Francoz <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), gankyrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Higashitsuji <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), L11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Lohrum <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), and Daxx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Tang <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). This large number of regulatory molecules indicates the complexity of the MDM2&#x02013;p53 interaction. The pattern of p53 degradation depends on the cellular level of MDM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Further, in different human cancer cell lines, the extent of p53 accumulation varies even when a similar level of MDM2 inhibition has been achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). The identification of PA28&#x003b3; as a cofactor for the degradation of p53 suggests a new model for p53 degradation, in which PA28&#x003b3; regulates the MDM2&#x02013;p53 interaction and MDM2-dependent degradation. Without PA28&#x003b3;, MDM2 induces p53 monoubiquitination and nuclear export; subsequent polyubiquitination is catalysed by cytoplasmic factors. When PA28&#x003b3; is present, p53 is efficiently polyubiquitinated by low levels of MDM2 within the nucleus, and the p53 level remains under stringent control by MDM2. This could provide advantages to cells in that it would circumvent the need for elevated levels of MDM2 and the need for nucleus-to-cytoplasm transport.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that MDM2 can form polymers to increase the local concentrations of components of the ubiquitination reaction and provide a binding surface for multiple E2s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Poyurovsky <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). We have observed by FPLC analysis that in lysates of GFP-PA28&#x003b3;-transfected cells, a portion of MDM2 appeared with GFP-PA28&#x003b3; and p53 in the fractions with molecular weights higher than 669 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4G</xref>, right panel). It is possible that polymerized PA28&#x003b3; mediates the interactions not only between p53 and monomeric MDM2 (appearing in fractions &#x0223c;560 kDa) but also between p53 and polymeric MDM2. This high-order structure would allow for efficient MDM2-dependent polyubiquitination of p53. The protein complex may also provide a scaffold to orient the substrates, in addition to increasing the local concentrations of the components, especially when the amounts of cellular E2 are low.</p><p>MDM2 is being considered as a target for human cancer therapy. We have provided evidence that PA28&#x003b3; has an integral function in regulating the MDM2&#x02013;p53 interaction by facilitating the interaction of the two proteins. This observation may have clinical implications. In designing future trials of agents targeting MDM2, screening for the expression of PA28&#x003b3; in cancer patients should be taken into account.</p><p>Another interesting observation is that the change in MDM2 expression in different cells is not the same after PA28&#x003b3; overexpression. MDM2 is a target of p53, and PA28&#x003b3; is a negative regulator of p53. Therefore, overexpression of PA28&#x003b3; in cells may result in a decrease in the level of MDM2. This may occur through the inhibition of the transactivation activity of p53 by PA28&#x003b3;. Although this seems to be the case in A549 cells, at the current stage we cannot completely rule out the possibility that PA28&#x003b3; may directly regulate MDM2 or may regulate the oncoprotein through other pathways. These mechanisms may be cell-type dependent. Future studies investigating the possible regulatory function of PA28&#x003b3; on MDM2 expression either in the presence or absence of p53 are warranted.</p><p>This study reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying the effects of PA28&#x003b3; on apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. Although one PA28&#x003b3; substrate, SRC-3/AIB1, had been identified previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), its pro-growth nature is difficult to reconcile with the pro-apoptotic and antiproliferative phenotypes following PA28&#x003b3; knockdown. Recently, p21<sup>Waf1</sup> was also demonstrated to be a substrate of PA28&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Although the cell cycle arrest phenotype of PA28&#x003b3; knockdown could be explained by its effects on p21<sup>Waf1</sup>, the mechanisms responsible for its induction of apoptosis were not clear. We have identified an interaction among PA28&#x003b3;, MDM2, and p53, which have established activities in apoptosis and cell proliferation. This interaction could provide the missing link between PA28&#x003b3; and apoptosis.</p><p>In support of this theory, <italic>PA28</italic>&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, although viable, have a phenotype similar to transgenic mice with hypomorphic MDM2. We also observed that PA28&#x003b3; has a negative regulatory function in the level of p53 in both MEF cells and normal breast epithelial MCF10A cells. It is possible that the viability of <italic>PA28</italic>&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice may depend on the presence of other p53-regulatory molecules when PA28&#x003b3; is knocked down. For example, we have observed that YY1 is still capable of downregulating p53 in the presence of PA28&#x003b3; knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3M</xref>). Recent efforts have identified several cellular factors that selectively regulate the transactivational activities of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Das <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). These molecules may also regulate the activities of p53 in the absence of PA28&#x003b3;.</p><p><italic>MDM2</italic> knockout results in lethality early in development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Jones <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Montes de Oca Luna <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). This may result from a p53-mediated hypoxic response due to the lack of regulation by MDM2. It is possible that the regulation of MDM2&#x02013;p53 by PA28&#x003b3; may not be involved in this stage of early development, or that other cofactors have a more important function at this stage, which could explain the viability of <italic>PA28</italic>&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.
