Although some individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome showed clinical features that were reminiscent of autosomal dominant DC, these features did not correlate with telomere length, suggesting that these were not caused by critically short telomeres. We conclude that a <italic>TERT</italic> gene deletion leads to slightly shorter telomeres within one generation.

It consists of two core components, the telomerase reverse transcriptase (<italic>TERT</italic>) and the telomerase RNA (<italic>TERC</italic>), that serves as a template for the synthesis of telomeric DNA repeats at chromosome ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Greider &#x00026; Blackburn, 1987</xref>). Loss of telomerase activity leads to progressive telomere shortening and loss of telomere integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Blackburn, 2001</xref>). When telomeres become critically short, cell cycle arrest or cell death occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>). Haploinsufficiency for <italic>TERC</italic> causes the autosomal dominant variant of dyskeratosis congenita (DC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Vulliamy <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>).</p><p>DC is a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome. In addition to progressive bone marrow failure, clinical features include nail dystrophy, abnormal skin pigmentation and mucosal leukoplakia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Knight <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). Patients with DC have very short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Vulliamy <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>), suggesting that excessive premature telomere shortening is responsible for the development of the disease in these individuals (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Mason <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). More recently, <italic>TERT</italic> gene mutations have been identified in rare individuals with autosomal dominant DC and in sporadic cases of bone marrow failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Armanios <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Vulliamy <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Liang <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Vulliamy &#x00026; Dokal, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Xin <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). In autosomal dominant DC, the age of onset is earlier and the disease is more severe in later generations who carry the pathogenic mutation, a phenomenon known as anticipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Vulliamy <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Mason, 2003</xref>). Disease anticipation in autosomal dominant DC is thought to be due to the inheritance of increasingly short telomeres in subsequent generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Vulliamy <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Goldman <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The rate of telomere shortening has been extensively studied in telomerase-deficient mice. Mice with no telomerase function, either because of a <italic>Terc</italic> gene deletion (<italic>Terc</italic> RNA&#x02013;/&#x02013; mice) or due to a null mutation in the <italic>Tert</italic> gene (<italic>Tert&#x02013;</italic>/&#x02013; mice), showed no obvious phenotype in the early generations of inbreeding despite progressive telomere shortening. Three to six generations of inbreeding were necessary to produce telomeres sufficiently short to cause a &#x02018;short telomere phenotype&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Blasco <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Herrera <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Niida <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). The rate of telomere shortening in human haploinsufficiency for <italic>TERC</italic> or <italic>TERT</italic> is not known. Similarly, the number of generations that of haploinsufficiency and increasingly short telomeres has to be inherited before telomeres become critically short is unknown.</p><p>To explore the impact of <italic>de novo TERT</italic> haploinsufficiency on telomere shortening, we studied a large number of individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome having a <italic>TERT</italic> gene deletion. The 5p&#x02013; syndrome, also know as Cri du Chat syndrome, or monosomy 5p, is one of the most frequent autosomal deletion syndromes. The deletions involve the short arm of chromosome 5 and usually encompass <italic>TERT</italic> gene located at 5p15.33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Meyerson <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). This syndrome has several phenotypic components including the characteristic cry that gives the syndrome its name, facial dysmorphology, speech delay and mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mainardi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Clinical manifestations vary with the size and location of the chromosomal deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Overhauser <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Gersh <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kim &#x00026; Wu, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mainardi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The deletion in individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome is either a <italic>de novo</italic> event or is inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mainardi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Consequently, individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome whose deletion includes the <italic>TERT</italic> gene are the first generation to be haploinsufficient for <italic>TERT</italic> (<italic>de novo TERT</italic> gene deletion). Classical features of DC have not been associated with the syndrome; however, only few individuals have been followed into adulthood and no hematological assessments have been performed.</p><p>We were, therefore, interested in the degree of telomere shortening in individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome due to the phenomenon of anticipation in autosomal dominant DC and in whether haploinsufficiency for <italic>TERT</italic> may contribute to the clinical spectrum of the 5p&#x02013; syndrome. Our investigations demonstrate that the majority of individuals with 5p&#x02013; had only one copy of the <italic>TERT</italic> gene. Telomeres measured in peripheral blood cells from individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome and a <italic>TERT</italic> gene deletion, although significantly shorter than age-matched controls, remained within normal levels and did not approach the severely shortened telomeres seen in patients with autosomal dominant DC. We conclude that a <italic>de novo TERT</italic> gene deletion, although associated with shorter telomeres, does not lead to critically short telomeres within one generation and that clinical manifestations of the 5p&#x02013; syndrome are unlikely to be caused by premature shortening of telomeres.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome have clinical manifestations consistent with premature aging</title><p>Fifty-one families with at least one family member affected with the 5p&#x02013; syndrome participated in our study. Fifty-two participants had 5p&#x02013; syndrome; 79 were unaffected family members. The median age of participants with 5p&#x02013; syndrome was 9 years old (range, 1&#x02013;42 years), and that of unaffected family members (parents and siblings) was 41 years old (range, 2&#x02013;70 years). All individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome showed typical clinical features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mainardi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) including, on review, the cat-like cry and specific alteration of the voice, facial anomalies (i.e. epicanthal folds, microretrognathia), and psychomotor and mental retardation. In addition to the classical features of 5p&#x02013; syndrome, ridging of the fingernails was noted in 14 individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome and early hair graying in 10 individuals. Both ridging of the fingernails and early hair graying are early cutaneous manifestations characteristic of DC. The youngest participant with ridged fingernails was 2 years old and the youngest with early graying of the hair was 12 years old. Telomere lengths in individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome having ridged finger/toe nails were not significantly different from the individuals without ridged nails (<italic>P</italic> = 0.92). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference of telomere length between individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome having early hair graying/loss and without this feature (<italic>P</italic> = 0.80). Leukoplakia, another characteristic manifestation of DC, was not seen in any of the participants with 5p&#x02013; syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Deletion of one copy of <italic>TERT</italic> in individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome</title><p>We determined the copy number of the <italic>TERT</italic> gene by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). While the 79 unaffected family members had an average copy number of <italic>TERT</italic> of 1.89 &#x000b1; 0.26, the 42 individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome had an average of 1.00 &#x000b1; 0.14 (<italic>P</italic> = 4.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;39</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). The result suggests that there is a concomitant deletion of <italic>TERT</italic> in the majority of participants having deletion of 5p. We identified three individuals with 5p&#x02013; having two copies of the <italic>TERT</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>, open circles), indicating an interstitial deletion sparing the <italic>TERT</italic> locus was responsible for the syndrome, as confirmed by fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) analysis.

To investigate whether haploinsufficiency for the <italic>TERT</italic> gene is associated with a reduced level of <italic>TERT</italic> mRNA and reduced levels of telomerase activity, we measured the levels of <italic>TERT</italic> mRNA and telomerase activity in activated T cells after incubations with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. The levels of <italic>TERT</italic> mRNA as measured by Q-PCR and of telomerase activity as determined by Q-PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kim &#x00026; Wu, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Uehara, 2006</xref>) were highly variable and not significantly different in individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome vs. normal controls (see Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). However, our finding of accelerated telomere shortening (see below) indirectly indicates that functional haploinsufficiency is likely to operate in individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Shortened telomeres in individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome</title><p>It has been well established that telomere length shortens with age in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Harley <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hastie <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Nordfjall <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Telomere lengths were determined from 105 healthy individuals aged from 3 to 94 years. The 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentiles of the age-dependent distribution of telomere lengths are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>. We have used the general linear model (GLM) procedure to analyze the association between telomere length and <italic>TERT</italic> gene deletion, age, gender and race. Consistent with previous reports, we found a negative association between telomere lengths and age (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). In contrast, gender and race were not significant predictors of telomere lengths (<italic>P</italic> = 0.993 and 0.239, respectively). Although at first glance telomere lengths in individuals with 5p&#x02013; seemed not to differ much from normal controls by either flow cytometry FISH or Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A,B</xref>), statistical analysis revealed a significant association between telomere length and the copy number of <italic>TERT</italic> (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0066). Furthermore, age-dependent telomere shortening in individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome and a concomitant <italic>TERT</italic> gene deletion seemed to be accelerated compared to normal controls (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02013;0.09, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0046 vs. <italic>r</italic> = &#x02013;0.07, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), but this did not reach statistical significance due to the low number of older individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome and the wide distribution of telomere lengths [95% confidence interval (CI): &#x02013;0.15 to &#x02013;0.03 vs. &#x02013;0.09 to &#x02013;0.05]. However, when compared to telomere lengths from individuals with autosomal dominant DC due to a <italic>TERC</italic> gene deletion, whose telomere lengths are far below the 5th percentile (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A,B</xref>), telomere lengths in blood cells from individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome and a <italic>TERT</italic> gene deletion were only marginally shorter than normal controls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). We have also quantitatively estimated the differences in the rate of telomere shortening. It was found that telomere lengths were shortened by 1.1 relative fluorescence units (RFU) in the first generation of individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome compared to normal controls (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0147). In contrast, in the autosomal dominant DC patients with a <italic>TERC</italic> gene deletion telomere lengths were on average 5.6 RFU lower than in individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Telomere lengths in individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome and normal study controls.

Here we investigated the effect of a <italic>TERT</italic> gene deletion on telomere lengths in individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome. Our studies showed that telomere lengths in individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome, who are haploinsufficient for the <italic>TERT</italic> gene, are only slightly shorter than telomere lengths in normal controls, who have two copies of <italic>TERT</italic>. Shorter telomeres were previously demonstrated by Zhang and colleagues in eight individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome compared to eight normal controls, with the conclusion that significant telomere shortening was evident in 5p&#x02013; and might contribute to the 5p&#x02013; phenotype (2003). However, the study did not take into account the wide distribution of telomere lengths in the normal population and lacks sufficient numbers of normal controls and 5p&#x02013; individuals to evaluate the extent of telomere shortening in these individuals. In our study, telomere lengths of 44 individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome were compared with a much larger group of control individuals (<italic>n</italic> = 105). Both populations showed a wide distribution of telomere lengths, which were largely overlapping. These results, in contrast to the previous study, put the telomere shortening observed in individuals with 5p&#x02013; into proportion, indicating that telomere shortening in individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome, although significant, is minimal and that the majority of telomere lengths of individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome still fall within the distribution of normal telomere lengths (5th&#x02013;95th percentile, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>). Comparing telomere lengths of individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome to the telomere lengths in individuals with autosomal dominant DC due to a <italic>TERC</italic> gene deletion, we find that individuals with 5p&#x02013; have much longer telomeres than individuals with autosomal dominant DC and a <italic>TERC</italic> gene deletion, both by flow cytometry FISH and by Southern blotting (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A,B</xref>).</p><p>The most likely explanation for these findings is that in individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome, haploinsufficiency for <italic>TERT</italic> almost always occurs <italic>de novo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mainardi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) and, as demonstrated here, within one generation this does not lead to the excessively short telomeres seen in individuals with autosomal dominant DC due to an inherited <italic>TERC</italic> gene deletion. These findings strongly support the hypothesis of anticipation and underline the importance of anticipation in the pathogenesis of disease in patients with autosomal dominant DC.</p><p>Anticipation due to the inheritance of increasingly shorter telomeres is a unique characteristic of autosomal dominant DC. It explains the increasing severity and younger age of onset of the disease in later generations in patients with autosomal dominant DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Vulliamy <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Mason, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Armanios <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Goldman <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The cumulative effect of telomere shortening over several generations also explains why even a minimal impairment of telomerase activity will eventually lead to telomeres sufficiently short to cause disease.</p><p>An alternative explanation of our finding could be that haploinsufficiency for <italic>TERC</italic> has a different effect on telomere length from haploinsufficiency for <italic>TERT</italic>. In mice, <italic>TERT</italic> and <italic>Terc</italic> RNA deficiency showed a very similar rate of telomere shortening and an almost identical phenotype after several generations of inbreeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Blasco <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). However, telomere dynamics differ in mouse and humans. In contrast to humans, mice <italic>Terc</italic> RNA or <italic>Tert</italic> haploinsufficiency is not associated with the development of a disease phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Blasco <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Chiang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hathcock <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), whereas in humans homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for telomerase null mutations have never been described and are most likely not compatible with life. We can not exclude that <italic>TERC</italic> and <italic>TERT</italic> haploinsufficiency might have a different effect on telomere lengths in humans. Samples from patients with autosomal dominant DC due to a <italic>TERT</italic> gene mutation were not available to us; but the fact that autosomal dominant DC occurs in families with inherited <italic>TERC</italic> or <italic>TERT</italic> gene mutations strongly supports our hypothesis that in the majority of humans neither haploinsufficiency for <italic>TERT</italic> nor for <italic>TERC</italic> leads to excessively short telomeres or autosomal dominant DC disease in the first generation.</p><p>We expected that telomere shortening due to <italic>TERT</italic> haploinsufficiency would be most significant during embryonic development, but we were surprised to find that telomere lengths in children with 5p&#x02013; syndrome below the age of 5 years were not significantly different to normal controls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>), but telomere loss appeared to be accelerated thereafter. This raises the interesting question of when in human life telomerase haploinsufficiency affects telomere length the most. Interestingly, individuals with autosomal dominant DC due to <italic>TERC</italic> gene deletions have very short telomeres already at a very young age (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>). We hypothesize that there is a lower limit of telomere length for a functional blood cell and that lower limit is reached in autosomal dominant DC patients with disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Goldman <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Blood progenitor cells with shorter telomeres stop dividing or die leading to the bone marrow failure in individuals with autosomal dominant DC.</p><p>Interestingly, some individuals with 5p&#x02013; showed ridged fingernails and early graying of their hair, a clinical manifestation associated with premature aging. Similarly, individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome had low numbers of circulating peripheral blood progenitor cells compared to normal controls, which is suggestive for bone marrow failure. However, fingernail changes were also found in one of the three individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome having two copies of the <italic>TERT</italic> gene, and equally low numbers of circulating blood progenitor cells were present in all three 5p&#x02013; individuals with two copies of <italic>TERT</italic>. Early graying of hair was not seen in individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome and with two copies of <italic>TERT,</italic> but all three were below the age of 10. Although we cannot formally exclude that some of these features are caused by short telomeres in the specific tissue, the fact that some of these features were found also in individuals with 5p&#x02013; but two copies of <italic>TERT</italic> suggests that the observed changes of the nails, early hair graying, and the decreased number of circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells are due to haploinsufficiency of one or more of the other genes involved in the large chromosomal deletion. Similarly, although none of the affected genes other than <italic>TERT</italic> is involved in telomere maintenance, we cannot exclude that their haploinsufficiency directly or indirectly influences telomere length.</p><p>In summary, our data demonstrate accelerated telomere shortening in individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome. The residual telomere length, rather than reduced telomerase activity, has been implicated to be responsible for the phenotype in telomerase deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Hao <italic>et al</italic>., 2005b</xref>). Short telomeres have also been implicated in the pathology of patients with DC. Our analysis demonstrates that within one generation, telomeres do not become sufficiently short to cause disease or contribute to the 5p&#x02013; phenotype. However, whether TERT haploinsuffciency contributes to the 5p&#x02013; phenotype outside of its role on telomeres remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Blackburn, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Human subjects</title><p>The study group comprised 52 individuals with 5p&#x02013; syndrome from 51 families: 37 individuals (36 families) were enrolled during the annual meeting of the 5p&#x02013; Society held in St. Louis, MO, USA, in July 2005, and 15 individuals (15 families) were enrolled during the annual meeting held in Santa Clara, CA, USA, in 2006.

(B) Telomerase activity in activated T lymphocytes from individuals with 5p- syndrome and family controls. Telomerase activity was determined by Q-PCR analysis. TPG (total products generated) is defined as the amount of template [TSR7: AATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTTAG(GGTTAG)6] that is extended with telomeric repeats by telomerase. There is no statistically significant difference between the individuals with 5p- syndrome (&#x02022;, median: 0.00099; <italic>n</italic> = 14) and the family controls (&#x000d7;, median: 0.0018; <italic>n</italic> = 16) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.46).
