Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is highly expressed in 1st and 2nd trimester villous cytotrophoblast cells, yet barely detectable in syncytiotrophoblast, thus we examined the potential role of ILK in aiding trophoblast fusion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The temporal/spatial expression and activity of ILK were determined in BeWo cells undergoing syncytialization by immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses. BeWo cells were also transfected with pEGFP expression vectors containing wildtype or two mutant ILK cDNA constructs. The incidence of cell fusion in transfected cells grown under syncytialization conditions was then scored by the presence or absence of E-cadherin immunostaining. Beta-hCG expression in transfected cells, a marker of syncytiotrophoblast hormonal differentiation, was also similarly assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>ILK catalytic activity increased and ILK began to increasingly localize to BeWo cell nuclei during syncytialization in correlation with increased pAkt and Snail protein expression. Syncytialization was also significantly elevated (p &#x0003c; 0.05) in BeWo cells expressing constitutively active (ca)-ILK vs cells containing empty vector or dn-ILK. Furthermore, cytoplasmic Beta-hCG expression markedly increased (p &#x0003c; 0.05) in cells expressing wt- and ca-ILK.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>ILK-facilitated syncytialization is dependent, at least in part, on ILK catalytic activity while hormonal differentiation appears dependent on both ILK-associated protein interactions and catalytic activity. This study demonstrates that ILK plays a novel role in BeWo syncytialization and differentiation, perhaps through an ILK-Akt-Snail pathway, and implicates ILK in the same process in villous cytotrophoblasts in vivo.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The human placenta is a critical organ formed during pregnancy that possesses an array of specialized metabolic, hormonal, and immunological functions that control the growth and viability of the fetus and, in turn, the health of the mother [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The importance of proper placental development to the health and well being of the fetus and mother is illustrated in conditions that arise during pregnancy such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and intrauterine growth restriction, that are thought to be the result of placental abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In the human fetal placenta, the floating villi represent the majority of the chorionic villi and are bathed in maternal blood to function in hormone transport and to aid in the exchange of gases, nutrients and waste between the mother and fetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The floating villi consist of an outer multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast layer, an underlying mitotically active mononuclear cytotrophoblast layer and a stroma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the cytotrophoblast layer, polarized stem cytotrophoblast cells proliferate and daughter cells then differentiate and fuse with existing syncytiotrophoblast to maintain the multi-nucleated layer [reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]]. Morphometric analyses have indicated that in the first trimester there is an excess of villous cytotrophoblast cells fusing with the syncytiotrophoblast &#x02013; likely necessary for the metabolic integrity of the syncytiotrophoblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], although Ellery et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] has recently demonstrated that a proportion of nuclei in the syncytiotrophoblast are actively engaged in transcription in accordance with the high metabolic and secretory activity of the tissue. While proliferation of villous cytotrophoblast cells falls with advancing gestation, the cytotrophoblast layer is not entirely discontinuous. Mori et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and Jones et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] have calculated ~45&#x02013;80% continuity of the cell layer at term with cytotrophoblast cells being transformed into flat cells with many thin cellular interdigitating processes. While the events leading to maintenance of the cytotrophoblast stem cell population as well as cytotrophoblast differentiation and fusion are poorly understood, it is becoming clear that initiation of an apoptosis cascade occurs early in differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A flip of phosphatidylserine within the cytotrophoblast cell membrane is also associated with cytotrophoblast fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Since the villous cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast comprise the epithelial covering of the chorionic villi that is in contact with maternal blood, any disturbances in the processes of cytotrophoblast proliferation and fusion of cytotrophoblast with overlying syncytiotrophoblast can seriously perturb the turnover and function of the syncytiotrophoblast layer and ultimately may contribute to development of fetal growth restriction or preeclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Research has demonstrated that syncytin-1, a retroviral envelope protein, appears to have a direct role in human trophoblast fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, glial cells missing-1 (GCM1), a transcription factor, appears to be upregulated in pre-fusing cytotrophoblast and to regulate syncytin-1 mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Along with these findings, other proteins or groups of proteins such as protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases with a variety of other known functions also appear to play important roles in the fusion pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. An intracellular serine/threonine kinase named Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) localizes to focal adhesions and is critically involved in the adhesion of cells to their extracelluar environment and in signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. ILK interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of &#x003b2;-integrins and numerous cytoskeletal associated proteins and has been found to mediate protein-protein interactions.</p><p>Recently, Elustondo et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] reported that ILK was highly detectable by immunoblot analyses in human chorionic villous tissue lysates throughout gestation. It was also highly expressed <italic>in situ </italic>in villous cytotrophoblast cells and in stromal mesenchyme in first trimester and early second trimester human chorionic floating villi; however, it was scarcely detected in the syncytiotrophoblast layer. The adherens junction protein E-cadherin mediates homophilic calcium- dependent cell adhesion in neighbouring cells and is also highly detectable at points of cytotrophoblast cell-cell contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. E-cadherin expression markedly decreases with remodeling of cell-cell adhesion complexes associated with differentiation and subsequent fusion of cytotrophoblast to syncytiotrophoblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and, thus, presence/absence of the protein can be used to assess trophoblast syncytialization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As yet, the mechanism(s) underlying the downregulation of E-cadherin expression in villous cytotrophoblast undergoing the morphogenetic process of syncytialization is unknown.</p><p>Hannigan et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] has demonstrated that over-expression of ILK in epithelial cells results in disrupted cell-cell adhesion. ILK also downregulates E-cadherin expression through activation of the transcriptional repressor Snail, independent of &#x003b2;-catenin/T cell factor (TCF7) regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Based on the reported role of ILK in regulating E-cadherin expression and the known expression of both ILK and E-cadherin expression in the cytotrophoblast of human chorionic villi during pregnancy, we hypothesized that ILK could be a player in regulating the differentiation and fusion of cytotrophoblast into the syncytiotrophoblast via the downregulation of E-cadherin. To begin testing this hypothesis we employed a well documented cell line model, BeWo cytotrophoblast cells, for the study of trophoblast syncytialization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The BeWo cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Cat. #CCL-98, Manassas, VA, USA). This cell line was originally derived from a human trophoblast choriocarcinoma and is well known to undergo syncytialization upon forskolin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This cell line model is ideal for experiments because syncytialization can be controlled with syncytialization of up to 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. They can be grown under proliferating conditions indefinitely where they exhibit an epithelial phenotype or under syncytialization conditions where it is well known that BeWo cells express markers of syncytiotrophoblast such as &#x003b2;-hCG, syncytin, and markedly decreased E-cadherin and desmoplakin expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Cells were cultivated in 75 cm<sup>2 </sup>culture flasks in Ham's F-12 media with L-glutamine (Cat. #11765-062; Invitrogen Ltd., Burlington, Ontario, Canada) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cat. #16000-044; Invitrogen) and 100 U penicillin/100 &#x003bc;g (Cat. #15140-122; Invitrogen) as has been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The BeWo cells were maintained under standard culture conditions of 5% carbon dioxide in air at 37&#x000b0;C with medium renewal on a daily basis. This tissue culture media formulation and associated culture parameters were designated "proliferating conditions". Once cells reached ~80% confluency they were passaged into new tissue culture flasks with new media at a ratio of 1:4. For culture of BeWo cells to promote syncytialization the same conditions as above were utilized except that the media was simply changed to Ham's F-12K media (Cat. # 21127-022) containing 25 &#x003bc;M Forskolin (Cat. #F6886; Sigma Chemical Co, St. Louis, Missouri, USA).

Under proliferating culture conditions (0 h), ILK was localized in the cell cytoplasm, at focal adhesion-like structures and particularly present at cell-cell adhesions marked by E-cadherin expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, arrows; inset). Once BeWo cells were cultured under syncytialization conditions, ILK localization shifted over the timecourse of culture to an increased nuclear localization concomitant with decreasing E-cadherin detection in cell-cell adhesions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Since BeWo cells grown under syncytialization conditions can achieve up to 80% syncytialization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], some BeWo cell clusters do not syncytialize.

While total ILK expression was significantly lower by 12 h (vs 0 h) of culture in syncytialization conditions, expression quickly recovered and reached detection levels at 48 h of culture that were comparable to ILK expression at 0 h. However, more dramatic changes in spatial expression of ILK were apparent during syncytialization as ILK began accumulating in cell nuclei. Recent work by Acconcia et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] demonstrated that ILK can localize to both cell cytoplasm and cell nuclei and that ILK contains both functional nuclear localization and nuclear export sequences. Furthermore, in MCF7 and NIH 3T3 cells ILK nuclear localization appears important for nuclear integrity and ILK can associate with chromatin. Since changes in ILK expression and catalytic activity were associated with BeWo syncytialization, we examined whether or not exogenous ILK overexpression in BeWo cells could facilitate the process.</p></sec><sec><title>ILK facilitates BeWo syncytialization</title><p>The examination of the presence or absence of desmosomal or adherens junction (E-cadherin) proteins has been successfully used for evaluating the incidence of fusion in trophoblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Thus, we also scored the incidence of syncytium formation in BeWo cells overexpressing EGFP-ILK fusion proteins by examining the presence or absence of E-cadherin immunolocalization. Transient expression of wt-ILK in BeWo cells significantly increased trophoblast syncytialization compared to dn-ILK while ca-ILK expression significantly increased syncytialization compared to vector control and dn-ILK expressing BeWo cells. The ILK constructs used for our experiments have been utilized by other laboratories, including ours, in a number of cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that transient expression of dn-ILK in the extravillous trophoblast cell line model HTR8-SVneo significantly reduced trophoblast migration compared to cells expressing wt-ILK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The over-expression of wt-ILK in a number of cell types can lead to phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3-&#x003b2; while the active mutant ca-ILK has been shown to constitutively phosphorylate Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].

Therefore, it appears to exert a strong dominant negative effect by maintaining ILK associated proteins in an inappropriate subcellular location (e.g. not focal adhesions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>Since dn-ILK expressing BeWo cells only displayed a slightly reduced level of syncytialization compared to vector control cells, it would appear that lack of focal adhesion incorporation of ILK-associated proteins, but not likely &#x003b1;-parvin or paxillin, does not significantly impact BeWo syncytialization. Furthermore, the likelihood of residual kinase activity from this mutant (not fully kinase dead) may account for the less than significant reduction in syncytialization in dn-ILK expressing BeWo cells. Transient expression of wt-ILK in BeWo cells did not significantly increase trophoblast syncytialization compared to vector control expressing cells. ILK activity is dependent on PI-3 kinase activity in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and, as a result, it is possible that the overexpression of the wt-ILK fusion protein may have saturated the endogenous PI-3 kinase resulting in low activation levels of the exogenous wt-ILK fusion protein. In contrast, our results with ca-ILK expressing BeWo cells indicate that ILK facilitates BeWo trophoblast syncytialization and that it is likely dependent, at least in part, on ILK catalytic activity. Fusion-promoting culture conditions, particularly elevated cAMP levels and PKA activation induced by forskolin addition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], also likely synergize with ILK catalytic activity to aid syncytialization as ILK-induced syncytialization was absent in BeWo cells grown only under proliferation-promoting conditions (data not shown). In total, our results clearly correlate with work by Miller et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] who demonstrated that over-expression of ILK in L6 myoblasts resulted in increased ILK activity and stimulation of myoblast fusion into myotubes.</p></sec><sec><title>ILK induces intracellular &#x003b2;-hCG expression</title><p>The synthesis and secretion of &#x003b2;-hCG is a marker of syncytiotrophoblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and syncytializing BeWo cells also express &#x003b2;-hCG mRNA and protein when cultivated under fusion-promoting conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In our experiments we examined &#x003b2;-hCG expression in transfected cells using immunocytochemistry, as has been previously done [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], since our transient transfection strategy meant there was a background of &#x003b2;-hCG expression and secretion from untransfected cells. In vector control cells we detected some &#x003b2;-hCG expression as a result of culture in fusion-promoting conditions; however, dn-ILK expressing cells exhibited significantly lower levels of &#x003b2;-hCG expression in situ compared to vector controls and the other mutant ILK protein expressing cells. Thus, in contrast to syncytialization, lack of proper subcellular localization of ILK-associated proteins (dominant negative effect) does impact BeWo cell &#x003b2;-hCG expression and differentiation. Furthermore, with the concern above regarding proper catalytic activation of exogenous wt-ILK in transfected BeWo cells, the significant increase in &#x003b2;-hCG expression in these cells vs dn-ILK and vector controls may also indicate a need for ILK, in addition to catalytic activity, as an adapter protein and signaling platform for other signalling proteins to aid proper hormonal differentiation. What specific ILK-associated protein(s) may be involved in hormonal differentiation of BeWo cells is under investigation. The significant upregulation of &#x003b2;-hCG expression in ca-ILK expressing BeWo cells highlights that ILK catalytic activity, at least in part, also has a role in promoting syncytiotrophoblast differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Candidate ILK signalling pathway</title><p>The underlying signaling mechanism that could be responsible for ILK facilitated syncytialization of BeWo cells may involve Snail, a sensitive transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin expression. Tan et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] have previously demonstrated that over-expression of ILK in human colon carcinoma cell lines stimulated Snail expression. Recently, these results were extended in Scp2 mouse mammary epithelial cells where ILK over-expression resulted in stimulation of Snail expression and loss of E-cadherin expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Alternatively, depletion of ILK, Akt, or Snail resulted in upregulation of E-cadherin expression. The authors also identified Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) as a component of the signaling pathway upstream of Snail leading to downregulation of E-cadherin expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Our results clearly establish a correlation of increased ILK activity and alterations in ILK expression, including nuclear localization of ILK, during BeWo syncytialization with increased Snail expression in these cells during this process. With reports of Snail involved in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition by downregulating E-cadherin expression through an ILK-Akt-Snail pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], our study also implicates this pathway in facilitating syncytialization of BeWo trophoblast cells. Identification of additional members of this ILK signaling pathway and the specific interactions and role(s) of all these proteins in trophoblast syncytialization is ongoing.</p><p>Impaired trophoblast fusion and differentiation appears to be directly associated with pathological conditions such as preeclampsia or fetal growth restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Using DNA microarray analysis, Kudo et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] reported that genes involved in cell and tissue structural dynamics appeared to be very important for syncytialization. Given the role of ILK in such processes, we appear to have identified a new protein involved in trophoblast syncytialization and differentiation for future study. In addition, our research also raises the possibility of a more general role for ILK in cell-cell fusion <italic>per se </italic>as this fusion process has been suspected in breast cancer cells and demonstrated in macrophages and myoblasts &#x02013; and all of which can highly express ILK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings demonstrate that ILK activity and expression play a novel role in syncytialization and differentiation of BeWo cells, and implicate ILK in the same process in villous cytotrophoblasts in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TB carried out the experiments and contributed to the writing of the manuscript.
