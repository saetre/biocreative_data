In the present work, we used the <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mutant mouse, a strain in which axonal degeneration is considerably slowed down, to show that axon to myelin traffic takes place in the absence of axon degeneration.

Myelin is important not only for rapid saltatory conduction of nerve impulse but also for support of the underlying axon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001331-Edgar1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, inactivating the <italic>Cnp1</italic> myelin gene does not alter myelin ultrastructure but causes accumulation of membranous organelles in the axons, axon swelling and degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001331-LappeSiefke1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. This support role, and the exact way by which oligodendrocytes and axons communicate, is still poorly understood. Theiler's virus (TMEV) is a mouse picornavirus responsible for a persistent infection of CNS and a chronic, inflammatory, neurological disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001331-Brahic1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. TMEV infects neurons first but persists in oligodendrocytes and macrophages in the white matter. In a previous paper we showed that TMEV infects retinal ganglion neurons when injected in the eye, is transported axonally in the optic nerve, and infects optic nerve oligodendrocytes through their myelin sheaths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001331-Roussarie1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. We also showed that a deletion of the myelin basic protein gene prevents this axon-myelin traffic and renders the mice resistant to persistent infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001331-Roussarie1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001331-Bihl1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This observation raises important questions regarding the mechanism of axon to myelin traffic and the role of this traffic in viral persistence. Picornaviruses, such as TMEV, are non-enveloped and cannot travel from cell to cell by budding followed by fusion. Classically, they exit infected cells by lysis, although exit without lysis has been discussed but not formally proven <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001331-Kirkegaard1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present work we investigated the role of axon lysis in the entry of TMEV into the myelin using the <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mouse, a mutant strain in which axonal degeneration is 10 times slower than in wild type controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001331-Coleman1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. We show that TMEV enters the myelin even when the axons do not degenerate.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mutation does not affect the infection of retina by TMEV or the axonal transport of the virus in the optic nerve</title><p>Wild type and <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mice were inoculated with TMEV in the vitreous chamber of the eye as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001331-Roussarie1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. First, we examined if the <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mutation altered the infection of retinal ganglion neurons. The amount of viral negative-strand RNA in retina was measured by real-time RT-PCR 2 days post-inoculation. Negative-strand RNA is diagnostic of viral replication, as opposed to genomic positive-strand RNA which can come from the inoculum as well as from newly replicated genomes. No difference was observed between the 2 strains of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001331-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Next we examined the effect of the <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mutation on the axonal transport of the virus by looking for viral antigens in neurons of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), to which retinal ganglion cells project, 4 days post-inoculation. Serial sections of the entire nucleus were stained with fluorescent antibodies specific for TMEV capsid antigens and the total number of positive cell bodies was counted. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001331-g002">Figure 2</xref>, no statistically significant difference was found between wild type and <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mice. This result suggested that the mutation did not affect the rate of anterograde axonal transport of the virus. We then studied the effect of infection on axonal degeneration using both immunofluorescence with the SMI32 monoclonal antibody, an antibody which stains non-phosphorylated neurofilaments specifically, and electron microscopy. Wild type and <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> optic nerves were obtained 3 and 4 days post-inoculation, coded and observed blindly. In the wild type mice, both at 3 and 4 days post-inoculation, immunofluorescence showed conspicuous staining with the SMI32 antibody and electron microscopy showed numerous swollen axons with disorganized cytoskeleton. In contrast, in <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mice, no SMI32 staining was observed by immunofluorescence and abnormal axons were observed only very occasionally by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001331-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Thus, the <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mutation did not affect the infection of the retina by TMEV or the axonal transport of the virus in the optic nerve but prevented axonal degeneration.</p><fig id="pone-0001331-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001331.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Amount of viral RNA in the retina, 2 days post-inoculation.</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from the eye.

An early time was chosen to rule out the possibility of glia to glia spread of the infection. The mice were inoculated in one eye only in order to use the contralateral pre-chiasmatic segment of the optic nerve as control for the hematogenous spread of virus from axon to myelin. Frozen sections were coded, doubly-stained with fluorescent antibodies against 2&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032;cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CNPase), an oligodendrocyte marker, or glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies (GFAP), an astrocyte marker, and with fluorescent anti-TMEV antibodies.

No virus was found in the contralateral pre-chiasmatic segment, ruling out hematogenous spread. In contrast, infected cells were present in the ipsilateral nerve in both wild type and <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mice. The percentage of infected cells that were CNPase<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was the same for wild type and <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mice (65&#x00025;&#x000b1;8&#x00025; and 75&#x00025;&#x000b1;7&#x00025; respectively; <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.31, Mann-Whitney test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001331-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The CNPase<sup>&#x02212;</sup> infected cells were GFAP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> astrocytes. The number of infected oligodendrocytes per mm<sup>2 </sup>of optic nerve section was also the same for both mice (1.1&#x000b1;0.3 and 1.3&#x000b1;0.2 oligodendrocytes/mm<sup>2</sup>; <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.40, Mann-Whitney test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001331-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Therefore the <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mutation did not prevent the infection of optic nerve oligodendrocytes from the axons of retinal ganglion neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results show that the <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mutation does not alter the extent of replication of TMEV in retina or the axonal transport of the virus from retinal ganglion cells to neurons of the LGN. They show a dramatic difference in axonal degeneration between the optic nerves of intra-ocularly inoculated wild type and <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mice. In spite of this difference, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001331-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows that the extent of oligodendrocyte infection was the same in both types of mice. The absence of infection in the contralateral optic nerve ruled out hematogenous spread. It is not possible to formally exclude the presence of limited axonal degeneration, undetected by SMI32 staining, in <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mice. However, if axonal degeneration was the cause of oligodendrocyte infection in wild type and in <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mice, the number of infected oligodendrocytes should have been much lower in the latter, which was not the case. Therefore, the axon to myelin traffic of the virus took place in the absence of axonal degeneration in <italic>Wld<sup>s</sup></italic> mutant mice.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that TMEV, a non-enveloped virus, is able to traffic from the axon into the surrounding myelin in the absence of membrane lysis. Non-lytic cell to cell transfer of a non-enveloped virus has remained a controversial point until now. In the case of persistent infections, non-lytic egress could be crucial by ensuring the survival of the infected host cell. Picornaviruses, such as TMEV, reorganize intra-cytoplasmic membranes to their advantage using pathways derived from the cellular process of autophagy. It has been proposed that the virus could egress from such infected cells in membrane bound vesicles derived from autophagosomes thereby escaping detection by neutralizing antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001331-Jackson1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Viruses are masters at using cellular mechanisms for their own purpose and studying host-pathogen interactions is a very efficient way to uncover new functions in the host. It is most likely that TMEV is transferred from the axon to the myelin sheath through a mechanism that operates in normal, uninfected CNS. An exchange of cytoplasm between axon and myelin could be part of the support function of myelin for the axon. This would be consistent with the hypothesis, made on rather limited evidence, that myelin of the peripheral nervous system clears the axon from unwanted material <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001331-Gatzinsky1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> and on the results of ultrastructural studies suggesting the existence of cytoplasmic exchanges between axon and myelin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001331-Gatzinsky1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001331-Li1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.
