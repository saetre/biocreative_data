In those cases, promoter induction was associated with the initial developmental stages of transport structures.

This flux takes place through phloem sieve elements, cells that are intimately connected to modified companion cells by numerous, branched plasmodesmata. The companion cells, which nurse and feed the sieve elements, are located in the loading and unloading areas of the vascular tissues, and often show typical transfer cell morphology characterized by a large number of cell wall ingrowths facing towards the sieve elements (Pate and Gunning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1972</xref>; Thompson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2001</xref>; Offler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2002</xref>). The development of such ingrowths has also been reported in the phloem parenchyma cells of the minor veins of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> leaves (Haritatos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2000</xref>).</p><p>Transfer cells are seen in all plant taxonomic groups, including algae, as well as in fungi (Pate and Gunning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1972</xref>). The secondary wall ingrowths of these cells can increase the plasma-membrane surface area by up to 20-fold, thus enhancing its transport capacity. It has been proposed that transfer cells play significant roles in nutrient transport pathways. Indeed, these cells are strategically positioned at the interfaces where solute exchange takes place, for example, at leaf minor veins, at distribution areas of xylem and phloem sap in stem nodes, at sites of glandular secretion, at points of delivery of nutrients to sink organs (at the base of flowers and fruits), and at the symplastic discontinuities between individuals belonging either to different generations [i.e., at the base of seeds (Kiesselbach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1949</xref>; Cochrane and Duffus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1980</xref>; Ligrone and Gambardella <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1988</xref>; Offler and Patrick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1993</xref>; Talbot et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2001</xref>)], or species [for example in symbiotic associations like mycorrhizal and rhizobium-root nodule interfaces (Gunning et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1974</xref>; Allaway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1985</xref>) and plant&#x02013;parasite interactions like nematode infections (Jones and Northcote <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1972</xref>)].</p><p>Developing seeds are a typical example of sink elements since they are net importers of organic and inorganic nutrients. Seeds synthesize starch from sucrose and sucrose-derived metabolites that they import from the maternal vascular system terminals. Since there are no symplastic connections between the maternal and filial cells, the solutes are apoplastically uploaded by the embryo and the endosperm. To promote solute uptake, in many species the outer cell layers of the storage organs (generally the endosperm in monocots and the cotyledons in dicots) differentiate into transfer cells in the region facing the maternal vascular terminals. In the maize kernel, at the base of the endosperm and adjacent to the pedicel, the aleurone layer is substituted by the transfer cell layer; this is specialized for nutrient uptake and transport from the maternal tissues to the developing endosperm (Thompson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2001</xref>; Royo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2007</xref>).</p><p>Transfer cell differentiation presumably occurs as a response to an increased demand for solute transport. Little is known about the molecular signals that induce transfer cell differentiation, but it is likely that transported solutes are involved in the process (Offler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2002</xref>). We have recently obtained evidence (data not shown) indicating that <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> (G&#x000f3;mez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2002</xref>) is a primary sensor of this signal in maize and that it induces transfer cell differentiation at the base of the maize endosperm.</p><p>ZmMRP-1 was the first transfer cell-specific transcriptional activator to be identified. The protein contains a 53-amino acid domain highly homologous to the MYB-related DNA binding domain identified in several DNA binding proteins of the SHAQK(Y/F)F sub-family (MybSt1, LeMYB1, LHY and CCA1). The expression of ZmMRP-1 is readily detected in the basal part of the endosperm as early as 3&#x000a0;days after pollination (DAP) (when the endosperm coenocyte is still organized into nuclear-cytoplasmic domains) and continues during the development of transfer cells. ZmMRP-1 also regulates the expression of the transfer cell specific genes <italic>BETL-1</italic>, <italic>BETL-2</italic> (G&#x000f3;mez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2002</xref>), <italic>Meg-1</italic> (Guti&#x000e9;rrez-Marcos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2004</xref>) and <italic>ZmTCRR-1</italic> (Mu&#x000f1;iz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>).</p><p>In this work, a functional promoter of <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> was identified in maize. The introduction of this promoter into several heterologous species provided important information on the signals inducing the expression of <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> and, consequently, the differentiation of functional transfer cells. Two major causes inducing promoter activity were found to be: (1) the need to support active transport across developing exchange surfaces (such as in young branching areas) before proper vasculature connections are established; and (2) the increase in transport demand caused by the establishment of a strong sink, such as at the base of developing fruits and in nematode feeding structures. The present results also show that the promoter is modulated, in these sites, by the concentration of monosaccharides.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>Plants were transformed using different methods with vectors containing 850&#x000a0;bp of the proximal <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> promoter sequence (G&#x000f3;mez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2002</xref>) fused to the GUS reporter gene.</p><p>For maize transformation, the fragment ZmMRP-1prom was obtained from the plasmid ZmMRPprom-GUS (G&#x000f3;mez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2002</xref>) and cloned in a Gateway derived vector (Invitrogen) that contains the ZmMRP-1 promoter linked to GUS and an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Sac66 polyadenylation signal.

To overcome these difficulties, the effect of the different sugars on <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> promoter activity was analyzed in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisae</italic> cells carrying a construct containing the 850-bp promoter fused to the lacZ reporter gene.

The expression of the reporter gene seems to be, however, delayed as compared to the endogenous gene, which is detected by in situ hybridization as early as 3 DAP and reaches a maximum of expression between 11 and 16 DAP (G&#x000f3;mez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2002</xref>). This behavior was already observed for the promoter of <italic>BETL-1</italic> (Hueros et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1999a</xref>) and could be interpreted as the result of (1) the low sensitivity of the GUS histochemical assay, which would make difficult the detection of the expression at the earliest developmental stages (2) the stability of the GUS protein, which would extend the duration of the apparent expression peak once the protein is accumulated. <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> is not expressed in the embryo surrounding region (ESR; G&#x000f3;mez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2002</xref>), which constitutes a separate expression domain within the endosperm (Opsahl-Ferstadt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1997</xref>). Activity of the <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> promoter in the embryo surrounding region cannot be excluded from our data; however, due to the close proximity of the ESR cells to the transfer cell layer at its ad-germinal side and the diffuse GUS signal that covers the entire basal endosperm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Closer inspection of sectioned material (not shown) suggest that indeed the promoter activity is excluded from the ESR, but a precise mapping of the promoter activity would probably require in situ detection of GUS mRNA.</p><p>Identifying the signals controlling the activity of the <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> promoter in maize is impeded by the difficulty of accessing the endosperm transfer cells in order to manipulate the putative signals that diffuse from the maternal phloem cells (and which are presumably necessary for its differentiation) (G&#x000f3;mez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2002</xref>). In previous studies, we were unable to detect or induce <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic>, or any other transfer cell-specific gene (Hueros et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">b</xref>; G&#x000f3;mez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2002</xref>), in maize plant tissues other than the endosperm transfer cells. This suggests that the mechanisms regulating gene expression in transfer cells are tightly controlled in maize. We, therefore, decided to introduce the ZmMRP-1prom-GUS construct into the heterologous species barley, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tobacco, in which the promoter would likely be less strongly controlled and the resulting GUS expression patterns likely to provide additional information regarding the regulation of <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> promoter.</p><p>In temperate cereals, such as barley and wheat, seed anatomy strongly differs from that observed in maize (Royo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2007</xref>). Nutrients are uploaded into the endosperm from a cavity running along the seed, rather than from the pedicel as in maize. The endosperm cavity is surrounded by a modified aleurone layer composed of cells showing transfer cell morphology, and which are involved in the transport of nutrients into the developing endosperm (Wang and Fisher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1994</xref>; Weschke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2003</xref>). In this work, <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> promoter activity was detected in the developing modified aleurone layer of the barley (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). This provides a functional link between the modified aleurone layer in barley and maize transfer cells, as well as a first indication that the promoter responds to functional, transport-related signals rather than positional signals, which would have targeted the promoter expression to the base of the barley grain. Interestingly, no expression was detected in the transfer cells found at the nucellar projection. This is consistent with the pattern of other maize transfer cell-specific promoters examined in barley (data not shown). In addition, the existence of endosperm and nucellar transfer cells as two separate expression domains has been demonstrated by the identification of genes specifically expressed in each of these tissues (Drea et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2005</xref>). The signalling mechanisms operating in the endosperm maize and wheat/barley transfer cells probably differ profoundly from those found at the nucellar projection transfer cells of wheat/barley. The former cell types are specialized in the uptake of nutrients to nurse sink organs (such as the developing endosperm or young leaves and stem branches; see below), while the latter facilitate the transit of nutrients from the vascular terminals to the endosperm cavity. GUS expression was also detected in the developing barley spikelets (see below).</p><p>The expression pattern of the reporter gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tobacco was basically identical, indicating that the signals regulating the in vivo expression of <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic>, and very likely the differentiation of transfer cell areas, are conserved in both species. GUS expression was detected in several tissues and organs in these transgenic reporter lines. The different patterns of expression can be assigned to two functional classes: (1) that of the nodal regions of young stems and the base of reproductive structures, and (2) that of the endosperm in germinating <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tobacco.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>GUS expression in the nodal regions of young stems and at the base of reproductive structures</title><p>The GUS expression observed at different points of the vegetative structures in the present transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tobacco plants was always restricted to immature tissues apparently involved in the active transport of nutrients. In young tobacco and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings, the expression of GUS was detected in the nodal region of the stems, at the base of the cotyledons, and at the end point of the cotyledonary leaves close to the hydathodes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The presence of a &#x0201c;collar&#x0201d; of transfer cells at the cotyledonary nodes was described by Pate et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1970</xref>). They appear after seed germination and usually differentiate from the xylem parenchyma of the cotyledonary traces. These transfer cells play a very important role during the early nutrition of the young plumule, particularly before it develops proper vascular connections with the primary vascular system already connecting the cotyledons and roots (Pate et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1970</xref>; Pate and Gunning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1972</xref>). The GUS signal begins to decrease, and eventually disappears in the cotyledonary node when these vascular connections are finally established. The whole mount-high resolution images shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b&#x02013;d revealed that the promoter driven GUS expression reached a maximum at the anastomosis regions formed at the place where the vascular bundles from cotyledons, leaf primordia and stem converge. This further reinforces the suggestion that the <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> promoter responds to situations in which an active transport system is being established.</p><p>Hydathodes retrieve ions and organic molecules from the apoplasm and the xylem sap and exude water via the guttation stream; they are also involved in the selective absorption and retrieval of both inorganic and organic solutes (Esau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1977</xref>). In some species, cells positioned between the xylem and the hydathodes develop the characteristic transfer cell wall ingrowths, as they are the main regulators of the bidirectional transport established between the vascular tissue and the external environment (Pate and Gunning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1972</xref>). Again, the GUS signal was detected only in the cotyledons and young leaves, progressively decreasing (until disappearing) as they matured, even though hydathodes continue to be functional in adult leaves. Therefore, as in maize and barley endosperm transfer cells, <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> promoter activity in solute exchanging areas is only detectable during the first stages of differentiation of the transport areas, becoming silent when transport ceases or the vascular connections are fully established.</p><p>In the nodes along the stem, the expression of GUS was also transitory and restricted to transport areas (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Transfer cells have been detected in the vascular tissues of nodes and adjacent region of internodes in a wide variety of plants (Gunning et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1970</xref>). In every case, these cells occur as a modified xylem parenchyma and are predominantly associated with departing foliar traces. These cells facilitate the transfer of nutrients to organs, like at the young apices and axillary meristems still not connected to the main vasculature. It should be noted that the expression of GUS in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tobacco plants reproduces this pattern of development, with the GUS signal being restricted to the young nodes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, b), and more specifically to the transfer cells modified from the xylem parenchyma (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c, d). A similar situation has been reported in the spikelets of wheat, at the nodes where the sterile glumes are attached to the rachilla (Zee and O&#x02019;Brien <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1971</xref>). In the present barley reporter lines, GUS expression followed the development and differentiation of transfer cells in the vascular system, in the main bundles supplying nutrients to those floral organs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b).</p><p>The results of the analyses of GUS expression in developing flowers and fruits provide additional support to the hypothesis that the <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> promoter responds to the same signals that induce the differentiation of transfer cells. The intensity of the GUS signal at the base of the siliques increases over fruit development, reaching a maximum when the siliques are fully expanded, right before the fruits switch from the differentiation to the seed filling and maturation processes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a).</p><p>The interdependence between transfer cell differentiation and the need to establish an efficient transport mechanism has been investigated by experimental elimination of the sinks; fruit elimination or preventing fertilization abolishes the differentiation process (Pate and Gunning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1972</xref>). Similarly, in the present transgenic tobacco plants, the GUS signal disappeared from the pedicel of flowers in which pollination was prevented, but not from pollinated flowers on the same branch (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d). Additional evidence of sink dependence on promoter activity was provided by the experimental infection of transgenic roots with nematodes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The promoter of <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> was transiently active during infection when the feeding structures were being induced by the nematodes. No promoter activity was detected during the most active transport phase, when the giant cells have completely differentiated (Goverse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Promoter activity in the endosperm of germinating <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tobacco seeds</title><p>The expression of the <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> promoter in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tobacco seeds at germination was an unexpected result. In cereal seeds, this promoter activity is strictly confined to the seed development phase (G&#x000f3;mez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2002</xref>; this work). The lack of signal during the maturation phase agrees with the minimal contribution of the endosperm to seed development in dicot species, where it is consumed by the cotyledons and becomes a residual structure in mature seeds. This also suggests that the endosperm does not develop specialized transport structures and probably does not make a major contribution to the seed filling process, despite the apparently conserved antero-posterior organization of endosperm domains in cereals and dicots suggesting the existence of homologies between the posterior chalazal endosperm and the maize basal transfer cell layer (Berger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>; Olsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2004</xref>).</p><p>At germination, however, GUS expression was detected in the remnants of the peripheral endosperm, along with strong expression in the micropylar endosperm in germinating <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tobacco seeds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The activation of the <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> promoter at seed germination appears not to be related to the development of transport structures. This activation might be caused by signals present in the promoter due to its endospermic origin; these signals would be read incorrectly in the dicot systems since the activity is detected in germinating, rather than developing seeds. Significantly, neither the maize nor barley transgenic plants showed any promoter expression in the germinating seeds (not shown). Alternatively, the induction of the <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> promoter in the endosperm of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tobacco during germination might indicate that it is responsive to signals involved in defence responses. This would agree with the role of <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> as a transcriptional regulator of some genes encoding antimicrobial peptides, and with the putative defence role of the cereal endosperm transfer cells in developing grains (Serna et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2001</xref>). The presence of active defence-related signalling pathways in germinating seeds is not unexpected, in fact it has been suggested that the main function of the genes expressed by the endosperm during germination is to provide a prophylactic mechanism against microbial infection (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Sugars and the regulation of the <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> promoter</title><p>The observed increase in promoter activity when incubating germinating seeds and seedlings in increasing concentrations of sugars (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e for quantitative data on germinating seeds) suggests that the increase in monosaccharides at the exchange areas might trigger the differentiation of transfer tissues. These results also confirm that cell identity is a major determinant of ZmMRP-1 expression, since the increase in reporter gene expression induced by glucose did not result in expression of the promoter at additional sites within the plant (not shown). These results suggest that developmental signals, rather than the concentration of any given metabolite, ultimately determine the sites of expression of <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic>. The concentration of sugars would then act as a modulator of the promoter activity; this effect is, however, difficult to study in the plant system since the nature of the signal that ultimately reaches the cells expressing the construct is unknown. Furthermore, the sugar composition of the different media might influence the physiology of the seedlings (including the transport rate), thus indirectly influencing promoter activity.</p><p>These difficulties are overcome in a cell system such as yeast, where the cells are grown up to log phase in identical media followed by a short incubation period with the different sugars. Indeed, the present results suggest a strong inductive effect of glucose and fructose on the <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> promoter in yeast (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f).</p><p>In vitro experiments have shown a direct influence of sugars on transfer cell differentiation at the surface of <italic>Vicia faba</italic> cotyledons (Offler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1997</xref>; Weber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1997</xref>; Farley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2000</xref>). These experiments indicate that apoplastic sugars, although more precisely the hexoses/sucrose ratio, induce and modulate epidermal transfer cell differentiation. Importantly, the present data show that the promoter of <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> regulates the site of expression of this transfer cell-specific transcriptional activator in response to tissue-specific signals, while the expression level at those sites is modulated by the concentration of hexoses.</p><p>This work shows that the <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> promoter is induced in developing transport-related cells located at the exchanging interfaces between different plant compartments. The promoter is silenced, however, when (1) a proper vasculature connection is established, thus making transfer cell-facilitated transport unnecessary, or (2) the transfer cells are fully differentiated and an active transport function, but no further cell differentiation, is required. The present results suggest that the <italic>ZmMRP-1</italic> promoter might be induced by some of the solutes being transported.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Cereal Functional Analysis Group (FAC) at Biogemma SAS, headed by Dr. Pascual P&#x000e9;rez, and the FAC maize transformation group headed by Dr. Denise Gerentes for their help.
