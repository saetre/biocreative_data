AIM: To evaluate the role of CTMC and MMC for release of TNF-alpha and eicosanoids after allergenic challenge in distinct segments of rat trachea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Proximal trachea (PT) and distal trachea (DT) from ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized rats, treated or not with compound 48/80 (48/80) or dexamethasone, were incubated in culture medium. After OVA challenge, aliquots were collected to study release of TNF-alpha and eicosanoids. RESULTS: Release of TNF-alpha by PT upon OVA challenge peaked at 90 min and decayed at 6 and 24 h. Release from DT peaked at 30-90 min and decayed 6 and 24 h later. When CTMC were depleted with 48/80, OVA challenge exacerbated the TNF-alpha release by PT at all time intervals, while DT exacerbated TNF-alpha levels 6 and 24 h later only. Dexamethasone reduced TNF-alpha production after 90 min of OVA challenge in PT and at 3 and 6h in DT. OVA challenge increased prostaglandin D2) in DT and leukotriene B4 in both segments but did not modify prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene C4 release. CONCLUSION: OVA challenge induces TNF-alpha release from MMC, which is negatively regulated by CTMC. The profile of TNF-alpha and eicosanoids depends on the time after OVA challenge and of the tracheal segment considered.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
