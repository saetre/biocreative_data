People colonized with <italic>S. aureus</italic> are at higher risk of becoming infected by the organism, especially when host defenses are breached, for example, postsurgical wounds, catheter insertions, or burn wounds. People suffering from atopic dermatitis are more likely to be colonized and infected by <italic>S. aureus</italic> than the general population. Superantigens produced by <italic>S. aureus</italic> are known factors that enhance skin inflammation in atopic dermatitis and may be responsible for steroid resistant T cell responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007499-Boguniewicz1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Superantigens, especially toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1), are also responsible for systemic exotoxemias such as toxic shock syndrome (TSS), an acute onset and potentially life-threatening illness. Clinical manifestations of TSS include fever, hypotension, rash, desquamation, and multi-organ failure. These symptoms are the result of overwhelming cytokine production systemically due to abnormal cross-linkage between T cells and macrophages by superantigens. The most recognized cases of TSS are associated with tampon usage in menstruating women; however, TSS is also associated with <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections at surgical or skin infection sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007499-Chuang1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007499-Jarman1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

USA200 clonal type, which is genetically similar to the epidemic hospital strain EMRSA16 in the United Kingdom, is also the major clonal type associated with TSS, presumably due to the high prevalence of these isolates to possess <italic>tst</italic> (the gene for TSST-1). USA300 and USA400 clonal types have been associated recently with necrotizing pneumonia and necrotizing fasciitis in community settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007499-Limbago1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, these antibiotics are often recommended for treating antibiotic resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections, and not for TSS prophylaxis. On the other hand, &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics induce or increase TSST-1 production, which may increase the risk of TSS in patients with severe staphylococcal infections, especially by MRSA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007499-Stevens2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Given that most <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections are initiated at mucosal and skin sites, topical anti-staphylococcal agents, that can be incorporated into wound dressings, disposable medical devices, or tampons to inhibit toxin production and/or <italic>S. aureus</italic> growth and thus prevent <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections or TSS, would have clinical value.</p><p>Glycerol monolaurate (GML) (2,3-dihydroxypropyl dodecanoate) is a lauric acid glycerol ester commonly used in the food and cosmetic industries as an emulsifier and preservative and is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration for topical use at doses up to 100 mg/ml.

In addition, a difference in strain (clonal type) specific susceptibility to both GML and DDG was observed.

By testing the compounds against a large collection of clinical relevant strains, we confirmed that there are differences in sensitivity to GML among bacterial strains, even within the same clonal type.

We also observed that USA400 strains do not produce more lipase than USA200 strains (data not shown), despite being more resistant to the compounds.

Glycerol esters are commonly found in bacterial membranes, and cells have mechanisms to maintain membrane integrity in their presence. This is likely to occur also in the presence of GML. In contrast, glycerol monoethers are uncommon in bacterial membranes, and thus, the bacteria may be expected to have greater difficulty in maintenance of membrane integrity in the presence of DDG. As noted in our studies, GML antimicrobial effects were dose dependent and required higher concentrations for bactericidal activity, while DDG was predominantly bacteriostatic, but active at lower concentrations than GML. Similar mechanisms may also explain the differences between GML and DDG on toxin inhibition.

The rabbit Wiffle ball infection model has been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007499-Scott1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007499-Schlievert7">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, golf-ball-sized Wiffle balls were implanted subcutaneously in the flanks of Dutch-belted rabbits (either sex, 1.5 to 2.5 kg). The animals were allowed to recover for 6&#x02013;8 weeks. On day 0 of experimentation, the animals (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5) received 0.3 ml of 100 mg/ml GML or DDG (or solvent control) by injection directly into the Wiffle ball (final concentration of 1 mg/ml in the 30 ml Wiffle ball). A 1 mg/ml (0.1&#x00025;) final concentration for DDG and GML was chosen and hypothesized to be non-toxic and efficacious as we previously determined that a GML (5&#x00025;) containing gel inserted vaginally every day in monkeys for 6 months was not toxic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007499-Schlievert3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>; and initial in vitro results indicated this concentration of GML and DDG would be bactericidal against <italic>S. aureus</italic> and inhibit TSST-1 production. The same treatments were administered every other day (days 2, 4, and 6). Overnight <italic>S. aureus</italic> MN8 cultures were grown in TH broth, washed once with PBS, and re-suspended to the desired concentration in PBS. Immediately after injecting the compounds, 1&#x000d7;10<sup>10</sup> CFU <italic>S. aureus</italic> MN8 (in a volume of 1.0 ml) was injected into each animal's Wiffle ball (30 ml), bringing the local concentration to approximately 3&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml. Animals were monitored daily for signs of TSS, including fever (with use of rectal thermometers), diarrhea, weight loss, and moribundity (as an indication of imminent death). A small volume of fluid (0.3 ml) was drawn from each Wiffle ball daily for bacterial counts, TSST-1 measurement, and TNF-&#x003b1; determination. Animals were euthanized on day 7.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) ELISA</title><p>TNF-&#x003b1; was used as a biomarker of inflammation at the infection site. Purified recombinant rabbit TNF-&#x003b1;, capture antibody, primary detection antibody (goat anti-rabbit TNF-&#x003b1;), secondary anti-rabbit antibody (biotin mouse anti-rabbit TNF-&#x003b1;), and assay reagents were commercially available from Becton Dickinson. Rabbit Wiffle ball fluids were diluted a minimum of 1&#x02236;2 with assay buffer to eliminate viscosity and nonspecific effects. Lower limit of detection of this assay was approximately 200 pg/ml.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Paired <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed to compare the differences in bacterial densities between GML and DDG (50 and 100 &#x000b5;g/ml) against the 54 clinical <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates. Un-paired <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare the susceptibility of MRSA and MSSA. Total <italic>S. aureus</italic> CFU/ml and TSST-1 levels among groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with <italic>Bonferroni</italic> method to adjust <italic>p</italic> values for multiple comparisons. Fisher's exact test was used to compare rabbit survival between treatment groups. A <italic>p</italic>&#x02264;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Computations and graphing were performed using Prism version 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, CA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0007499-Gordon1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
