For example, testicular hyaluronidase PH-20 counteracts TGF-&#x003b2;1-mediated growth inhibition of epithelial cells. PH-20 sensitizes various cancer cells to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) cytotoxicity by upregulating proapoptotic p53 and WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WOX1). TGF-&#x003b2;1 blocks PH-20-increased TNF cytotoxicity. In the present study, the functional antagonism between TGF-&#x003b2;1 and lysosomal hyaluronidases Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 was examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Murine L929 fibroblasts were engineered to stably express green-fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged hyaluronidase (GFP-Hyal-1 or GFP-Hyal-2) or GFP alone. Compared to control cells, Hyal-2-expressing cells had a significantly increased sensitivity to TNF cytotoxicity (~60&#x02013;110% increase), while Hyal-1-expressing cells were less sensitive to TNF (~20&#x02013;90% increase). TNF activated NF-&#x003ba;B, along with I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation, occurred at 20 to 60 min in Hyal-2 cells post stimulation, but at the 20 min time point in both control and Hyal-1 cells. Hyal-2 cells, but not Hyal-1 and control cells, constitutively expressed WOX1, and transiently expressed Hyal-2 enhanced WOX1-mediated cell death. Unlike PH-20, Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 did not induce p53 expression. Hyal-2 translocated from the lysosome to the mitochondria during staurosporine-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that Hyal-2 may damage mitochondria. Finally, Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 blocked TGF-&#x003b2;1-enhanced L929 cell growth. In contrast, TGF-&#x003b2;1 inhibited Hyal-1- and Hyal-2-increased TNF cytotoxicity in L929 cells by 30&#x02013;50%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>TGF-&#x003b2;1 limits the ability of Hyal-2 to induce TNF cytotoxicity in L929 cells. Hyal-2-increased TNF cytotoxicity in L929 cells appears to be correlated with upregulation of WOX1, a prolonged NF-&#x003ba;B activation, and Hyal-2 translocation to the mitochondria during apoptosis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-&#x003b2;) family proteins are multifunctional cytokines capable of regulating cell growth, extracellular matrix protein synthesis, and immune cell functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].

TGF-&#x003b2;1 induces a novel extracellular matrix protein that prevents TNF-mediated cell death and blocks the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; also known as p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase, p42/44 MAPK) in L929 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

Additionally, PH-20 rapidly activates ERK in L929 cells and TGF-&#x003b2;1 reduces the PH-20-induced ERK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In contrast, TGF-&#x003b2;1 synergistically increases PH-20-mediated inhibition of staurosporine apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Hyal-1, also known as Luca-1, is a lysosomal enzyme that is secreted from cells. Hyal-1 is a candidate tumor suppressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], although it enhances extravasation and metastasis of prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Also, mutations in Hyal-1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of a lysosomal disorder, mucopolysaccharidosis IX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Hyal-2 is a lysosomal protein, which is active at low pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

The goal of the present study was to examine whether lysosomal Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 enhance TNF cytotoxic function and counteract TGF-&#x003b2;1-mediated TNF-resistance in L929 cells. It was determined that stable expression of murine Hyal-2 in L929 cells increased their sensitivity to TNF-mediated death, whereas Hyal-1 was somewhat less effective. TGF-&#x003b2;1 blocked this increased sensitivity. In contrast, Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 did not enhance L929 cell death by anticancer drugs such as daunorubicin, actinomycin D, staurosporine and camptothecin. Overexpressed Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 induced the expression of proapoptotic WOX1, but not p53, suggesting a role of WOX1 in the increased cellular susceptibility to TNF cytotoxicity. Additional mechanisms that are associated with the increased TNF cytotoxicity were also investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>As summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, PH-20 induces the expression of proapoptotic p53 and WOX1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and downregulates antiapoptotic matrix inter-&#x003b1;-inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], thereby enhancing TNF susceptibility in L929 cells.

TGF-&#x003b2;1 counteracted Hyal-1- and Hyal-2-increased TNF killing of L929 fibroblasts. TGF-&#x003b2;1 increased L929 growth, while Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 blocked this enhancement of cell growth. These observations are consistent with our previous finding that exogenous bovine testicular hyaluronidase PH-20 enhances TNF cytotoxicity in various cancer cells, and that TGF-&#x003b2;1 blocks the increased TNF cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. As summarized in the Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, the underlying mechanisms whereby Hyal-2 induces TNF cytotoxicity appear to be associated with 1) Hyal-2 induction of the proapoptotic WOX1, 2) Hyal-2 migration to the mitochondria during apoptosis, and 3) the prolonged period of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation and NF-&#x003ba;B activation in TNF-treated Hyal-2-expressing cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>A summarized scheme for Hyal-2-induced TNF susceptibility in L929 cells. Upregulation of proapoptotic WOX1 but not p53 was observed in the Hyal-2-expressing cells. Unlike PH-20, Hyal-2 could not induce constitutive JNK activation. TNF cytotoxicity was enhanced in these Hyal-2-expressing cells. The enhancement of TNF function is likely due to 1) the induced proapoptotic WOX1, 2) the likely translocation of Hyal-2 to the mitochondria in response to TNF, and 3) the prolonged period of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation and NF-&#x003ba;B activation in as mediated by TNF.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-3-8-8"/></fig><p>Upregulation of p53 and WOX1 contributes, in part, to the PH-20-enhanced cytotoxic function of TNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. WOX1 is a p53-binding protein. Ectopic expression of both p53 and WOX1 cDNA constructs results in colocalization of these proteins in the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Increased synthesis and complex formation between p53 and WOX1 in the cytoplasm are observed during apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Both p53 and WOX1 mediate apoptosis synergistically. Overexpressed WOX1 alone mediates apoptosis independently of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, p53 apoptosis requires the participation of WOX1. Blocking WOX1 expression with antisense mRNA abolishes p53-mediated cell death, suggesting that WOX1 is a potential partner of p53 in apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Both Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 induced WOX1 expression when transiently expressed in L929 cells. However, only Hyal-2 induced WOX1 expression following stable transfection of L929 cells. This correlates with the greater extent of Hyal-2 enhancement of TNF killing compared to Hyal-1. WOX1 expression was induced by TNF in the Hyal-1 stable transfectant. In transient transfection experiments, Hyal-2 enhanced WOX1-mediated L929 cell death, while Hyal-1 had no effect. Both Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 alone failed to induce cell death. Thus, induction of WOX1 expression contributes, in part, to Hyal-1- and Hyal-2-increased TNF sensitivity in L929 cells.</p><p>TNF rapidly induces phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, which normally peaks at 5&#x02013;10 min, followed by proteasome-dependent degradation (10&#x02013;20 min) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation and NF-&#x003ba;B activation occurred, as determined 20 min after exposure of control and Hyal-1 cells to TNF. However, there was an extended period of TNF-mediated I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation and NF-&#x003ba;B activation in Hyal-2 cells, ranging from 20&#x02013;60 min. It is unclear whether this extend ed period of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation and NF-&#x003ba;B activation directly contributes to the ability of Hyal-2 to enhance TNF-mediated apoptosis. I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; is a physiological inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B activation; I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; complexes with NF-&#x003ba;B and prevents its translocation to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B activation is believed to induce antiapoptotic proteins to block cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, in several studies activated NF-&#x003ba;B cannot protect cells from apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Also, NF-&#x003ba;B appears to be essential in the p53-mediated apoptosis in tested cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The mitochondrion is a reservoir of proapoptotic proteins and plays a key role in apoptosis [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; reviews]. One of the pathways that leads to the release of proapoptotic proteins in the mitochondria has been determined. For example, the TNF/TNF receptor-signaling complex activates caspase 8, which leads to the activation and cleavage of Bid, a proapoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family. Activated or truncated Bid (tBid) in turn activates Bak and Bax. Bak migrates to the mitochondrial outer membrane where it generates transmembrane pores; Bax induces the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pores. Cytochrome c is then released from the mitochondria into the cytosol, where it interacts with downstream proapoptotic proteins such as Apaf-1 and caspase 9. Activation of these proteins further activates nucleases, such as caspase-activated DNase (CAD), which cause DNA fragmentation.</p><p>During staurosporine-mediated apoptosis, a portion of the lysosomal Hyal-2 migrates to the mitochondria. Whether Hyal-2 causes mitochondrial membrane damage is unknown. Presumably, Hyal-2 interacts with a specific protein target on the mitochondrial surface that changes the membrane permeability. This notion is supported by our recent screening of Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 interacting proteins in yeast two-hybrid interactions (Chang <italic>et al</italic>, unpublished)</p><p>The functional property of Hyal-2 in degrading hyaluronic acid is controversial. Hyal-2 is found in the lysosome and is active under conditions of low pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Hyal-2 is also found on the cell surface as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptor for jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Nonetheless, the enzymatic activity of Hyal-2 has not been detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Whether the increased TNF cytotoxicity in L929 cells caused by Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 is associated with their enzymatic activities is being studied in this laboratory.</p><p>The TGF-&#x003b2;1 inhibition of Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 effects could be abolished by cycloheximide or actinomycin D (data not shown). That is, inhibition of protein synthesis or gene transcription reduced the inhibitory effect of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in the prevention of Hyal-1- or Hyal-2-increased TNF cytotoxicity. Whether TGF-&#x003b2;1-induced antiapoptotic proteins such as TIAF1 and TIF2 inhibit the function of Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Like testicular PH-20, lysosomal Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 enhanced TNF susceptibility in L929 cells. TGF-&#x003b2;1 suppressed the induced TNF sensitivity. Furthermore, TGF-&#x003b2;1-mediated L929 cell proliferation was blocked by Hyal-1 and Hyal-2. These data indicate that there is a functional antagonism between TGF-&#x003b2;1 and Hyal-1 or Hyal-2. Hyal-2-increased TNF susceptibility in L929 cells appears to be associated with 1) Hyal-2 upregulation of the proapoptotic WOX1, 2) Hyal-2 migration to the mitochondria during apoptotic cell death, and 3) the prolonged I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation and NF-&#x003ba;B activation in Hyal-2-expressing cells stimulated with TNF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>cDNA constructs, transient expression and stable transfectants</title><p>The full-length murine hyaluronidase <italic>Hyal1</italic> and <italic>Hyal2</italic> cDNAs were found in the EST database (Genbank accession AA688635 and BF139787, respectively) and purchased from Incyte Genomics (St. Louis, MO).
