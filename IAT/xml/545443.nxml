The major product for both types of tRNA is the cross-link between 16S rRNA (C1400) and the tRNA (cmo<sup>5</sup>U34) characterized already by Ofengand and his collaborators [Prince <italic>et al</italic>. (1982) <italic>Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA</italic>, 79, 5450&#x02013;5454]. However, in complexes containing deacyl-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup>, an additional product is separated by denaturing PAGE and this is shown to involve C1400 and m<sup>5</sup>C967 of 16S rRNA and cmo<sup>5</sup>U34 of the tRNA. Puromycin treatment of the biotinylvalyl-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> &#x02013;70S complex followed by irradiation, results in the appearance of the unusual photoproduct, which indicates an immediate change in the tRNA interaction with the ribosome after peptide transfer. These results indicate an altered interaction between the tRNA anticodon and the 30S subunit for the tRNA in the P&#x0002f;E hybrid state compared with its interaction in the classic P&#x0002f;P state.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The details of the ribosome interactions with the tRNAs are a critical issue in understanding the mechanism of the protein synthesis cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c3">3</xref>). Photocross-linking has been of some use in monitoring the interaction of the tRNA in the tRNA P site with the 30S ribosome subunit. Specifically, the interaction between 16S rRNA (C1400) and tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> was significantly altered by Initiation Factor 3 (IF3), as judged by the frequency of an intermolecular cross-link between C1400 and C35 (the 5&#x02032; nucleotide of the anticodon in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>), and this is probably connected to the decoding preference change induced by IF3 in the initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c4">4</xref>). The tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> also forms an UVB light-induced intermolecular cross-link with 16S rRNA, again involving the 5&#x02032; anticodon nucleotide and C1400 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c5">5</xref>).</p><p>However, the cross-linking efficiencies of tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> and tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> to <italic>E.coli</italic> ribosomes were only &#x0223c;1%, and it was reasoned that a tRNA with higher cross-linking efficiency should be more sensitive in detecting differences in the tRNA&#x02013;subunit interactions. It was shown previously by the Ofengand group that up to 70% of non-enzymatically bound <italic>E.coli N</italic>-acetyl-Val-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> could be cross-linked to ribosomes by irradiation with wavelengths &#x0003e;310 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c9">9</xref>). This cross-link occurs by cyclobutane dimer formation between the 5-(carboxymethoxy) uridine at position 34 (cmo<sup>5</sup>U34) of tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> and C1400 of 16S RNA, and is dependent on a codon that leaves cmo<sup>5</sup>U34, which is the 5&#x02032; anticodon base, unpaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c10">10</xref>). The characterization of this cross-link, together with the determination of the tRNA location by electron microscopy, provided valuable information about the molecular organization of the P site in the 30S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c11">11</xref>). This was an important constraint in ribosome models prior to the X-ray structure and has been confirmed in the X-ray structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c14">14</xref>). Most of the previous experiments had been done with aminoacylated tRNAs because the [<sup>14</sup>C]valine label was used to track and analyze the photoproducts. Because of this, the results pertained to the tRNA in the classic P&#x0002f;P tRNA binding site in which both the anticodon end of the tRNA and acceptor end of the tRNA occupy positions in the 70S ribosome characteristic of peptidyl tRNA.</p><p>In addition to being highly efficient, the 16S rRNA(C1400) &#x000d7; tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> (cmo<sup>5</sup>U34) cross-link is activated by wavelengths, which should not produce other intramolecular RNA&#x02013;RNA cross-links in the ribosome. To check this, a control experiment in which biotinylvalyl-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> was bound to 70S ribosomes and irradiated with wavelengths &#x0003e;310 nm showed a single prominent product by gel electrophoresis analysis, in agreement with the properties described by the Ofengand group. However, when ribosome complexes containing deacyl-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> were irradiated, an additional product with a much reduced electrophoresis mobility was seen in the gel electrophoresis experiment as well as the prominent product. The identification of the cross-linking sites of the new photoproduct in the 16S rRNA and tRNA and its correlation with the tRNA P&#x0002f;E hybrid binding state are described here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Preparation of ribosomes, mRNA and tRNA</title><sec><title>E.coli ribosomes</title><p>Washed 70S <italic>E.coli</italic> ribosomes were prepared according to Makhno <italic>et al</italic>.

The mRNA analog contained a Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno sequence and the codon GUU for tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup>; the GUU sequence results in a U-cmo<sup>5</sup>U34 mismatch in the wobble position of the codon&#x02013;anticodon interaction and should allow high reactivity of the cmo<sup>5</sup>U34 nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c9">9</xref>). In the first experiment, tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> 3&#x02032;-labeled with [5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P]pCp, unlabeled tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup>, or biotinylated-[<sup>14</sup>C]Val-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> were non-enzymatically bound to 70S ribosomes. Empty 70S ribosomes and the complexes were irradiated with a xenon lamp using a mylar filter to block wavelengths &#x0003c;310 nm. After irradiation, RNA was extracted from each of the complexes by treatment with proteinase K and phenol extraction, and 16S-sized RNA was then separated from 23S and 5S using agarose gel electrophoresis. The samples (except for the sample already containing <sup>32</sup>P-labeled tRNA) were treated with phosphatase and were 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. All samples were then separated on a denaturing 3.6% polyacrylamide gel, which separates molecules with different inter- or intra-molecular cross-links (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c21">21</xref>). Two bands were expected: one corresponding to the linear, non-cross-linked 16S rRNA and a second, containing 16S rRNA with C1400 cross-linked to cmo<sup>5</sup>U34 of tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c9">9</xref>).</p><p>The tRNA-dependent band (band 2) attributable to the C1400&#x0002f;tRNA cross-link is the most prominent new feature of the electrophoresis pattern in all of the samples containing the tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f1">1</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;4). However, in complexes formed with deacyl-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f1">1</xref>, lanes 2 and 3), an extra band (band 1) is present in the top part of the gel, indicating an RNA species that, based on its electrophoretic mobility, was expected to contain a covalent link between distant nucleotides in the 16S rRNA primary structure. An additional band of lower intensity, band 1a, is present when deacyl-tRNA is non-enzymatically bound to the ribosome.</p><p>Band 1 is present both when the tRNA is 3&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled before irradiation (lane 2) and when the RNA is 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled after purification of 16S-sized RNA on an agarose gel (lane 3), hence it is not connected just to the addition of the [5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P]pCp to the 3&#x02032; end of tRNA prior to irradiation. In addition, in another experiment that used 3&#x02032;-labeled tRNA by an exchange reaction at the 5&#x02032; phosphate of the terminal A with CCA-adding enzyme, the same band 1 photoproduct was seen. Therefore, the appearance of the band is associated specifically with the deacylated state of the tRNA in the P site. There is no change in the frequency of bands 1, 1a and 2 if proteinase K treatment is omitted prior to phenol extraction. This is consistent with the cross-links involving direct RNA&#x02013;RNA reactions without incorporation of ribosomal proteins.</p><p>The position of band 1 is nearly identical to that of a 16S rRNA with an internal cross-link between C967 and C1400 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c21">21</xref>). This indicates a cross-link involving nucleotides distant in the 16S rRNA primary sequence is formed in some way. Importantly, however, bands 1, 1a and 2 are seen in the autoradiogram when tRNA is <sup>32</sup>P-labeled (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f1">1</xref>, lane 2), indicating that tRNA is present as a covalent part of the photoproducts in those bands.</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse transcription analysis of the 16S rRNA cross-linking sites in the bands 1 and 2 RNA</title><p>Reverse transcription experiments were done on RNA purified by 3.6% PAGE to verify the identity of band 2 and to determine the 16S rRNA cross-linking sites in the band 1 RNA. Deacyl-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> was 3&#x02032; labeled with [5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P]pCp and non-enzymatically bound to 70S complexes and after irradiation 16S-sized RNA was separated on a denaturing 3.6% polyacrylamide gel (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f2">2</xref>A). RNA from bands 1 and 2 was isolated for further analysis. A set of primers was used for reverse transcription to identify cross-linking sites. Since the RNA had been pre-purified based on its content of covalent cross-links, fraction- specific reverse transcription stops should be present to indicate the cross-linking sites. The only reverse transcription stop seen in the band 2 RNA and not in control RNA corresponds to a cross-link at C1400 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f2">2</xref>B, lane 6), as expected from the results of Prince <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c9">9</xref>). Band 1 RNA also contained the stop corresponding to a cross-link at 16S rRNA C1400 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f2">2</xref>B, lane 5), although the intensity of the stop in this sample is &#x0223c;50-fold less than the intensity of the stop in the band 2 RNA, reflecting the relative frequency of the two products.</p><p>An additional double reverse transcription stop at nucleotides A968&#x0002f;m<sup>5</sup>C967 is seen in the band 1 RNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f2">2</xref>C, lane 5). This is distinctly different from the single intrinsic reverse transcription stop on m<sup>5</sup>C967, which is due to the post-transcriptional methylation of m<sup>2</sup>G966. The pattern of stops at A968&#x0002f;m<sup>5</sup>C967 in the band 1 RNA is characteristic of cross-linking on nucleotide m<sup>5</sup>C967 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c5">5</xref>). The band 2 RNA did not show the A968 reverse transcription stop corresponding to cross-linking at m<sup>5</sup>C967 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f2">2</xref>C, lane 11). RNA from the lower intensity band 1a was also isolated; reverse transcription stops indicated cross-linking sites at C967 and C1400 were also seen (data not shown). This suggests a close relationship between band 1a and 1; however, it was not possible to isolate enough of the band 1a RNA to analyze it further.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of the cross-linking in tRNA in bands 1 and 2</title><p>One explanation for the involvement of C1400 and m<sup>5</sup>C967 in the band 1 RNA was that, there were two intermolecular cross-links to tRNA, one between C1400 and cmo<sup>5</sup>U34, and another between m<sup>5</sup>C967 and some other nucleotide in the tRNA. Therefore, RNA sequencing reactions and alkaline hydrolysis were done to sequence tRNA from bands 1 and 2 from both ends to determine the cross-linking site(s).</p><p>The tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> was either 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase after dephosphorylation or was 3&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled with the CCA-adding enzyme. The tRNA was non-enzymatically bound to 70S ribosomes programmed with the GUU mRNA analog and the complexes were irradiated. To minimize loss, the purification of 16S rRNA from the 23S and 5S rRNAs by agarose gel electrophoresis was omitted and total RNA was separated on denaturing 3.6% polyacrylamide gels.</p><p>In the experiments in which tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> was 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled, the alkaline hydrolysis ladders from the tRNA in bands 1 and 2 are interrupted at the same position (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f3">3</xref>A, lanes 2 and 3). The last linear fragment before the cross-linking site ends at U33, based on the pattern of RNase U2 digestion of [<sup>32</sup>P]RNA from band 2, and RNase U2 and RNase T1 digestion of control <sup>32</sup>P-labeled tRNA, obtained by photoreversal of the band 2 RNA; therefore, the first cross-linked nucleotide encountered from the 5&#x02032; end is cmo<sup>5</sup>U34. Even though the 5&#x02032;-labeled tRNA was purified by 8% PAGE before complex formation and irradiation, there is a shadow on the bands in all lanes of the sequencing reactions. This shadow leads to an extra band with 3-fold lower intensity after position 33 in tRNA from both bands 1 and 2. However, shadows are present in all lanes, including the sequencing lanes and including the band 2 RNA lanes, which is known to involve only cmo<sup>5</sup>U34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c9">9</xref>), so the shadows must be an artifact.</p><p>In the sequencing of 3&#x02032;-labeled tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup>, the alkaline hydrolysis ladders are again interrupted in the same place for both bands 1 and 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f3">3</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4). Based on the pattern of RNase T1 and RNase U2 digestion of band 2, and RNase U2 and RNase T1 digestion of tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup>, obtained by photoreversal of the band 2 RNA, the identity of the last linear fragment determined from the 3&#x02032; end is A35; therefore, the cross-linking site is cmo<sup>5</sup>U34 in both cases. Unlike the sequence from the 5&#x02032; end, there are no shadows of individual bands, leading to a complete absence of intensity at position 34. There is a band compression somewhere in the sequence between A27 and A35 because a nucleotide is missing between A27 and A35 in the partial alkaline hydrolysis ladder. However, the position of A35 is completely clear and the sequence of the tRNA above A27 and below A35 corresponds to the tRNA sequence (with the exception of reduced RNase T1 recognition of G42&#x02013;46 and reduced RNase U2 recognition of <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine 37). Therefore, we conclude that sequencing from either end of the tRNA identifies cmo<sup>5</sup>U34 as the single site of cross-linking in both band 1 and band 2 RNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Time course for cross-link formation</title><p>A complex of deacyl-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> and 70S ribosomes were irradiated for increasing times with &#x0003e;310 nm light to determine the time course of formation of the bands 1 and 2 photoproducts.

The band 1 product appears less slowly at early times but continues to increase through 80 min, the longest time of irradiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f4">4</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Photoreversal test of the bands 1 and 2 products</title><p>To determine whether the photoproducts in bands 1 and 2 were photoreversible, [3&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P]pCp-labeled tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> was non-enzymatically bound to 70S ribosomes, complexes were irradiated and the RNA from bands 1 and 2 was isolated. The RNAs were then re-irradiated with a germicidal (254 nm) lamp or with wavelengths &#x0003e;310 nm for 1, 2 and 5 min (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f5">5</xref>). In the case of the band 2 RNA, the cross-link is very responsive to 254 nm light, and all of the 3&#x02032; labeled tRNA is released from 16S RNA after 5 min. This is consistent with a cyclobutane dimer structure present in the 16S rRNA(C1400) &#x000d7; tRNA(cmo<sup>5</sup>U34) cross-link. However, band 1 RNA, is insensitive to 254 nm irradiation, indicating that this product does not contain a cyclobutane bridge. Therefore, this product probably does not have the same structure as the phototrimer described previously by Wang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c24">24</xref>), which contained a cyclobutane bridge between two of the three thymines.</p></sec><sec><title>Puromycin reaction of the biotinyl-Val-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup>&#x02013;ribosome complex results in the formation of the band 1 photoproduct</title><p>Since irradiation of 70S complexes containing deacyl-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> produces the additional band 1 photoproduct compared with complexes containing amino-blocked val-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> under the same conditions, the novel photoproduct might be formed by the tRNA in the P&#x0002f;E state as opposed to the P&#x0002f;P state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c25">25</xref>). To test this, biotin-[<sup>14</sup>C]Val-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> was non-enzymatically bound to the P-site of GUU programmed 70S ribosomes and half of this complex was immediately irradiated at 4&#x000b0;C, while the other half was treated with 1 mM puromycin for 10 min at 37&#x000b0;C before irradiation at 4&#x000b0;C. The puromycin reaction was found to be complete in 5 min at 37&#x000b0;C as determined by the ethylacetate extraction assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c26">26</xref>). It is well established that puromycin, which binds to the A-site of 50S subunits as a mimic of the 3&#x02032; end of aminoacyl-tRNA, reacts with the peptide of the tRNA in the 50S P-site via peptidyl transferase activity of the 50S subunit. As a consequence of this, the tRNA is deacylated. From tRNA footprinting experiments, this newly deacylated tRNA occupies the P-site of the 30S subunit and the E site of the 50S subunit (P&#x0002f;E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c25">25</xref>). If the band 1 photoproduct is indicative of tRNA in the hybrid P&#x0002f;E site, reaction of biotin-[<sup>14</sup>C]Val-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> with puromycin should yield a complex capable of forming the phototrimer.</p><p>After the puromycin reaction, there was a 10- to 20-fold higher level of band 1 photoproduct from irradiated tRNA&#x02013;ribosome complexes compared with complexes irradiated before puromycin reaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f6">6</xref>, lane 3 versus lane 2). Biotin-[<sup>14</sup>C]Val-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> non-enzymatically bound to 70S ribosomes formed the band 1 photoproduct to a low extent in this experiment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f6">6</xref>, lane 2); the amount was subsequently related to the amount of deacylated tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> that was present in the tRNA recovered from the complexes. This was present either because of incomplete purification of the biotin-[<sup>14</sup>C]Val-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> or deacylation during incubation at 37&#x000b0;C used to form the complexes. The band 1a photoproduct does not appear after puromycin reaction. The amount of the band 2 photoproduct is not different in the RNA from the complexes irradiated before puromycin treatment compared with those irradiated after puromycin treatment and there is no change in its electrophoretic mobility.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The three nucleotides, tRNA(cmo<sup>5</sup>U34), 16S rRNA(m<sup>5</sup>C967) and 16S rRNA(C1400) have been identified as cross-linking sites in the band 1 photoproduct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f7">7</xref>). This photoproduct occurs specifically in ribosome complexes containing deacylated tRNA, so it is correlated with tRNA in the P&#x0002f;E hybrid state. The electrophoretic mobility of this product is nearly the same as that of a 16S rRNA with an internal cross-link between m<sup>5</sup>C967 and C1400 that results from irradiation with UVB light in the empty ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c21">21</xref>). However, that cross-link is not observed with wavelengths &#x0003e;310 nm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh1001f1">1</xref>) and is not expected in the presence of tRNA&#x02013;ribosome complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c5">5</xref>). In addition, tRNA is present in the band 1 product and the only cross-linking site in the tRNA is at the cmo<sup>5</sup>U34 nucleotide. These properties of the product indicate a phototrimer in which cmo<sup>5</sup>U34 mediates the connection between m<sup>5</sup>C967 and C1400.</p><p>The main types of products formed between pyrimidines after UVB irradiation are dimers containing a cyclobutane bridge between the C5 and C6 bonds of each base, dimers containing a 4-6 bond between the bases and hydrated monomers that arise from direct photohydration or from reversal of dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c29">29</xref>). In the case of the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer, it is fully photoreversible into its constituent parts by re-irradiating the dimer with 254 nm light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c29">29</xref>). Additionally, a thymine phototrimer has been reported to form upon 254 nm UV irradiation of thymine in a frozen aqueous solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c24">24</xref>). The thymine phototrimer was partially photoreversible by 254 nm irradiation and this was consistent with its structure, which contained a cyclobutane dimer and a single 6-4 bond joining the second and the third nucleotides of the trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c24">24</xref>). The absence of any photoreversal in the RNA from band 1 when irradiated at 254 nm argues that none of the covalent bonds connecting the three participants is of the cyclobutane type. On the other hand, the RNA from the band 2 photoproduct was readily reversed in our hands, consistent with its previous characterization of containing the cyclobutane bridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c8">8</xref>).</p><p>The phototrimer is probably formed in a two-step reaction. The prominent photoproduct observed here is the cross-link between C1400 and cmo<sup>5</sup>U34. Because no simple cross-link is seen between m<sup>5</sup>C967 and cmo<sup>5</sup>U34, the order of formation of the trimer is likely to be the addition of C1400 and cmo<sup>5</sup>U34, followed by subsequent addition of m<sup>5</sup>C967. The C1400 &#x000d7; cmo<sup>5</sup>C34 dimer is not photoreversible upon irradiation with wavelengths of &#x0003e;310 nm for 5 min and this is evidence of its low absorbance at this wavelength. Thus, it is likely that the second reaction, which results in the formation of the trimer, is limited by the absorbance of the intermediate and is not an indication of the geometry between m<sup>5</sup>C967 and C1400&#x0003c;&#x0003e;cmo<sup>5</sup>U34, nor is it an indication of the fraction of the deacyl-tRNA complexes that are capable of undergoing the second photoreaction.</p><p>These results indicate that there is likely to be a structural difference in the 30S subunit when the tRNA is in the P&#x0002f;E hybrid state and when the tRNA is in the P&#x0002f;P state. The arrangement between m<sup>5</sup>C967 and the tRNA anticodon must be altered in some way in the P&#x0002f;E state compared with the P&#x0002f;P state. The X-ray structure in this region indicates that the base of nucleotide m<sup>2</sup>G966 is the closest part of the H31 end loop to the anticodon of the tRNA in the P site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c13">13</xref>). The identification of m<sup>5</sup>C967 in the present study was made on the basis of reverse transcription, because of the small amount of the cross-linked band 1 product. However, the appearance of the reverse transcription stop is the same as seen earlier in the m<sup>5</sup>C967 &#x000d7; C1400 cross-link which was confirmed by RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c5">5</xref>). Reconciliation between the C967 &#x000d7; C1400 cross-link and the X-ray structure is possible, since it is not unlikely that the conformation of the empty ribosome is different from the conformation of the ribosome with a P-site bound tRNA. The present results further indicate the conformational complexity of this region&#x02014;there is some significant difference in the structure with tRNA in the P&#x0002f;E versus P&#x0002f;P states and for the P&#x0002f;E state, this is likely to be different than the conformation seen in the X-ray structure.</p><p>An alternative interpretation of the results is related to the issue of the tightness of the tRNA&#x02013;ribosome interaction. Intramolecular 16S rRNA cross-links are correlated to favorable geometrical arrangements between the participating nucleotides but also require local conformational flexibility (W. Huggins, S. K. Ghosh, K. Nanda and P. Wollenzien, unpublished data). In this view, the formation of the phototrimer could be due to changes in the conformational flexibility in the 30S subunit if the structure of the complex with deacyl-tRNA in the P&#x0002f;E state is somehow less restrained than the structure with peptidyl-tRNA in the P&#x0002f;P state.</p><p>It was proposed in 2003 that deacyl-tRNA exists naturally in the P&#x0002f;P state and that binding of the translation factor EFG is necessary for the formation of the P&#x0002f;E tRNA hybrid state on the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c31">31</xref>). However Semenkov <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c32">32</xref>) and more recently Sharma <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c33">33</xref>) have shown that after peptide bond formation the peptidyl tRNA is reactive with puromycin, indicating EFG independent movement of the tRNA acceptor ends on the 50S ribosomal subunit before translocation. Thus, the Semenkov <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c32">32</xref>) and Sharma <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c33">33</xref>) experiments are consistent with the scheme originally proposed by Moazed and Noller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c25">25</xref>). The occurrence of the phototrimer product after puromycin reaction with the biotinyl-Val-tRNA<sub>1</sub><sup>Val</sup> is additional evidence for immediate changes in the tRNA interactions after peptide bond formation. In this case, the changes even involve the 30S subunit and indicate the distinct nature of the P&#x0002f;P and P&#x0002f;E states.</p><p>One complicating factor in comparing the results from these different experiments is that they frequently have been done under different conditions: the experiments described by Moazed and Noller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c25">25</xref>), Semenkov <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c32">32</xref>), Sharma <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c33">33</xref>) and in this report, were done in conventional buffers (K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> cations), the experiments by Zavialov and Ehrenberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c30">30</xref>) and Valle <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c31">31</xref>) and recently by Blanchard <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c3">3</xref>) have been done in different versions of polymix buffers (K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, putrescine and spermidine) and earlier experiments by Agrawal <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c34">34</xref>) were done in a polyamine buffer (K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> supplemented with spermidine and spermine). This is relevant because of the report that the P&#x0002f;P and P&#x0002f;E binding states are in equilibrium, and this depends on the buffer conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh1001c34">34</xref>). The ability to easily quantify the amount of tRNA in the P&#x0002f;E hybrid state through observation of the phototrimer product will allow an independent assessment of the P&#x0002f;E versus P&#x0002f;P equilibration question.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh1001f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Gel electrophoresis separation of RNA cross-linked products.
