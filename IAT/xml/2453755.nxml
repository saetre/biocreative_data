Patients with psoriatic arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and mice with TNF-induced arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] have increased numbers of circulating OCPs, which correlate with systemically increased TNF concentrations and are reduced by anti-TNF therapy in association with clinical improvement. These findings suggest that OCP mobilization from the marrow may be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis. The factors that mediate OCP mobilization are currently unknown.</p><p>Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), a member of the C-X-C chemokine family also known as CXCL12, acts through its receptor CXCR4, and is the master chemokine that modulates trafficking of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Studies of knockout mice reveal that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is required for fetal B lymphopoiesis, bone marrow myelopoiesis and organogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Both SDF-1-deficient and CXCR4-deficient mice die perinatally and have very few hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors within their bone marrow. SDF-1 and CXCR4 have been implicated in OCP migration <italic>in vitro</italic>, and SDF-1 treatment of OCPs increases osteoclastogenesis and subsequent osteoclast bone-resorbing capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>SDF-1 is primarily produced by bone marrow stromal cells, such as osteoblasts and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Expression of SDF-1 is controlled by various factors including hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and cytokines, such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#x003b2;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. G-CSF is used clinically to stimulate the release of hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow into the bloodstream of patients with a variety of malignancies. The stem cells are then harvested from the blood as a source of stem cells to be returned to patients following chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. Whether or not inflammatory cytokines such as TNF affect the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis <italic>in vivo </italic>to control OCP mobilization, however, has not been studied.</p><p>We used TNF-transgenic (TNF-Tg) mice as a model of chronic TNF overexpression and also injected WT mice with TNF as an acute model to investigate the involvement of TNF in the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis control of OCP mobilization. We found that TNF directly inhibits SDF-1 production by bone marrow stromal cells and that it has little effect on CXCR4 expression by OCPs. A mechanism whereby TNF accelerates OCP mobilization in inflammatory erosive arthritis may therefore be to reduce bone marrow SDF-1 concentrations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and animals</title><p>Recombinant murine SDF-1, TNF&#x003b1;, and RANKL were from R&#x00026;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).

To investigate whether the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis &#x02013; the master chemokine system controlling mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors &#x02013; mediates TNF-induced OCP mobilization, we first verified that OCPs express functional CXCR4 and migrate toward a SDF-1 gradient in a combined chemotaxis/osteoclastogenesis assay. M-CSF-dependent bone marrow mononuclear cells were generated <italic>in vitro </italic>and were used as the source of OCPs.

We also cultured nonmigrated OCPs from the upper chamber with M-CSF and RANKL, and compared their osteoclast forming potency with those that have migrated to SDF-1 gradient (100 ng/ml) in the lower chamber. Both nonmigrated and migrated OCPs can give rise to mature osteoclasts, but the cells from the lower chamber formed more osteoclasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>, left panel). In contrast, cells that were freely migrated to the lower chamber without a SDF-1 gradient did not form osteoclasts under the same condition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>, right panel).

In the present study, we investigated whether the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is involved in TNF-mediated OCP mobilization because this chemokine system plays an essential role in hematopoietic stem cell and progenitor homing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We found that TNF directly inhibits bone marrow stromal cell production of SDF-1 and reduces SDF-1 levels in the bone marrow, which is accompanied with an increase in the egress of OCPs from the marrow. Decreased SDF-1 production by bone marrow stromal cells in response to TNF overexpression may therefore be one of the mechanisms mediating release of OCPs to the peripheral blood in mice with TNF-induced arthritis or in patients with inflammatory arthritis.</p><p>SDF-1-regulated cell mobilization is determined by local SDF-1 gradients and/or CXCR4 expression on target cells. Although alternation of either of these could lead to impaired cell mobilization and homing, external factor regulation of SDF-1 expression levels appears to be the major mechanism. For example, hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and cytokines &#x02013; including TGF&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and G-CSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] &#x02013; all reduce SDF-1 levels and stimulate hematopoietic stem cell release from bone marrow. Regulation of CXCR4 expression by external factors has been studied less and the results have been inconsistent. This inconsistency may be related to small numbers of CXCR4-expressing cells and low expression levels by these cells, making it difficult to reliably detect a change in the number of CXCR4-positive cells.</p><p>Our findings that TNF significantly decreases SDF-1 levels but has little effect on OCP CXCR4 expression suggest that, like most hematopoietic cell mobilizers, TNF also promotes OCP mobilization through regulation of SDF-1 rather than through CXCR4 expression. TNF-mediated OCP mobilization, however, is different from stem cell and precursor mobilization induced by SDF-1, G-CSF or other agents because TNF also has a strong stimulatory effect on OCP generation. This represents a unique pathologic situation in chronic inflammatory arthritis, in that the entire process of generation of OCPs and their egress from the bone marrow is accelerated in response to TNF. This situation leads to increased numbers of OCPs in both bone marrow and blood, whereas SDF-1 or G-CSF administration triggers a rapid release of cells from the bone marrow &#x02013; and the total bone marrow cell number is consequently reduced.</p><p>We do not currently know the molecular mechanisms by which TNF inhibits SDF-1 production. SDF-1 is regulated at both transcriptional and post-translational levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We found that TNF induced massive apoptosis of ST2 cells when a transcription or translation inhibitor was used with TNF (data not shown). In these circumstances it is therefore difficult to investigate the mechanism of action for TNF. Protease degradation is one of the major mechanisms to reduce SDF-1 protein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and protease release from neutrophils and other myeloid cells can be stimulated by TNF. However TNF may also inhibit SDF-1 expression at the RNA level within 8 hours of treatment as shown by our data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>).</p><p>TGF&#x003b2; at concentrations as low as 0.01 ng/ml decreases SDF-1 mRNA expression in stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], implying that a small change in TGF&#x003b2; could alter SDF-1 concentrations. We found that TNF increases TGF&#x003b2; mRNA expression in ST2 cells. TNF administration to wild-type mice had no effect on TGF&#x003b2; expression, however, although it significantly decreased SDF-1 expression in bone marrow stromal cells. Therefore it is unlikely that TGF&#x003b2; mediates TNF-induced bone marrow SDF-1 downregulation <italic>in vivo</italic>. G-CSF is another cytokine that downregulates SDF-1 mRNA expression in osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. TNF did not increase G-CSF in ST2 cells (data not shown), however, suggesting that the reduction in SDF-1 induced by TNF <italic>in vitro </italic>is not mediated by G-CSF. Furthermore, the SDF-1 promoter does not contain binding sites typically present in the other CXC chemokine promoters, especially for NF-&#x003ba;B, interferon regulatory factor recognition elements or NF-IL6, which are associated with transcriptional activation in response to proinflammatory extracellular signals, such as TNF, IL-6 or interferons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These data suggest that studying SDF-1 regulation may be more complicated than studying other CXC chemokines.</p><p>The present study did not provide a direct association between TNF-reduced SDF-1 production and OCP mobilization <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have attempted to answer this question using mice with CXCR4 specifically deleted in OCPs by generating CXCR4 CKO mice via crossing CXCR4 floxed mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] with CD11b-Cre mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We injected TNF to these CXCR4 conditional mice to determine whether TNF-induced increased OCP release is altered when CXCR4 expression has theoretically been deleted in CD11b-expressing OCPs. Unfortunately, we found that only about 50% of bone marrow CD11b<sup>+ </sup>cells have no CXCR4 surface expression in these CXCR4 CKO mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>), suggesting a low excision frequency of the Cre recombinase in our system. With this leaky system, the blood OCP frequency was similar between CXCR4 CKO mice and wild-type mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>). Our results suggest that CD11b-Cre mice appear not a good system to delete the gene encoding <italic>cxcr4 </italic>in bone marrow CD11b-positive cells.</p><p>The importance of TNF-mediated reduction in SDF-1 production in increased OCP mobilization <italic>in vivo </italic>needs to be further confirmed using a model where SDF-1 concentration in the bone marrow is maintained in the presence of TNF. Since rheumatoid arthritis and other forms of inflammatory bone disorders are chronic diseases, however, multiple factors may contribute to promote OCP release from the bone marrow. For example, we have demonstrated that TNF-stimulated OCP formation could increase the OCP pool in bone marrow and push cell egression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Kindle and colleagues reported that TNF activates endothelial cells and increases the attachment of OCPs to vascular endothelium <italic>in vitro. </italic>They speculated that this could increase the ability of OCPs to enter the bloodstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It has been reported recently that RANKL-stimulated osteoclastogenesis promotes the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells by cleaving SDF-1 through bone-resorbing proteinase, cathepsin K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. TNF stimulates osteoclastogenesis synergistically with RANKL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and this mechanism may also apply to TNF-induced OCP mobilization. The regulation of OCP mobilization is therefore a complicated process, and decreased SDF-1 expression by bone marrow stromal cells may represent another important mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that TNF directly inhibits bone marrow stromal cells to produce SDF-1, which is associated with increased release of OCPs from the bone marrow. The SDF1/CXCR4 axis therefore may not only control hematopoietic cell homing, but may also contribute to the accelerated OCP mobilization in inflammatory arthritis where systemic TNF levels are elevated.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CKO = conditional knockout; ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FACS = fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FITC = fluorescein isothiocyanate; G-CSF = granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; IL = interleukin; M-CSF = macrophage colony-stimulating factor; NF = nuclear factor; OCPs = osteoclast precursors; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline PCR = polymerase chain reaction; RANKL = receptor activator of nuclear factor-B ligand; RT = reverse transcriptase; SDF-1 = stromal cell-derived factor 1; Tg = transgenic; TGF&#x003b2; = transforming growth factor beta; TNF = tumor necrosis factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LX had full access to all data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
