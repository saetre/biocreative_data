In this study, we show that leptin, which instead inhibits insulin secretion, partly uses the sympathetic nervous system to fulfill this function. Remarkably, for our purpose, an osteoblast-specific ablation of sympathetic signaling results in a leptin-dependent hyperinsulinemia. In osteoblasts, sympathetic tone stimulates expression of <italic>Esp</italic>, a gene inhibiting the activity of osteocalcin, which is an insulin secretagogue. Accordingly, <italic>Esp</italic> inactivation doubles hyperinsulinemia and delays glucose intolerance in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice, whereas <italic>Osteocalcin</italic> inactivation halves their hyperinsulinemia. By showing that leptin inhibits insulin secretion by decreasing osteocalcin bioactivity, this study illustrates the importance of the relationship existing between fat and skeleton for the regulation of glucose homeostasis.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: HA, hydroxyapatite; ICV, intracerebroventricular; ITT, insulin tolerance test; WT, wild type.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Our understanding of the mechanisms regulating insulin secretion at the organismal level improved greatly recently with the identification of several novel hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herman and Kahn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gesta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2007</xref>).

Remarkably, hyperinsulinemia and low blood glucose levels were also present in newborn and 1-wk-old <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). To understand how this marked hyperinsulinemia develops in mice that are otherwise metabolically normal, we studied islet gene expression and &#x003b2;-cell proliferation in WT and <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. Expression of the <italic>Insulin</italic> genes and of <italic>Glucokinase</italic>, a central component of the glucose-sensing machinery of &#x003b2; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grupe et al., 1995</xref>), was increased 50% and 140%, respectively, in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), at least partly explaining the aforementioned increased insulin levels. Serum c-peptide levels were increased 2.5-fold in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (Fig. S1 E). There was also a small but detectable and reproducible increase in insulin content in <italic>ob/ob</italic> pancreata (Fig. S1 F). In addition, expression of <italic>Cdk4</italic>, a gene favoring &#x003b2;-cell proliferation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rane et al., 1999</xref>), was up-regulated 50% in <italic>ob/ob</italic> islets, and Ki67 immunostaining showed a significant increase in &#x003b2;-cell proliferation in <italic>ob/ob</italic> compared with WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). Undetectable increases in &#x003b2;-cell area and &#x003b2;-cell mass (Fig. S1, G and H) indicate that the absence of leptin affects circulating insulin levels primarily by regulating insulin expression and secretion in addition to the possibility of changes of cell survival. Nevertheless, these results establish that leptin is a physiological regulator of serum insulin levels independent of the influence it may have on insulin sensitivity.</p><p>We asked whether similar abnormalities were present in mice lacking adipocytes altogether. 2-wk-old adipocyte-deficient mice were also markedly hyperinsulinemic and had a significant drop in blood glucose levels; this hyperinsulinemia was also observed at birth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, F and G</xref>; and Fig. S1, I and J). Expression of <italic>Insulin</italic>, <italic>Glucokinase</italic>, and <italic>Cdk4</italic> was up-regulated to the same extent in islets of adipocyte-deficient and <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>), and insulin content was significantly increased in islets of adipocyte-deficient mice (Fig. S1 K). &#x003b2;-cell proliferation, area, and mass were all significantly increased in adipocyte-deficient mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, I&#x02013;K</xref>; and Fig. S1 L). Collectively, and although insulin resistance may have favored &#x003b2;-cell proliferation in the adipocyte-deficient mice, the data presented here show that hyperinsulinemia and lower blood glucose levels precede the appearance of obesity and hyperglycemia in <italic>ob/ob</italic> and adipocyte-deficient mice, respectively, and can be ascribed in both cases to an increase in <italic>Insulin</italic> and <italic>Glucokinase</italic> expression and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in &#x003b2;-cell proliferation. More severe hyperinsulinemia in adipocyte-deficient mice than in ob/ob mice indicates that in addition to leptin deficiency, other mechanisms affect insulin secretion in the former model.</p></sec><sec><title>Multiple mechanisms contribute to leptin regulation of insulin secretion</title><p>Next, we studied leptin influence on isolated islets. When using WT islets cultured in low or high glucose concentration, we failed to observe a decrease in the amount of insulin secreted in the medium after leptin treatment. In contrast, leptin did decrease insulin secretion by <italic>ob/ob</italic> islets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, L and M</xref>). This result supports the notion that this hormone acts directly on &#x003b2; cells to regulate insulin secretion; however, the decrease observed was too modest to explain why the absence of leptin would result in a 2.5-fold increase in circulating insulin levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In the face of these results, we asked whether islets isolated from mice harboring an activating mutation in the leptin receptor (<italic>L/L</italic> mice; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bj&#x000f6;rnholm et al., 2007</xref>) might be a better tool to uncover a more significant direct effect of leptin on &#x003b2; cells. In this study, again we observed only a modest decrease in insulin secretion after leptin treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 N</xref>). The marked increase in insulin secretion by high glucose concentration served as an internal positive control and indicated that the islets used in all of these experiments were in good condition. Collectively, data obtained using islets isolated from WT, <italic>ob/ob</italic>, and <italic>L/L</italic> mice verified that leptin acts locally on &#x003b2; cells to inhibit insulin secretion but were also consistent with the hypothesis that in addition to this direct effect, leptin may use indirect mechanisms to regulate insulin secretion.</p></sec><sec><title>Leptin-dependent sympathetic regulation of insulin secretion</title><p>Given what is known about the mediation of most of its functions, the aforementioned results prompted us to ask whether leptin also uses a neuronal relay to inhibit insulin secretion. Thus, we crossed mice harboring a floxed allele of the leptin receptor gene <italic>Lepr</italic> (<italic>Lepr-flox/flox</italic>) with <italic>Synapsin-Cre</italic> transgenic mice to remove the leptin receptor in all neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">van de Wall et al., 2008</xref>). 1-mo-old <italic>Synapsin-Cre</italic>;<italic>Lepr-flox/flox</italic> (<italic>Lepr<sub>syn</sub><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) mice had a normal body weight but harbored a significant increase in serum insulin levels, indicating that in vivo there is a significant neuronal contribution to the leptin regulation of insulin secretion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 O</xref> and Fig. S1 M).</p><p>We noted that in <italic>Lepr<sub>syn</sub><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, sympathetic tone, as measured by <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression in brown fat and serum levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine, was low (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A&#x02013;C</xref>). This decrease, similar to the one observed in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice, led us to ask whether the sympathetic tone could be a mediator of the leptin-dependent neuronal regulation of insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berthoud and Jeanrenaud, 1979</xref>). WT, <italic>ob/ob</italic>, and adipocyte-deficient newborn pups were treated for 2 wk with sympathomimetics acting through &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptors (isoproterenol) or through the Adr&#x003b1;2 (clonidine) or Adr&#x003b1;1 (phenylephrine) receptors. Neither phenylephrine nor clonidine affected serum insulin levels in any of the mouse models tested; in contrast, isoproterenol used at a moderate dose (3 mg/kg) significantly decreased circulating insulin levels in <italic>ob/ob</italic> and adipocyte-deficient mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). Isoproterenol increased <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression in brown fat, supporting the notion that there was an increase in sympathetic tone following this treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Isoproterenol did not affect circulating insulin in WT mice, probably because it was used at a dose that did not cause a massive increase in sympathetic tone. Indeed, <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression was not significantly increased in WT mice by isoproterenol (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Collectively, these observations establish that the sympathetic tone acting through &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptors regulates insulin secretion.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Sympathetic signaling in osteoblasts regulates insulin expression and secretion.</bold> (A) <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression in brown fat of <italic>Lepr<sub>syn</sub><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice.

Collectively, the results presented in this study support the hypothesis that the leptin-dependent sympathetic inhibition of insulin secretion occurs in part via the osteoblast and acts by modulating osteocalcin activity.</p><p>Our results reveal that leptin inhibits the endocrine function of the skeleton. Indeed, to a substantial extent, leptin's inhibition of insulin secretion relies on a three-step cascade, including (1) leptin's up-regulation of sympathetic tone, (2) sympathetic enhancement of <italic>Esp</italic> expression in osteoblasts, and (3) decrease in osteocalcin bioactivity. Osteocalcin acts in this context primarily by regulating insulin expression and secretion. These results do not contradict that leptin acts locally on &#x003b2; cells to inhibit insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Covey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Morioka et al., 2007</xref>); rather, they reveal an additional pathway whereby leptin fulfills this function. Beyond linking two secreted molecules, i.e., leptin and osteocalcin, these observations establish that the metabolic connection between osteoblasts and adipocytes is tighter than originally thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karsenty, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rosen, 2008</xref>). This cross talk includes an important functional component because osteoblasts mediate a significant part of one of the endocrine functions on adipocytes. This unexpected functional relationship between adipocytes, neurons, sympathetic tone, and osteoblasts illustrates in vivo the importance of the skeleton in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and provides an example of how critical the interplay is between multiple organs in the establishment and regulation of major physiological functions in vertebrates.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals, treatments, and surgical procedures</title><p><italic>Adr&#x003b1;2A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (Q.
