Meiosis is a modified cell cycle in which segregation of homologous chromosomes is followed by segregation of sister chromatids without an intervening S phase. These unique divisions are controlled by general mitotic cell-cycle regulators as well as specialized meiotic proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. During oogenesis in multicellular organisms, meiosis presents a particular regulatory challenge. The meiotic divisions must be coordinated tightly with growth and development of the oocyte to allow for oocyte differentiation and to ensure that the completion of meiosis is coordinated with fertilization. To achieve this coordination, oocytes arrest at prophase I and again at metaphase I or metaphase II and are released from these arrests through processes called oocyte maturation and activation, respectively &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, additional specialized cell-cycle regulation is required for the transition between meiosis and restart of the cell cycle in embryogenesis. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, meiosis is completed without cytokinesis in the same common cytoplasm in which the rapid mitotic divisions of embryogenesis begin. Upon fertilization, the oocyte must quickly inactivate meiotic regulators to prevent interference with embryonic mitotic cycles. The ways in which general mitotic proteins act together with meiosis-specific proteins to meet the multiple regulatory challenges of meiosis in metazoans are not well understood.</p><p>The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) plays a critical role in mitosis, but much remains to be understood about its function in meiosis. The APC/C is a large E3 ubiquitin ligase composed of at least 12 core subunits, which targets specific substrate proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. In mitosis, the APC/C is crucial for proper cell division through targeting of key substrates. Securin, an inhibitor of separase, must be degraded to allow for cleavage of cohesin and subsequent segregation of sister chromatids, and mitotic cyclins must be degraded to allow for the metaphase to anaphase transition and events associated with mitotic exit &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, the APC/C targets many other proteins for degradation including proteins involved in spindle function and regulators of DNA replication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Substrate specificity is conferred to the APC/C by activator proteins Cdc20/Fizzy and Cdh1/Fizzy-related, which recognize substrate proteins containing D-box or KEN box motifs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b011">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Regulation of these specificity factors is one crucial way by which APC/C activity is modulated. Cdc20 is transcribed and translated during S phase and G2, phosphorylated in mitosis, and degraded in an APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup>-dependent manner in G1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b016">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Phosphorylation of several APC/C subunits in mitosis facilitates the ability of Cdc20 to bind to and activate the APC/C &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b020">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Levels of Cdh1 are constant in mitosis and lowered in late G1 and S, but inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdh1 prevents its association with APC/C during S, G2, and M phases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, differential regulation of Cdc20 and Cdh1 directs their transient association with the APC/C at different times during the cell cycle to target specific subsets of proteins for degradation.</p><p>In meiosis, the role of the APC/C and its regulation is less clear. An appealing hypothesis is that the meiotic divisions are driven in part by the degradation of specific meiotic APC/C substrates, and thus, the APC/C must require unique regulation during these divisions. In yeast, it is known that disjunction of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I and sister chromatids in meiosis II requires APC-mediated destruction of Pds1/securin to release separase for cleavage of cohesin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b025">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. In multicellular organisms, however, a requirement for the APC/C in meiosis has been more difficult to demonstrate. Mutations in or RNA interference against APC/C subunits in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> result in a metaphase I arrest &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.

Several studies in mouse oocytes have shown that APC/C-mediated protein degradation is required for homolog disjunction and polar body extrusion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b031">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.

The reasons behind this apparent inconsistency in <italic>Xenopus</italic> remain unknown.</p><p>One way in which the APC/C may be regulated uniquely in meiosis is through its association with meiosis-specific activators. Cdc20/FZY family members that are expressed exclusively in meiosis have been identified in yeast.

The identification and study of meiosis-specific APC/C activators are starting points from which to understand the unique regulation of the APC/C during meiosis as well as to identify meiosis-specific substrates of the APC/C.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> provides the best candidate for a meiosis-specific APC/C activator in metazoans. <italic>cortex</italic> (<italic>cort</italic>) encodes a distant member of the Cdc20/FZY family and is expressed exclusively in oogenesis and early embryogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>cort</italic> is required for proper female meiosis.

In this study, we demonstrate that CORT interacts biochemically with the APC/C during female meiosis and reveal a mechanism for developmental regulation of <italic>cort</italic> through both post-transcriptional and post-translational processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CORT Protein Is Associated with the APC/C In Vivo</title><p>A recent study suggested that the cortex gene encodes a functional activator of the APC/C &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. This assertion was based on the ability of <italic>cort</italic> to affect cyclin protein levels. Levels of mitotic cyclins are elevated in <italic>cort</italic> mutants, and misexpression of <italic>cort</italic> causes decreased levels of cyclins in wing imaginal discs. While these data are strong evidence of <italic>cort</italic>'s function as an activator of the APC/C, demonstration of a physical association between CORT and the APC/C during oogenesis is lacking. We looked for an association between CORT and the APC/C by co-immunoprecipitation. We made transgenic lines with a MYC-tagged form of <italic>cort</italic> under control of the UAS response element and drove MYC-CORT expression in the female germline using <italic>nos-gal4</italic>. MYC-CORT is functional, because expression of this transgene rescued the meiotic arrest in progeny of <italic>cort<sup>RH65</sup></italic> mutant females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030202-st001">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>We immunoprecipitated MYC-CORT from ovary extracts using a MYC antibody. Cdc27 and Cdc16, tetratricopeptide repeat core subunits of the APC/C, co-immunoprecipitate with MYC-CORT but not with a control mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030202-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) (unpublished data). Morula (MR), the APC2 homolog in Drosophila, does not co-immunoprecipitate with MYC-CORT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030202-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Data from <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> suggest that the APC/C exists in two distinct subcomplexes bridged together by Apc1. One subcomplex contains Apc2 and Apc11, while the other contains the tetratricopeptide proteins Cdc27, Cdc16, and Cdc23 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. Failure of MR to co-immunoprecipitate with MYC-CORT may be explained by a tighter and more direct association of CORT with the tetratricopeptide protein-containing subcomplex but not with the Apc2-containing subcomplex. Furthermore, buffer conditions may be causing CORT to dissociate from MR, as extensive high-salt washes of human APC cause dissociation of Apc2 and Apc11 from the rest of the complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. On the basis of previous studies of APC/C, we still think it is likely that CORT acts together with MR and Cdc27 in one complex. As an additional control, we immunoprecipitated an unrelated MYC-tagged protein, PLU-MYC, from ovary extracts to confirm that the associations of Cdc27 and Cdc16 with CORT are specific. Neither Cdc27 nor Cdc16 co-immunoprecipitate with PLU-MYC, indicating that they are associating with CORT and not with the MYC tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030202-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) (unpublished data).</p><fig id="pgen-0030202-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CORT Protein Associates with the APC/C In Vivo</title><p>(A) Cdc27 co-immunoprecipitates with MYC-CORT.

These results parallel the timing of changes in CORT protein levels in a wild-type background; CORT levels normally drop by the time that meiosis is completed, and, similarly, the dependence of CORT degradation on <italic>mr</italic> is only apparent in unfertilized eggs, in which meiosis has been completed. These results strongly suggest that CORT is targeted for degradation by the APC/C at some point after the release of the metaphase I arrest and by the time that the meiotic divisions are completed. The specific timing of CORT degradation suggests that it is critical for development of the embryo that CORT protein levels be greatly reduced by the time meiosis is completed.</p><p>The APC/C targets proteins for degradation through recognition of specific motifs in its substrates. The two most common motifs are D-boxes (R-X-X-L-X-X-X-X-N) and KEN boxes (K-E-N-X-X-X-E/D/N), although additional motifs have been identified &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;.

We mutated all of the conserved residues in CORT's D-box to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030202-g005">Figure 5</xref>B) and tagged it with MYC to distinguish the protein from endogenous CORT. We know that a MYC-tagged form of CORT is regulated in a similar way to endogenous CORT, because transgenic MYC-tagged CORT is degraded with similar developmental timing in embryos to endogenous CORT in vivo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030202-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).

We found that D-box mutant CORT is stabilized compared to wild-type CORT. Thus, the D-box motif in CORT is required for its degradation in early embryos.</p><p>Given our previous observation that <italic>cort</italic> mRNA is deadenylated in early embryos, we wondered if this regulatory mechanism also contributes to the drop in CORT protein levels after the completion of meiosis. To determine whether Ccr4-mediated deadenylation of <italic>cort</italic> mRNA is required for low levels of CORT in early embryos, we looked at CORT protein levels in <italic>ccr4</italic> mutants by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030202-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). We found that CORT protein levels are unchanged in both <italic>ccr4/Df</italic> stage 14 oocytes and 0&#x02013;1-h embryos when compared to heterozygous sibling controls. This result suggests that although <italic>ccr4</italic> is required for <italic>cort</italic> deadenylation, it is not required for a subsequent decrease in protein levels. Thus, APC/C-mediated degradation of CORT is the primary mechanism by which CORT protein levels are lowered in early embryos. It is likely that deadenylation serves as a backup mechanism to block future synthesis of CORT after fertilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>CORT Is Likely to Be Targeted for Degradation by APC/C<sup>FZY</sup></title><p>Given the dependence of CORT degradation on <italic>mr</italic> and an intact D-box, we wanted to determine which APC/C activator is responsible for CORT's destruction.

We found that CORT protein physically associates with the APC/C in vivo and confirmed its function as an APC/C activator. We looked at levels of mitotic APC/C substrates in <italic>cort</italic> mutants and found that Cyclin A is targeted for destruction by APC/C<sup>CORT</sup> in mature metaphase I arrested oocytes while Cyclin B, Cyclin B3, and PIMPLES/Securin are not targeted until egg activation. Developmental analysis of CORT protein showed that it is translated at oocyte maturation, and appearance of the protein correlates with polyadenylation of <italic>cort</italic> mRNA. Finally, we found that <italic>cort</italic> is regulated post-transcriptionally and post-translationally after the completion of meiosis. <italic>cort</italic> mRNA is deadenylated in early embryos, and CORT protein is degraded after egg activation in an APC/C-dependent manner. CORT contains a conserved D-box motif that is required for the efficiency of its degradation. Our results shed light on the mechanism for the regulation of a meiosis-specific APC/C activator, which results in restriction of its expression to a specific developmental time point.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>CORT Is an Activator of the APC/C</title><p>In this study, our demonstration of a physical interaction between CORT and the APC/C strengthens and confirms previous suggestions that <italic>cort</italic> encodes a functional meiosis-specific APC/C activator.

Our studies of <italic>cortex</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggest that developmental control of levels of a meiosis-specific APC/C activator is one way in which meiosis is developmentally regulated, which has not been previously observed in a multicellular organism. This strategy exploits ongoing regulatory mechanisms occurring during meiosis and embryogenesis: cytoplasmic polyadenylation during oocyte maturation, deadenylation after egg activation, and APC/C-dependent degradation in the early embryo.</p><p>Cytoplasmic polyadenylation upon oocyte maturation has been shown to translationally activate maternal transcripts of genes that are required for meiotic entry, transition between meiosis I and meiosis II, and metaphase II arrest in vertebrates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. We have shown that <italic>cort</italic> mRNA is polyadenylated at oocyte maturation, which adds an APC/C subunit to this group of transcripts that are translationally unmasked for entry into the meiotic divisions. What is the signal for polyadenylation of <italic>cort</italic>? Masked transcripts contain a <italic>cis</italic>-acting cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) to which CPE binding protein (CPEB) is bound. Phosphorylation of CPEB upon oocyte maturation triggers elongation of the poly(A) tail and activation of translation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;. We have not yet identified a CPE in the 3&#x02032; UTR of <italic>cort</italic>, although CPE sequences are quite variable. In addition, we have tested but have not observed a dependence of <italic>cort</italic> polyadenylation on <italic>orb</italic>, the CPEB homolog in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (unpublished data). Because the <italic>orb</italic> alleles we used are hypomorphic, we cannot fully rule out the possibility that polyadenylation of <italic>cort</italic> is <italic>orb</italic>/CPEB-dependent.</p><p>Egg activation triggers maternal transcript destabilization in several organisms, some of which occurs through <italic>ccr4</italic>-dependent deadenylation, and this is likely to be important for localization of maternal transcripts in the embryo and proper zygotic development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030202-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. We showed in this study that <italic>cort</italic> mRNA is deadenylated in the early embryo in a <italic>ccr4</italic>-dependent manner, but this deadenylation is not required for lowering CORT protein levels. However, we may not be able to detect a difference in protein levels because of the rapid APC/C-dependent degradation of CORT protein that occurs after release of the metaphase I arrest.

We found that CORT is targeted for APC/C-dependent degradation by the completion of meiosis in the early embryo.

Second, we show here that <italic>cort</italic> and <italic>fzy</italic> interact genetically in a way that is consistent with <italic>cort</italic> being a negative downstream target of <italic>fzy</italic> in embryos. Third, in our embryo injection experiments, we showed that exogenous MYC-CORT is degraded in a D-box&#x02013;dependent manner in injected embryos. Because the only APC/C activator in early embryos is FZY, degradation of MYC-CORT is likely to occur through APC/C<sup>FZY</sup> in this assay.</p><p>It is also possible the APC/C<sup>CORT</sup> regulates itself in a negative feedback loop by targeting CORT for degradation when levels of CORT reach a certain threshold at the end of meiosis. To address this possibility, we looked at the degradation of CORT in a homozygous <italic>cort<sup>QW55</sup></italic> background in which there is no functional CORT protein. CORT<sup>QW55</sup> mutant protein is not degraded at the transition from mature stage 14 oocytes to unfertilized eggs, unlike in a heterozygous control background (unpublished data). These results suggest that CORT could be targeted by itself, but it remains a possibility that the lesion in the <italic>cort<sup>QW55</sup></italic> allele prevents an interaction between CORT<sup>QW55</sup> mutant protein and the APC/C machinery. The lesion does not disrupt the D-box, but it could affect proper folding and structure of the protein. In summary, we conclude that CORT is targeted for degradation by the APC/C. It is most likely that FZY is the participating APC/C activator, but CORT may also contribute to targeting itself for degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Role of Meiosis-Specific Activators in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>Recent work has shown that both <italic>cort</italic> and <italic>fzy</italic> are required for the meiotic divisions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> female meiosis.

Samples were prepared containing 250 ng/&#x003bc;l wild-type or mutant <italic>cort</italic> RNA in injection buffer (5 mM KCl, 0.1 M K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> &#x0005b;pH 7.8&#x0005d;). A no RNA control contained injection buffer alone. Each sample was injected into 150 embryos. After 40 min at room temperature, the embryos were harvested in heptane, washed 2 times in embryo wash (0.4&#x00025; NaCl, 0.03&#x00025; Triton X-100), and homogenized in 20 &#x003bc;l USB. Extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. The experiment was repeated 5 independent times to confirm results.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Egg fixation, staining, and microscopy.</title><p>Eggs were collected for 0&#x02013;3 h for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030202-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and for 2&#x02013;4 h for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030202-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, dechorionated in 50&#x00025; bleach, devitellinized in methanol and heptane, and fixed in methanol for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C.
