Independently, two different approaches yielded two cDNA clones highly homologous to the MSSP cDNAs, suggesting an involvement of MSSP in the regulation of the cell cycle (scr2) and in the repression of HIV-1 and ILR2 alpha-promoter transcription (human YC1). Screening human genomic libraries, we have isolated clones belonging to two different gene loci. Whereas the human MSSP gene 1 turned out to be intronless, the organization of the coding sequence within gene 2 is more complex. It spans more than 60 kb and contains 16 exons (including two alternative first exons), ranging from 48 to 287 bp, respectively. The intron sizes vary from 0.1 to more than 13 kb. Gene 1 has been completely sequenced. A deletion series of its upstream region was conjugated to the luciferase gene, but the transfection of the constructs did not display any promoter activity. Moreover, compared with gene 2 and the cDNA sequences known so far, about 20 point mutations as well as flanking direct repeats have been detected in the MSSP gene 1, showing that it possesses all the characteristics of processed retropseudogenes. Sequence analysis of a 1.7 kb fragment of the 5' flanking region of the MSSP gene 2 revealed that the promoter of gene 2 lacks consensus sequences for TATA and CCAAT boxes, is GC-rich, and contains numerous potential transcription factor binding elements including an Sp1 binding site. DNase I footprinting experiments showed that the putative Sp1 site was bound by proteins. The results of primer extension and S1 mapping analyses suggested the transcription of the gene starts at multiple positions upstream from the initiator methionine codon. Luciferase assays employing progressive deletions of the 1.7 kb promoter region allowed us to define the minimal promoter region of 428 bp (-488/+) and revealed a complex pattern of the transcriptional regulation the human MSSP gene 2. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the MSSP gene 2 encodes both MSSP-1 and MSSP-2, and moreover scr2 and human YC1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
