[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). Among the best studied examples of cullin/RING enzymes are the so-called SCF complexes. SCF complexes share homologues of the core components cullin 1 (CUL1), SKP1, and the RING domain protein HRT1/RBX1/ROC1, which associate with different F-box proteins and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. F-box proteins specifically bind substrates, following their phosphorylation in response to activation of various signaling pathways. Although substrate phosphorylation is one major determinant of SCF-mediated ubiquitylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], covalent modification of the CUL1 subunit through attachment of the ubiquitin-related peptide NEDD8 also regulates SCF activity. NEDD8 modification stimulates SCF-dependent substrate ubiquitylation <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and mutant CUL1 resistant to NEDD8 modification is defective <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition, fission yeast mutants deficient in the enzymes that attach Ned8p, or in the <italic>ned8</italic> gene itself, are inviable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In addition to CUL1, the human genome contains at least five other cullins, CUL 2, 3, 4A, 4B, and 5. This diversity is partially recapitulated in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, which encodes <italic>pcu3</italic> and <italic>pcu4</italic>, homologues of human CUL3 and CUL4, for which there are no direct correlates in budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. All human cullins interact with HRT1/RBX1/ROC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], are modified by NEDD8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and have ubiquitin ligase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Similarly, the fission yeast cullins Pcu1p and Pcu4p are neddylated, and neddylation is critical for their function <italic>in vivo</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>While it is clear that neddylation affects the activity of cullin/RING complexes, mechanisms controlling this modification are just emerging. A recent study by Lyapina <italic>et al.</italic> uncovered a novel connection between the COP9/signalosome (CSN) and cullin neddylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. CSN is a highly conserved multiprotein complex consisting of eight subunits, which have been implicated in a wide variety of regulatory processes, including, cell cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], transcriptional activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and plant photomorphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. To date, no distinct biochemical activity has been identified that can reconcile this diversity in CSN functions. The eight CSN subunits show a one-to-one relationship to components of the 19S proteasome lid complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and, like <italic>pcu3</italic> and <italic>pcu4</italic>, at least seven of the eight human subunits are conserved in fission yeast, but not in budding yeast. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Lyapina <italic>et al.</italic> recently showed that disruption of <italic>S. pombe</italic> CSN subunit 1 (<italic>caa1/csn1</italic>) results in accumulation of Pcu1p in the neddylated state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, it remained unclear whether this reflects global control of multiple cullins by Csn1p as part of the entire CSN complex. We have examined this question by determining the effect of disruption of several CSN subunits on Pcu3p neddylation, localization, and ubiquitin ligase activity. Our results indicate that the entire CSN complex is required for proper control of the neddylation state of multiple cullins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Pcu3p is modified by Ned8p</title><p>Immunoblotting of protein lysates prepared from <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells, whose <italic>pcu3</italic> chromosomal locus was modified to encode Pcu3p with thirteen copies of the Myc epitope attached to its C-terminus, revealed two distinct species of Pcu3p, which migrated on SDS gels as two closely spaced species of roughly equal abundance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Several findings indicate that the slower migrating form of Pcu3p arose from covalent modification with the ubiquitin-related protein Ned8p: First, overexpression of a fusion protein of Ned8p and glutathione transferase (GST-Ned8p) converted the faster, unmodified form of Pcu3p into a high molecular weight species that reacted with antibodies to GST (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Second, replacing lysine 729, which is homologous to the conserved neddylation sites in other cullins, with arginine, completely abolished the slower migrating, modified form of Pcu3p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In contrast, mutation of a neighboring conserved lysine (residue 760) did not alter the mobility of Pcu3p. Thus, as with other <italic>S. pombe</italic> cullins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], Pcu3p undergoes covalent modification by ubiquitin-like Ned8p at lysine 729.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Pcu3p is modified by Ned8p on lysine 729. <bold>(a)</bold> Cells containing Pcu3p tagged with 13 Myc epitope tags at the C-terminus (<italic>pcu3-13myc</italic> cells) were transformed with a pRep3-based plasmid driving the overexpression of a fusion of GST with <italic>S. pombe</italic> Ned8p.

The comparatively low level of Pcu3p neddylation in this experiment may be attributable to overexpression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-2-7-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Multiple <italic>csn</italic> mutants accumulate neddylated Pcu3p</title><p>Interestingly, fission yeast <italic>caa1/csn1</italic> deletion mutants show a set of defects, which partially overlaps that found in <italic>pcu3</italic> disruptants: slow growth, cell elongation, and sensitivity to UV-irradiation, but not hydroxyurea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. With respect to the recent implication of CSN in cullin regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], we considered the possibility that the overlapping phenotypes of <italic>csn1</italic> and <italic>pcu3</italic> mutants could arise from interference with Pcu3p function.</p><p>Initial support for this hypothesis was provided by the observation that disruption of <italic>csn1</italic> led to accumulation of Pcu3p in the slower migrating form (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). This shift in migration is due to Pcu3p neddylation as shown by overexpression of GST-Ned8p in <italic>csn1</italic> mutants. This caused an additional supershift, converting a substantial portion of the slower migrating form into a GST-Ned8p modified species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Importantly, accumulation of neddylated Pcu3p was also apparent in strains deleted for <italic>csn3</italic>, <italic>csn4</italic>, and <italic>csn5</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), three genes encoding other putative subunits of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> CSN, which co-fractionate with Csn1p upon size exclusion chromatography (see below, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, unlike <italic>csn1</italic> disruptants, which have a defect in S phase control resulting in slow growth and cell elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], deletion of <italic>csn3</italic>, <italic>csn4</italic>, and <italic>csn5</italic> genes did not cause cell elongation, S phase delay, or any other obvious growth defects (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, data not shown). This indicates that the described phenotype of <italic>csn1</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] is unlikely to be a consequence of interference with Pcu3p activity. Pcu1p, another fission yeast cullin also accumulated in the neddylated form in all <italic>csn</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), suggesting that CSN has a general role in the control of cullin neddylation in fission yeast. The accumulation of neddylated Pcu3p was prevented in all <italic>csn</italic> mutants by providing the missing CSN subunit on a plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Neddylated Pcu3p accumulates in <italic>csn</italic> mutants. <bold>(a)</bold> The indicated <italic>csn</italic> genes were disrupted in a <italic>pcu3-13myc</italic> background.

All peptidases known to cleave ubiquitin- or SUMO-protein conjugates are cysteine-based proteases (reviewed in ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). Csn5p contains a motif closely resembling the conserved cysteine box previously recognized in the catalytic center of deubiquitylating enzymes and in the budding yeast proteasome subunit Rpn11p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The complementation assay shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> allowed us to determine the potential role of this motif in the control of Pcu3p neddylation by replacing the critical cysteine residue with alanine. This mutant Csn5p retained full activity for preventing Pcu1p and Pcu3p hyperneddylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> lanes 12-15, and data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Pcu3p interacts with CSN</title><p>We next determined whether the effect of CSN deficiency on Pcu3p neddylation reflects a physical interaction of these proteins. Size exclusion chromatography of lysates prepared from cells harboring epitope-tagged Pcu3p or CSN subunits at the endogenous genomic loci, revealed precise co-elution of Pcu3p with CSN subunits 1, 3, 4, and 5 in high molecular weight fractions corresponding to approximately 550 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Interestingly, Csn5p, unlike the other CSN subunits, showed a second peak in gel filtration eluting with an approximate molecular weight of 200 kDa, suggesting that Csn5p may also be involved in protein complexes separate from the entire CSN (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p><p>Based on the co-elution of Pcu3p with CSN subunits in gel filtration, we determined whether Pcu3p and Csn1p interact <italic>in vivo</italic> at endogenous expression levels. Pcu3-Myc immunoprecipitated from lysates of cells expressing HA-tagged Csn1p together with Pcu3p-Myc from the endogenous promoters revealed co-precipitation of Csn1p-HA. This interaction was specific as it was not observed with an irrelevant antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> left panel) or with lysate from a strain containing untagged Pcu3p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, right panel). In contrast, immunoprecipitation with HA antibodies failed to precipitate both Csn1p-3HA and Pcu3p-Myc, potentially due to inaccessibility of the C-terminal 3HA tag of Csn1p within the CSN complex (data not shown).</p><p>We therefore generated Pcu3p-Myc containing strains overexpressing N-terminally 6xhistidine-Myc-tagged Csn1p, Csn3p, Csn4p, or Csn5p. Binding of each of the four different CSN subunits to nickel beads resulted in co-purification of Pcu3p, indicative of specific <italic>in vivo</italic> interactions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Notably, both modified and unmodified Pcu3p interacted with CSN subunits (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).

We therefore considered the possibility that accumulation of neddylated Pcu3p in <italic>csn</italic> mutants is a consequence of defective subcellular targeting. Indirect immunofluorescence staining indicated that endogenous Myc-tagged Pcu3p is present in the cytoplasm, but enriched in the nucleus of wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This localization pattern was fully preserved in all four <italic>csn</italic> mutants, indicating that CSN does not regulate the subcellular localization of Pcu3p.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Localization of Pcu3p in <italic>csn</italic> mutants.

To determine whether Pcu3p is associated with such an activity and how it is affected by CSN, we developed a substrate-independent <italic>in vitro</italic> polyubiquitylation assay, similar to that originally reported by Lyapina et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As Pcu3p-associated ubiquitin ligase activity was not described before, we first needed to determine which of the fourteen different ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UBCs) present in the fission yeast genome associate with the RING domain protein Pip1p, an essential cofactor of cullin ubiquitin ligases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

Appearance of multiubiquitin chains was inhibited by mutant ubiquitin lacking all lysines, indicating that they were specifically generated in the reaction rather than co-precipitated with Pcu3p-Myc (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Thus, CSN deficiency appears to stimulate Pcu3p-associated ubiquitin ligase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. A similar stimulation was obtained for substrate-specific polyubiquitylation of phosphorylated Rum1p by SCF<sup>Pop</sup> purified from <italic>csn5</italic> mutants (unpublished observation).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data confirm and extend the recently discovered connection between CSN and cullin regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] by showing that deletion of four putative CSN subunits causes accumulation of Pcu3p in the neddylated state (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Co-elution of these four proteins in a 550 kDa complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) strongly suggests that they represent part of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> equivalent of the eight subunit CSN complex found in higher eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus, cullin regulation through modulation of the balance of Ned8p modification appears to require the entire CSN complex.</p><p>Our study also provides some insight into the role of deneddylation in cullin function, as we were able to create a situation in which Pcu1p and Pcu3p are fully neddylated <italic>in vivo</italic> (ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and data presented here). Deletion of <italic>pcu1</italic> and <italic>pcu3</italic> results either in lethality or in severe growth retardation, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The normal growth behavior of <italic>csn3</italic>, <italic>4</italic>, and <italic>5</italic> mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), where both cullins seem constitutively neddylated, argues against a critical role for dynamic cycles of neddylation and deneddylation in cullin function in fission yeast. Consistent with this notion, the subcellular localization of Pcu3p and Pcu1p were unaffected by mutations in CSN (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Instead, neddylated Pcu3p and Pcu1p purified from <italic>csn</italic> mutant cell extract exhibit increased ubiquitin ligase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Thus, CSN may exert negative control on Pcu1p and Pcu3p by promoting their deneddylation. However, while mutation of <italic>csn5</italic> caused a modest two-fold increase in the steady state fraction of neddylated Pcu3p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), Pcu3p-associated ubiquitin ligase activity recovered from this mutant showed a much more dramatic increase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). This suggests the possibility that CSN represses Pcu3p activity by other mechanisms, in addition to its control of neddylation. Further experiments are required to determine whether recombinant Csn5p or purified CSN complex can inhibit Pcu3p-associated ubiquitin ligase activity.</p><p>Lyapina <italic>et al.</italic> recently provided evidence for a cullin deneddylating activity of CSN by demonstrating that a partially purified preparation of the pig CSN can deneddylate the fission yeast cullin Pcu1p <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The results presented here eliminate the attractive hypothesis that the cysteine box in Csn5p, which is conserved in numerous deubiquitylating enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], harbors a critical activity for deneddylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In addition, recombinant Csn5p failed to deneddylate Pcu1p and Pcu3p <italic>in vitro</italic> (unpublished observation). Our finding that hyperneddylated Pcu3p and Pcu1p accumulate in all <italic>csn</italic> mutants tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, and data not shown), also suggests that control of cullin neddylation results from cooperation of multiple CSN components rather than from the activity of a single catalytic subunit. The CSN complex may, for example, serve as a platform for recruitment of a separate deneddylating enzyme. A human NEDD8-processing isopeptidase has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The potential role of CSN as an organizing center for certain enzymatic activities may not be restricted to the control of cullin neddylation, as CSN was also shown to mediate phosphorylation of c-JUN, IkBa, and p53 by a tightly associated kinase(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>So far, we were unable to obtain deneddylation of Pcu3p-13Myc <italic>in vitro</italic> by partially purified CSN preparations active in deneddylation of Pcu1p-13Myc (data not shown). We can therefore not exclude that CSN's role in the control of Pcu3p neddylation differs from its role established for Pcu1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. For example, binding by CSN could protect Pcu3p from the Ned8p-conjugating enzyme Ubc12p, thus maintaining a fraction of Pcu3p in a deneddylated state. As this shield is experimentally removed through deletion of CSN subunits, Pcu3p may accumulate in the neddylated state. In such a scenario, no enzymatic activity of purified CSN toward neddylated Pcu3p would be expected <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Finally, our data suggest CSN functions in addition to cullin regulation that are not shared by all individual subunits. Out of the four mutants tested, only <italic>csn1</italic> showed the previously described defect in S phase progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), thereby underscoring the significance of our finding that all CSN subunits tested here are involved in cullin regulation. It is likely that some subunits have very specialized functions within the complex, while others are required for its broader activities such as control of cullin neddylation. On the other hand, we found that a sizable fraction of Csn5p is dissociated from the putative CSN holocomplex, but enriched in a 200 kDa assembly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). It thus appears that part of the diversification of CSN function may arise from formation of smaller subcomplexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study reveals a general role of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> CSN complex in the control of cullin modification by Ned8p. Regardless of the exact mechanism, CSN may regulate the activity of multiple cullin ubiquitin ligases through counteracting their stimulatory Ned8p modification. Future studies will reveal whether some of the other described functions of CSN also involve post-translational modification of regulatory proteins by ubiquitin-like modifiers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids and yeast strains</title><p><italic>S. pombe</italic> genes for UBCs and <italic>csn3</italic>, <italic>4</italic>, and <italic>5</italic> were identified in the Sanger Centre <italic>S. pombe</italic> sequence database based on their homology to the respective human and budding yeast proteins.
