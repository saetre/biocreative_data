Ataxin-3 protein with an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat causes spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 (SCA3), also called Machado&#x02013;Joseph disease, and is cleaved in mammalian cells, transgenic mice and SCA3 patient brain tissue. However, the pathological significance of Ataxin-3 cleavage has not been carefully examined. To gain insight into the significance of Ataxin-3 cleavage, we developed a <italic>Drosophila</italic> SL2 cell-based model as well as transgenic fly models. Our data indicate that Ataxin-3 protein cleavage is conserved in the fly and may be caspase-dependent as reported previously. Importantly, comparison of flies expressing either wild-type or caspase-site mutant proteins indicates that Ataxin-3 cleavage enhances neuronal loss <italic>in vivo</italic>. This genetic <italic>in vivo</italic> confirmation of the pathological role of Ataxin-3 cleavage indicates that therapies targeting Ataxin-3 cleavage might slow disease progression in SCA3 patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Protein cleavage plays a critical role in a number of different neurodegenerative disease situations. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by a series of proteases leads to the production of beta-amyloid (A&#x003b2;) peptide and the relative abundance of A&#x003b2; 42 versus A&#x003b2; 40 is thought to play an important role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C1">1</xref>). Increasing evidence also indicates that caspase-mediated cleavage of APP plays important roles in A&#x003b2; production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C2">2</xref>). Tau protein, found in Alzheimer's disease and other disease lesions, is also subject to cleavage by caspases, which may contribute to disease progression in Alzheimer's disease and tauopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C4">4</xref>). Huntingtin protein, which is responsible for Huntington's disease (HD), is also cleaved by proteases and its cleavage fragments are detected in HD patient brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C5">5</xref>). Site-directed mutagenesis targeting a caspase recognition site of the Huntingtin protein was shown to drastically reduce HD-like neurodegeneration in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C6">6</xref>).</p><p>HD is one of a larger class of diseases known as polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, of which there are numerous ataxias, including the most common dominantly inherited ataxia spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 [SCA3, also known as Machado&#x02013;Joseph disease (MJD)]. Data from mouse transgenic models and human disease tissue indicate that the pathogenic Ataxin-3 protein, encoded by the <italic>ATXN3</italic> gene, is proteolyzed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C7">7</xref>). In mice, proteolysis is seen in transgenic lines with high protein expression levels that show degeneration, and is stronger in animals that are sick, and milder in those without symptoms. A normal protein cleavage product is reported, although it is unclear whether protein expression levels are comparable with that of disease animals. Epitope mapping of the cleavage site indicated that it occurs N-terminal to aa221, more recently narrowed to N-terminal to aa190, and the resulting cleavage fragment includes the polyQ repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C8">8</xref>). A similar proteolytic fragment was seen in western samples from three human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C7">7</xref>). These studies suggest that proteolysis of the pathogenic protein may occur, may contribute to disease, and that the stable fragment contains the pathogenic polyQ repeat.</p><p>In a second study, proteolysis of the normal and pathogenic Ataxin-3 proteins was seen in Cos-7 cells upon staurosporine-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C9">9</xref>). Endogenous Ataxin-3 with a normal polyQ length repeat also underwent cleavage with staurosporine treatment. The cleavage in these situations was inhibited by caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. The cleavage was mapped to a similar location as in the Goti <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C7">7</xref>) study, and was shown to be largely caspase-1 dependent. Examination of patient brain tissue for proteolytic fragments failed to reveal a clear fragment.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> models expressing human Ataxin-3 proteins have provided novel insights into SCA3 disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C13">13</xref>). The Ataxin-3 protein has an N-terminal ubiquitin protease domain, with the polyQ repeat near the C-terminal region of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C14">14</xref>). The ubiquitin protease domain has been shown to have de-ubiquitination activity, and is speculated to be a ubiquitin chain editing enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C16">16</xref>). In the fly, the activity of the normal protein associated with the ubiquitin protease domain substantially mitigates toxicity of the pathogenic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C13">13</xref>). When this domain is deleted (as with an N-terminally truncated protein), or if the ubiquitin protease domain is mutated to make it inactive (C14A mutation), the protein with a pathogenic repeat is substantially more toxic in both degree and tissue range of toxicity. These data indicate that the N-terminal domain has activity to mitigate toxicity of the pathogenic protein, and that, should N-terminal proteolysis occur, it is predicted to substantially enhance toxicity of the protein. N-terminal truncation of the protein also affects the ability of the protein to interact with P97/VCP, which also enhances toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C17">17</xref>).</p><p>Previous reports about Ataxin-3 protein cleavage are in cell-based studies or correlative studies in transgenic mouse models or patient brain samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C19">19</xref>). In order to gain experimental evidence of the pathological significance of Ataxin-3 protein cleavage <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used the fruit fly model system to define potential cleavage of the Ataxin-3 protein in the nervous system <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the consequences of preventing that cleavage pattern. Our data suggest that Ataxin-3 cleavage enhances the progression of neurodegeneration in the fly model for SCA3, indicating that such cleavage in the human situation may enhance disease progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ataxin-3 protein is cleaved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in a pattern similar to mammals</title><p>Studies using various antibodies suggest that the major cleavage product of Ataxin-3 includes the polyQ domain, and that expanded pathogenic Ataxin-3 protein from the brain tissues of transgenic mouse models or SCA3 patients generates a &#x0223c;36 kDa fragment, with the size fragment dependent on the length of the polyQ repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C9">9</xref>). We examined whether similar protein cleavage products were generated in the nervous system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> expressing Ataxin-3 with either normal length (Atx3Q27) or expanded polyQ domain (Atx3Q84). Polyclonal antibody to Ataxin-3 and the monoclonal antibody 1H9, which recognizes aa221&#x02013;224, as well as anti-Myc and anti-Flag antibodies, were chosen to compare our data with previous studies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP456F1">1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C18">18</xref>).

These data suggest that &#x0223c;37 kDa fragments, also reported in transgenic mouse and some MJD patient samples, are likely to contain the C-terminal portion of MJD protein, as well as the polyQ domain of the protein.

With the 1H9 and anti-MJD antibodies, significant amounts of cleavage products were readily detected. The pathogenic Atx3Q84 protein runs at &#x0223c;73 kDa, and is cleaved to generate fragments running at &#x0223c;37 kDa. Depending on the antibody, the cleavage product appears as a doublet or single band. The normal length Atx3Q27 protein generates a smaller fragment of &#x0223c;22 kDa, suggesting that the major cleavage product includes the polyQ domain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP456F1">1</xref>B). The presence of &#x0223c;37 kDa fragments, similar in size to the fragment seen in mouse and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C7">7</xref>), with expression of pathogenic Ataxin-3 suggests that Ataxin-3 cleavage is conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Interestingly, our initial studies showed that cleavage of Ataxin-3 was much more prominent when the protein was expressed in the nervous system than in the eye, which has predominantly accessory cells along with neuronal cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp456/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). The full-length Ataxin-3 protein is also not very toxic to non-neural cells of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C1">1</xref>), suggesting that the cleavage of the protein may be more particular <italic>in vivo</italic> to the nervous system, and that this may relate to the toxicity of the protein.</p><p>The anti-Myc antibody which recognizes the N-terminal end of tagged forms of Ataxin-3 protein highlighted the full-length protein, which migrated just below the 75 kDa marker, and no significant smaller products (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP456F1">1</xref>B). This indicated that cleavage products do not include the N-terminal end of the protein. With the double-tagged protein, we observed a similar cleavage pattern of the Atx3Q84 protein indicating C-terminal cleavage. Notably, antibodies to the C-terminal FLAG tag detect a cleavage product migrating just above &#x0223c;37 kDa, further confirming that stable cleavage products are derived from the C-terminus of the protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP456F1">1</xref>C).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk inhibits Ataxin-3 protein cleavage in S2 cells</title><p>Previous reports suggest that Ataxin-3 protein cleavage is dependent on caspase activities and is blocked by caspase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C19">19</xref>). Calpain proteases and the proteasome have also been implicated in studies <italic>in vitro</italic> using neuroblastoma cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C18">18</xref>). To further define potential proteases that may function for protein cleavage in the fly, we developed a <italic>Drosophila</italic> SL2 cell-based system to determine whether the Ataxin-3 protein is proteolyzed by any of the proteases previously implicated using various chemical inhibitors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP456F2">2</xref>A).</p><fig id="DDP456F2" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2.</label><caption><p>zVAD, a broad-acting caspase inhibitor, can suppress Ataxin-3 protein cleavage in an SL2-cell-based system.

All drugs were dissolved in DMSO, with final percentage of DMSO indicated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ddp45602"/></fig><p>As observed in the fly <italic>in vivo</italic>, we detected the &#x0223c;37 kDa cleavage products when the pathogenic Atx3Q84 protein was transiently expressed in SL2 cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP456F2">2</xref>B). The cleavage pattern of the protein in SL2 cells was similar to the cleavage pattern of the protein in the fly <italic>in vivo</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp456/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>).

We then used inhibitors to define potential cleaving proteases. zVAD-fmk, a broad caspase inhibitor, consistently reduced the level of &#x0223c;37 kDa fragment, while the control peptide zFA-fmk had no effect (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP456F2">2</xref>B, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp456/DC1">Supplementary Material, Figs S3</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp456/DC1">S4</ext-link>).

Furthermore, when zVAD-fmk and MG-132 were combined, the results were additive rather than synergistic, suggesting that the proteasome and caspases may act independently.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Site-directed mutagenesis of caspase-recognition sites significantly modify Ataxin-3 protein cleavage in cells and in the fly</title><p>Goti <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C7">7</xref>) used a series of monoclonal antibodies to identify the potential Ataxin-3 protein cleavage site.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C9">9</xref>) reported several putative caspase-recognition sites and showed that the modification of six or nine caspase sites by site-directed mutagenesis eliminated the appearance of cleavage products in Cos-7 cells.

To test the significance of caspase cleavage, we modified the aspartic acid residues to asparagines at select caspase sites. Because of our interest in the &#x0223c;37 kDa fragments, we focused on the six putative caspase sites at amino acids 171, 208, 217, 223, 225 and 228 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP456F3">3</xref>A).</p><fig id="DDP456F3" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3.</label><caption><p>Mutation of putative caspase recognition sites in Ataxin-3 dramatically reduces the amount of cleavage product <italic>in vivo</italic>.

That is, single site (D208N or D217N) or even triple mutation (D171/208/217N) of the putative caspase sites did not fully eliminate cleavage, but rather lead to an alteration in the cleavage pattern in SL2 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp456/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S5</ext-link> and data not shown). Strikingly, however, elimination of all six putative caspase-sites (6M) eliminated the &#x0223c;37 kDa fragments in SL2 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp456/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S5A</ext-link>). Such mutation of the protein also had an effect on the overall mobility of the protein in gels. This may be due to a conformational change caused by the mutations or could result from additional cleavage at the C-terminal end of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C19">19</xref>).</p><p>To extend these findings <italic>in vivo</italic> in order to understand the pathological impact of modified Ataxin-3 protein cleavage, we generated transgenic animals expressing either wild-type protein (Myc-Atx3Q84-Flag (WT)) or the sextuplet mutant protein (Myc-Atx3Q83-Flag (6M)). Analysis of flies expressing equal levels of these proteins revealed that the 6M mutant protein had dramatically reduced levels of cleavage product <italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP456F3">3</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we conducted a time course experiment to determine whether there was a difference in onset or size of nuclear inclusion formation by Ataxin-3 <italic>in vivo</italic>. We used the late-onset rhodopsin (<italic>rh1-Gal4</italic>) driver that allows sensitive analysis of inclusion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C13">13</xref>).</p><p>These studies revealed no difference in protein accumulation between the WT and 6M form of pathogenic Ataxin-3 with 7d animals, showing a similar level and size of nuclear inclusions between WT and 6M flies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP456F4">4</xref>). Analysis at earlier time points also indicated that the rate of inclusion formation was similar between WT and 6M flies (data not shown). Therefore, mutation of the caspase cleavage sites and reduced proteolysis of the pathogenic Ataxin-3 protein does not affect protein accumulation. This finding also suggests that protein misfolding and clearance are not significantly affected by the presence of these caspase cleavage products, in agreement with MG-132 data from SL2 cells (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp456/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S3</ext-link>).</p><fig id="DDP456F4" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;4.</label><caption><p>Elimination of putative caspase cleavage sites in Ataxin-3 protein has little impact on protein accumulations.

To confirm that the 6M mutant protein was properly folded despite the caspase site mutations, we tested whether the ability to suppress the pathogenicity of the truncated SCA3Q78 protein was retained. Normally, the pathogenic full-length Ataxin-3 protein, when co-expressed with the truncated Q78 protein, has activity to suppress toxicity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP456F5">5</xref>C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C13">13</xref>).

These studies provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that cleavage of the Ataxin-3 protein in the nervous system may occur and may contribute to disease progression.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Ataxin-3 protein cleavage is conserved</title><p>Ataxin-3 protein cleavage appears to be conserved as we observed cleavage products from <italic>Drosophila</italic> SL2 cells and the fly nervous system similar to those reported from Cos-7 cells, transgenic mice and SCA3 patient brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C9">9</xref>). Western blot analysis, using polyclonal antibodies and the 1H9 antibody, indicates that the major cleavage product from transgenic flies contains the polyQ domain, because the size of cleavage fragment varied depending upon the polyQ length. Moreover, the &#x0223c;37 kDa fragments were greatly reduced upon zVAD-fmk treatment that inhibits caspase activity, similar to the findings in Cos-7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C9">9</xref>). Overall conservation of the Ataxin-3 cleavage pattern suggests that <italic>Drosophila</italic> can be used as a model to study the mechanism and significance of the protein cleavage.</p><p>One hypothesis we had initially was that Ataxin-3 cleavage fragments may act as seeds or facilitators of protein aggregation. According to that hypothesis, we expected to see a delay in nuclear inclusion formation or reduced inclusions in flies expressing the 6M mutant protein. However, there was no obvious difference in inclusion onset, size or accumulation. Pozzi <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C19">19</xref>) identified multiple Ataxin-3 protein cleavage products in Cos-7 cells and concluded that polyQ expansion in the Ataxin-3 protein partially inhibited its proteolysis. Additionally, it was suggested that the reduced proteolytic degradation may enhance accumulation of full-length Ataxin-3 protein, and thereby contribute to disease. Our data showed no obvious difference in the dynamics of protein accumulation with or without Ataxin-3 cleavage, and suggested that the ubiquitin proteasome system is not differentially affected by caspase site mutations. Despite this, we did see a significant reduction in the rate of photoreceptor neural degeneration when Ataxin-3 protein cleavage was inhibited by mutation.</p><p>The UIM domains have been found to modulate toxicity of the pathogenic Ataxin-3 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C13">13</xref>). Because the 6M mutations potentially affect residues in the first UIM domain, it is possible that the resulting changes in UIM function may change the overall toxicity. However, loss of UIM function has been shown to increase, rather than decrease, Ataxin-3 toxicity as observed here. We also used an assay <italic>in vivo</italic>, the ability to suppress polyQ toxicity, to assess Ataxin-3 function of the 6M mutant protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C13">13</xref>). This showed that the 6M protein retains normal Ataxin-3 activity. Thus, we suggest that the 6M mutant protein shows reduced toxicity as a result of reduced protein cleavage. Overall, these observations indicate that the cleavage product <italic>per se</italic> may contribute to disease progression.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Protein cleavage and neurodegeneration</title><p>Cleavage of the protein may enhance neurodegeneration <italic>in vivo</italic> in multiple ways. Cleavage fragments containing the polyQ domain may interact with other proteins in a more robust manner. Nuclear inclusions in polyQ diseases may have components with differing exchange rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C20">20</xref>), and the presence of short cleavage products may be more potent in sequestering key cellular factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C21">21</xref>). Proteomic studies may help reveal insight into why the WT protein is more toxic than the 6M protein.</p><p>Cong <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C22">22</xref>) made an interesting observation that the short N-terminal fragment of Huntingtin with the expanded polyQ remained predominantly monomeric in cells. Considering the apparent lack of a gross difference in the formation of nuclear inclusions by Ataxin-3 cleavage in fly neurons, it is possible that &#x0223c;37 kDa cleavage products may not be readily recruited into macroscopic inclusions, but rather may exert toxic effects as soluble monomers. The apparent increase in the SDS-insoluble aggregates with normal Ataxin-3 protein cleavage, however, also suggests that the cleavage product may be a part of the nuclear inclusions <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, the apparent decrease in the SDS-insoluble aggregates with cleavage-site mutant protein suggests that cleavage products may alter or trigger changes in the biochemical properties of Ataxin-3 accumulations. One such candidate process is cross linking by transglutaminase. A recent study using chemical inhibitors of transglutaminase showed mitigated SCA3-like disease effects when fed to <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C23">23</xref>). While the mechanism of transglutaminase activation in the nervous system remains to be fully elucidated, Ataxin-3 cleavage fragment might selectively interact with transglutaminase and trigger cross linking of aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C24">24</xref>).</p><p>Ataxin-3 has a ubiquitin chain-modifying activity, and especially targets Lys63 linkages in mixed linkage ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C16">16</xref>). Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains are thought to play critical roles in the NF-kB signal transduction pathway as well as in DNA repair. While the cellular targets are unknown, it is possible that cleavage of the N-terminal ubiquitin protease domain may compromise key cellular pathways normally regulated by Ataxin-3. Moreover, because the cleavage product is likely to keep the UIM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C19">19</xref>), it is an interesting possibility that it may act as a dominant-negative protein in the affected pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Proteases involved in cleavage of Ataxin-3</title><p>Our data indicate that caspases may be responsible for Ataxin-3 cleavage. Activation of caspases as diseased cells undergo apoptosis pathways may trigger cleavage, as is the case with endogenous Ataxin-3 protein in Cos-7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C9">9</xref>). While it is reasonable to hypothesize that expanded Ataxin-3 protein may activate caspases that proteolyze Ataxin-3, the observation that normal Ataxin-3, which does not cause neurodegeneration, is also cleaved, suggests that cleavage is not necessarily a consequence of apoptosis. Caspases have been known to play important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation, beyond their roles as inducers/executioners of apoptosis.</p><p>In SL2 cells, there were additional fragments beyond the &#x0223c;37 kDa fragment seen in mammalian models or fly brain, suggesting that Ataxin-3 protein cleavage may be a multi-step process like for Huntingtin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C25">25</xref>). The &#x0223c;37 kDa fragments may have the longest half-life and thereby accumulate <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, z-VAD-fmk treatment eliminated the &#x0223c;37 kDa fragment selectively in SL2 cell, leaving the &#x0223c;50 kDa fragments unaffected. Haacke <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C18">18</xref>) suggested potential involvement of calpain proteases, but calpain inhibitor ALLN had no effect in Ataxin-3 cleavage in SL2 cells. The apparent discrepancy could be due to the use of different cell lines or culture conditions. MG-132 is widely used as an inhibitor of proteasome function and it was effective in reducing Ataxin-3 protein cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP456C18">18</xref>). We also observed that MG-132 treatment consistently reduced the appearance of some cleavage products in SL2 cells, but the &#x0223c;37 KDa fragments were not affected. When cells were treated with a combination of zVAD-fmk and MG-132, we observed an additive but not synergistic effect. These data suggest that Ataxin-3 protein cleavage is a complex process, involving multiple cellular pathways.</p><p>In an attempt to define a specific caspase responsible for the cleavage of the Ataxin-3 protein <italic>in vivo</italic>, we utilized dsRNA-mediated RNA knockdown in SL2 cells and in the fly. We effectively decreased the levels of Dronc, Strica and Drice in SL2 cells, but this had no effect on the Ataxin-3 cleavage pattern (J. Jung and N. Bonini, unpublished data). We further examined knockdown of caspase genes in the fly <italic>in vivo</italic> using P35 or dsRNA transgenic lines, but no consistent effect was seen (J.

Additionally, we provide experimental evidence that Ataxin-3 cleavage significantly enhances neural degeneration induced by the pathogenic Ataxin-3 protein.
