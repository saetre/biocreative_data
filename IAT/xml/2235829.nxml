The integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 has been shown to play a critical role during angiogenesis.

Although volociximab has already been tested in open label, pilot phase II clinical trials in melanoma, pancreatic and renal cell cancer, evaluation of the mechanism of action of volociximab has been limited because this antibody does not cross-react with murine &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, precluding its use in standard mouse xenograft models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We generated a panel of rat-anti-mouse &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 antibodies, with the intent of identifying an antibody that recapitulated the properties of volociximab. Hybridoma clones were screened for analogous function to volociximab, including specificity for &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 heterodimer and blocking of integrin binding to fibronectin. A subset of antibodies that met these criteria were further characterized for their capacities to bind to mouse endothelial cells, inhibit cell migration and block angiogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic>.

This antibody does not significantly cross-react with human integrin, however 339.1 inhibits murine endothelial cell migration and tube formation and elicits cell death in these cells (EC<sub>50 </sub>= 5.3 nM). In multiple xenograft models, 339.1 inhibited the growth of established tumors by 40&#x02013;60% (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) and this inhibition correlates with a concomitant decrease in vessel density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results herein demonstrate that 339.1, like volociximab, exhibits potent anti-&#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 activity and confirms that inhibition of integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 impedes angiogenesis and slows tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Angiogenesis is the process by which nascent blood vessels form from existing vasculature to supply new tissue with nutrients. This process was proposed by Folkman over three decades ago to drive tumor growth beyond a few millimeters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Since that time, numerous angiogenesis inhibitors have been shown to inhibit vessel growth in models of neovascularization and restrict the growth of tumors in pre-clinical models of cancer. Currently, anti-angiogenic agents that are approved for the treatment of cancer include sunitinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], sorafenib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and bevacizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and many others are in late stage clinical testing.</p><p>Tumors secrete multiple growth factors that drive activation, migration and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells (EC's), including TGF-&#x003b1;, bFGF and VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These agents bind their respective receptors on EC's to initiate signaling cascades that culminate in pro-angiogenic events. To date, the majority of angiogenesis inhibitors have focused on disrupting growth factor signalling, including the aforementioned clinically approved agents, which primarily target the VEGF axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, growth factors are not the only pro-angiogenic molecules that influence the tumor microenvironment. For example, tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages are known to secrete matrix metalloproteinases, such as MMP-9 and MMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These enzymes degrade the basement membrane, exposing components of the extracellular matrix, including fibronectin. These exposed ECM proteins drive angiogenesis by ligating integrins, which play a central role in the angiogenic program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Integrins are heterodimeric signalling and adhesion molecules consisting of an alpha chain and a beta chain. Ligands for these receptors bind integrins and induce EC shape change, motility and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. One well-characterized example of an integrin-ECM interaction is that between fibronectin and integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, an integrin that is up-regulated in proliferating EC's [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Ligation of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 has been shown to promote cell survival through Bcl-2, migration through RhoA and proliferation through ERK, Akt and FAK-dependent mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Activation of these and other cellular programs through integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 in endothelial cells results in angiogenesis. Conversely, blockade of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 ligation has been demonstrated to inhibit angiogenesis, at least in part through the inhibition of signalling and the induction of the cell death program through caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Volociximab is a chimeric, function blocking antibody that targets integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1. We have previously shown that this antibody elicits cell death in dividing endothelial cells, inhibits angiogenesis in a cynomolgus monkey model of choroidal neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and slows tumor growth in a rabbit VX2 carcinoma model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Volociximab, however, does not cross-react with rodent &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, precluding its use in standard mouse xenograft models of cancer. Although commercially available antibodies against mouse &#x003b1;5 exist, we and others have found that these monoclonals do not elicit cell death or inhibit tumor progression <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>To determine whether blockade of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 in murine disease models results in inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth, we sought to generate a function blocking antibody that closely mirrored the known properties of volociximab. To this end, we generated a panel of rat-anti-mouse integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 antibodies and subjected them to a rigorous screening strategy designed to identify antibodies that reproduce the known properties of volociximab that are associated with its efficacy <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Purification of mouse placental &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1</title><p>Mouse placental integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 was purified by affinity chromotagraphy using rat anti-mouse &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 antibody BMC5 (Chemicon) essentially as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Briefly, antibody was coupled to CNBr-coupled Sepharose (Pharmacia) and mouse placenta was homogenized using a Polytron tissue homogenizer in lysis buffer [200 mM octyl-&#x003b2;-gluocopyranoside, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.0)], followed by incubation on ice.

Antibodies purified from supernatants that recognized murine EC's by flow cytometry and showed a preference for &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 heterodimer were compared for their capacity to inhibit the binding of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1-Fc to mouse fibronectin by competitive ELISA, (C). Many antibodies inhibited integrin-fibronectin binding; one antibody, 321.1, was found to promote binding. Antibodies were assessed for binding to cellular integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 on SVR cells by flow cytometry, (D).

Immunohistochemical analysis of sections from human &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 positive (MDA-MB-231) and negative (C32) xenograft tumors further confirmed that antibodies that cross-reacted to human integrin by ELISA also did so on tissue sections (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). For example, 517-2, which cross-reacts by ELISA, binds to tumor cells in the &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 positive MDA-MB-231 xenograft, and not to C32 xenograft tumor cells, but binds to murine &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 on the vasculature and stroma of both xenografts.

As volociximab does not cross-react with rodent integrin, these earlier studies were conducted in rabbit and monkey models. We therefore considered whether 339.1 affects tumor growth in syngeneic and xenograft tumor models. In the murine endothelial-derived angiosarcoma model, SVR, 339.1 targets both tumor and tumor vascular endothelial cells. 339.1, administered intraperitoneally to mice bearing established tumors, thrice weekly at 10 mg/kg, inhibited tumor growth by approximately 60% (<italic>p </italic>= 0.007; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).

As in the C32 and MDA-MB-231 xenografts, vessels stained positive for integrin with 339.1 in both of these xenograft models (data not shown). Sections from A673 tumors treated with 339.1 were assessed for vessel density by immunohistochemistry using an antibody against anti-CD31 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).

Despite the recent approval of targeted therapies in this area, optimizing the use of anti-angiogenic drugs in the clinic has been difficult. Challenges that face anti-angiogenic agents that are currently under development include choosing disease areas that might benefit most, optimizing combination strategies with existing standards of care and defining patient populations that might respond best to therapy. Preclinical models of disease provide the best opportunity for addressing these issues, therefore appropriate reagents for use in these systems are essential for driving drugs through development.</p><p>Volociximab has been shown to inhibit the growth of new blood vessels in preclinical models of ocular angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This effect was found to translate into decreased tumor growth in the rabbit VX2 carcinoma model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These experiments provided a strong proof of concept demonstration of volociximab activity <italic>in vivo </italic>and defined a novel mechanism of action for angiogenesis inhibition. However, the VX2 model is limited in that it represents a very aggressive tumor, must be passaged <italic>in vivo</italic>, is carried out in immunocompetent animals (resulting in antibody clearance) and requires large amounts of antibody. To further define volociximab mechanism of action and identify appropriate settings for its use in tractable animal models of cancer, it was therefore imperative a similar reagent with activity in mouse be generated.</p><p>A number of antibodies against mouse &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 are available commercially. We have found that although some of these antibodies inhibit binding of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 to fibronectin, none inhibited other biological functions, such as migration, <italic>in vitro </italic>angiogenesis or tumor growth <italic>in vivo </italic>(unpublished observations; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]). However, the &#x003b1;5 knockout mouse is embryonically lethal due to gross defects in vascular architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], suggesting that in mice, as in humans, &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 is important for blood vessel formation and/or integrity. The new panel of reagents described herein represents a number of &#x003b1;5- and &#x003b2;1-specific antibodies. Of note, Fc-fusion protein-based immunizations resulted in a higher proportion of &#x003b1;5-specific antibodies, whereas placenta-based immunization resulted in a higher proportion of heterodimer-specific antibodies, including 339.1 (data not shown). As the overall number of antibodies produced by each method was similar, this suggests that the purified material may have resulted in similar immunogenicity while maintaining a more native quaternary structure <italic>in vivo</italic>. In either case, many of the antibodies that bound &#x003b1;5 or were specific for &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 heterodimer blocked binding to fibronectin and competed, at least in part, with one another in ELISA or FACS assays (data not shown). Of these antibodies, one group cross-reacted with human integrin, while another did not, suggesting that at least two distinct epitopes were represented. This implies that inhibition of binding to fibronectin can be achieved through blocking at multiple sites, possibly through steric hindrance. Importantly, not all antibodies that block binding to fibronectin have equivalent biological function <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>in vivo</italic>. 517-2 and 339.1, for example, each bind with high affinity (0.21 nM and 0.59 nM, respectively) block binding to fibronectin and inhibit migration. Moreover, both antibodies have rat IgG1 constant regions, which like volociximab, a human IgG<sub>4</sub>, would be predicted to lack significant effector activity. However, only 339.1, which does not cross-react with human &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, elicits significant cell death <italic>in vitro </italic>and inhibits angiogenesis and tumor progression <italic>in vivo</italic>. This finding suggests that although these antibodies have similar biological functionality and similar affinities, initiation of the cell death program requires binding to a highly specific epitope. This result also suggests that 339.1 binds to the murine cognate of the epitope recognized by volociximab, which would be predicted to be non-homologous between mouse and human &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, since volociximab does not cross-react with mouse integrin. A corollary of this hypothesis is that an antibody that recognizes both human and mouse integrin would not bind this important epitope, and therefore might not elicit cell death, as is the case with 517-2.</p><p>339.1 inhibits tumor growth in an A673 rhabdosarcoma model. This model was chosen to evaluate anti-&#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 activity because it was reported to be sensitive to the mouse parent antibody of bevacizumab, A.4.6.1, suggesting that its growth is highly dependent on angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, A.4.6.1 and bevacizumab do not inhibit tumor growth in other xenograft models to the same extent as in the A673 model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The reasons for this are not fully understood; 339.1 is currently being evaluated in additional xenograft models to determine if similar differences in sensitivities are observed with this antibody. Comparing xenograft models that respond to 339.1 to varying degrees may reveal molecular mechanisms that will help stratify patients and illuminate combination strategies that might best slow disease progression. In addition, the combination of 339.1 and volociximab is currently being assessed in xenograft models to determine the effect of targeting both tumor and host &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results described in this report represent the first description of a mouse-specific &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 inhibitor that blocks EC function, angiogenesis and tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>.
