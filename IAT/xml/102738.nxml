Recently it has become clear that in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> many RNA helicases of the DEAD-box and related families are involved in ribosome biogenesis. Here we show that the previously uncharacterised open reading frame <italic>YDL031w</italic> (renamed <italic>DBP10</italic> for <underline>D</underline>EAD-<underline>b</underline>ox <underline>p</underline>rotein <underline>10</underline>) encodes an essential putative RNA helicase that is required for accurate ribosome biogenesis. Genetic depletion of Dbp10p results in a deficit in 60S ribosomal subunits and an accumulation of half-mer polysomes. Furthermore, pulse&#x02013;chase analyses of pre-rRNA processing reveal a strong delay in the maturation of 27SB pre-rRNA intermediates into 25S rRNA and 7S pre-rRNA. Northern blot analyses indicate that this delay leads to higher steady-state levels of 27SB species and reduced steady-state levels of 7S pre-rRNA and 25S&#x0002f;5.8S mature rRNAs, thus explaining the final deficit in 60S subunit and the formation of half-mer polysomes. Consistent with a direct role in ribosome biogenesis, Dbp10p was found to be located predominantly in the nucleolus.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ribosome biogenesis constitutes a major cellular activity in actively growing cells. Indeed, in an exponentially growing yeast ~2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> new ribosomes have to be produced during each cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c2">2</xref>). To meet the large demand of mature rRNAs, eukaryotic organisms encode the pre-rRNAs in clusters of rDNA repeats. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the small ribosomal subunit is composed of 32 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) and the 18S rRNA, whereas the large subunit contains 46 r-proteins and three rRNA species (5.8S, 25S and 5S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c3">3</xref>). Three of the four rRNAs (18S, 25S and 5.8S) are co-transcribed as a single large precursor by RNA polymerase I, while the 5S rRNA is independently transcribed as a pre-rRNA by RNA polymerase III.</p><p>The 35S pre-rRNA, which is the longest detectable precursor, contains the sequences of the mature 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNAs separated by two internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and flanked by two external transcribed spacers (5&#x02032; ETS and 3&#x02032; ETS). During ribosome biogenesis, which mainly takes place in the nucleolus, a specialised compartment of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c5">5</xref>), the 35S precursor is processed through a series of sequential endo- and exo-nucleolytic cleavages to give rise to mature rRNAs 18S, 25S and 5.8S (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f1">1</xref>). Furthermore, shortly after transcription, it undergoes approximately 108 covalent modifications of nucleotides (55 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-ribose methylations, 43&#x000a0;pseudo-uridinylations, approximately 10 base methylations) that are mostly guided by small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c6">6</xref>). All these maturation steps occur in large pre-ribosomal particles that contain, in addition to r-proteins, numerous <italic>trans</italic>-acting proteins and snoRNAs that associate transiently with pre-rRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c9">9</xref>). Current analyses indicate the presence of approximately 75&#x02013;100 different snoRNAs per yeast genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c10">10</xref>) and to date more than 60 protein <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors have been reported to act in ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c12">12</xref>). Thus, it is generally believed that the pre-ribosomal particle is a highly dynamic structure in which many structural rearrangements are required for maturation of ribosomal subunits to occur. We and others have shown that there are many putative RNA helicases of the DEAD-box and related families amongst the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c13">13</xref>). These proteins are characterised by eight conserved motifs. Based on the <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> RNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activities of some of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c19">19</xref>), it has been suggested that they are involved in the local unwinding of structured RNAs. Nevertheless it cannot be excluded that these proteins also possess RNA&#x02013;protein dissociating activities. Indeed, unwinding of RNA&#x02013;RNA duplexes (rRNA&#x02013;rRNA or rRNA&#x02013;snoRNA) or dissociation of RNA&#x02013;protein complexes are expected to occur during the dynamic and complex process of ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>Depending on the molecular aspect of the terminal molecular phenotype observed upon helicase inactivation or depletion, it has been suggested that RNA helicases may be involved in ribosome assembly or pre-rRNA processing, although these two processes are intrinsically linked. The absence of a functional RNA helicase may result in an unstable pre-ribosomal particle and rapid degradation of pre-rRNA intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c21">21</xref>). Alternatively, the depletion of an RNA helicase may result in the accumulation of pre-rRNA intermediates that are no longer processed into mature rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c22">22</xref>).</p><p>So far, 12 putative RNA helicases have been described that are involved in ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c32">32</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f1">1</xref>). The activity of these proteins seems to be highly specific for distinct steps since they are mostly essential and they generally cannot replace each other. Here, we describe the analysis of the DEAD-box protein Dbp10p, which is encoded by the open reading frame (ORF) <italic>YDL031w</italic>. Depletion of Dbp10p results in an inhibition of the processing of the 27SB pre-rRNA intermediates, which in turn results in a deficit in 60S ribosomal subunits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, media and microbiological methods</title><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains described in this study were all derivatives of W303 (<italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold>&#x0002f;<italic>MAT&#x003b1; ura3-1&#x0002f;ura3-1 ade2-1&#x0002f;ade2-1 his3-11,15&#x0002f;his3-11,15 leu2-3,112&#x0002f;leu2-3,112 trp1-1&#x0002f;trp1-1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c33">33</xref>).

Compared to the wild-type strain (YBF1-1A), the <italic>dbp10-1</italic> mutant strain (YBF1-1B &#x0005b;YCplac33-<italic>dbp10-1</italic>&#x0005d;) showed a slight growth defect at low temperatures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f2">2</xref>A). Secondly, a transcriptionally repressible <italic>GAL::DBP10</italic> fusion gene was constructed by placing the <italic>DBP10</italic> ORF under the control of the inducible <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter, which allows the expression of the gene in presence of galactose but its shut off in presence of glucose (Materials and Methods). The resulting plasmid pAS24-<italic>DBP10</italic>, which drives the expression of an N-terminally HA-tagged Dbp10-fusion protein, fully complemented the <italic>dbp10-</italic>disrupted strain YBF1-1B on YPGal, but it permitted only residual growth on YPD plates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f2">2</xref>B). In YPGal liquid medium, the <italic>GAL::DBP10</italic> strain (YBF1-1B &#x0005b;pAS24-<italic>DBP10</italic>&#x0005d;) exhibited the same growth rate as the wild-type strain (YBF1-1A). Six hours after a shift from YPGal to YPD liquid medium, the growth rate of the <italic>GAL::DBP10</italic> strain progressively slowed to a doubling time of &#x0003e;8 h after 36 h in glucose medium, whereas the wild-type strain growth rate remained the same (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f2">2</xref>C). Accordingly, western blot analysis revealed that the levels of HA-Dbp10p began to decrease rapidly after the shift and it became undetectable after 18 h in glucose medium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f2">2</xref>D).</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>GAL::DBP10</italic> and <italic>dbp10-1</italic> strains exhibit altered polysome profiles due to a deficit in 60S ribosomal subunits</title><p>Many DEAD box proteins have been found to be involved in translation initiation or ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c13">13</xref>). To test whether Dbp10p was involved in one of these processes, we performed polysome analyses on the conditional <italic>dbp10</italic> strains described above.</p><p>Polysome extracts prepared from the <italic>GAL::DBP10</italic> and wild-type strains grown in YPGal and then shifted to YPD were analysed on 7&#x02013;50&#x00025; (w&#x0002f;v) sucrose gradients. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f3">3</xref>C and D, a comparison of the profiles revealed that depletion of Dbp10p is accompanied by an overall decrease of polysomes, a deficit in free 60S ribosomal subunit versus an excess of free 40S subunits and the appearance of half-mer polysomes. Notably, a double peak at the &#x02018;usual&#x02019; position of the free 60S ribosomal subunit peak appeared reproducibly at the 12 h depletion time point (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f3">3</xref>C). At later time points, the free 60S ribosomal subunit peak almost disappeared and the double peak was no longer detectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f3">3</xref>D). To confirm a deficit in 60S ribosomal subunits relative to 40S subunits, the total ribosomal subunits were quantified in a run-off experiment on sucrose gradients. In accordance with a defect in 60S subunit biogenesis, the 60S&#x0002f;40S ratio dropped from 1.77 to 1.67 and 1.6 after 12 and 18 h of depletion, respectively (data not shown).</p><p>Polysome extracts prepared from the <italic>dbp10-1</italic> strain grown in YPD medium at 30&#x000b0;C and at room temperature revealed that the <italic>dbp10-1</italic> mutation also led to a deficit in free 60S ribosomal subunits and the appearance of half-mer polysomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f3">3</xref>B and data not shown). The presence of a double peak at the position of the free 60S subunit peak was observed when the mutant strain was grown at room temperature or at 18&#x000b0;C. Altogether these results strongly suggest a role for Dbp10p in 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>The formation of 25S and 5.8S mature rRNAs is impaired upon Dbp10p depletion</title><p>Since polysome analysis indicated a defect in 60S ribosomal subunit synthesis when Dbp10p function was impaired, we analysed the kinetics of rRNA maturation in the <italic>GAL::DBP10</italic> strain by pulse&#x02013;chase labelling experiments. To do so, the YBF1-1B &#x0005b;pAS24-<italic>DBP10</italic>&#x0005d; &#x0005b;YCplac33&#x0005d; and YBF1-1A &#x0005b;YCplac33&#x0005d; strains were grown in SGal&#x02013;Ura and then shifted to SD&#x02013;Ura medium for 18 h. At this time point, the doubling time of the <italic>GAL::DBP10</italic> strain was 4 h, versus 2 h for the wild-type strain. Cells were pulse-labelled for 2 min with &#x0005b;5,6-<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;uracil prior to a chase with cold uracil. Total RNA was extracted at given time points during the chase, separated on agarose&#x02013;formaldehyde gels, blotted onto Nylon membrane and analysed by fluorography. In the wild-type strain, the 35S precursor was rapidly converted into 32S and then into 27S and 20S pre-rRNAs, which were further processed into 25S and 18S mature rRNAs, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f4">4</xref>A, lanes 1&#x02013;5). After 5&#x000a0;min of chase, most of the labelled species were mature rRNAs. In the <italic>GAL::DBP10</italic> strain, the processing of the 35S precursor was slowed down, and part of it being still detectable after 60 min of chase. The synthesis of the 18S rRNA was only mildly delayed and was not significantly reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f4">4</xref>A, compare 18S rRNA levels in lanes 2&#x02013;5 with 7&#x02013;10). Traces of an aberrant 23S species appeared at early chase time points. In contrast, formation of the 25S mature rRNA was clearly slowed down and above all strongly reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f4">4</xref>A, compare ratios 25S&#x0002f;18S lanes 5 and 10). At the same time, its immediate precursor, the 27SB pre-rRNA, persisted until the end of the chase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f4">4</xref>A, compare lanes 4 and 5 with 9 and 10), thus indicating that the processing step corresponding to the maturation of the 27SB precursor into 25S and 5.8S rRNA species was likely impaired. In agreement with this, analysis of the low-molecular weight RNAs confirmed that formation of 5.8S rRNAs was delayed and strongly reduced in the <italic>GAL::DBP10</italic> strain, whereas synthesis of the 5S rRNA and tRNAs were not significantly affected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f4">4</xref>B).</p><p>Similar experiments performed with &#x0005b;methyl-<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;methionine revealed that the overall methylation of the pre-rRNAs was not affected upon Dbp10p depletion (data not shown). Finally, consistent with the results observed with the <italic>GAL::DBP10</italic> strain, a defect in 25S and 5.8S rRNAs synthesis associated with a delay in the maturation of the 27SB pre-rRNA was also observed in the <italic>dbp10-1</italic> mutant strain grown at room temperature (data not shown).</p><p>Altogether these results indicated that the deficit in 60S ribosomal subunits observed upon Dbp10p depletion and in the <italic>dbp10-1</italic> mutant strain was linked to a defect in the maturation of the 27SB pre-rRNA into mature 25S and 5.8S rRNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Depletion of Dbp10p results in accumulation of the late 27S pre-rRNA precursors</title><p>To study the pre-rRNA processing phenotype observed upon Dbp10p depletion in more detail, steady-state levels of the mature rRNAs and pre-rRNA intermediates were assessed by northern blot analyses. Total RNA was extracted from the <italic>GAL::DBP10</italic> strain at various time points during the depletion, separated on agarose&#x02013;formaldehyde gels and blotted onto a nylon membrane. The same blot was repeatedly hybridised with different probes specific for the different pre-rRNA intermediates (for probes see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f1">1</xref>A). As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f5">5</xref>A, the methylene blue staining of the mature rRNA species showed a clear deficit in 25S rRNA and a very minor decrease of 18S rRNA steady-state levels upon Dbp10p depletion. Consistent with the results of the pulse&#x02013;chase experiments, hybridisation with probe F revealed that the 27SB pre-rRNAs accumulated with ongoing depletion, especially at the 12 and 18 h time points (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f5">5</xref>F, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). On the other hand, the steady-state levels of the 27SA pre-rRNAs started to decrease at the 18 h time point as shown with probes D and E (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f5">5</xref>D and E, lanes 4&#x02013;6). Concomitantly with the diminution of the 27SA pre-rRNAs pools, the 35S precursor accumulated as detected by all the probes used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f5">5</xref>B&#x02013;F), the 20S pre-rRNA steady-state levels decreased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f5">5</xref>C, probe C) and a 23S aberrant precursor, detected by probes B, C and D, arose (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f5">5</xref>B&#x02013;D). The latter stems from the direct cleavage of the 35S pre-rRNA at site A<sub>3</sub> and was indicative of a mild inhibition of early cleavages at sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c44">44</xref>). This is consistent with the slight reduction in the 18S rRNA steady-state levels observed upon Dbp10p depletion. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f5">5</xref>H, analyses of low molecular RNAs revealed a clear decrease of 7S pre-rRNA steady-state levels and a diminution in mature 5.8S rRNAs upon depletion. The 5S rRNA steady-state levels remained relatively constant during the depletion time course with a decrease at the later time points. Primer extension analysis performed with probe G indicated that during the time course of Dbp10p depletion, 27SB<sub>S</sub>&#x0002f;27SB<sub>L</sub> ratios remained unchanged and processing at sites A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>1L</sub> and B<sub>1S</sub> was accurate at the nucleotide level (data not shown).</p><p>A comparison between pre-rRNA and rRNA steady-state levels from the <italic>dbp10-1</italic> mutant and the wild-type strains grown at three different temperatures (30&#x000b0;C, room temperature and 18&#x000b0;C) showed that the major difference between the two strains resided in a reduced steady-state level of mature 25S rRNA and increased 27SB pre-rRNA steady-state levels in the mutant strain, especially at the more restrictive temperatures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f6">6</xref>A&#x02013;F, compare lane 2 to 5 and lane 3 to 6). Steady-state levels of other precursors were not affected, except at 18&#x000b0;C where the 35S pre-rRNA steady-state level is clearly increased and the 23S aberrant precursor appeared.</p><p>Altogether these results confirmed that the primary and major defect occurring in ribosome biogenesis when Dbp10p function was impaired (either by depletion or due to mutation) was an inhibition of the maturation of the 27SB intermediates into 25S mature rRNA and 7S pre-rRNAs, which corresponded to processing events at sites C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Dbp10p localises to the nucleus with enrichment in the nucleolus</title><p>Most of the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors involved in ribosome biogenesis are located in the nucleolus, whereas components of the ribosome are mainly found in the cytoplasm. In order to distinguish between a <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor and a component of the ribosome, the subcellular localisation of Dbp10p was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. For this purpose, a centromeric plasmid-borne HA-<italic>DBP10</italic> allele under the control of its cognate promoter and expressing a fully functional N-terminally HA-epitope-tagged Dbp10p was constructed (YCplac111-HA-<italic>DBP10</italic>, see Materials and Methods). Indirect immunofluorescence was performed with the YBF1-1B &#x0005b;YCplac111-<italic>HA-DBP10</italic>&#x0005d; strain following growth in YPD medium to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6. The HA-Dbp10p was detected with primary monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibodies and secondary goat anti-mouse rhodamine-conjugated antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f7">7</xref>A), the nucleus was visualised by staining DNA with 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f7">7</xref>C) and the nucleolus was visualised by the detection of the Nop1p with primary polyclonal rabbit anti-Nop1 and secondary goat anti-rabbit fluorescein-conjugated antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f7">7</xref>B). The HA-Dbp10p was restricted to the nucleus and highly enriched in a crescent-shaped area (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f7">7</xref>A) corresponding to the nucleolus as shown by its colocalisation with Nop1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f7">7</xref>F, overlap in yellow). A small part of HA-Dbp10p was also detected throughout the nucleoplasm as indicated by the colocalisation with the DAPI staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f7">7</xref>E, overlap in magenta). This may represent its normal distribution within the nucleus or may be due to the presence of the HA-epitope, or the fact that the gene is located on a plasmid, despite its cognate promoter. No signal was detected with the anti-HA antibody in control cells not harbouring the HA-<italic>DBP10</italic> allele (data not shown). The predominant nucleolar localisation of the HA-Dbp10 protein and its absence in the cytoplasm were consistent with the role of Dbp10p as a <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor in 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this paper, we describe the functional analysis of the ORF <italic>YDL031w</italic>. <italic>YDL031w</italic> contains all eight conserved motifs characteristic of the proteins of the DEAD-box family of putative RNA helicases, and therefore we renamed it <italic>DBP10</italic>. Like most genes encoding putative RNA helicases involved in ribosome biogenesis, <italic>DBP10</italic> is essential for vegetative growth. Thus, to pursue the phenotypic analysis, we constructed two different conditional systems: the cold sensitive <italic>dbp10-1</italic> mutant strain and the conditional lethal <italic>GAL::DBP10</italic> strain.</p><p>Polysome analyses and quantification of total ribosomal subunits in these strains revealed a deficit in 60S ribosomal subunits leading to the formation of half-mer polysomes. These phenotypic features are characteristic of mutants affecting either structural components of the 60S ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c47">47</xref>) or <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors involved in its biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c48">48</xref>). Rather than being a structural component of the 60S ribosomal subunit, Dbp10p is more likely a <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor involved in its biogenesis since a HA-epitope tagged Dbp10p was mostly localised in the nucleolus and was not detected in the cytoplasm.</p><p>Analyses of rRNA synthesis by pulse&#x02013;chase and northern blots confirmed that the deficit in 60S ribosomal subunits observed in the <italic>dbp10-1</italic> and <italic>GAL::DBP10</italic> strains is due to an inhibition of the pre-rRNA processing, which causes a deficit of the 25S and 5.8S mature rRNAs. The most striking pre-rRNA processing defect in these strains is the accumulation of the normal 27SB intermediates to the detriment of the mature 25S rRNA and of the 7S pre-rRNAs precursor to the 5.8S rRNAs. The 7S pre-rRNAs and the 25S rRNA are generated from the 27SB intermediates through processing reactions at sites C<sub>1</sub> at the 5&#x02032; end of the 25S rRNA and C<sub>2</sub> in ITS2. Little is known about these processing steps that are likely to be coupled. The sequences surrounding the sites are important but the nature of the cleavage reactions (endonucleolytic and&#x0002f;or exonucleolytic) is still under question and so far no <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors have been specifically implicated in these cleavage steps. It is not clear whether Dbp10p is directly involved in the cleavage reactions or whether it plays a role in the assembly process of a pre-ribosomal particle. In the latter case, an assembly defect would result in stable 27SB pre-rRNA intermediates that cannot be processed due to an incorrect structure or composition of the pre-ribosomal particle.</p><p>Because the specific substrate and the interacting partners of Dbp10p are not identified, it is not possible to precisely define its role in 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis. However, and interestingly, one intriguing peculiarity that we observed during the phenotypic analysis of Dbp10p is the presence of two close peaks in the polysome profiles at the position where a single peak corresponding to free 60S ribosomal subunit is normally observed. The additional &#x02018;60S-like&#x02019; peak arose in the <italic>GAL::DBP10</italic> strain after 12 h of depletion and in the <italic>dbp10-1</italic> mutant strain grown at restrictive temperatures (room temperature and 18&#x000b0;C). Remarkably, at the same time, these strains harboured the highest 27SB pre-rRNA steady-state levels. It is likely that the &#x02018;60S-like&#x02019; additional peak corresponds to a sort of pre-ribosomal particle that accumulates when Dbp10p function is impaired. The &#x02018;60S-like&#x02019; particle has a sedimentation coefficient very close to that of the mature 60S subunit, which leads to some overlap of the two peaks in polysomes gradients. Furthermore, compared to the overall mature 60S subunits the &#x02018;60S-like&#x02019; particles represent a very minor population. Thus, we were not able to determine the protein composition of this peculiar particle. Indeed, no satisfying purification of pre-ribosomal particles has ever been reported. Overcoming these technical limitations will greatly help our understanding of the ribosome assembly process, which is still very poor, and isolation of mutants (such as <italic>DBP10</italic>) leading to accumulation of stable pre-particles will certainly be of great help.</p><p>In addition to Dbp10p, four components (Nop2p, Spb1p, Nip7p, Spb4p) have been described that show a delayed processing at sites C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>. Mutations in the corresponding genes lead to the accumulation of the 27SB pre-rRNAs and delayed synthesis of the 5.8S and 25S mature rRNAs. Nop2p and Spb1p are two putative RNA methyltransferases. Whereas in the case of Nop2p the delay in 27SB processing is accompanied by a delay in methylation at the site U<sub>m</sub>G<sub>m</sub>&#x003a8;UC<sub>2922</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c48">48</xref>), no specific methylation defect has been described for Spb1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c50">50</xref>). Nip7p is both a nucleolar and cytoplasmic protein that interacts with a component of the exosome and with Nop8p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c52">52</xref>). Spb4p is a putative RNA helicase of the DEAD-box protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c22">22</xref>). As for Dbp10p, there is no strong experimental evidence that these factors are directly involved in the pre-rRNA processing reactions <italic>per se</italic> and the favoured hypothesis is that they rather play a role in the assembly process of the pre-ribosomal particles. We believe that the absence of the corresponding functional proteins lead to particles in which the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> cleavage sites are no longer accessible for cleavage and further processing.</p><p>In addition to the defect in the maturation of the 27SB intermediates, at later time points of Dbp10p depletion, an inhibition of the early cleavages at sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> was apparent, leading to a diminution of the 18S rRNA pools. This was revealed by the accumulation of the 35S pre-rRNA and the 23S aberrant intermediate, and the decrease of the 27SA<sub>2</sub> and 20S intermediates. Inhibition of the early processing steps has been reported for numerous mutations that specifically affect 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c55">55</xref>). Indeed, while many mutations inhibit the formation of the 18S rRNA without affecting that of the 25S and 5.8S rRNAs, very few affect the latter without at least delaying the A<sub>0</sub>-A<sub>2</sub> cleavages. It has been proposed that the early processing machinery has a mechanism for checking that processing factors needed for the subsequent steps are assembling correctly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c12">12</xref>). The role of Dbp10p in 25S&#x0002f;5.8S rRNAs appears to be specific since neither the synthesis of the 5S rRNAs and the tRNAs nor rRNA methylation were significantly affected. There is only a very minor effect on the overall synthesis of the 18S rRNA and the steady-state levels of the 40S ribosomal subunit.</p><p>Dbp10p is the seventh putative RNA helicase described that is involved in 60S ribosomal subunit biosynthesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd384f1">1</xref>). Two have been assigned a function in the pre-rRNA processing itself, Dbp3p in the cleavage at site A<sub>3</sub> performed by RNase MRP and Dob1p in assisting the exosome in trimming the 3&#x02032; end of the 7S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c31">31</xref>). Two proteins still lack precise descriptions of their pre-rRNA processing defects, their role in 60S synthesis being solely deduced from aberrant polysome profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c56">56</xref>). The remaining three have been assigned a function in the assembly process with an effect on pre-rRNA processing as a consequence (Dbp6p, Dbp7p and Spb4p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c22">22</xref>). Regarding the consequences on pre-rRNA processing, two classes of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors have been evoked (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c50">50</xref>). One class of factors has mutations that lead to the depletion of the 27S intermediates, which is thought to be due to a rapid degradation of the pre-rRNA due to the instability of the pre-particles formed in the absence of these factors. This is the case for the Dbp6 and Dbp7 proteins. The second class of factors has mutations that lead to the accumulation of the normal 27S intermediates, which suggests that a stable pre-particle is formed but that it is no longer adequate for processing to occur. This is the case for the Spb4p and Dbp10p proteins. It has also been suggested that factors belonging to the first class act in the early steps of the 60S ribosomal assembly pathway, whereas factors belonging to the second class act in later steps (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c57">57</xref>). To date, our knowledge on the assembly process is too scarce to confirm or reject either hypothesis.</p><p>The 27SB intermediates that accumulated in the <italic>dbp10</italic> and <italic>spb4</italic> conditional strains migrate in run-off sucrose gradients in a manner similar to particles with a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 66S, as do the 27SB intermediates present in&#x000a0;a wild-type strain (data not shown; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd384c22">22</xref>). However, no additional &#x02018;60S-like&#x02019; peak was detected in polysome gradients of the conditional <italic>spb4</italic> strains. Furthermore, each of these two helicases is essential and functionally not redundant. Indeed, over-expression of Dbp10p does not suppress the growth defect of the <italic>sbp4-1</italic> strain and does not bypass the lethal phenotype of the <italic>spb4</italic> null strain. Reciprocally, over-expression of Spb4p does not suppress the growth defect of the <italic>dbp10-1</italic> strain and does not bypass the lethal phenotype of the <italic>dbp10</italic> null strain. This suggests that various and distinct assembly steps (still undefined) are required for generating functional 27SB-containing pre-particles, and it becomes more and more clear that numerous structural rearrangements have to occur, and that these are most likely driven by RNA helicases.</p><p>It is obvious that characterisation of all the factors required for ribosome biogenesis is an essential step in the complete understanding of this process. One next important step concerning the RNA helicases as ribosome biogenesis <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors will be the demonstration of their enzymatic activities, the determination of their substrate specificity and the discovery of their interacting partners.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd384f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Pre-rRNA processing in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>.

The 27SA<sub>2</sub> precursor is processed by two alternative pathways that both lead to the formation of mature 5.8S and 25S rRNAs. In the major pathway, the 27SA<sub>2</sub> precursor is cleaved at site A<sub>3</sub> by the RNase MRP complex. The putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase Dpb3p assists in this processing step. The 27SA<sub>3</sub> precursor is exonucleolytically digested 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; up to site B<sub>1S</sub> to yield the 27SB<sub>S</sub> precursor, a reaction requiring the exonucleases Xrn1p and Rat1p. A minor pathway processes the 27SA<sub>2</sub> molecule at site B<sub>1L</sub>, producing the 27SB<sub>L</sub> pre-rRNA. While processing at site B<sub>1</sub> is completed, the 3&#x02032; end of mature 25S rRNA is generated by processing at site B<sub>2</sub>. The subsequent processing at ITS2 appears to be identical for both 27SB species. Cleavage at sites C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> releases the mature 25S rRNA and the 7S pre-rRNA. The latter undergoes exosome-dependent 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exonuclease digestion to the 3&#x02032; end of the mature 5.8S rRNA. It has been proposed that Dob1p&#x0002f;Mtr4p, a putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase, assists the exosome activity. The data presented in this study suggest that Dbp10p is required for a late step in the assembly of 60S ribosomal subunits, a process that may also involve six other putative ATP-dependent RNA helicases: Dbp6p, Dbp7p, Dbp9p, Spb4p, Drs1p and Mak5p. The pre-rRNA processing phenotype of the Drs1p-depleted and Mak5p-depleted strains has not been described. Data concerning Dbp8p and Dbp9p are unpublished results from our laboratory.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkd38401"/></fig><fig id="gkd384f2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p> Mutations in <italic>DBP10</italic> or depletion of Dbp10p results in growth inhibition.
