Distinguishing the expression of <italic>MyoD </italic>in satellite myoblasts and muscle fibres has proved difficult <italic>in vivo </italic>leading to controversy over the significance of <italic>MyoD </italic>expression within adult innervated muscle fibres. Here we employ the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>transgenic mouse, in which the 6 kb proximal enhancer/promoter (DRR/PRR) of <italic>MyoD </italic>drives <italic>lacZ</italic>, to show that MyoD is present and transcriptionally active in many adult muscle fibres.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In culture, <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>expresses in myotubes but not myogenic cells, unlike endogenous <italic>MyoD</italic>.

The <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>reporter is down-regulated both in adult muscle fibres by denervation or muscle disuse and in cultured myotubes by inhibition of activity. Activity induces and represses <italic>MyoD </italic>through the DRR and PRR, respectively. During the postnatal period, accumulation of &#x003b2;-galactosidase correlates with maturation of innervation.

In the absence of <italic>MyoD</italic>, muscle regeneration is impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] possibly due to delayed differentiation of muscle precursor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, <italic>MyoD </italic>is also expressed in adult muscle fibres, albeit at low levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Conditions that damage muscle or change muscle phenotype often lead to changes of <italic>MyoD </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, when changes in <italic>MyoD </italic>expression occur, it is unclear how much is in fibres, myogenic cells or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the activity and regulation of <italic>MyoD </italic>in normal muscle fibres is unknown.</p><p>The role of MyoD within muscle fibres is unknown. Differential expression of <italic>MyoD </italic>has been observed between muscles with distinct fibre type composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In several vertebrates, <italic>MyoD </italic>mRNA and protein is relatively more abundant in fast muscle and <italic>myogenin </italic>mRNA in slow muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], suggesting a potential role in controlling muscle fibre phenotype. In the absence of MyoD, contractile function is perturbed due to diminished regulatory proteins within the muscle fibre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, <italic>MyoD </italic>is up-regulated in situations that cause the muscle fibres to change size. It has been proposed that MRFs are up-regulated to prevent muscle atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In fact, signalling pathways within muscle that reduce MyoD function are associated with muscle wasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, denervation, a cause of rapid catabolism, has been shown to increase <italic>MyoD </italic>RNA and protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, the use of a <italic>myf5</italic>-lacZ reporter demonstrated that <italic>myf5 </italic>within adult muscle fibres was increased by denervation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This indicates that MRFs within adult muscle fibres may be controlled by the nerve and/or electrical activity and regulate some aspect of muscle function.</p><p>To date, <italic>MyoD </italic>regulation has been defined to occur through two elements. A 'core enhancer' around 20 kb 5' of the transcriptional start site drives early embryonic myoblast expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. A bipartite element in the 5' proximal 6 kb contains a 'Distal Regulatory Region' (DRR) and a Proximal Regulatory Region (PRR), which together drive expression in adult muscle fibres and cultured muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A transgenic construct, <italic>MD6.0-lacZ</italic>, in which the proximal 6 kb containing the DRR and PRR drives expression of nuclear-targeted &#x003b2;-galactosidase, mimics <italic>MyoD </italic>expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, showing appropriate preferential expression in some fast muscle fibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Deletion of the DRR element from the endogenous locus by homologous recombination leads to a reduction of <italic>MyoD </italic>expression in adult muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], possibly from the fibre nuclei. Therefore, as endogenous <italic>MyoD </italic>is responsive to the nerve/electrical activity, we tested the hypothesis that elements in and around the DRR/PRR, which drives <italic>MyoD </italic>expression in fibre myonuclei, are also regulated by the nerve and/or electrical activity.</p><p>We used the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>reporter mouse to show that this regulatory element of <italic>MyoD </italic>is activated in fibres by innervation and muscle activity. Comparison of DRR/PRR reporter and endogenous <italic>MyoD </italic>expression shows that activity-dependent regulation of <italic>MyoD </italic>is more complex than previously supposed. Denervation induces an opposite response from the DRR/PRR compared to endogenous <italic>MyoD</italic>. Altered activity levels with an intact nerve, during firing pattern maturation, induces a similar response in the DRR/PRR element compared to the endogenous gene. Furthermore, we show that maintenance of <italic>MyoD </italic>expression through the DRR/PRR element is dependent on positive feedback by MyoD, providing strong evidence that MyoD protein is transcriptionally active within normal adult muscle fibres.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>is specifically expressed in nuclei of MyHC-positive cells</title><p>We investigated the expression pattern of the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>transgene in cross-sections from adult muscle and myoblast cultures. Four lines of evidence, taken together, indicate that the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>transgene is expressed postnatally in differentiated muscle fibres. First, the location and frequency of nuclear-targeted &#x003b2;gal in adult muscle cross-sections from <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>mice show that many fibre nuclei express the transgene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Second, culture experiments using single fibres from dissociated <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>muscles show &#x003b2;gal in fibre myonuclei, but not in mononucleate activated satellite cells on or migrating away from a single fibre, even though activated cells contain abundant MyoD protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). As reported previously, MyoD protein is very weakly detected in adult fibre nuclei, consistent with the greater sensitivity of &#x003b2;gal staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Third, primary neonatal myoblast cultures with no differentiated MyHC-positive cells contain no &#x003b2;gal activity, although desmin-positive myogenic cells are present (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). Fourth, when such cultures are permitted to differentiate, &#x003b2;gal-containing nuclei appear following MyHC expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C&#x02013;G</xref>). After ten days differentiation, 92% of multinucleate myotubes contained &#x003b2;gal and MyHC as did 94% for mononucleated myocytes, showing that <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>is activated upon myoblast differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D&#x02013;G</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>reporter is specifically expressed by fibre nuclei and not dividing myoblasts or activated satellite cells. <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>acts, therefore, as a reporter of factors regulating <italic>MyoD </italic>expression within differentiated muscle.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>reporter is specifically associated with fibre nuclei</bold>. <bold>A</bold>, Cross-section through the TA muscle of an <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>adult transgenic mouse reacted with X-gal.

All constructs containing more than the basal promoter express at similar levels in undifferentiated myoblasts and in cells triggered to differentiate overnight (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). After four days differentiation, however, the full length <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>construct shows significant up-regulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), with 72% of cells having detectable X-gal reactivity (data not shown). Removal of the DRR by truncation to 4 kb completely abolishes the up-regulation, and further truncations containing only the PRR element lead to a repression of activity during differentiation, although some residual activity does remain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The ratio of <italic>PRRlacZ </italic>activity to luciferase control plasmid was 0.3 &#x000b1; 0.001 and 0.001 &#x000b1; 0.003 after 1d and 4d differentiation, respectively. In contrast, the low activity of the empty PD46lacZ control vector did not change during differentiation. These data suggest that the PRR becomes repressed during myotube maturation, rather than simply failing to respond to signals that increase expression during maturation. Furthermore, the repressive effect of the PRR could be reversed by addition of the DRR, showing that the DRR contains an element activated during differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Nevertheless, the overall activity of the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>construct is significantly higher than that of the DRR/PRR alone, indicating that other aspects of the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>sequence are essential for full activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). We conclude that the activity of multiple elements within the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>construct change during muscle differentiation, with those in and around the DRR being activated and those in the PRR being repressed.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>contains elements differentially regulated during differentiation</bold>.

Thus, different regulatory elements within the <italic>MyoD </italic>gene regulate myoblast and myofibre expression. After birth, MyoD is down-regulated, becoming less abundant in myoblasts and barely detectable in most fibre nuclei at postnatal day 6 (P6; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). As with endogenous MyoD, &#x003b2;gal activity from <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>is detected in only a few fibres in neonates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C,E,G</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, at this stage, &#x003b2;gal activity is preferentially localised within central nuclei of large slow fibres (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C,E,G</xref>). This preferential slow fibre localisation is found in all hindlimb muscles analysed. In postnatal day 0 (P0) tibialis anterior (TA), 44% (11/25) of slow fibres and 5% (9/187) of fast fibres react for X-gal. Similarly, in P0 lateral gastrocnemius, 24% (10/41) of slow fibres but only ~1% (1/73) of non-slow fibres contained &#x003b2;gal activity. Therefore, reporter expression is restricted to the more mature fibres at this stage, many of which are slow fibres.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold><italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>is active in slow and fast fibre types as each matures</bold>.

As muscles mature, the expression of <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>is not maintained in slow fibres but instead accumulates in muscle regions rich in fast fibres (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D,F,H</xref>). This pattern is similar to that previously described in adult <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>muscles and to the pattern of endogenous MyoD protein expression in maturing rodent muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Thus, commencing just before P9, <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>reporter expression up-regulates preferentially within fast fibres in regions where muscle fibres will subsequently be predominantly large type IIb fibres. This up-regulation parallels maturation of neural firing patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], raising the possibility that nerve-dependent muscle activity regulates the DRR/PRR element.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>expression is maintained by activity</title><p>To examine the effect of innervation on <italic>MyoD </italic>expression, mouse lower hindlimb muscle was denervated by unilateral sciatic nerve section. At 5 days post-operation, expression of the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>reporter declines at both the protein and mRNA levels. Wholemount X-gal stain reveals a striking loss of reaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Contralateral and mock-operated muscles show no significant change in expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and data not shown). The fold decrease elicited by denervation in <italic>lacZ </italic>mRNA is 4 &#x000b1; 1 (n = 5) for <italic>lacZ</italic>/<italic>actin </italic>mRNA level and possibly slightly greater for &#x003b2;gal protein at 7 &#x000b1; 2 (n = 3) for &#x003b2;gal content/total DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B,C</xref>). At five days post-operation no decline in muscle wet mass is apparent, but ribosomal RNA is significantly increased relative to contralateral control muscles, whereas actin mRNA is not. A similar loss of reporter activity is observed when <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>lower hindlimb muscles are immobilised for five days compared to contralateral control muscles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Therefore, activity maintains <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>reporter expression within the muscle fibre. As reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>reporter activity and endogenous <italic>MyoD </italic>expression is less in innervated slow soleus muscle than in innervated fast EDL muscle. This low level of reporter activity in soleus is also nerve-dependent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). Thus, slow and fast nerves each up-regulate <italic>MyoD </italic>reporter activity in their respective target muscles. The data suggest that the up-regulation of endogenous <italic>MyoD </italic>in fibres induced by maturing innervation and/or activity is mediated by elements within the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>transgene. To test further the role of activity in <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>expression we examined myotubes treated with high K<sup>+ </sup>medium, which has previously been shown to down-regulate <italic>MyoD </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

Moreover, immunological detection of MyoD protein either three or five days after explant gave a similar result, with increased MyoD immunoreaction in both fibre nuclei and in satellite cell-derived nuclei, which we identified by their strong Syndecan-4 expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

MyoD protein was detected within many nuclei of fibres from denervated muscle, but was essentially undetectable in fibres from contralateral innervated muscle.

Taken together with the strong up-regulation of <italic>MyoD </italic>mRNA and loss of <italic>lacZ </italic>mRNA in Northern blots of denervated muscle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), these data show that the up-regulation of MyoD in fibres requires elements outside the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>construct.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>MD6.0-lacZ</italic> is down-regulated in <italic>MyoD</italic><sup>-/- </sup>fibres</title><p>In myoblasts, MyoD can positively auto-regulate its own expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].

Expression of the fibre specific reporter, <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>was examined in a <italic>MyoD </italic>null mutant background.

It was therefore conceivable that a decline in activity of endogenous MyoD following denervation (despite its increased abundance) might account for the loss of reporter expression.

This <italic>MyoD </italic>expression is regulated by innervation and muscle activity, which act both positively and negatively on several separable regulatory elements in the <italic>MyoD </italic>gene to fine tune <italic>MyoD </italic>expression. The data implicate MyoD in the adaptation of muscle to altered physiological activity.</p><p>Cultured myoblasts and activated satellite cells do not express <italic>MD6.0-lacZ</italic>. On terminal differentiation, most myotubes in cell culture activate <italic>MD6.0-lacZ</italic>. In mice, <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>expression is only observed in fibres. These data are consistent with the late onset of <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>expression in the embryo, the correlation of differentiation failure with loss of <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>expression and the requirement for the DRR element for <italic>MyoD </italic>expression in adult muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thus, myoblast <italic>MyoD </italic>expression is not driven through the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>element, at least after birth. DRR-driven reporters do express at low levels in proliferating myoblasts in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>](Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, our data show that such expression may not be significant in the <italic>in vivo </italic>context, with the possible exception of satellite cell activation in regenerating muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In our hands, essentially all cultured mononucleated cells expressing <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>also contain the terminal differentiation marker MyHC. Moreover, denervation or fibre explant induce MyoD accumulation in satellite cells without up-regulating <italic>MD6.0-lacZ</italic>. Taken together with the differential expression of both <italic>MyoD </italic>and <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>between adult muscles of distinct contractile character [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], these data provide compelling evidence that most, probably all, <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>expression is in differentiated muscle fibres. However, not all muscle fibres express the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>reporter simultaneously.</p><p>Altered nerve activity appears to drive postnatal <italic>MyoD </italic>and <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>expression changes. Innervation is required for muscle maturation. For example, firing pattern determines mature fast fibre types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. As fast fibres and their innervation mature during the first postnatal week, <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>expression emerges predominantly in the fastest fibres of fast muscles, which have burst firing but low overall electrical activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Subsequently, fast <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>reporter expression is nerve-dependent. We suggest, therefore, that maturing fast firing promotes <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>expression in fast fibres. Conversely, prior to fast fibre maturation, <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>expression is confined to small numbers of mainly large slow fibres. This expression declines as slow fibres mature further. Firing patterns in newborn mice are unknown, but by P12 rat slow soleus motor units have a mature electrical firing rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], suggesting the maturing slow firing pattern suppresses expression of <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>in slow fibres before the second postnatal week. Nevertheless, adult slow soleus fibres require innervation to maintain their low levels of <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>expression. Even a reduction in activity through leg immobilisation leads to decline in <italic>MyoD </italic>reporter expression, indicating that it is the activity elicited in muscle by the nerve that is required, rather than other 'trophic' factors. Thus, the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>reporter appears to contain elements that integrate electrical activity-dependent signals in distinct fibre types during development and maturation.</p><p>Denervation of adult muscle leads to a decrease in <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>activity. Therefore, in the adult fibre, elements inside <italic>MD6.0-lacZ</italic>, possibly the DRR, integrate activity-dependent signals. Unlike the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>reporter, various MRF mRNAs are induced by denervation, although because satellite cells become activated the location of the up-regulated mRNAs has been unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Transient up-regulation of MyoD protein early after denervation has been reported in rat satellite cells and muscle fibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We confirm up-regulation of MyoD in both fibre and satellite cell nuclei on denervation. Similarly, a <italic>myf5 </italic>reporter is induced in fibre nuclei after denervation. However, <italic>myf5 </italic>is not expressed in innervated fibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], which indicates that <italic>myf5 </italic>and <italic>MyoD </italic>are regulated differently in adult muscle fibres.</p><p>Our data show that maintenance of normal levels of <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>expression in adult fast fibres is dependent upon MyoD itself. MyoD is well known to regulate its own expression during myogenic conversion of various cell types <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The action of MyoD in fibres is probably a cell autonomous positive auto-regulatory loop as MyoD mRNA and protein are differentially accumulated in adult fast fibres, just like <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The DRR is required in the endogenous <italic>MyoD </italic>gene for normal adult expression, making it an obvious candidate site for MyoD positive feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We show that this region is positively regulated by activity during myotube maturation. However, the DRR, PRR and intervening elements each contain several potential MRF binding sites. In addition, a MEF2 site in the DRR helps drive myotube expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Our data do not preclude cooperative roles for other factors, such as Mef2, in regulating MyoD in fibres. As MyoD can collaborate with Mef2 to enhance transcription in the absence of a MyoD binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], MyoD could directly enhance its own expression without DNA binding. Further work will be required to determine where within the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>region MyoD actually binds in mature fibres. To conclude, we have thus identified two factors, MyoD protein and fibre activity, that are required for essentially all expression of <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>in adult fibres.</p><p>A separate mechanism requiring elements outside <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>up-regulates <italic>MyoD </italic>after denervation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Suppression of activity in culture, or denervation <italic>in vivo</italic>, down-regulates <italic>MD6.0-lacZ</italic>, probably through loss of the positive effect on the DRR region. In contrast, denervation up-regulates expression of the intact <italic>MyoD </italic>gene in fibres. The ability of activity to suppress expression from constructs containing the PRR but lacking the DRR, suggests that elements outside <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>region may interact with the PRR. In our view, the simplest resolution of these data is to suggest that a general effect of innervation is to suppress <italic>MyoD </italic>through elements outside the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>construct. However, particular kinds of activity can overcome this suppression, perhaps by acting positively through the DRR. For example, the parallel increase in <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>activity and MyoD during fast fibre maturation may act in this manner. These findings indicate that denervated fibres have a unique status, at least in terms of MRF expression, and do not appear to return to an 'immature' myotube-like state. In summary, activity-dependent regulation of <italic>MyoD</italic>, as well as embryonic and myoblast expression, requires elements outside the DRR/PRR.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Model of <italic>MyoD </italic>regulation in adult muscle fibres</bold>. <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>element(s) constituting a 'Fibre Enhancer' integrate two signals, positive auto-regulation by MyoD and nerve/activity-dependence, and target them onto the native <italic>MyoD </italic>promoter. Activity effects on the DRR/PRR region comprise suppression of PRR (grey line) and activation of DRR, which predominates in the intact DRR/PRR region (black lines). Another activity-dependent 'Denervation Enhancer' mediates the activation of <italic>MyoD </italic>in adult fibres after denervation by one of two routes. Activity may suppress this enhancer, which otherwise directly activates the basal promoter (dashed lines). Alternatively, this enhancer may co-operate with the PRR (dotted arrow) to activate the basal promoter when direct effects of nerve on the DRR/PRR region (solid lines) are absent. In either case, upon denervation the poised low-level <italic>MyoD </italic>expression driven through <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>Fibre Enhancer is lost, but MyoD rises driven by the Denervation Enhancer. Despite the increased level of nuclear MyoD protein, lack of nerve/activity prevents maximal activation of the <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>transgene. In innervated fibres, we propose that subtle differences in activity in otherwise similar fibres lead to changes in <italic>MyoD </italic>expression that are amplified by positive feedback (grey arrow) through the Fibre Enhancer, thereby explaining fibre-to-fibre variation in <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>and <italic>MyoD </italic>expression. Active MyoD in these fibres may mediate some effects of the nerve, such as the rate of anabolism (open arrow). Elsewhere in the gene, elements missing from <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>control expression in, for example, early embryonic myogenic cells and other myoblasts.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-8-5-6"/></fig><p>The effects of electrical activity appear complex and dispersed in the <italic>MyoD </italic>locus. Whereas nascent cultured myotubes, and early embryonic fibres <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], express <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>highly when they are spontaneously active, <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>is not highly expressed in fibres at birth, when innervation is present but firing pattern is immature. This indicates that certain kinds of activity may suppress <italic>MD6.0-lacZ</italic>. Consistent with this, in the absence of the DRR, activity inhibits expression from the PRR element in cultured myotubes. However, neonatal denervation does not lead to <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>up-regulation (A. Brack, unpublished observation). Thus, it appears that positive effects of particular kinds of activity acting through the DRR can override the suppressive effects acting via the PRR.</p><p>In both <italic>MyoD</italic><sup>+/- </sup>and <italic>MyoD</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice, <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>is differentially expressed between fast and slow muscle and expression declines following five days denervation. Therefore, MyoD is not needed for innervation to promote differential reporter expression between fibre types. The parallel decline of <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>mRNA and &#x003b2;gal protein after denervation and in <italic>MyoD</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice show that changes in reporter protein turnover do not account for all changes in reporter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Thus, multiple regulatory mechanisms co-ordinate the expression of <italic>MyoD </italic>in adult muscle tissue and those acting within <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>mediate nerve- and MyoD-dependent activation in fibres in an apparently mutually independent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The positive feedback of MyoD on the DRR/PRR appears to sensitize innervated fibres to changes in activity. Based on the ability of activity to promote transcription through the DRR in cultured cells, we suggest that the positive effects of electrical activity on <italic>MD6.0-lacZ in vivo </italic>act through the DRR, which is required for normal adult <italic>MyoD </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The role of MyoD is not completely understood, but the function of MyoD in adult fast fibres is unlikely to be restricted to auto-regulation (see below). To date, the mild fibre phenotype of <italic>MyoD </italic>null mice has shed insufficient light on the role of MyoD in fibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Nevertheless, our findings show that MyoD is present and transcriptionally-active in large numbers of muscle fibres in adult mice.</p><p>MyoD has been proposed to limit muscle atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Muscle growth can occur by both the fusion of myoblasts from activated satellite cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and by the anabolic accumulation of cytoplasm in an existing fibre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. MyoD is present in both satellite cells and fibre nuclei where, as we show, they are controlled by different enhancer elements. It is tempting to speculate that <italic>MyoD </italic>could have a role in both forms of muscle growth, with the DRR/PRR region involved in anabolic cytoplasmic growth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). MyoD may control developmental MyHCs in nascent fibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. After maturation, fibre MyoD expression is primarily associated with the larger fast fibre types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We note that <italic>MD6.0-lacZ </italic>is not always expressed in the largest fibres of a particular type. Could reporter expression reflect fibres in a particular anabolic state e.g. in the process of increasing their size? In the <italic>MyoD </italic>null mouse there is a shift of fast fibres to a slower phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and during hindlimb unloading the <italic>MyoD </italic>null mouse fails to up-regulate <italic>myHC IIb </italic>gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].
