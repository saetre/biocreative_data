CK2 is implicated in several physiologic and pathologic processes, particularly in cancer biology. CK2 is comprised of several subunits, including CK2&#x003b1;, CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; and CK2&#x003b2;. Inactivation of <italic>CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032;</italic> leads to chromatin degeneration of germ cells, resulting in male sterility. To identify additional targets of CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; in testes and to determine the role of CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; in germ cell nuclear integrity, GST pull-down and protein&#x02013;protein interaction assays were conducted. A novel testis-specific gene, <italic>CKT2</italic> (CK2 Target protein 2), was found whose product interacts with and is phosphorylated by CK2 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. CKT2 is a 30.2 kDa protein with one coiled-coil domain and six putative phosphorylation sites. High expression of CKT2 correlated with chromatin condensation of spermatids in murine testes. Findings reported herein demonstrate that CKT2 is a target protein of native CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; in testes and suggest that CKT2 plays a role in chromatin regulation of male germ cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Protein Kinase CK2 is a serine/threonine phosphotransferase that exists primarily as a tetrameric structure with two catalytic subunits, CK2 alpha (CK2&#x003b1;) and CK2 alpha prime (CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032;), and two regulatory CK2 beta (CK2&#x003b2;) subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). CK2&#x003b1; and CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; are gene products of <italic>Csnk2a1</italic> and <italic>Csnk2a2</italic>, respectively. A third isoform of the catalytic subunit, called CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x02032;, is a larger variant of CK2&#x003b1; that has a translated Alu sequence at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The human genome contains four CK2 loci, corresponding to three active genes, coding for the catalytic &#x003b1; and &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunits, one regulatory &#x003b2; subunit, and a processed &#x003b1; subunit pseudogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). CK2 has the unique ability to utilize GTP as a phosphate donor in place of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>CK2 has been reported to phosphorylate many physiological substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). More than one-third of the known 300+ protein substrates phosphorylated by CK2 are involved in gene expression and protein synthesis, either as transcription factors, effectors of DNA/RNA structure, or translation elements. Substrates for CK2 also function as signalling proteins and those essential for viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Candidate cellular CK2 substrates include proto-oncogene products such as c-Myc, c-Myb and c-Jun; tumour-suppressor gene products such as p53 and BRCA1; transcriptional regulators such as Max, Cut, PU.1/IRF4 and Six1; and components of the canonical Wnt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>CK2 has been implicated in diverse cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and cell growth, circadian rhythms, apoptosis, regulation of cell polarity, embryonic development, cell morphology and the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Increased constitutive activity of CK2 has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and cardiovascular disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>The best known pathogenic role for CK2 has been in neoplastic growth and high CK2 activity has been observed in numerous cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Consistent with its ability to enhance cancer growth, CK2 promotes aberrant activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, suppression of cellular apoptosis and survival of breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). It also induces lymphocyte transformation in transgenic mice, collaborates with Ha-Ras in fibroblast transformation, and is involved in the pathobiology of androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). CK2 can exert an anti-apoptotic role by protecting regulatory proteins from caspase-mediated degradation and counteracting caspase cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). As a result of its cancer-promoting properties, CK2 has been considered to be a target of anti-neoplastic treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>The catalytic subunits of CK2&#x02014;CK2&#x003b1; and CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x02014;are paralog proteins. Typically, the evolution of paralog proteins is associated with a functional specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). CK2&#x003b1; and CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; exhibit approximately 90% identity in their catalytic domains, but mainly differ in their C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). CK2&#x003b1;&#x02019; and CK2&#x003b1; are significantly different with respect to some well-known CK2 properties such as autophosphorylation and supra-molecular aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Abundance of CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032;-containing holoenzyme in certain tissues suggests an important role of CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; in these tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Indeed, CK2&#x003b1; is the more abundant CK2 subunit in developing embryos ad in contrast to <italic>CK2&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02032;<italic>&#x02212;</italic>/&#x02212; embryos, <italic>CK2&#x003b1;&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> embryos die in mid-gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). A pro-neoplastic role for CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; has been demonstrated in that human osteosarcoma U2-OS cell proliferation is inhibited following the over-expression of a kinase inactive variant of CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032;, but not of CK2&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; is found predominantly in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Our previous studies showed that male mice lacking <italic>CK2&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02032; were infertile and exhibited an abnormal shape in their spermatid nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In addition, a significant number of germ cells in the <italic>CK2&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02032;&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice were eliminated by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Moreover, male germ cells at various steps of differentiation showed unique perturbations of chromatin and nuclear envelope in the <italic>CK2&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02032;&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Therefore, the phenotype of the <italic>CK2&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02032;&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice suggests that CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; has a role in cell survival, in maintaining nuclear integrity of male germ cells, and raises the question of whether dysregulated expression of CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; may be involved in testicular malignancy.</p><p>Compared to other CK2 subunits, significantly less is known about CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032;. To better understand the testis-specific function of CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032;, the yeast two-hybrid technique was used to identify protein(s) that can interact with testicular CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032;. As we will show, a new gene designated <italic>CKT2</italic> (<italic>CK2 Target protein 2</italic>) was identified in the mouse chromosome 16 and specifically expressed in mouse testes. Furthermore, we will show that CKT2 is a target protein of CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032;, is phosphorylated by CK2, and is present in the nuclei of mouse spermatids during chromatin condensation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Detailed descriptions of the following Materials and Methods are given in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp094/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link>: reagents and molecular tools, and Southern blot.</p><sec><title>Construction of plasmids for two-hybrid experiments</title><p>The ORF region of <italic>CK2&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02032;, <italic>CK2&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>CK2&#x003b2;</italic> were cloned into the Gal4 DNA-binding domain vector pGBKT7.

Hence, we further substantiated the functional significance of CKT2-CK2 interaction by examining the phosphorylation of CKT2 by CK2 using three different approaches. First, to determine which subunit(s) of CK2 could phosphorylate CKT2, we incubated purified recombinant CKT2 with recombinant CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x003b2;, CK2&#x003b1;&#x003b2;, CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032;, CK2&#x003b1;, CK2&#x003b2; or CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x003b1;&#x003b2; in an <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation assay.

A noninhibitory peptide without a CK2 phosphorylation site served as a control. A Coomassie stain showed equal loading of GST-CKT2 among experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B, upper panel). Whereas the control peptide did not significantly inhibited such phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B, bottom panel, lane 3), the CK2 inhibitory peptide strongly inhibited CK2 phosphorylation of CKT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B, bottom panel, lanes 4 and 5). To confirm these results, <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation of CKT2 with recombinant CK2 was performed in the presence of heparin, a polyanion known to inhibit CK2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).

Thus, mouse testicular lysates were used as a kinase source for the phosphorylation reactions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D, GST protein alone was not phosphorylated by testicular lysates from the wild-type mice. As also demonstrated, both GST-CKT2 C-terminus and GST-CKT2 full length were robustly phosphorylated by testicular lysates from wild-type mice (lanes 2 and 4, respectively). These results indicate that CKT2 is phosphorylated by native cellular CK2 and that CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; is the essential subunit for CK2 phosphorylation activity. Although there was minimal phosphorylation of the substrates by the testicular lystates from the <italic>CK2&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02032;&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice (lanes 3 and 5, respectively), it suggests that kinases other than CK2&#x003b1; is responsible since the <italic>in vitro</italic> data with recombinant proteins showed that CKT2 was not phosphorylated by either CK2&#x003b1; or CK2&#x003b1;&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A).</p><p>To determine whether endogenous CKT2 can be phosphorylated by CK2, CKT2 was co-immunoprecipitated with CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; from testicular lysates using anti-CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; antibody and protein A-sepharose beads. After washing the beads, an <italic>in vitro</italic> CK2 kinase assay was performed by adding to the immunoprecipitate mixture [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP and CK2 casein (see Materials and Methods section). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A, immunoprecipitated CKT2 was phosphorylated by CK2 (lane 1).

In the presence of a CK2 inhibitor (DRB), there was significant decrease in the cellular phosphorylation of CKT2. Immunoblotting of the same nitrocellulose membrane with anti-CKT2 revealed equal amounts of total CKT2.

Indeed, it has been proposed that the number of proteins phosphorylated by CK2 may be much more numerous than those identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and that CK2 alone may be responsible for the generation of a relatively large proportion (10&#x02013;20%) of the eukaryotic phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>We identified a novel gene <italic>CKT2</italic> whose product CKT2 is a target for CK2. RT-PCR and ISH studies showed that expression of CKT2 is testis-specific. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry revealed that CKT2 is localized to the nuclei of male germ cells. Although CKT2 does not appear to have a nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptide, this sequence is not known to be required for proteins &#x0003c;45 kDa because they are able to passively diffuse through nuclear pore complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>Survey of the CKT2 sequence showed that it contains a coiled-coil domain and six putative CK2 phosphorylation sites, one of which is located in the coiled-coil domain. Phosphorylation of a coiled-coil assembly may serve to regulate the conformation of the parent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). CKT2 was found to be phosporylated by recombinant purified CK2. GST pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays showed that CKT2 binds to the CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit. Furthermore, in testicular lysates immunoprecipitated for CKT2, CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; was co-immunoprecipitated, indicating that CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; binds to CKT2 endogenously. In addition, we showed that endogenous CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; immunoprecipitated from testicular lysates can phosphorylate CKT2. We also found that recombinant CKT2 is phosphorylated by CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; but that the regulatory subunit CK2&#x003b2; was required for the kinase activity of CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032;. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, there are six amino acid residues on CKT2 that are potential sites of phosphorylation by CK2. Although phosphorylation of one or more of these sites is likely necessary for full CKT2 function, future studies involving site-directed mutagenesis of each or more of these residues would be required to determine the consequences of their phosphorylation in regulating spermatid chromatin condensation. Furthermore, it is interesting to speculate that the serine-rich domain from amino acid positions 164&#x02013;182 of CKT2 may be phosphorylated by an unknown kinase, creating an acidic region that may render CKT2 to be more susceptible to phosphorylation by CK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>A study of the spatio-temporal dynamics of CK2 in living cells has revealed that both CK2&#x003b1; and CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; are located mostly in nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Immuno-electron microscopy revealed that CKT2 is present in spermatid nuclei undergoing chromatin condensation, consistent with previous findings in yeasts that CK2-induced gene expression are those that encode chromatin remodeling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; is highly expressed in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) and appears to have an important role in survival and nuclear integrity of male germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Genetic disruption of <italic>CK2&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02032; results in extensive nuclear alterations and apoptosis of differentiating male germ cells. Such morphologic changes in male germ cell differentiation include large nuclear envelope protusions and chromatin degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Our observation that CKT2 is highly expressed at a specific step of spermatid chromatin condensation suggests that CKT2 and CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; are involved in chromatin regulation during its remodelling. In spermatids undergoing condensation, somatic histones are replaced by lysine-rich transition proteins and, in turn, transition proteins are replaced by relatively arginine- and cysteine-rich protamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), processes that indicate complex protein&#x02013;DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p><p>The TSPY testis-specific protein has already been found to play a role in the development of testicular cancer and prostate cancer. Interestingly, TSPY is known to be involved in chromatin remodelling and to be dependent on CK2 phosphorylation for its entrance into nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The unique testicular phenotype of <italic>CK2&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02032;&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice raises the question of whether CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; could contribute to the pathogenesis of male germ cell tumors. Current evidence indicate that elevated expressions of CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; are found in a number of metastatic tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Nuclear localization of CK2&#x003b1; is associated with a poorer prognosis in human prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The anti-apoptotic function of CK2 may contribute to its ability to participate in transformation and tumorigenesis. CK2 activates histone deacetylase in hypoxia-associated tumors; in addition, upon hypoxic treatment, both CK2&#x003b1; and CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; shuttle into the nucleus where histone deacetylases are localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Administration of a peptide that targets the acidic phosphorylation domain for CK2 substrates has an anti-tumor effect in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Furthermore, strategies to inhibit CK2 have been ongoing in preclinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Although CKT2 shares some homology with the oncogene product c-Myc (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp094/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>), the relatively sparse expression of CKT2 in spermatogonia would argue against its role in the nuclear alterations seen in the spermatogonia of <italic>CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032;</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice and in testicular cancers.</p><p>In summary, this study identified CKT2 as the first known target for CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; during spermatogenesis. CKT2 expression was found to parallel chromatin remodelling, suggesting important nuclear functions of CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; and CKT2 in germ cells. <italic>CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032;</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice and future development of a <italic>CKT2</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice will be important models to extend these studies. Future work needs to also address whether CKT2 is a CK2&#x003b1;&#x02032; target in premeiotic male germ cells and various germ cell tumors.
