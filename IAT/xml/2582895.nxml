To examine the underlying mechanisms, the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 was grown in a three-dimensional matrix to generate a cystlike structure, where the apical surface of each epithelial cell faces a fluid-filled central lumen. A discrete apical domain is established as early as the first cell division and between the two daughter cells. During subsequent cell divisions, the apical domain of each daughter cell is maintained at the center of the growing structure through a combination of mitotic spindle orientation and asymmetric abscission. Depletion of Cdc42 does not prevent the establishment of apical&#x02013;basal polarity in individual cells but rather disrupts spindle orientation, leading to inappropriate positioning of apical surfaces within the cyst.

Par6 was originally identified in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as being involved in asymmetric positioning of the mitotic spindle during zygotic cell division, and subsequent work showed that Cdc42 is also required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hung and Kemphues, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gotta et al., 2001</xref>). Other work in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and mammals has revealed a critical role for Cdc42 and Par6 in generating polarity during directed cell migration and morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hutterer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Na and Zernicka-Goetz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Welchman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). The exact contribution of Cdc42 in these contexts is less clear. Work on directed cell migration has shown that Cdc42 acts through Par6 to control the orientation of microtubules, but Cdc42 also controls nuclear positioning and polarized actin polymerization through two other targets, MRCK (myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase) and p65PAK, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cau and Hall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gomes et al., 2005</xref>). Cdc42 is not required for random migration, leading to the suggestion that it is not required for the establishment of polarity as such but rather to orient polarity with respect to an external cue (directional sensing; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Srinivasan et al., 2003</xref>). A similar conclusion has emerged from experiments on Cdc42 during pheromone mating in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Irazoqui et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Epithelial morphogenesis involves the establishment of an apical surface in an individual cell and the formation of cadherin-based adherens junctions and claudin-based tight junctions between adjacent cells. Accompanying reorganization of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons and polarized vesicle trafficking reinforces these interactions, leading to a stable tissue of polarized cells. Expression of dominant-negative or constitutively active versions of Cdc42 in the dog kidney epithelial cell line MDCK grown on a two-dimensional surface leads to defective tight junction formation (typically a delay) as well as mislocalized delivery of basolateral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kroschewski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rojas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wells et al., 2006</xref>). Similar experiments performed with MDCK grown in three dimensions to provide a more physiological growth context have concluded that Cdc42 is required to form an apical surface through regulated trafficking of a vacuolar apical compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vega-Salas et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, we describe the analysis of Caco-2, a human intestinal epithelial cell line, which, when grown in a three-dimensional matrix, generates polarized cysts with a single central lumen. We show that Cdc42 is not required for the formation of an apical surface, but instead is required to position the apical surface with respect to the growing three-dimensional structure. Our results indicate that Cdc42 regulates apical surface positioning by controlling spindle orientation during cell division.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Caco-2 form fully polarized cysts in three-dimensional cultures</title><p>Caco-2 cells have been used extensively as polarized epithelial monolayers grown on two-dimensional surfaces, although few studies have been performed in three dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guruswamy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ivanov et al., 2008</xref>). 12 d after suspending single cells in Matrigel, Caco-2 form cysts with enhanced actin accumulation at internal surfaces facing a central lumen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).

However, stimulation of cAMP signaling with cholera toxin (CTX) induces dramatic and rapid lumen formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref> and Video 2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807121/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807121/DC1</ext-link>). 6 d after plating, CTX treatment results in a well-defined lumen in &#x0003e;90% of all Caco-2 structures in &#x0003c;12 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Time-lapse microscopy reveals that lumen formation occurs through a process of internal expansion without cell proliferation or death (Video 3). cAMP can activate PKA and Epac, an exchange factor for the small GTPase Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Rooij et al., 1998</xref>). PKA is known to activate apical chloride channels such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor (CFTR), resulting in fluid secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Riordan, 2008</xref>), whereas Rap regulates epithelial morphogenesis through unknown mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boettner and Van Aelst, 2007</xref>). To determine which pathway is involved, cAMP analogues that specifically activate PKA (6-Bnz) or Epac (8-Cpt) were used. Activation of PKA but not Epac induces lumen formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Recent work on intestinal development in zebrafish concluded that lumen formation is induced through fluid accumulation driven by polarized ion transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagnat et al., 2007</xref>). To examine whether Caco-2 use a similar mechanism, three-dimensional cultures were treated with CTX either alone or with ouabain, an inhibitor of the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase pump. Ouabain completely inhibits lumen expansion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Similar to what has previously been reported for Caco-2 cells grown in two dimensions, the CFTR chloride channel and the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase are localized apically and laterally, respectively, in three dimensions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). These data indicate that lumen expansion occurs by ion transport&#x02013;driven fluid flow. Polarized secretion (fluid or protein) to drive the separation of two opposing apical surfaces is emerging as an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for lumen formation in a wide range of epithelial tissues such as the <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina and trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Husain et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsarouhas et al., 2007</xref>), the zebrafish gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagnat et al., 2007</xref>), and the zebrafish neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lowery and Sive, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cdc42 depletion inhibits Caco-2 morphogenesis</title><p>To determine the role of Cdc42 in cyst development, Caco-2 cells were transfected with nonspecific or Cdc42-specific siRNAs 1 d before plating in Matrigel (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Treatment with CTX 6 d later results in the swelling of a single central lumen in control structures, whereas 50% of Cdc42 siRNA&#x02013;transfected structures appear abnormal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and Video 4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807121/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807121/DC1</ext-link>).

In multicellular structures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A</xref> [middle] and B), 91% of midbodies are located in the center of the developing cyst, suggesting that after the first cell division, all subsequent abscissions occur asymmetrically and close to the existing apical membrane (i.e., in the center of the growing structure).

In this study, we show that Caco-2 cysts form by polarized fluid filling in a manner similar to gut and neural tube development in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagnat et al., 2007</xref>). We believe that the similarities between Caco-2 cyst formation in vitro and intestinal epithelia in vivo make this a relevant system for studying morphogenesis.</p><p>A striking observation is that Caco-2 cells display a distinct apical membrane patch as early as the two-cell stage. This appears to be linked to cytokinesis because the apical marker aPKC associates with the midbody before abscission occurs. Apical surfaces are maintained at the center of the growing Caco-2 structure during subsequent cell divisions through a combination of (a) orientation of the mitotic spindle to generate radial cleavage and (b) asymmetric positioning of the midbody to generate apical abscission (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807121/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807121/DC1</ext-link>). Oriented cell division coupled to apical abscission provides a mechanism for maintaining the structural integrity of an epithelial barrier in tissues undergoing continuous proliferation such as the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Reinsch and Karsenti, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fleming et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Cdc42 depletion in MDCK cells leads to an accumulation of intracellular vesicles containing apical proteins, resulting in intracellular lumens, as well as cells in the middle of the cyst that are eventually cleared by apoptosis, resulting in intercellular lumens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007</xref>). We find no evidence for cell death after depleting Cdc42 in Caco-2; instead, multiple intercellular lumens are formed, each of which appears to be correctly polarized as judged by aPKC and tight junction localization. Because these ectopic lumens expand through polarized fluid secretion, this provides further evidence for appropriate apical&#x02013;basal polarity. Further analysis reveals that Cdc42 depletion causes spindle misorientation, leading to disruption of cleavage furrow orientation and mislocalization of the midbody during cytokinesis. Because the apical surface is established at the site of abscission, Cdc42 depletion results in noncentrally located apical surfaces to generate ectopic lumens (Fig. S1 B). Cdc42 has been reported to control spindle orientation in the early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo and in mouse oocytes, and this is linked to its association with Par6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gotta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Na and Zernicka-Goetz, 2006</xref>), but other potential Cdc42 targets have also been linked to spindle orientation, including LIM kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Toyoshima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaji et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, it is interesting to note that the loss of asymmetric abscission (Fig. S1 C) could in itself lead to an inappropriately positioned apical surface. The mechanisms controlling apical midbody positioning are not well understood. Recent work on zygotic cell division in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has implicated septins and anillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maddox et al., 2007</xref>), and interestingly, the former has been linked to Cdc42 through the Borg family, and the latter is a target of Rho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Piekny and Glotzer, 2008</xref>). We are currently using live cell imaging to characterize in more detail the specific roles of Cd42 in this morphogenetic process.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Cell culture medium was obtained from Invitrogen or an in-house facility.
