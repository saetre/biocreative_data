We have therefore screened mutagenized zebrafish embryos for the altered expression of a stress biomarker, senescence-associated &#x003b2;-galactosidase (SA-&#x003b2;-gal) in our current study. We validated the use of embryonic SA-&#x003b2;-gal production as a screening tool by analyzing a collection of retrovirus-insertional mutants. From a pool of 306 such mutants, we identified 11 candidates that showed higher embryonic SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity, two of which were selected for further study. One of these mutants is null for a homologue of <italic>Drosophila spinster</italic>, a gene known to regulate lifespan in flies, whereas the other harbors a mutation in a homologue of the human <italic>telomeric repeat binding factor 2</italic> (<italic>terf2</italic>) gene, which plays roles in telomere protection and telomere-length regulation. Although the homozygous <italic>spinster</italic> and <italic>terf2</italic> mutants are embryonic lethal, heterozygous adult fish are viable and show an accelerated appearance of aging symptoms including lipofuscin accumulation, which is another biomarker, and shorter lifespan. We next used the same SA-&#x003b2;-gal assay to screen chemically mutagenized zebrafish, each of which was heterozygous for lesions in multiple genes, under the sensitizing conditions of oxidative stress. We obtained eight additional mutants from this screen that, when bred to homozygosity, showed enhanced SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity even in the absence of stress, and further displayed embryonic neural and muscular degenerative phenotypes. Adult fish that are heterozygous for these mutations also showed the premature expression of aging biomarkers and the accelerated onset of aging phenotypes. Our current strategy of mutant screening for a senescence-associated biomarker in zebrafish embryos may thus prove to be a useful new tool for the genetic dissection of vertebrate stress response and senescence mechanisms.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>By performing genetic mutant screens using senescence-associated biomarkers, we show that the zebrafish is a tractable model system for the study of aging. In vertebrate organisms, it has not previously been possible to carry out systematic screens for genes that are important for stress responses and aging in an unbiased way. However, such vertebrate models are of considerable importance, given the provocative evidence of common biochemical and functional pathways modulating stress responses and lifespan as well as aging in a wide range of organisms. Our present study has successfully employed a colorimetric high-throughput method using a senescence-associated &#x003b2;-galactosidase-based assay to screen for mutations that alter the stress responses in zebrafish embryos, in the hope that these might represent potential aging mutants. Subsequently, the mutations identified by embryonic senescence have indeed displayed adult aging-related phenotypes in zebrafish. Hence, our method for the identification of mutant zebrafish has the immediate potential to accelerate the discovery of novel genes and new functions relevant for our understanding of aging processes in vertebrates. Such knowledge will be essential for the ultimate development of pharmacological, nutritional, and behavioral interventions for the amelioration of oxidative stress- and age-associated diseases and disabilities in humans.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic oxidative stress has been shown to reduce lifespan in many species and lead to accelerated aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Ku1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Finkel1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated during normal cellular metabolism, primarily as a result of inefficiencies in the electron transport chain during mitochondrial respiration. Optimally localized levels of ROS serve functionally in the activation of some signal transduction pathways. However, ROS can also cause damaging chemical modifications of macromolecules such as proteins, lipids and DNA, which can in turn contribute to the progression of neurological diseases and neuromuscular disorders including Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and ataxia telangiectasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Lin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Watters1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The genetic regulation of the stress and damage response pathways in vertebrates may be more complex than that seen in simple model organisms such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, a strong case can be made for repeating the genetic screens performed in these lower organisms, in a vertebrate model, to identify genes regulating oxidative stress. Such analyses have the potential to identify candidate genes related to multiple stress- and age-associated diseases in humans. However, due to the challenges of performing large-scale forward genetic screens in mice, it would be of considerable benefit if the high-throughput screening technology used in simpler organisms (i.e., invertebrates) can be adapted for use in zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), a vertebrate model in which forward genetic screens are routinely performed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Patton1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Amsterdam1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The zebrafish is inexpensive to maintain and has favorable characteristics for experimentation such as a high fecundity, rapid external development, embryonic translucence, and ease of genetic manipulation. In addition, the sequence of the zebrafish genome, while not yet completely annotated, has already revealed a high degree of similarity between fish and human genes.</p><p>Thus far, we and two other groups have mainly contributed to establish important baseline information validating the use of zebrafish as a valuable model for aging studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Gerhard1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Tsai1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. We have extensively searched for various biomarkers of aging in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Kishi2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, to faithfully monitor the wide-ranging <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of several stresses on senescence and aging in zebrafish in a high-throughput manner, we required a reliable and easily applicable biomarker that robustly indicates presence of oxidative stress during embryonic development as well as symptoms of aging in adults. One obvious candidate was senescence-associated &#x003b2;-galactosidase (SA-&#x003b2;-gal), a marker of cellular senescence <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as of organismal aging in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Tsai1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Dimri1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Valenzano1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Mounting evidence suggests that the identity of SA-&#x003b2;-gal is in fact the well characterized lysosomal &#x003b2;-galactosidase enzyme, which is most active at a much lower pH, but has some minimal activity at pH 6.0 where it can be detected when abundant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Lee1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Kurz1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, lysosomal &#x003b2;-galactosidase induction could represent a general adaptive response to cellular senescence. Oxidized protein and lipid by-products that cannot be degraded by lysosomal hydrolases nor be exocytosed accumulate over time in post-mitotic cells, and are not diluted by cell division.

We then present two genetic screens for mutants in stress responses that might also display altered aging phenotypes. We first examined a collection of retrovirus-mediated insertional mutants for the embryonic induction of SA-&#x003b2;-gal. The screening of these mutants for modified SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity could be performed relatively quickly in the absence of an extrinsic insult and stress, since the homozygous embryos can be identified by their morphology. We found from our results that, of the 306 insertional mutations we examined, at least 11 scored as having significantly elevated SA-&#x003b2;-gal production levels in homozygous mutant embryos, two of which we present in further detail herein. The mutation which resulted in the highest SA-&#x003b2;-gal levels caused an inactivation in a gene encoding the zebrafish homologue of the <italic>Drosophila spinster</italic>, which is responsible for regulation of aging and lifespan in flies and has been implicated in a lysosomal storage function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Nakano1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Sweeney1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

We performed a sensitized dominant screen in the zebrafish to detect mutations in the heterozygous state by using a chemical sensitizer (rather than a genetic sensitizer). In our pilot screen using this methodology, we obtained eight mutants in two complementation groups that showed altered SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity in response to oxidative stress. Importantly, adult fish that were heterozygous for several of these mutations also showed premature expression of aging markers/phenotypes, and a shorter lifespan. Our new screening strategy using a senescence-associated biomarker during the embryonic stages in zebrafish provides a new tool for the genetic dissection of vertebrate stress responses and aging mechanisms. Moreover, our initial results strongly suggest that genetic lesions in certain early developmental mechanisms lead to late adult-onset phenotypes with age.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>SA-&#x003b2;-gal Is a Robust Biomarker of Aging in the Adult Zebrafish</title><p>To further characterize aging in the adult zebrafish, we have previously examined several potential biological and biochemical markers, including regenerative competence and assays for the oxidative damage of proteins, lipids and DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Tsai1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Kishi2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Kishi3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

For such an approach to succeed, we surmised that the chosen biomarker must respond both to aging in adults and to stress responses during embryonic development. Hence, we tested whether the SA-&#x003b2;-gal assay would also respond to oxidative stress in embryos treated with ROS such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) or <italic>tert</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide (BHP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g002">Figure 2A&#x02013;D</xref>). Several different doses of these peroxides were used over a developmentally long period to better simulate long-term chronic oxidative stress. An experimental endpoint at 6 days post fertilization (dpf) was chosen to avoid potential spurious effects of caloric restriction or other nutritional deficiencies, as this is the point in larval development at which the supportive yolk has been consumed and the fish begin to eat and rely on oral intake nutrition. The LD<sub>50</sub> values for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and BHP were measured at approximately 300 &#x000b5;M and 1 mM, respectively, under these assay conditions. At sub-lethal doses of peroxides, SA-&#x003b2;-gal levels increased in a roughly linear fashion with increasing concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and BHP to the maximum tolerated doses of 150 &#x000b5;M and 500 &#x000b5;M, respectively.

A number of studies in a variety of species have shown that both catalase and glutathione-peroxidase are responsible for antioxidant protection by limiting the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Sohal1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Finkel1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Gerhard2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Ken1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. To ascertain the potential importance of catalase in protecting zebrafish embryos from oxidative stress-induced senescence, we altered the expression levels of this enzyme in stressed embryos and measured the effects of this upon SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity. Embryos overexpressing zebrafish catalase were generated by the injection of 300 pg of mRNA encoding this enzyme at the one-cell stage (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;50). This resulted in a reduction in both hydrogen peroxide- and BHP-induced SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity, compared with control GFP mRNA injections (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;50) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g002">Figure 2E</xref> and data not shown). BHP was used as the oxidative agent throughout the later stages of this study as it is more stable than hydrogen peroxide and produces less variable stress responses. The most dramatic rescue effects were observed when intermediate concentrations of BHP were used in these catalase experiments.</p><p>We additionally tested if a reduction in the catalase expression levels would enhance the induction of SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity by oxidative stress. To this end, we injected embryos with an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) targeting zebrafish catalase and, indeed, observed a marked enhancement in their susceptibility to elevated SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity following exposure to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). The greatest effects were again observed when intermediate concentrations of BHP were used.

TRF2 has an essential role in telomere end protection and t-loop formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-deLange1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Griffith1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-deLange2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the disruption of endogenous TRF2 function in human cells by expressing dominant-negative forms of this protein markedly increases the rate of telomere end-to-end fusions and cellular senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-vanSteensel1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

We crossed individual F<sub>1</sub> mutant males with wild-type females to produce clutches of F<sub>2</sub> embryos, each of which was heterozygous at many loci. By using BHP as a chemical sensitizer, we hoped to identify heterozygous mutants with an altered response to oxidative stress; that is we expected the chemical sensitizer to induce haploinsufficiency in many of the potential target genes. We have denoted this methodology &#x02018;CASH&#x02019; (<underline>C</underline>hemically <underline>A</underline>ssisted <underline>S</underline>creening in <underline>H</underline>eterozygotes).</p><p>We treated 50 embryos from the resulting clutches with 350 &#x000b5;M BHP from 6 hours post fertilization (hpf) to 6 dpf. In each clutch of embryos, half of the clutch would be heterozygous for any mutant allele, and half would be wild type for that allele. Thus, an F<sub>1</sub> male carrying a mutation that alters sensitivity to oxidative stress would produce clutches wherein half the embryos show altered induction of SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We divided SA-&#x003b2;-gal staining intensity in the F<sub>2</sub> embryos into discrete quantitative ranges and measured how many embryos fell into each staining intensity range. When we performed this analysis on wild-type embryos, the result was a tight Gaussian distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). When we looked at our candidate mutant clutches, in most cases their staining distributions appeared similar to wild type. However, occasionally, nearly half of the embryos were darker than the others and the distributions appeared abnormal (see a dotted red line throughout <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g005">Figure 5B, 5D, and 5F</xref>). The F<sub>1</sub> fathers of these clutches were potential carriers of mutations that either enhanced SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity. These are what we will refer to as &#x02018;Class 1&#x02019; mutant candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;35 for this tested candidate; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01, Student t-test).

However, when we repeated these outcrosses without exogenous oxidative stress, the resultant clutches appeared morphologically normal. These clutches comprise what we will refer to as &#x02018;Class 2&#x02019; mutant candidates. We performed an initial screen in 150 F<sub>1</sub> mutagenized genomes, and obtained 8 candidate mutants that bred in a consistent recessive Mendelian fashion through to the F<sub>4</sub> generation.

In our current study we found that there is still no detectable lipofuscin accumulation in wild-type sibling fish (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;15) by 2.8 years (33 months) of age, but that heterozygous <italic>nrs</italic><sup>m/&#x0002b;</sup> mutant fish (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10) had accumulated a great deal of lipofuscin in the skeletal muscle by this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g008">Figure 8H</xref>). On the other hand, in terms of the liver histology of the wild-type zebrafish, lipofuscin accrual changed dramatically with age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000152.s007">Figure S7A</xref>), similar to that reported in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Schmucker1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although heterozygous <italic>nrs</italic><sup>m/&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>psm7</italic><sup>m/&#x0002b;</sup> mutant fish did not display significantly increased SA-&#x003b2;-gal levels at 25 months (2.1 years) and 18 months (1.5 years) of age, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g008">Figure 8A</xref>), both of these mutants did show increased lipofuscin accumulation at these ages (<italic>nrs</italic>, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9 and <italic>psm7</italic>, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g008">Figure 8E, G</xref>). This indicated that different aging phenotypes may occur independently or that liver lipofuscin buildup may be an earlier or more sensitive indicator of aging in these mutants. Taken together, these results suggest that our newly identified mutants show a robust early-onset expression of aging biomarkers that normally only manifest in much older wild-type animals.</p><p>A striking phenotype associated with the <italic>terf2</italic><sup>m/m</sup> homozygous mutant embryos was observed in the central nervous system, including the eye (retina) and brain, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g004">Figure 4C&#x02013;E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g007">Figure 7W&#x02013;Y</xref>. Given the degenerative phenotype seen in embryonic <italic>terf2</italic><sup>m/m</sup> retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g004">Figure 4C&#x02013;E</xref>, right panels), we examined histological sections of heterozygous adult mutants. Histological sections of mutant (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;23) and wild-type sibling (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;15) retinas were analyzed at various ages to determine the cellular basis for the observed age-dependent retinal defects. We observed structural abnormalities, principally retinal cell degeneration, in most aged mutant retinas with drusen-like autofluorescent accumulations around the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). This degeneration was not uniform over the retinas but tended to be patchy. Areas of rods (rod outer segments) degeneration were interspersed between areas where significant numbers of rods remained. Cones (cone outer segments) generally were better preserved than the rods, but areas of cone degeneration were also noted. The observed degeneration was progressive with age. In animals older than 12 months, degeneration was usually seen only in the central-most regions of the retina. By 21 months of age, however, degeneration was observed across much of the retina, although the far peripheral regions tended to be spared. Importantly, in the wild-type zebrafish retinas, these degenerative changes appeared dramatically with advancing age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000152.s007">Figure S7B</xref>).</p><p>Representative histological sections from a 23-month old wild-type sibling fish and an age-matched heterozygous <italic>terf2</italic><sup>m/&#x0002b;</sup> mutant fish were compared and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g008">Figure 8I</xref>. In zebrafish, the photoreceptors are typically tiered so that in the light-adapted retina, the rods are positioned more distally than the cones. In the 23-month old <italic>terf2</italic><sup>m/&#x0002b;</sup> retina, the peripheral regions were found to be similar to control retinas, but obvious abnormalities were observed throughout the central retina. In some areas only the rods were affected, i.e., the rod outer segments were disorganized and reduced in length, and autofluorescent accruals in the RPE were increased in number and size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g008">Figure 8I</xref>, right panel in <italic>terf2</italic><sup>m/&#x0002b;</sup>). In other areas, the rods were severely degraded but the cones appeared relatively normal. In yet other areas, both the cones and rods were affected, i.e., both were sometimes disorganized and reduced in length (data not shown). Moreover, the inner plexiform layers of the retina usually looked thinner in affected animals, and occasionally some patchy thinning of the inner nuclear layer and empty spaces were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g008">Figure 8I</xref>, left panel in <italic>terf2</italic><sup>m/&#x0002b;</sup>), suggesting some loss of inner retinal neurons. To investigate whether there might be loss of elements other than photoreceptors in the mutant zebrafish retinas, we measured the thickness of various retinal layers centrally in control (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6) and mutant (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8) animals at 23 months of age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000152.s009">Table S2</xref>), and also in control (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6) and mutant (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6) animals at 30 months of age (data not shown). The retinas of mutant animals were clearly thinner than those of the wild-type fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g008">Figure 8I</xref>). Much of this change in thickness was accounted for by a decrease in the thickness of the photoreceptor layer and inner plexiform layer.</p><p>Finally, we obtained Kaplan-Meier survival curves for some of our mutant fish. The oldest fish that were heterozygous for <italic>psm</italic> mutations in our stocks at the time of writing had not reached their maximum lifespan (wild-type zebrafish have a maximum lifespan of roughly 5 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Gerhard3">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>), so we have not yet been able to determine the effects of these mutations upon overall lifespan. We have, however, maintained populations of heterozygous <italic>nrs</italic> and <italic>terf2</italic> mutant fish and their wild-type siblings until death, and conducted observational studies on their lifespan. We scored the cohorts of <italic>nrs</italic><sup>m/&#x0002b;</sup> fish (no genders identified; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;148) in comparison with their wild-type siblings (no genders identified; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;256), and found significant decreases in the lifespan of the heterozygous mutants (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001, log rank test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). Moreover, the male <italic>terf2</italic><sup>m/&#x0002b;</sup> fish cohorts (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;96) also manifested a shorter lifespan compared with that of their wild-type male siblings (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;79) (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001, log rank test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000152-g009">Figure 9B</xref>).

We have presented the results of two different screens for potential aging mutants in this report, both utilizing SA-&#x003b2;-gal production in the zebrafish embryo as a key part of the screening process. We first screened a collection of retrovirus-mediated insertional mutants for elevated SA-&#x003b2;-gal production in unstressed homozygous embryos. Notably, this collection of insertional mutants was isolated based on the requirement for homozygous developmental phenotypes. Each of the two mutants out of the 11 candidates from this first screen included a lesion in the <italic>nrs</italic> gene, the zebrafish homologue of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> spinster gene a known regulator of aging in flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Nakano1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, or the <italic>terf2</italic> gene, which plays roles in telomere protection and telomere-length regulation as a component of the telosome/shelterin complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-deLange1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In the second screen, using an oxidant agent as a sensitizer, we have isolated a series of mutants, denoted <italic>psm</italic> mutants, which showed elevated SA-&#x003b2;-gal expression in the stressed heterozygous state and additionally in an unstressed homozygous state of embryos. Sensitized screens are much less labor and time intensive than traditional screens for recessive phenotypes in homozygous mutant embryos. Importantly, heterozygous mutant fish from both screens showed elevated expression of aging biomarkers in relatively younger ages. Thus, mutants from both screens showed degenerative phenotypes in homozygous embryos during early development and in heterozygous adults with age. Notably, the heterozygous animals in some cases also appeared to die at earlier ages than controls.</p><p>It is possible that the two screens revealed some different classes of mutants. For instance neither of the two insertional mutants which we studied in detail showed statistically significant alterations in their sensitivity to oxidative stress as heterozygotes (data not shown). The heterogeneity of the observed phenotypes in mutants from the 2 screens persisted in the adult heterozygotes. Both <italic>nrs</italic> and <italic>psm</italic> mutations showed hastened lipofuscin accrual in the livers of young adult heterozygotes, whereas two <italic>psm</italic> mutants (<italic>psm6</italic> and <italic>psm9</italic>) showed enhanced SA-&#x003b2;-gal production in relatively young adults (1.5 y) compared with their wild-type siblings, a trait shown only in older <italic>nrs</italic><sup>m/&#x0002b;</sup> fish (3.3 y). However, since we examined mutants for only two genes in each screen in any detail, it is premature to derive substantial conclusions at this stage.</p><p>The accelerated production of lipofuscin in the liver is a phenotype that was found to be common to the adult zebrafish from both screens. Lipofuscin accumulation is a hallmark of aging in many organisms from worms to mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Terman1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Jung1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Tissues that are traditionally thought to be sensitive to lipofuscin accrual in mammals include the brain, and both skeletal and cardiac muscle. However, previous studies from our laboratory have shown that there is no clear accumulation of lipofuscin inclusions with age in wild-type zebrafish skeletal muscle cells and cardiac myocytes, at least up to 2.5 years of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Kishi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Kishi3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> (unpublished observations). In contrast, age-related changes in liver structure and lipofuscin accumulation have been demonstrated in male mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Schmucker1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. We have also observed premature lipofuscin accrual in the adult liver of our heterozygous male <italic>psm</italic> mutants as well as in male <italic>nrs</italic><sup>m/&#x0002b;</sup> heterozygotes. It is widely believed that oxidative damage processes underlie sources of lipofuscin production, and that its accumulation may have multiple negative effects, including a further increase in sensitivity to many stress-induced damage responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Terman1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Since we observed no obvious response to exogenous (extrinsic) oxidative stress by BHP in <italic>nrs</italic> mutant embryos, we suspect that differences in intrinsic energy metabolism may underlie lipofuscin appearance in the <italic>nrs</italic> mutants, although this clearly requires further investigations. In the case of flies, it has also been shown that mutations in the <italic>spinster</italic> gene cause enhanced lipofuscin production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Nakano1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, though the precise underlying mechanism also remains unknown. Therefore, parallel studies of this gene product in other organismal aging model systems would be very desirable to provide a more conclusive insight into its mechanistic roles.</p><p>There is cumulative evidence to date to suggest that early onset neuronal degeneration phenotypes in homozygous zebrafish mutants are predictive of a late-onset visual impairment in the corresponding heterozygous animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Li1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Maaswinkel2">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Intriguingly, in heterozygous <italic>terf2</italic><sup>m/&#x0002b;</sup> mutant adult fish, drusen-like autofluorescent accumulation (presumably caused by lipofuscin accrual) is more obvious in the RPE compared with age-matched siblings. In contrast to other tissues, ocular lipofuscin has been identified as <italic>N</italic>-retinylidene-<italic>N</italic>-retinylethanolamine (A2E). A2E is a quaternary amine and retinoid by-product of the visual cycle and causes the accumulation of free and esterified cholesterol in RPE cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Lakkaraju1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Sparrow1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Although endogenously produced A2E in the RPE has been associated with macular degeneration, the precise mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, the involvement of the telomeric factor TRF2 in the mechanism of the RPE lipofuscin accrual might provide intriguing new insights into potential novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Alternatively, telomere-associated proteins might be involved in neural differentiation, as homozygous <italic>terf2</italic><sup>m/m</sup> mutant embryos show an aggressive neurodegenerative phenotype in both the eye (retina) and brain. In this regard, divergent molecular and physiological responses to telomere dysfunction in mitotic neural stem/precursor cells and postmitotic neurons appear to regulate the differentiation and survival of neurons as well as RPE cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Zhang1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Cheng1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Notably, both <italic>terf2</italic> (males) and <italic>nrs</italic> (gender not identified) heterozygous mutant had shorter lifespans in comparison with their control wild-type siblings, suggesting that partial loss-of-function/decrease-of-function in these genes may have systemic effects on physiological aging rather than the organ-specific tissue aging on which we focused in the current study. In addition, there may be gender-dependent differences in longevities and mortality rates in zebrafish when we look at the survival curves of wild-type siblings of <italic>terf2</italic> and <italic>nrs</italic> mutants. Male <italic>terf2</italic> heterozygous mutant fish and their wild-type male siblings were kept isolated from females except for the occasional matings performed in our current study. Heterozygous <italic>terf2</italic> mutant females and their wild-type female siblings had not reached the end point of their lifespan at the time when the male fish all died out. On the other hand, heterozygous <italic>nrs</italic> mutant males and females basically co-habited throughout their life, as did their wild-type siblings. When they died, sex determination was therefore not possible due to rapid decomposition (autolysis) in water. Although further studies are definitely needed, social and environmental factors between genders might affect zebrafish lifespan in addition to their genetic background.</p><p>Any understanding of the mechanisms by which the <italic>psm</italic> genes regulates the functions of age accompanied with degenerative phenotypes will require positional cloning of the mutated genes. The <italic>psm</italic> mutants may also be useful for studying signal transduction pathways and related biological processes in addition to both stress responses and aging. The fact that these mutations regulate embryonic tissue-specific responses to oxidative stress is also interesting per se. It will be of considerable interest to see if these mutations lie in genes already associated with oxidant responses, such as antioxidant genes or genes that maintain mitochondrial functions. It is also possible that the <italic>psm</italic> mutants which showed neuronal phenotypes may have value as new models for specific disorders such as Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and ataxia telangiectasia, because several lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is associated with the development of these neurodegenerative diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Rotman1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Emerit1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since we have already shown an embryonic haplosensitivity of the <italic>psm</italic> mutants to oxidative stress by the very nature of the CASH strategy, we are currently further investigating the possibility that more of these mutants may show accelerated onset of aging in the adult heterozygotes, expanding their utility as models of stress-associated pathophysiological aging and degenerative disease.</p><p>In the future, we hope to further utilize our technology to identify a real &#x0201c;suppressor&#x0201d; type mutant which would display enhanced embryonic stress resistance and, perhaps, a longer healthy lifespan (&#x02018;health span&#x02019;). Alternatively, it might also be possible to isolate a &#x02018;revertant&#x02019; from the background of an accelerated aging mutant, which would restore the original normal phenotype by means of a suppressor mutation.</p><p>In summary, our current study has demonstrated for the first time in vertebrates that it is possible to obtain mutations that alter adult aging markers/phenotypes and lifespans by screening mutagenized and sensitized embryos for the extemporal expression of the aging biomarker. It is our hope that this novel tactic of screening for aging biomarkers in zebrafish embryos may open a new avenue for the future genetic dissection of vertebrate aging mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Zebrafish Husbandry, Maintenance, and Longevity</title><p>Zebrafish of the wild-type strain and mutants were maintained with a 14:10 h light/dark cycle and fed living brine shrimp twice per day. Brine shrimp was given using 1 mL pipettes at an amount of about 0.75 mL per 20 fish. Flake food was also given a few days per week semiquantitatively according to the number of fish in the tanks. A continuously cycling Aquatic Habitats&#x02122; system was used to maintain water quality (Apopka, FL, USA) which completely replaces the water in each tank every 6&#x02013;10 min. Each tank is a baffle/tank system that ebbs water in a circular motion to ensure flushing and water turnover. Ultraviolet (UV) sterilizers (110,000 microwatt-s cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) were employed to disinfect the water and prevent the spread of disease in the recirculating system.

Water quality was tested daily for chlorine, ammonia, pH, nitrate, and conductivity under real-time computer monitoring with alarms to signal potential fluctuations. The general health of each fish was observed on a daily basis throughout fish life to monitor longevity, and abnormal looking or acting fish were quarantined into isolated tanks unconnected from the general circulation. The water in these quarantined tanks was treated with methylene blue (0.0001&#x02013;0.001&#x00025;). If and when fish recovered, they were returned to their original tanks on the general circulation. All animals showing signs of infectious or parasitic disease that are not alleviated by a 7-day incubation with methylene blue in water were euthanized in a beaker containing tricaine (approximately final 0.5&#x00025; in water). Animals exhibiting overt tumors or extreme morbidity were also euthanized.</p><p>Embryos were collected by natural spawning, raised in 10&#x00025; Hank's saline with or without 0.003&#x00025; 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (PTU) (embryo media) and staged according to Kimmel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000152-Kimmel1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>.

Additional statistical analyses were performed at the Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. These analyses included survival estimates using the method of Kaplan and Meier, and comparison of survival between mutant fish and their wild type controls using the log rank test.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>SA-&#x003b2;-gal Assay and Quantitation</title><p>Zebrafish adults and embryos were fixed in 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 4&#x000b0;C (for 3 days in adults and overnight in embryos), and then washed 3 times for 1 h in PBS-pH 7.4 and for a further 1 h in PBS-pH 6.0 at 4&#x000b0;C. Staining was performed overnight at 37&#x000b0;C in 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mg/ml X-gal in PBS adjusted to pH 6.0. All animals were photographed under the same conditions using reflected light under a dissecting microscope. SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity in each animal was quantitated using a selection tool in Adobe Photoshop for a color range that was chosen by 25 additive blue color selections of regions that showed visually positive SA-&#x003b2;-gal staining. For analyses of embryos, these regions were selected in each embryo proper only and not in the yolk in order to eliminate variability due to differences in initial yolk volume and yolk consumption over time. Since the yolk stains much more intense blue for SA-&#x003b2;-gal at all stages of development than any other embryonic tissues, even under conditions of high oxidative stress, it was desirable to eliminate this as a source of variability. Following pixel selection, a fuzziness setting of 14 was used, and the chosen pixel number was calculated using the image histogram calculation. For adult zebrafish analyses, the trunk area for colorimetric quantitation was chosen by selection of the area between the operculum and the dorsal and anal fins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000152.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Molecular Analysis and Gene Knockdown</title><p>The cloning of zebrafish catalase cDNA was performed using the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR kit with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, by using the forward primer <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-TTTGCCTCGTGTTTTGTCAC-3&#x02032;</named-content> and reverse primer; <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GGAGTCAGTGTTGCATTTGCT-3&#x02032;</named-content>.

SA-&#x003b2;-gal staining was performed as above, and positive candidates were determined by correlating high SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity with the presence of a homozygous mutant phenotype. Since some of mutants needed to be distinguished by their pigmentation patterns, the entire screening of 306 mutants was performed in these embryos without PTU treatment.
