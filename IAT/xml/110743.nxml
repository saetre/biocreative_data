Most of this chromatin is localized near centromeres and it differs markedly in many respects from the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c1">1</xref>). The constitutive heterochromatin is almost devoid of genes, replicates late in S phase, remains tightly condensed throughout the cell cycle and can vary in amount between different tissues of the same individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c2">2</xref>). The most distinctive feature of heterochromatin is its tightly compacted structure. Although several proteins have been described that associate with heterochromatin and might play a role in its condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c7">7</xref>) their mode of action remains largely unknown.</p><p>The proliferation disrupter protein (Prod) of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has been shown to be required for the condensation of mitotic chromosomes and, in particular, for the condensation of heterochromatic regions located close to the centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c8">8</xref>). Prod is a non-histone chromosomal protein associated with over 400 euchromatic loci which also accumulates dramatically in the constitutive heterochromatin of the second and third chromosomes suggesting preferred association with the AATAACATAG satellite repeat, that is specific to these chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c8">8</xref>). Immunostaining of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> chromosomes have indeed shown that the Prod signal in heterochromatin colocalizes with fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization signals of the AATAACATAG repeat satellite DNA probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c9">9</xref>); however, it remains unknown whether Prod binds DNA directly or binds other chromosomal proteins specific for this region. The heterochromatic accumulation of the Prod protein has been shown to be cell cycle dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c9">9</xref>); it is present on the heterochromatin during mitosis, and in interphase periods near mitosis, however, during the lengthy interphase cycles of larval brain cells the protein gradually disappears from its heterochromatic sites and is probably shifted to euchromatin.</p><p>Loss of function mutations in the <italic>prod</italic> gene lead to abnormal centromere condensation, anaphase defects and cell death, all of which have been interpreted as resulting from the absence of Prod from its target sites in heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c8">8</xref>). It appears likely that the association of the Prod protein with chromosomes directly influences chromatin condensation and segregation. If so, it is important to understand the nature of its association with discrete chromosomal sites, and of equal interest is the mechanism whereby Prod may effect chromatin condensation. Here we provide evidence, from three independent assays <italic>in vitro</italic>, that Prod is a novel sequence-specific DNA-binding protein whose target sequence is contained in the 1.686 g&#x0002f;cm<sup>3</sup> satellite DNA repeat with the sequence AATAACATAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c10">10</xref>). This satellite, which we call Prodsat, represents ~2&#x00025; of the genome of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, that is localized in a single, Hoechst bright, nearly 2 Mb block in the heterochromatin of chromosome 2 at h37 and a similarly sized block in the heterochromatin of chromosome 3 at h48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c11">11</xref>). We propose that Prod alone might be capable of directly folding Prodsat arrays into a superhelix, a property which might allow it to maintain the compact state of the heterochromatin. The <italic>prod</italic> mutant phenotype suggests that this compaction is required for the proper segregation of mitotic chromosomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subcloning of fusion protein constructs</title><p>Each fusion construct is named after the predicted molecular weight of the protein fragment without the GST domain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f1">1</xref>A).

The following morning, the overnight culture was diluted 1:10 in fresh NZCYM&#x0002f;Amp medium and grown for 3 h at 30&#x000b0;C before addition of IPTG (0.1 mM final) and continued incubation for 2 h at 30&#x000b0;C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (3 min at 3000 r.p.m., Sorvall RC5C plus, GSA rotor), washed in 1&#x000d7; PBS and pelleted again. Cells were resuspended in 1&#x0002f;20 culture volume of 1&#x000d7; PBS and affinity purification was performed using the Bulk GST Purification Modules of Pharmacia Biotech according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Purified fusion proteins were desalted and concentrated using Centricon 10 cartridges (Amicon Inc.). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, bacterial cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1&#x0002f;30 culture vol of RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0&#x00025; NP-40, 0.5&#x00025; DOC, 0.1&#x00025; SDS, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0) containing 200 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml PMSF and 1 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml aprotinin, then sonicated on ice in four 30 s bursts. The cell lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min, then centrifuged at 15 000 r.p.m. (Eppendorf table top centrifuge) for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C. An equal volume of glycerol was added to the supernatant and the protein extract was stored at &#x02013;20&#x000b0;C. Extracts were tested for the presence of fusion proteins by western blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f1">1</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Co-immunoprecipitation</title><p>DNA binding and immunoprecipitation of Prod&#x02013;DNA complexes was essentially done as described by Desplan <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c12">12</xref>). A collection of randomized DNA fragments was created by digesting &#x003bb; phage DNA with <italic>Taq</italic>I or <italic>Sau</italic>3AI and mixing the restriction fragments (300 ng) before end-labelling with T4 polynucleotide kinase. For binding assays, labeled fragments (50 ng) were incubated with 200 &#x000b5;g bacterial total protein extract in 100 &#x000b5;l binding buffer (BB) for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C with constant rocking. For the general DNA-binding experiments shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f2">2</xref>, BB contained 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.6, 0.25 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10&#x00025; glycerol and 10 mM PMSF. For the sequence-specific binding experiments shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f3">3</xref>B, the NaCl concentration was raised to 170 mM and cold salmon sperm DNA was added to 100 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml. The binding reaction was precleared as follows: 6 &#x000b5;l pre-immune rabbit serum was added to the extract and incubated for 30 min before precipitation with 20 &#x000b5;l 50&#x00025; protein-A Sepharose for 1&#x000a0;h and centrifugation. Goat-anti-GST antibody (1 &#x000b5;l) (Pharmacia) was then added to the supernatant and incubation was continued for an additional 30 min before addition of 1.5 &#x000b5;l rabbit-anti-goat antibody. After a 30 min incubation, the antibody complex was precipitated with 20 &#x000b5;l 50&#x00025; protein-A Sepharose suspension and centrifuged after an additional 1 h incubation period. The pellet was washed twice in BB, phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated using yeast tRNA as carrier. Final pellets were dissolved in water and applied on 5&#x00025; polyacrylamide or agarose gels. Gels were dried and autoradiographed.</p></sec><sec><title>Gel retardation</title><p>Gel retardation or gel-shift assays were performed essentially as described by Mikami <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c13">13</xref>). The labeled probe contained 4.5 repeats of the 10 bp (AATAACATAG) Prodsat DNA subcloned into pBluescript KS&#x0002b; and was prepared by PCR amplification of a 232 bp fragment from the construct, using T7 and T3 universal primers, one of them had been previously end-labeled. The probe was purified on a polyacrylamide gel as described by Sambrook <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c14">14</xref>). The binding reaction contained the DNA probe (5000 c.p.m.), 1&#x02013;4 &#x000b5;g sonicated salmon sperm DNA as carrier, 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH&#x000a0;8.8, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, 7&#x00025; glycerol and purified fusion protein in a final volume of 20 &#x000b5;l. The binding reaction was incubated for 45 min at 37&#x000b0;C then loaded on a gel running at maximum current. One millimeter thick 4&#x00025; polyacrylamide gels (40:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) were used with 0.5&#x000d7; TBE as running buffer. Gels were pre-run at 100 V overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, followed by electrophoresis of the samples for 3 h at 200 V, 4&#x000b0;C. Gels were dried and exposed using a Phosphorimager 445SI (Molecular Dynamics). Radioactive signals were quantitated using the ImageQuant program of the Phosphorimager.</p></sec><sec><title>DNase I footprinting</title><p>DNase I footprinting assays were performed essentially as described by Martino-Catt and Kay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c15">15</xref>), using the same end-labeled probe as in the gel retardation experiments. The binding reaction was also the same as in the gel-shift experiments, except that more probe (25 000 c.p.m.) was used, no carrier was added and the reaction volume was 30 &#x000b5;l. DNase I digestions were performed at room temperature for 2 min by adding 2 &#x000b5;l of 0.1&#x000a0;mg&#x0002f;ml DNase I (Sigma) dissolved in 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Digestions were stopped by adding 5 &#x000b5;l 0.5 M EDTA then 85&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l stop buffer containing 5 M urea, 0.36 M NaCl, 0.5&#x00025; SDS, 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 0.2 mg&#x0002f;ml yeast tRNA and 1 M ammonium acetate. Samples were extracted with phenol&#x02013;chloroform, precipitated with 300 &#x000b5;l ethanol and centrifuged. DNA pellets were dissolved in 4 &#x000b5;l formamide loading buffer, boiled for 3 min and loaded on 6&#x00025; sequencing gels. Sequencing reactions were performed with the Sequenase 2.0 Sequencing kit (USB) using the same end-labeled T3 or T7 primers as in the footprinting reaction.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Prod is a DNA-binding protein</title><p>The Prod protein does not share any homology with known proteins in the existing databases, rendering predictions of a conserved biological function difficult to make. Although coil prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c16">16</xref>) suggests the presence of a coiled-coil domain in the middle of Prod (amino acids 145&#x02013;180; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f1">1</xref>), a motif known to be involved in protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c17">17</xref>), we first wanted to test whether Prod is able to bind DNA directly. Therefore we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments based on the approach of Desplan <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c12">12</xref>) who identified the functional homeobox within the <italic>engrailed</italic> gene. We constructed GST&#x02013;Prod fusion proteins containing the full-length protein or different Prod sub-fragments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f1">1</xref>A) and expressed them in <italic>Escherichia coli.</italic> Radiolabeled random DNA fragments were mixed with bacterial protein extracts containing the fusion proteins and the fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated from this solution using purified anti-GST antibody. If Prod binds DNA, labeled DNA fragments should co-precipitate with the fusion protein at low salt concentration (50 mM NaCl). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f2">2</xref>, both the full-length <italic>P</italic> construct and construct <italic>25</italic>, containing the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein, co-precipitated DNA fragments with similar affinities. In contrast, constructs <italic>13</italic>, containing the N-terminal one-third of Prod and construct <italic>15</italic>, containing the C-terminal one-third of the protein, as well as the GST protein alone, did not co-precipitate labeled DNA. These results indicate that the first 215 amino acids of Prod contain a DNA-binding domain probably around the middle third of the full-length protein.</p></sec><sec><title>The 10 bp Prodsat provides a sequence-specific Prod binding site</title><p>As the Prod protein shows a striking accumulation in the heterochromatin of the second and third chromosomes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c8">8</xref>), it seemed reasonable to assume that the DNA-binding is sequence specific and the target sequence is the AATAACATAG repeat specific for these chromosomes. Sequence-specific DNA binding is resistant to relatively high salt concentrations and to competition by non-specific carrier DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c12">12</xref>). As most of the major satellite sequences of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> have been cloned and mapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c11">11</xref>), we were able to test all known satellite sequences that are present on the second and third chromosomes in a stringent Prod-binding assay to prove the above assumption and to exclude the binding to other repeats.</p><p>Plasmids containing seven different satellite repeats were linearized, end-labeled and co-immunoprecipitated with the GST&#x02013;Prod fusion protein. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f3">3</xref>, when very high salt and carrier DNA concentrations were combined (170&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 100 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml competitor DNA), only one of the satellites, the 10 bp AATAACATAG repeat, co-precipitated with the fusion protein, suggesting that this is the only satellite sequence that provides a high affinity binding site for the Prod protein. For this reason, we call this satellite Prodsat.</p><p>To test which nucleotides of the Prodsat repeat are in direct contact with the Prod protein, we performed DNase I footprinting experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c15">15</xref>). A 232 bp pBluescript fragment containing 4.5 Prodsat repeats was incubated with the full-length fusion protein or the GST construct <italic>25</italic>. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f4">4</xref>, both proteins provided a similar protection against DNase I digestion. The footprints obtained clearly follow the periodicity of the DNA sequence, which is definitely recognized by Prod as repeated units of AGAATAACAT. This periodicity suggests that each Prodsat repeat unit is recognized and bound by one Prod protein unit (Prod monomer, dimer or other). Under these conditions, no sequences were found to be protected outside of the Prodsat repeats present in the DNA fragment tested and not all of the Prodsat bases proved to be equally protected. Every first A of the 10 bp sequence was either not or only very weakly protected and the C was not protected. In contrast, the ATAA unit was well protected, as was the A following the C. We could not clearly assess the protection of the three remaining bases (GA and the last T) because they are also poorly cleaved by DNase I in the control lane. Based on these results, we can assign the region specifically contacted by Prod from a minimum of 5 bp (ATAANA) to a maximum of 8 bp (GAATAANAT) in the Prodsat repeat.</p></sec><sec><title>A large part of the protein is required for DNA binding</title><p>Next we tried to identify the DNA-binding domain, the smallest part of the protein capable of binding DNA with an affinity and a specificity comparable to that of the full-length protein. Based on the results of the co-immunoprecipitation experiments shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f2">2</xref>, the DNA-binding domain is contained within the first 215 amino acids of the protein, probably around the middle of Prod, since neither the N-terminal nor the C-terminal third of the protein shows DNA binding activity in itself.</p><p>In order to further localize the DNA-binding domain, we made a series of fusion constructs encoding decreasing lengths of Prod sequence around the central part of the protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f1">1</xref>) and tested their ability to bind DNA in a gel-shift assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c13">13</xref>). In the gel-shift experiments we used the same 232 bp fragment containing 4.5 repeats of Prodsat as in the footprinting experiments shown above. We have separately tested a wide variety of binding conditions (salt, carrier and protein concentrations) for each construct in order to recognize if any remnant of DNA-binding ability could have been retained. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f5">5</xref> shows that, out of the GST-fusion constructs tested, only four were capable of shifting the Prodsat-containing DNA fragment (data for <italic>14</italic> and <italic>7</italic>, that also did not bind DNA, are not shown). While the smallest of these, GST&#x02013;19, clearly retained DNA-binding activity, the resulting weaker shift shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f5">5</xref> (lane marked 19) could only be obtained if 50 times more protein was used compared to the other constructs (lanes marked P, 28 and 25), suggesting that GST&#x02013;19 has a much lower affinity for Prodsat sequences. It is also notable that with construct <italic>28</italic> binding could be obtained only if the carrier DNA concentration was decreased. This suggests a decreased sequence specificity of <italic>28</italic> compared to that of <italic>P</italic> and <italic>25</italic>. Taken together, our results indicate that the smallest peptide that can bind Prodsat with an affinity comparable to that of the full-length protein is <italic>25</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Prod binds DNA in a co-operative manner</title><p>In order to provide a more quantitative description of the Prod&#x02013;DNA interaction, we performed gel-shift titration experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c18">18</xref>), in which increasing amounts of fusion peptide (<italic>P</italic>, <italic>25</italic> or <italic>28)</italic> are added to a constant and small amount of labeled target DNA, until all the DNA goes into complex. In our first gel-shifts we used a target DNA that contained 12 Prodsat repeat units. However the 12&#x000d7; Prodsat probe constantly resulted in a sudden shift of the radioactivity at some point from the control lane to the loading well by just a 3-fold increase in the protein concentration, without having any intermediate complex size, with full-length Prod and <italic>25</italic> (data not shown). This was a clear indication of extremely co-operative DNA-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c19">19</xref>) in case the large complexes in the loading well did not represent non-specific protein&#x02013;DNA aggregates. Since these large complexes disappeared from the loading well if cold Prodsat competitor DNA (identical to the labeled probe) was added to the same reaction, they must not have represented non-specific aggregates, but huge Prod&#x02013;Prodsat complexes that could not enter the gel because of their size. Nevertheless, we decided to decrease the Prodsat repeat number for having smaller complexes that can enter the gel and produce more convincing results, but are still capable of demonstrating co-operativity. For this reason all the shown gel-shift experiments were performed with a target DNA containing 4.5 Prodsat repeats only.</p><p>The behavior of <italic>28</italic> markedly differs from that of <italic>25</italic> and <italic>P</italic> in the gel-shift titration assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f6">6</xref>A, B and C). An increasing amount of <italic>28</italic> resulted in a gradual decrease in the mobility of the protein&#x02013;DNA complexes, which appeared to be stabilized at higher protein concentrations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f6">6</xref>C). In contrast, the size of the <italic>P</italic> and <italic>25</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f6">6</xref>A and B, respectively) complexes with DNA remained constant throughout a wide range of protein concentrations. Although faster-migrating <italic>P</italic> and <italic>25</italic> complexes can also be seen as faint bands at low protein concentrations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f6">6</xref>A and B arrows), the apparent size of the predominant complex does not change and the faint bands disappear at higher concentrations. At high concentrations of <italic>P</italic> and <italic>25</italic>, the stability of the predominant complexes becomes less stable as suggested by their smeary appearance and at the same time very large complexes start to accumulate in the wells &#x0005b;Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f6">6</xref>A and B, lanes 1&#x02013;3 and lane 1 (reading from left to right), respectively&#x0005d;. However, these very low-mobility complexes also shift back if cold Prodsat competitor DNA (identical to the labeled probe) is added to the same reaction indicating that they do not correspond to non-specific aggregates but rather represent binding of the protein to non-specific sequences outside of the Prodsat repeat within the probe if the protein concentration exceeds a certain threshold value (data not shown).</p><p>It is important to remember that the interaction of peptide <italic>28</italic> with DNA is much more sensitive to competition by cold carrier DNA than that of <italic>P</italic> or <italic>25</italic>. While complexes of <italic>P</italic> and <italic>25</italic> are stable in the presence of 6 &#x000b5;g carrier DNA, complexes of <italic>28</italic> are stable up to a maximum of 1 &#x000b5;g competitor DNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f6">6</xref> legend). This different behavior of <italic>28</italic> from <italic>P</italic> and <italic>25</italic> is even more obvious in footprinting experiments, where <italic>28</italic> does not provide a detectable protection against DNase I digestion at any of the concentrations tested (data not shown). This indicates that the <italic>28</italic> construct has lost most of the sequence specificity that is seen in the full-length protein while it is retained in construct <italic>25</italic>. This explains the distinct <italic>28</italic> gel-shift pattern.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have shown that the Prod protein of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> is a DNA-binding protein that recognizes the 10 bp AGAATAACAT satellite repeat with a high affinity <italic>in vitro</italic>, and follows the periodicity of the DNA multimer. Prod does not have a defined DNA-binding domain since the major part of the protein is necessary for binding to happen. Removing smaller parts of the protein significantly alters the binding behavior; removal of the N-terminal 74 amino acids eliminates sequence specificity, while removal of more than one-third of the C-terminus eliminates binding. DNA-binding is highly co-operative, suggesting that Prod molecules not only bind to DNA, but also to each other, most probably via the coiled-coil domain present in the middle of the protein.</p><sec><title>The co-operativity of Prod binding</title><p>The results with 12&#x000d7; Prodsat DNA probe were a very strong indication of co-operative DNA-binding since the binding of a protein monomer to the probe would not have been expected to form such large complexes that could not enter the gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c19">19</xref>). Co-operative binding is characterized by a steep sigmoidal titration curve when graphically illustrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c18">18</xref>) and indeed, the Prod titration curve is very steep even with the decreased (4.5) repeat number, the lowest and highest regions of the curve lying within a 10-fold range of protein concentration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f6">6</xref>D). The target DNA used in the shown gel-shift titration experiments contains 4.5 Prodsat tandem repeats. If Prod binding to each repeat were independent of binding to other repeats, titration of the DNA fragment with increasing protein concentrations would have been expected to produce a mobility shift in discrete steps, each step corresponding to an occupancy of a new binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c19">19</xref>). This is clearly not the case for the full-length Prod and <italic>25</italic> constructs, as the mobility of the major complex formed at the lowest protein concentration remains unchanged and only increases in yield at higher protein concentrations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f6">6</xref>A and B). The simplest explanation for this observation is co-operative DNA binding, where the Prod&#x02013;DNA complexes we observe through a wide range of protein concentrations, always contain the same number of protein molecules because the first stable complex to form at low protein concentrations is already fully loaded with proteins in a conformation stabilized by the co-operation of protein molecules.</p><p>Construct <italic>28</italic> also shows the same steep sigmoidal titration curve (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f6">6</xref>D) suggesting that molecules of <italic>28</italic> also co-operate with each other in the course of DNA-binding. However, as mentioned above, <italic>28</italic> binding has lost most of the sequence specificity. Thus, the titration pattern of <italic>28</italic> complexes can be explained in the following way: multimers of Prod and <italic>25</italic> are restrained by the limited number of Prodsat binding sites on the probe and can only extend beyond these sites if the protein concentration exceeds a saturating threshold value; <italic>28</italic> multimers, in contrast, cannot effectively distinguish Prodsat sequences from vector sequences on the probe and gradually extend beyond these sites. This behavior allows the complex size to increase with increasing protein concentration. This saturating threshold value for <italic>P</italic> seems to be at lower protein concentration than for <italic>25</italic>, based on the earlier appearance of large complexes in the loading well. This can be due to the higher co-operativity of full-length Prod molecules than <italic>25</italic> molecules. As the <italic>25</italic> titration curve is also less steep than that of <italic>P</italic> this suggests that the C-terminal third of Prod that is missing from <italic>25</italic> also contains sequences contributing to co-operativity.</p><p>We were unable to define a small DNA-binding domain in Prod as smaller constructs were also altered in their binding behavior. It seems likely that the domain that attaches to DNA is not fully functional in itself and other domains of the protein are also indispensible for binding. The fact that an extensive domain analysis yielded solely co-operatively binding Prod fragments indicates that co-operativity is the prerequisite of DNA-binding. The coiled-coil domain&#x02014;a potential protein binding domain via which Prod molecules might bind to each other&#x02014;is the primary candidate to mediate co-operative interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c17">17</xref>) and, indeed, each construct showing DNA-binding retained this domain. Results with construct <italic>28</italic> indicate that the N-terminal 74 amino acids are indispensable for sequence recognition.</p></sec><sec><title>Prod may directly condense the Prodsat repeat</title><p>There are more independent data, listed below, that support the above statement.</p><p>(i) The regularly spaced DNase I sensitive sites revealed by the Prod footprint are very reminiscent of those periodic footprint patterns described for one group of multimeric complex dsDNA-binding proteins (MC-DBPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c20">20</xref>). In complexes with all members of this group of proteins the DNA forms a superhelix around the multimeric protein core, resulting in the compaction of the DNA strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c24">24</xref>). Based on its footprint pattern and co-operative DNA binding, Prod seems to be a new member of the MC-DBP group and may also compact the DNA.</p><p>(ii) Sequence multimers containing dA&#x000b7;dT tracts form an intrinsically curved DNA structure if the tracts are in phase with the helical screw (i.e. the repeat unit is 10 bp) because the individual curves created by each tract are summarized coherently in the multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c26">26</xref>). Of the different sequence motifs studied by Koo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c27">27</xref>), the AATAA motif was shown to cause significant DNA curvature. Since AATAA is the central motif of the 10 bp Prodsat, this bending locus can promote the formation of a superhelical structure already in the absence of proteins. This bent Prodsat DNA might be stabilized and&#x0002f;or further curved by the Prod multimer since AT-rich DNA regions are also known to be very flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c28">28</xref>). DNA bending is also inferred from the enhanced cleavage at base C in the DNA&#x02013;Prod complex on the footprint (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd531f4">4</xref> arrows), because the change of DNase I sensitivity at base C can be the consequence of an alteration in the width of the minor groove of which DNase I is most sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c29">29</xref>). These arguments lead to the suggestion that the Prod protein might be able to condense the Prodsat repeat in the absence of other chromosomal proteins.</p><p>(iii) The above interpretation is in full agreement with the conclusions of Platero <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c9">9</xref>) who, based on the Prod immunostaining pattern of <italic>D.melanogaster, Drosophila simulans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila mauritiana</italic>, have suggested that the only heterochromatic function of Prod would be to appropriately package the Prodsat repeat by a self-assembly mechanism during mitosis, because biased composition of repeated sequences might hinder normal condensation processes.</p><p>(iv) Recently the GAGA factor, another non-histone chromosomal protein that, like Prod, binds distinct satellite repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c30">30</xref>), has been shown to bind to its natural multiple euchromatic binding sites as a multimer, in a co-operative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c19">19</xref>). The DNA in these complexes is wrapped around the surface of the GAGA multimer, while histone&#x02013;DNA contacts are severely compromised. It is very likely that GAGA binding to its heterochromatic &#x02018;multiple binding sites&#x02019; happens with the same mechanism.</p><p>The remarkable similarities between the Prod and GAGA factor heterochromatin localization, binding dynamics and mutant phenotypes have been extensively discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c31">31</xref>), now we can further extend these similarities with their co-operative DNA-binding properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-operative binding might be a general requirement for satellite compaction</title><p>Based on their similar heterochromatin binding dynamics during the cell cycle in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> and the absence of Prod and GAGA-factor as well as their heterochromatic target sequences from <italic>D.simulans</italic> and <italic>D.mauritiana</italic>, the closest relatives of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, Csink and Henikoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c31">31</xref>) proposed the &#x02018;mitotic protein borrowing model&#x02019; to explain the striking variability of the eukaryotic satellite sequences at the evolutionary level. According to this model the amplification of Prodsat in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> would reflect a very recent evolutionary event, possibly selected for by the pre-existence of Prod in the nucleus. It follows from the above that the primary function of this protein must have been euchromatic, but it might have acquired an additional heterochromatic function based merely on its ability to bind and compact the Prodsat repeated sequence.</p><p>Satellite domains usually appear in large blocks and are probably derived from the amplification of a simple sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c32">32</xref>). If the co-evolution of Prod and Prodsat as well as GAGA factor and AG repeats illustrate a general feature of heterochromatin evolution, then simple DNA sequences would be selected for amplification into satellites if they fulfilled two basic conditions: (i) the ability to assume a bent structure and (ii) the pre-existence of DNA-binding protein(s) that can organize&#x0002f;stabilize the bent structure into compacted heterochromatin. Intrinsic curvature is a general characteristic of all known satellite DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd531c34">34</xref>) in agreement with the first condition of this model. Based on the results with the GAGA factor and Prod, the ability of co-operative binding might be a second general feature of those proteins that are able to compact long tandem repeats.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd531f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) The different GST&#x02013;Prod fusion protein constructs used in our studies.
