A relative decrease of &#x003b1;6B expression was also identified in primary colon tumors and adenocarcinoma cell lines suggesting that the &#x003b1;6A/&#x003b1;6B ratios may be linked to the proliferative status of colonic cells. Additional studies in colon cancer cells showed that experimentally restoring the &#x003b1;6A/&#x003b1;6B balance in favor of &#x003b1;6B caused a decrease in cellular S-phase entry and repressed the activity of c-Myc.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings that the &#x003b1;6B&#x003b2;4 integrin is expressed in quiescent normal colonic cells and is significantly down-regulated in colon cancer cells relative to its &#x003b1;6A&#x003b2;4 counterpart are consistent with the anti-proliferative influence and inhibitory effect on c-Myc activity identified for this &#x003b1;6B&#x003b2;4 integrin.

Integrins do not possess intrinsic signalling capacities, but rather mediate positional information by interacting with a large range of scaffolding proteins resulting in activation of several signalling molecules, such as Ras and PI3K, leading to subsequent activation of, among other molecules, JNK, Jun, Erk and CyclinD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The net result of this integrin mediated intracellular signalling is control of cellular functions such as proliferation, migration, invasion and survival, all of which are pivotal events in cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The existence of 18 &#x003b1; subunits and 8 &#x003b2; subunits leads to the formation of at least 24 distinct integrins, which are further diversified by extensive alternative splicing and post-translational modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The accumulated findings of an association between high expression levels of the &#x003b1;6 integrin subunit and carcinoma cell invasion, metastatic capacity, apoptosis evasion and negative patient outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] strongly argue in favor of a role for &#x003b1;6 containing integrins in human cancers. While the &#x003b1;6 subunit can dimerize with either &#x003b2;1 or &#x003b2;4 subunits, it preferentially dimerizes with the &#x003b2;4 subunit. In fact, in cells that express significant amounts of &#x003b2;4, such as human intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], the formation of &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 is nominal. Recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated an overall up-regulation of the expression of the &#x003b2;4 integrin subunit in primary tumors of the human colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] strongly supporting the notion that the &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;4 integrin is an important player in the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These observations, taken together with the reported presence of this major laminin receptor at the invasive front of colorectal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], argue for an important role for the &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;4 integrin in colon cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The &#x003b1;6 integrin subunit exists as two distinct variants, &#x003b1;6A and &#x003b1;6B, that differ in their cytoplasmic domains as the result of alternative splicing of a single exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Thus, the inclusion of an alternatively spliced exon results in the formation of the &#x003b1;6A variant, while exclusion leads to a reading frame shift, use of an alternative stop codon and formation of the &#x003b1;6B variant. These two variants show dissimilar spatial and temporal patterns of expression in various human organs and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. For example, the &#x003b1;6A variant is exclusive to the mammary gland, basal keratinocytes and peripheral nerves, while the &#x003b1;6B variant is strongly favored in the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These distinct expression patterns, in combination with the conservation of the two variants in all mammalian species studied, suggest a biological importance for the existence of both molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These arguments are supported by the divergent capacities of the &#x003b1;6A and -B subunits to initiate intracellular biochemical events, namely tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and activation of the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, further evidence for the biological role of these &#x003b1;6 integrin splice variants is still lacking.</p><p>In the present study, we sought to establish the expression patterns and possible functions of the &#x003b1;6A and &#x003b1;6B integrin subunits in the normal human and adenocarcinoma cells of the colon. Our data show that these two variants are differentially expressed according to cell state. The A variant was predominant in the progenitor cells of the normal colon while the B variant was predominant in mature differentiated colonocytes. Significantly, we show a diminishment of &#x003b1;6B variant expression in primary colon carcinomas and adenocarcinoma cell lines. Interestingly, forced expression of the &#x003b1;6B variant revealed a specific ability of this variant to inhibit colonocyte proliferation and c-Myc activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissues</title><p>Samples of adult colon were obtained from patients between the ages of 49 and 86 years undergoing surgical treatment for colon adenocarcinoma.

Diagnoses of adenocarcinoma were confirmed by pathologists. Staging of the carcinomas was according to Astler and Coller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Resection margins of colon specimens obtained from patients undergoing surgery for pathologies other than colon cancer (bowel obstruction, diverticulosis, etc.) were also used for immunofluorescence.

Nonspecific protein-protein interactions were blocked for one hour at room temperature by immersion of slides in 10% goat serum (&#x003b1;6A) or 2% BSA (&#x003b1;6B) in PBS followed by incubation with the primary antibodies diluted 1:200 in their respective blocking solutions overnight at room temperature. Following extensive washing in PBS, the slides were incubated with either FITC or rhodamine conjugated secondary antibodies raised against mouse and rabbit IgG (Chemicon), respectively, for one hour at room temperature before being washed in PBS. The slides were stained with Evan's blue (0.01% in PBS) before being mounted in glycerol:PBS (9:1) containing 0.1% paraphenylenediamine and observed for fluorescence with a Leica Reichart Polyvar 2 microscope (Leica Canada, Saint-Laurent, QC) equipped with a Leica DFC300 FX digital color camera. In all cases, no immunofluorescent staining was observed when a mix of mouse and rabbit non-immune sera replaced primary antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary antibodies</title><p>Two antibodies recognizing integrin &#x003b1;6A (1A10) and &#x003b1;6B (6B4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] were originally generous gifts from Dr. A.

Subsequently, these antibodies were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA; 1A10) and MUbio Products (Maastricht, The Netherlands; 6B4). Mabs 1A10 and 6B4 were used for western blots and co-immunoprecipitation. For indirect immunofluorescence, 6B4 and a rabbit polyclonal &#x003b1;6A (&#x003b1;6-cytoA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] antibody was obtained and employed in place of 1A10. This antibody was a generous gift from Dr. de Curtis (Department of Molecular Pathology and Medicine, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy). The anti-Ki67 monoclonal antibody KiS5 and the polyclonal anti-lysozyme antiserum were from Chemicon and DAKO Cytomation (Glostrup, Denmark). The anti-progenitor cell Rbm19 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] was a kind gift from Dr. Alan M. Mayer (Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, WI).

An Rb responsive luciferase reporter plasmid, pRb-TA-Luc (Clontech) was also used. An expression vector containing the cDNA of integrin &#x003b1;6A, pRc/CMV-&#x003b1;6A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], was a generous gift from Dr. Sonnenberg (Division of Cell Biology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The &#x003b1;6A cDNA was subcloned into the viral expression vector pLPCX (BD Bioscience Clontech, Mississauga, ON) by a non-directional strategy using <italic>Hind </italic>III. Correct orientation was verified by restriction enzyme analysis. cDNA originating from a preparation of fetal epithelial enterocytes separated from the mesenchyme using Matrisperse (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] was used as a template for PCR amplification of the cytoplasmic tail of the &#x003b1;6B subunit using <italic>Pwo </italic>polymerase (Roche, Laval, QC).

The amplified DNA was ligated into pPCR-Script (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and verified for fidelity by sequencing. Subsequently, the cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin &#x003b1;6A subunit in pRc/CMV-&#x003b1;6A was replaced by the cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin &#x003b1;6B subunit by <italic>Xba</italic>I digestion of the recipient (pRc/CMV-&#x003b1;6A) and donor (pPCR-Script-&#x003b1;6B) vectors followed by ligation, generating pRc/CMV-&#x003b1;6B. The cDNA encoding the integrin &#x003b1;6B subunit was subcloned into the pLPCX vector using the same strategy as for &#x003b1;6A. A mammalian episomal expression vector, pEEP1, was used to generate populations of Caco-2/15 cells over-expressing the two integrin &#x003b1;6 splice variants. Integrin &#x003b1;6A or &#x003b1;6B subunit cDNA was excised from pRc/CMV-&#x003b1;6A and pRc/CMV-&#x003b1;6B, respectively, using <italic>Hind</italic>III, Klenow filled and blunt-end ligated into a Klenow filled <italic>Not</italic>I site in pEEP1, generating pEEP1-&#x003b1;6A and pEEP1-&#x003b1;6B.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture and generation of colon cancer cells over-expressing &#x003b1;6A and &#x003b1;6B</title><p>The colon cancer cell line, Caco-2/15 was grown in DMEM (GIBCO, Burlington, ON) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH), 1% HEPES and 1% Glutamax (both from GIBCO, Burlington, ON) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

As in our previous study on the &#x003b2;4 subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], using quantitative PCR we observed a significant up-regulation of total &#x003b1;6 expression in paired primary tumor samples versus patient matched normal resection margins (RM) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We then assessed whether modulation of &#x003b1;6 splice-variant expression accompanied the overall up-regulation of total &#x003b1;6 in primary tumors. Competitive RT-PCR using primers that amplify the transcripts of both &#x003b1;6 variants showed an overall dominance of &#x003b1;6B expression in the healthy resection margins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> &#x02013; RM). Furthermore, a clear down-regulation of expression of the &#x003b1;6B variant in conjunction with a possible increase in the &#x003b1;6A variant were observed in patient matched tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, C</xref>). Overall, 81% of the 21 pairs showed the same change in expression in the tumor sample, resulting in a statistically significant shift towards a diminished &#x003b1;6B/A-ratio in primary cancers compared to healthy resection margins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). However, no correlation was noted between tumor grade or stage and &#x003b1;6B down-regulation (data not shown). A predominant expression of the &#x003b1;6B variant in normal colonic tissue is in accordance with the fact that the quiescent cell population outsizes the proliferative cell population in the normal colon. Correspondingly, a shift towards higher expression of the A variant in hyperproliferative colon carcinomas correlated with the association of this variant with the proliferative compartment of the healthy colon.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Integrin &#x003b1;6 is up-regulated in colon cancer cells and undergoes a shift towards the &#x003b1;6A variant</bold>.

All six cell lines tested predominantly expressed the A-variant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). However, at least one exception to this exists since the Colo 320 cell line has been previously shown to predominantly express the B-variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] suggesting that, as observed herein for the primary tumors where 4 out of the 21 pairs analyzed did not show an &#x003b1;6A subunit increase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), the relation between high &#x003b1;6A expression and a pro-proliferative state is not absolute in colon cancer cell lines of human origin although quite frequent. To further investigate the phenomenon, we used the two colon cancer cell lines, Caco-2/15 and HT-29 that share the trait of undergoing a differentiation program, characterized by a significant decline in proliferation, as a consequence of culture method. These two cell types express both &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;4 subunits but because the affinity of &#x003b1;6 for &#x003b2;4 is much greater than for &#x003b2;1, it can be assumed based on studies performed on keratinocytes and other cell types that the &#x003b1;6A/B variants mainly combine with &#x003b2;4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This was confirmed by immunoprecipitating the &#x003b1;6B complex from metabolically labeled Caco-2/15 or primary keratinocytes with [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine and cystine using the &#x003b1;6 subunit-specific G0H3 antibody and analysis by SDS-PAGE under reduced and non-reduced conditions. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, both keratinocytes and Caco-2/15 cells display bands at approximately 205 kD and 150 kD and 205 kD and 120 kD corresponding to the &#x003b2;4 and &#x003b1;6 subunits under non-reduced and reduced conditions, respectively. The &#x003b2;1 subunit remained below detection level in Caco-2/15 cells confirming that &#x003b1;6 predominantly associates with &#x003b2;4 in intestinal cells. We thus used the two intestinal cell models Caco-2/15 and HT-29 to monitor the expression of the &#x003b1;6A and B variants during the course of proliferation arrest accompanied by the induction of differentiation. Competitive RT-PCR revealed that the ratio of &#x003b1;6A to &#x003b1;6B was altered as a function of cell state, reflecting the situation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Higher levels of &#x003b1;6A were associated with actively growing cells and a subsequent switch in favour of &#x003b1;6B was found to be associated with cells that had undergone cell cycle arrest (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C, D</xref>).

Consequently, we focused our experiments on the well-characterized colon cancer cell line Caco-2/15 which has the ability to constitutively deposit significant amounts of laminins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], the &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;4 ligands. To evaluate the hypothesis that an altered &#x003b1;6A/&#x003b1;6B ratio could be of functional importance for the proliferative status of colon cancer cells we attempted to create stable cell lines over-expressing &#x003b1;6A and &#x003b1;6B. However, we were repeatedly unable to maintain the &#x003b1;6B cells in long term cultures suggesting that over-expression of the &#x003b1;6B variant impaired cell proliferation. We were unable to perform complementary studies using RNAi since the only difference between the mRNA of the &#x003b1;6A and &#x003b1;6B variants is the inclusion of an alternatively spliced exon in the &#x003b1;6A transcript. As no region of the transcript is unique to the &#x003b1;6B variant it was not possible to exclusively target the &#x003b1;6B transcript for RNAi.</p><p>We consequently opted to perform studies on nucleofected cell populations over-expressing the two variants despite the difficulty in maintaining the &#x003b1;6B over-expressing cells, analyzing the cells shortly following the 10-day antibiotic selection period ensuring that all cells expressed their respective episomal vectors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

More importantly, it suggests that the intrinsic role of each &#x003b1;6 variant is distinct. In this context, our finding that the &#x003b1;6B variant exclusively repressed proliferation concurs with its low level of expression in the proliferative zone and its predominance in the non-proliferative compartments of the colon as shown herein, as well as in the small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].

The occurrence and development of most colon cancers follows a stereotypical pattern of a progressive accumulation of gain- and loss of function mutations of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It is also clear that neoplastic cells tend to up-regulate the expression of integrins favoring their migration, survival and proliferation during the complex multistep generation of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The mechanistic and biochemical roles of the &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;4 integrin in carcinoma biology are well documented[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Our results describe novel aspects of the biology of the &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;4 integrin variants in colon cancer. Thus, after having identified that distinct forms of the integrin &#x003b2;4 subunit were expressed in normal intestinal proliferative vs cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], we observed herein a shift in &#x003b1;6 variant expression from a predominantly high &#x003b1;6B/&#x003b1;6A ratio in the normal colon to a predominantly low &#x003b1;6B/&#x003b1;6A ratio in primary tumors.</p><p>c-Myc is a key player in cancer formation and progression due to the numerous roles it plays in proliferation control and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Indeed, c-Myc expression has been demonstrated to be up-regulated in 70% of colon cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and its well documented effects include stimulation of cyclinD expression, inhibition of p21<sup>cip1 </sup>and p27<sup>kip1 </sup>expression and inactivation of Rb, leading to enhanced G<sub>1 </sub>to S-phase transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Given the central role of c-Myc in the control of critical cellular events, its transcriptional functions are tightly regulated by several molecular pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Prototypically, the control of cellular c-Myc levels are largely attributed to the canonical activity of the Wnt-pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, the activity and expression levels of c-Myc are regulated by several other molecular mechanisms including distinct signalling pathways and interaction with binding partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. For instance, the nucleoshuttling scaffold protein bridging integrator-1 (Bin1) has been shown to strongly inhibit c-Myc transcriptional activity in a Wnt-pathway independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Interestingly, Bin1 can selectively interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the &#x003b1;6B integrin subunit in yeast two-hybrid studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and its expression has been reported to be associated with the non-proliferative cell population in the normal intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] suggesting a possible mechanism for the inhibitory effect of &#x003b1;6B&#x003b2;4 on c-Myc activity.</p><p>While there is substantial evidence for the differential capacity of the &#x003b1;6A&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;6B&#x003b2;1 integrins to initiate intracellular signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and facilitate migration on laminin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], these studies have all found that the &#x003b1;6A&#x003b2;1 integrin functions as the "active" integrin, whereas the &#x003b1;6B&#x003b2;1 integrin appears to have no major active role in these events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In this context it is noteworthy that over-expression of the &#x003b1;6A variant in colon cancer cells did not stimulate proliferation as compared to the control cells, but rather the &#x003b1;6B variant actively inhibited proliferation and c-Myc activity, under conditions where integrin/ligand interactions occurred. It is furthermore noteworthy that the &#x003b1;6A/B splice variants can dimerize with both the &#x003b2;1 and the &#x003b2;4 subunits to form two distinct functional integrins, &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;4, but that the &#x003b1;6 subunit preferentially dimerizes with the &#x003b2;4 subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], as confirmed herein. Thus, the specific ability of the &#x003b1;6B subunit to inhibit proliferation, in accordance with its predominant expression in the quiescent compartment of the normal colon and its down-regulation in primary colon cancers and adenocarcinoma cell lines, strongly suggests that the expression and ratio of the &#x003b1;6A and &#x003b1;6B splice variants are inherent to normal intestinal homeostasis and exploited by colon cancer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we provide the first functional evidence that the &#x003b1;6B&#x003b2;4 integrin can exert distinct biological functions compared to its &#x003b1;6A&#x003b2;4 counterpart.

To test this hypothesis, we forced &#x003b1;6A and &#x003b1;6B expression and found that re-establishing predominant &#x003b1;6B subunit expression inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation and c-Myc activity.
