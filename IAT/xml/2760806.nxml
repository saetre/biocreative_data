SgrS is a unique dual-function sRNA with a base pairing function that regulates mRNA targets and an mRNA function that allows production of the 43-amino-acid protein SgrT. SgrS is expressed when non-metabolizable sugars accumulate intracellularly (glucose-phosphate stress) and is required to allow <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells to recover from stress. In this study, homologs of SgrS were used to complement an <italic>E. coli sgrS</italic> mutant in order elucidate the physiological relevance of differences among homologs. These analyses revealed that the base pairing function of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> SgrS homologs is critical for rescue from glucose-phosphate stress. In contrast, base pairing-deficient SgrS homologs from <italic>Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> rescue <italic>E. coli</italic> cells from stress despite their failure to regulate target mRNAs. Compared with <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrS, <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> SgrS produces more SgrT and this rescues cell growth even when the base pairing function is inactivated. Genetic evidence suggests that a secondary structure in the <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrS 5&#x02032; region inhibits <italic>sgrT</italic> translation. This structure is not present in <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> SgrS, which explains its higher level of SgrT production.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Small RNAs have risen to prominence as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in virtually all organisms from bacteria to humans. The best-studied class of bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) is characterized by a base pairing-dependent mechanism of action on target mRNAs and a requirement for the RNA chaperone Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Most Hfq-dependent sRNAs are in the range of 60&#x02013;100 nucleotides (nt) in length and do not encode proteins. Since the regulatory function of these molecules depends on RNA&#x02013;RNA base pairing interactions, sRNAs are sometimes referred to as riboregulators. Hfq-dependent sRNAs are capable of both positive and negative regulation of mRNA translation and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). To date, examples of negative regulation are more common: an sRNA base pairing with the 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) of its target mRNA prevents ribosome binding to that mRNA and either directly or indirectly stimulates mRNA degradation.</p><p>In the last decade, hundreds of sRNAs of unknown function have been identified in dozens of bacterial species. While the vast majority of these RNAs remain uncharacterized with regard to their roles in cell physiology, the few sRNAs that have been studied generally have roles in cellular stress responses. For example, the 227-nt sRNA SgrS is expressed under conditions of metabolic stress in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> when cells are unable to appropriately metabolize phosphorylated sugars; SgrS is required for continued cell growth under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). This metabolic stress is referred to as glucose-phosphate stress because the stress response is apparently induced by the accumulation of early glycolytic intermediates, such as glucose-6-phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In the laboratory, the stress response is induced by exposing strains with mutations in early glycolytic genes (<italic>pgi</italic> or <italic>pfk</italic>) to glucose or by exposing wild-type cells to the non-metabolizable glucose analog &#x003b1;-methyl glucoside (&#x003b1;MG). Both glucose and &#x003b1;MG are transported into the cytoplasm and concomitantly phosphorylated through the action of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). When it is expressed under stress conditions, SgrS base pairs with mRNAs encoding PTS proteins, which inhibits translation and promotes degradation of these messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The proposed physiological significance of this regulation is that SgrS stops new sugar transporters from being produced under conditions where the accumulated sugar-phosphates have become toxic. Indeed, the growth of <italic>sgrS</italic> mutants is strongly and permanently inhibited under glucose-phosphate stress conditions, whereas <italic>sgrS</italic><sup>+</sup> cells are only slightly and transiently inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>We recently reported that SgrS is the defining member of a novel class of Hfq-dependent RNAs with two distinct functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The riboregulation function of SgrS on its target mRNAs is carried out by a mechanism that has been described for a number of other sRNAs. Base pairing interactions between SgrS and <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA, which encodes the major glucose transporter (PtsG or EIICB<sup>Glc</sup>), occlude the <italic>ptsG</italic> ribosome-binding site and lead to translation inhibition and <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The second function of SgrS is encoding the 43-amino-acid protein SgrT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). When SgrT is ectopically produced under glucose-phosphate stress conditions, it rescues the growth of cells by a mechanism that is distinct from riboregulation. Since SgrT can block glucose uptake without affecting levels of <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA or PtsG protein, we have proposed that it acts by blocking PtsG activity by an as yet unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>SgrS is thus far unique in its dual functionality and we do not know how translation and riboregulation influence one another. Therefore, in this and a companion study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) we sought to define the distribution of SgrS/SgrT systems and utilize SgrS homologs from other organisms as naturally occurring variants that might provide insight into the function of this sRNA. The current study describes our characterization of a subset of SgrS homologs in an <italic>E. coli sgrS</italic> mutant host. We have determined that while the riboregulation function is well conserved, there is diversity among homologs of closely related organisms, with respect to the role of SgrT in the glucose-phosphate stress response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strain and plasmid construction</title><p>Many strains constructed for this study are derivatives of DJ480 or DJ624 (D.

CV104 and CS136 were described in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). CS104 contains a &#x00394;<italic>sgrS</italic> allele that was constructed by homologous recombination using the &#x003bb; Red system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). To construct CS104, a <italic>cat</italic>-<italic>sacB</italic> cassette was amplified with primers O-CV178 and O-CV179 and the resultant PCR product was recombined with the chromosome after the fifth codon of <italic>sgrT</italic> to create strain CS100. A single-stranded oligonucleotide, O-CV211 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp591/DC1">Table S2</ext-link>) was then transformed into CS100 to loop out the <italic>cat</italic>-<italic>sacB</italic> cassette and the flanking regions of <italic>sgrS</italic>. CS123 is derived from CS100 and was constructed by homologous recombination using a PCR product obtained using primers O-CV181 and O-CV243. JH111 was created by J. B.

The <italic>ptsG&#x02032;-&#x02032;lacZ</italic> translational fusion in strain JH171 was created by J. B.

After removal of the kanamycin resistance cassette and transformation of the strain with a plasmid carrying FRT-<italic>lacZ-lacY</italic>-kan-FRT, homologous recombination resulted in an in-frame fusion such that LacZ was fused to a cytoplasmic loop after the fourth transmembrane domain of PtsG.</p><p>DH5&#x003b1; (Invitrogen) and XL10 gold (Stratagene) were used for cloning procedures.

All <italic>sgrS</italic> homologs are found in genomes adjacent to and encoded divergently from <italic>sgrR</italic> homologs. All have a conserved 3&#x02032; region predicted to be involved in riboregulation. The subset of homologs chosen for this study are described at length elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and briefly here. Homologs from <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 (<italic>sgrS<sub>K12</sub></italic>) and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (<italic>sgrS<sub>St</sub></italic>) both possess the <italic>sgrT</italic> coding sequence (CDS) and 3&#x02032; base pairing region.

The <italic>E. carotovora</italic> homolog (<italic>sgrS<sub>Ecar</sub></italic>) is the most divergent at the nucleotide sequence level, but retains both the <italic>sgrT</italic> CDS and putative base pairing sequences. To assess the function of SgrS homologs, we used two phenotypic assays described in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>): (i) recovery from glucose-phosphate stress following exposure of cells to &#x003b1;MG and (ii) growth inhibition on glucose minimal medium when SgrS is ectopically expressed. The genes encoding the homologs were placed under the control of the <italic>lac</italic> promoter on a medium-copy-number plasmid. The start of transcription chosen for each homolog is based on promoter predictions and alignment with <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 <italic>sgrS</italic>, for which the start site has been experimentally determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The homolog-containing plasmids were transformed into a &#x00394;<italic>sgrS</italic>, <italic>lacI<sup>q+</sup></italic> (overexpresses the LacI repressor) <italic>E. coli</italic> host and the resulting strains were tested for stress recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) and growth on minimal glucose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and C). Northern blots showed that an SgrS RNA of the predicted size for each homolog was produced from the P<italic><sub>lac</sub></italic> constructs at levels comparable to (<italic>sgrS<sub>K12</sub></italic>, <italic>sgrS<sub>St</sub></italic>, <italic>sgrS<sub>Yp</sub></italic>) or slightly less than (<italic>sgrS<sub>Ecar</sub></italic>, <italic>sgrS<sub>Kp</sub></italic>) that produced from the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome during glucose-phosphate stress (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp591/DC1">Figure S1</ext-link>).

In the current experiments, expression of all the homologs tested promoted recovery of the <italic>E. coli</italic> host strain from stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).

Inducer exclusion is mediated by deposphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> (the form that accumulates when glucose is transported) binding and inhibiting activity of proteins like Lac permease. Thus, when wild-type cells are growing in the presence of glucose and lactose, lactose is excluded and expression of <italic>lac</italic> genes is very low. The activity of the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene product (&#x003b2;-galactosidase) in cells growing in media with glucose and lactose serves as an <italic>in vivo</italic> measure of PTS function. Inducer exclusion assays demonstrated that ectopic expression of the wild-type SgrS or SgrT inhibits glucose transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).

This indicates that when base pairing is disrupted, these alleles (<italic>sgrS1<sub>K12</sub></italic> and <italic>sgrS1<sub>Yp</sub></italic>) are unable to down-regulate PtsG production or activity and therefore glucose transport and inducer exclusion are unaffected. This is consistent with previous data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) suggesting that the base pairing activity of SgrS<sub>K12</sub> and SgrS<sub>Yp</sub> is the most important function for these homologs (and the only function for SgrS<sub>Yp</sub>).

To date, all of these appear to function solely as non-coding riboregulators. Some of these [e.g. the <italic>E. coli</italic> RyhB sRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>)] target dozens of mRNAs for translational regulation or degradation and thus have far-reaching effects on cell physiology. It appears as though the <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrS sRNA has a more limited scope for its riboregulation function. We know of only two <italic>E. coli</italic> mRNAs that are directly targeted for negative regulation by SgrS; these both encode PTS carbohydrate transporters. However, SgrS has the additional unusual property of encoding a small protein with its own individual function in the glucose-phosphate stress response. In the present study, we used a set of homologs of SgrS (identified in a separate study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) as natural &#x02018;mutants&#x02019; that would provide insight into the individual roles of riboregulation and SgrT in the glucose-phosphate stress response. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a side-by-side functional comparison of homologous sRNAs.</p><p>The 3&#x02032; region of SgrS contains sequences involved in base pairing with target mRNAs and is the most conserved at the primary sequence level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), suggesting that the riboregulation function is also well-conserved. Among the homologs tested, only SgrS<sub>Yp</sub> and SgrS<sub>Ecar</sub> failed to inhibit growth on glucose minimal medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). We showed that the failure to inhibit growth on glucose was not due to failure to regulate <italic>ptsG</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Since we know that SgrS<sub>K12</sub> targets the <italic>manXYZ</italic> mRNA (J. B. Rice and C. K. Vanderpool, unpublished data), which encodes a PTS system of broad substrate specificity, we hypothesized that the <italic>sgrS<sub>Yp</sub></italic> and <italic>sgrS<sub>Ecar</sub></italic> alleles&#x02019; failure to down-regulate this message may account for their inability to fully inhibit growth on glucose. Indeed, we found that both of these homologs could fully inhibit growth on glucose in a &#x00394;<italic>manXYZ</italic> host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). These observations highlight one aspect of heterogeneity among SgrS homologs. We have not yet determined whether these SgrS homologs also fail to regulate their cognate <italic>manXYZ</italic> mRNAs or whether the base pairing determinants for SgrS and <italic>manXYZ</italic> mRNA have evolved compensatory mutations that preserve the regulation.</p><p>Phenotypic differences in rescue from stress and glucose growth inhibition among <italic>sgrS</italic> homologs indicate that of the two functions of <italic>sgrS</italic> (riboregulation and SgrT production) that SgrT production is more variable. The major functional difference among SgrS homologs was revealed by analyses of mutants with defective base pairing functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The <italic>sgrS1<sub>K12</sub></italic> and <italic>sgrS1<sub>Yp</sub></italic> alleles failed to rescue cells from stress, indicating that for these homologs, the base pairing function is primarily responsible for the rescue phenotype. This was not surprising for <italic>sgrS1<sub>Yp</sub></italic>, since it lacks the <italic>sgrT</italic> CDS altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, for the <italic>sgrS1<sub>K12</sub></italic> allele, it was an unexpected result as we had previously shown that ectopic expression of <italic>sgrT</italic> alone was sufficient for rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Furthermore, other homologs that encode <italic>sgrT</italic> (<italic>sgrS1<sub>St</sub>, sgrS1<sub>Ecar</sub></italic> and <italic>sgrS1<sub>Kp</sub></italic>) were fully capable of rescue even with defective base pairing functions. The disparate requirements for base pairing among these homologs likely can be explained by the occurrence of a translation-inhibitory secondary structure in the <italic>sgrS<sub>K12</sub></italic> 5&#x02032; region. Mutations that disrupt the putative secondary structure allow higher-level production of SgrT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). It is unclear whether this structure serves a regulatory role. There may be a condition or additional regulatory factor that we have not identified that modulates <italic>sgrT</italic> translation in <italic>E. coli</italic> K12. On the other hand, it is possible that some organisms, e.g. <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 and <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, have lost the need for SgrT and cope with stress using the base pairing function alone, while other organisms still require both base pairing and production of SgrT to adequately respond to stress.</p><p>The exact nature of the signal that initiates the glucose-phosphate stress response remains unclear, though the activities of SgrS appear to be aimed at limiting sugar transport. This could reflect toxicity of phosphosugars themselves; perhaps they damage cellular molecules or act as competitive inhibitors of enzymes involved in essential anabolic pathways. However, it is also possible that sugar-phosphates themselves are not problematic, but rather it is the depletion of phosphoenolpyruvate or other metabolic intermediates that drives the stress response. Beyond the identity of the stress signal, the natural conditions that induce this stress response are also unknown. The distribution of SgrRST homologs is limited to &#x003b3;-Proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, many species outside this group of organisms also utilize the PTS for glucose transport and glycolysis for its catabolism. If this metabolic stress is inherently generated by either PTS-mediated transport or the glycolytic pathway, these other species should also have a mechanism for responding to stress. It seems likely that we will not understand this issue until we have further elucidated the nature of the stress signal and the effects of the stress on cell physiology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp591/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp591_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkp591_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; the American Cancer Society (Research Scholar Grant ACS 2008-01868); the American Heart Association (Scientist Development Grant 0835355N).
