Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) has a crucial role in hematopoiesis, regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Typically, Flt3 is expressed on early myeloid and lymphoid progenitors and is activated by its soluble ligand (Flt3-L).

Additionally, recombinant Flt3-L was instillated intra-articularly in combination with peptidoglycans, a Toll Like Receptor 2-ligand with stong arthritogenic properties. Our results show significantly higher levels of Flt3-L in the synovial fluid as compared to serum levels in RA subjects (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0001). In addition, RA synovial fluid levels of Flt-3-L were significantly higher than these obtained from synovial fluids originating from non-inflammatory joint diseases (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.022). Intra-articular administration of B-cell line transfected with Flt3-L gene resulted in highly erosive arthritis while inoculation of the same B-cell line without hyperexpression of Flt3-L did not induce erosivity and only in a minority of cases caused synovial proliferation!

However there is only a scarce knowledge regarding pathogenesis of RA. RA gives rise to chronic inflammation and hyperplasia in the joint synovium, development of pannus, and invasion of leukocytes followed by destruction of local articular components such as cartilage and bone. The synovium is normally only a sparsely cellular structure containing adipocytes and scattered blood vessels but in RA the synovium is rich in cells showing a high degree of differentiation, with occurrence of CD4&#x0002b; T-cells, B-cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Hyperplasia of the synovium results from a marked increase of macrophage-like and fibroblast-like synoviocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003633-Firestein1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The reason for this markedly changed phenotype of joint during inflammation is presently unknown.</p><p>The Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) is a membrane bound tyrosine kinase receptor which has a crucial role in hematopoiesis, regulating cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Physiologically, it is mainly expressed on early myeloid and lymphoid progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003633-Rosnet1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> but few studies reported monocyte and granulocyte expression of Flt3 on mRNA and protein levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003633-Rosnet2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003633-Rappold1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The activation of Flt3-mediated signalling is achieved by interaction between Flt3 and its ligand (Flt3-L) leading to dimerization and phosphorylation and resulting in differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, both of myeloid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003633-Rusten1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and lymphoid origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003633-Namikawa1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Flt3-L also gives rise to differentiation and clonal expansion of human dendritic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003633-Maraskovsky1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Human Flt3-L is a type 1 transmembranous protein consisting of 235 amino acids. The dominating isoform is the full-length transmembrane isoform but there are also soluble forms which consist of different sizes of the extracellular domain. All isoforms are biologically active. In contrast to the Flt3 receptor, the Flt3-L is expressed in most human tissues (spleen, thymus, bone marrow, prostate, kidney, and intestine) but the highest levels are seen in peripheral blood leukocytes. Serum levels of Flt3-L are low in healthy individuals but markedly elevated levels are seen in patients with secondary leukopenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003633-Stirewalt1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Flt3-L and its receptor have never been studied in the setting of arthritis. The typical cellular pattern in the synovium of the RA-joint with its abundance of highly differentiated cells implies the possibility that Flt3-L, with its ability to induce differentiation and proliferation, could be of pathogenic importance. To investigate the possible role of Flt3-L in RA we have measured the levels of Flt3-L in serum and synovial fluid of patients and of healthy controls. Furthermore, we wanted to ascertain in vivo role of increased Flt3-L levels in the joint by transplanting Flt3-L secreting cells into healthy mouse joints. Our results show that Flt3-L induces erosive arthritis in mice and that the levels of Flt3-L are significantly elevated in the inflamed joints of RA patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Flt3-L levels in synovial fluids and sera of RA patients</title><p>Paired serum (S) and synovial fluid (SF) samples were collected from 130 RA patients who attended the rheumatology clinics at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, G&#x000f6;teborg for acute joint effusion.

Further, long term exposure to Flt3-L gives rise to significant articular erosivity. We also show that addition of Flt3-L worsens peptidoglycan-induced arthritis in mouse and finally that the levels of Flt3-L are significantly elevated in the synovial fluid of patients with RA.</p><p>Flt3-L and its receptor have never been studied in the setting of autoimmune diseases in general or experimental arthritis in particular. We have demonstrated that Flt3-L is strongly expressed at the site of inflammation in human RA. In our material, two known prognostically negative outcome variables for RA, RF&#x0002b; and high age, correlated to high levels of Flt3-L. Having in mind the arthritogenic properties of Flt3-L, this supports the hypothesis of Flt3-L having a role in induction and/or progression of arthritis. However, in our clinical material we found no correlation to erosive disease. One possible explanation to this is the patient material displaying long disease duration and a large majority of the patients exhibiting established arthritis. In these patients the erosive course of disease has taken place long time ago and the current levels of Flt3-L reflected merely maintenance of arthritis rather than its induction. This calls for further studies of patients with an early disease onset. Indeed, our preliminary data support the notion that in early RA levels of Flt3-L display significant correlation to the erosive course of the disease (Dehlin et al, unpublished).</p><p>Three possible mechanisms of action for Flt3-L may contribute to the development of arthritis. Flt3L could increase antigen presentation through increased differentiation of macrophages and dendritic cells, both in the joint but also extra-articularly with dendritic cells migrating to lymph nodes. A second mode of action would be expansion and differentiation of B- and T-cells. This would mainly take place extra-articularly since Flt3-L increases progenitor cells in peripheral blood but these could migrate into the joint. The third, and the most likely explanation, would be Flt3-ligand-mediated activation of synovial dendritic cells, macrophages and fibroblasts giving rise to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which might initiate joint inflammation even in the absence of T- and B-cells.</p><p>The prognosis of RA has lately greatly improved owing to better pharmacologic treatment but this has generated a need for better predictive markers in general and for erosive disease in particular. Our experimental results indicate that Flt3-L could be involved in the erosive process during joint inflammation. Joint destruction is mainly mediated by macrophages and fibroblasts that invade cartilage and activated osteoclasts which in turn cause bone resorption. Osteoclasts are derived from mononuclear phagocyte precursors in the presence of RANKL and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). A recent study has shown that Flt3-L can substitute M-CSF in support of osteoclast differentiation and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003633-Lean1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Flt3-L has also been shown to mobilize osteoclastogenic progenitors in non-human primates in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003633-Papayannopoulou1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the elevated levels of Flt3-L in the synovial fluid might indeed stimulate osteoclast differentiation and thereby become a mediator of erosive disease.</p><p>In this study we provide support for Flt3-L concerning both development of and erosive course of arthritis. These data will be further validated in a large prospective RA study presently being evaluated.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Ing-Marie Jonsson and Berit Ericsson for technical
