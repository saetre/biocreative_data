RAD54B contains an N-terminal region outside the SWI2/SNF2 domain that shares less conservation with the corresponding region in RAD54. The biochemical roles of this region of RAD54B are not known, although the corresponding region in RAD54 is known to physically interact with RAD51. In the present study, we have biochemically characterized an N-terminal fragment of RAD54B, consisting of amino acid residues 26&#x02013;225 (RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub>). This fragment formed a stable dimer in solution and bound to branched DNA structures. RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> also interacted with DMC1 in both the presence and absence of DNA. Ten DMC1 segments spanning the entire region of the DMC1 sequence were prepared, and two segments, containing amino acid residues 153&#x02013;214 and 296&#x02013;340, were found to directly bind to the N-terminal domain of RAD54B. A structural alignment of DMC1 with the <italic>Methanococcus voltae</italic> RadA protein, a homolog of DMC1 in the helical filament form, indicated that these RAD54B-binding sites are located near the ATP-binding site at the monomer&#x02013;monomer interface in the DMC1 helical filament. Thus, RAD54B binding may affect the quaternary structure of DMC1. These observations suggest that the N-terminal domain of RAD54B plays multiple roles of in homologous recombination.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Homologous recombination is involved in many biologically important processes, and it occurs in all organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). In meiosis, homologous recombination is carried out in order to generate genetic diversity, by creating new linkage arrangements between genes or parts of genes. Meiotic recombination also contributes to the establishment of a physical connection between homologous chromosomes, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Meiotic recombination is initiated by a programed double-strand break (DSB) introduced in the initiation sites for recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). At the DSB site, a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tail is produced, and it is incorporated into a protein&#x02013;DNA complex, called the presynaptic filament. This presynaptic filament catalyzes the homologous pairing and strand-exchange reactions. An intermediate structure, called the Holliday junction, in which two double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules form a four-way junction, is generated through the homologous-pairing and strand-exchange steps. The Holliday junction is then resolved into two DNA molecules by the action of endonucleases.</p><p>Studies in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> initially identified the <italic>rad52</italic> epistasis group of genes (<italic>rad50</italic>, <italic>rad51</italic>, <italic>rad52</italic>, <italic>rad54</italic>, <italic>rdh54</italic>/<italic>tid1</italic>, <italic>rad55</italic>, <italic>rad57</italic>, <italic>rad59</italic>, <italic>mre11</italic> and <italic>xrs2</italic>) as the core factors of the homologous recombination machinery. The functions of the <italic>rad52</italic> epistasis group genes are highly conserved among eukaryotes, from yeast to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). One member of this group of genes, <italic>rad54</italic>, encodes a protein that belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 protein family, whose members have DNA-dependent ATPase and chromatin-remodeling activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15">9&#x02013;15</xref>). Recent studies suggested that Rad54 may play diverse roles in multiple stages of homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Rad54 promotes and stabilizes the Rad51&#x02013;ssDNA nucleoprotein filament formation by physically interacting with Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21">18&#x02013;21</xref>), and it also stimulates the homologous pairing and strand-exchange reactions mediated by Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24 B25">22&#x02013;25</xref>). These facts suggest that Rad54 functions in the early stage of homologous recombination. Rad54 is also known to disassemble Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments from DNA, which may be essential in the later stages of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Moreover, Rad54 promotes branch migration of the Holliday junction in an ATP-dependent manner, suggesting that Rad54 functions in the late stage of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>RAD54B, which shares homology with Rad54, was identified in the human cell as a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Like Rad54, RAD54B is a DNA-dependent ATPase and stimulates the RAD51-mediated homologous pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Previously, our group and others reported that RAD54B stimulates the recombination activity of DMC1, a meiosis-specific RAD51 homolog, suggesting its role in meiotic homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32">30&#x02013;32</xref>). Therefore, Rad54B may be a paralog of Rad54 having both overlapping and nonoverlapping roles with those of Rad54. RAD54B contains helicase motifs, which are commonly found in the members of the SWI2/SNF2 family. Outside this region, RAD54B has an N-terminal region of &#x0223c;300 amino acid residues. The corresponding region in RAD54 directly interacts with RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), suggesting that the N-terminal region of RAD54B may also be essential for the interactions with other recombination factors. However, the N-terminal region of RAD54B is considerably longer than that of RAD54. Hence, it is of interest whether the N-terminal region of RAD54B contains functional regions that are not present in that of RAD54. In the present study, we identified a stable N-terminal domain of the human RAD54B protein, and found that this domain is capable of self-associating, binding to DNA and interacting with both RAD51 and DMC1. These observations suggest multifunctional roles of the N-terminal domain of RAD54B in homologous recombination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Purification of RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub></title><p>The His<sub>6</sub>-tagged human RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> protein was overexpressed in the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> JM109 (DE3) strain carrying an expression vector for the minor tRNAs [Codon(+)RIL, (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany)], using the pET15b expression system (Novagen).

However, this fragment rapidly degraded to several smaller fragments during the expression and purification processes, suggesting that the fragment contained unstructured or flexible regions. Several rounds of fragment design and purification were performed to identify the stable N-terminal region of RAD54B. We found that the fragment consisting of amino acid residues 26&#x02013;225 of RAD54B (RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub>) was resistant to proteolysis and was highly soluble. The RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> mutant was expressed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> JM109 (DE3) strain, as a fusion protein with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag containing a cleavage site for thrombin protease, and was purified by Ni-NTA column chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 2). After the His<sub>6</sub> tag was uncoupled with thrombin protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 3), the peak fractions containing RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> were further purified by Benzamidine column chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 4), Q-Sepharose column chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 5) and SP-Sepharose column chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 6). About 10 mg of purified RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> were obtained from 2.5 l of <italic>E. coli</italic> suspension culture. The SDS&#x02013;PAGE analysis of the final purification fraction revealed an additional band with an apparent molecular weight of about 50 kDa. The band disappeared when higher concentrations of reducing agent were included in the electrophoresis sample buffer, indicating that RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> oligomerizes. Consistent with this observation, a gel filtration analysis of the purified RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> indicated that the fragment primarily exists as a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). These results demonstrated that amino acid residues 26&#x02013;225 of RAD54B form a stable domain. Although it is not known whether the full-length RAD54B protein multimerizes, the N-terminal region may play a role in the self-association of RAD54B. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence comparison of RAD54 and RAD54B.

As expected, the full-length RAD54B has both ssDNA- and dsDNA-binding activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In contrast, the less conserved N-terminal domain of RAD54B has no known DNA-binding motifs, and it is not known whether this domain binds to DNA. Therefore, we first examined the DNA-binding activity of RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub>, using plasmid ssDNA and dsDNA substrates. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> bound to both plasmid ssDNA and dsDNA. To further characterize the DNA-binding activity of RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub>, oligonucleotide substrates were used. RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> bound to a polyA ssDNA oligonucleotide, a substrate that is free of secondary structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The binding was observed at higher salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), suggesting that RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> interacts with ssDNA through specific interactions and not by nonspecific ionic interactions. RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> also interacted with a dsDNA oligonucleotide, as well as DNA oligonucleotides with branched structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). The binding experiments were performed using the same concentrations of the DNA substrates (0.2 &#x003bc;M) and RAD54B (2, 4, 8 and 16 &#x003bc;M), to facilitate comparisons between the results with different DNA substrates. We found that RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> exhibited slightly higher affinity for dsDNA than ssDNA (compare the amount of uncomplexed DNA between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 5 and 2D, lane 5).

However, it is not known whether the N-terminal domain of RAD54B is involved in the interactions.

In contrast, RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> weakly bound to RecA, the bacterial homolog of RAD51 and DMC1, suggesting that the interactions between RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> and RAD51 or DMC1 were specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). When the salt concentrations were titrated for the RAD51- and DMC1-binding experiments, the amounts of RAD51 and DMC1 bound to RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> sharply decreased at 200 mM of KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lane 7 and 3B, lane 6).

To clarify the similarities and differences between RAD54B and Rad54, we focused on the poorly characterized N-terminal region of RAD54B, which shares less conservation with the corresponding region in RAD54. We found a stable domain of RAD54B that is composed of amino acid residues 26&#x02013;225. This region seems to be absent in RAD54, as no structured domains were found outside the crystal structure of the core region of the zebrafish Rad54 protein (amino acid residues 91&#x02013;738; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A; see Ref. 40).</p><p>The RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> fragment self-associates and exists primarily as a dimer in solution. We also found that the RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> fragment has both ssDNA- and dsDNA-binding activities. Among the branched DNA substrates tested, RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> exhibited the highest affinities for 5&#x02032;-flapped DNA and 3&#x02032;-PX junction. Interestingly, crosslinking studies of the RAD54 protein demonstrated that the fundamental unit of this protein is a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Furthermore, the RAD54 protein preferentially binds to branched DNA substrates, with the highest preference for PX junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). These activities are proposed to be the basis for the specific recognition of the branched DNA substrate by oligomeric RAD54 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Our result suggested that RAD54B may similarly self-associate on DNA, and that the N-terminal region could provide important interactions for the oligomerization and the DNA binding.</p><p>The RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> fragment also physically interacted with both the RAD51 and DMC1 recombinases. Previously, we demonstrated that RAD54B stimulates the DMC1-mediated strand exchange by stabilizing the DMC1&#x02013;ssDNA complex, and proposed that RAD54B may promote the formation of the active DMC1 helical filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In this study, we found that RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> bound to both DMC1 alone and DMC1 complexed with DNA, and we mapped the RAD54B-interacting regions of DMC1 (amino acid residues 153&#x02013;214 and 296&#x02013;340). These regions are exposed on the surface of the octameric ring. The corresponding regions in the <italic>Methanococcus voltae</italic> RadA protein, a homolog of DMC1 that forms a helical filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), are also exposed on the surface. Thus, the RAD54B-interacting regions appear to be easily accessible by other factors, in both the ring and helical filament forms. These regions, for example, do not overlap with the putative DNA-binding loops L1 and L2 (amino acid residues 235&#x02013;240 and 271&#x02013;286) that face towards the center of the ring or the filament structure. This fact is consistent with the results that RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> interacted with the DMC1 bound to either ssDNA or dsDNA. Interestingly, the corresponding RAD54B-interacting regions of RadA are located near the monomer&#x02013;monomer interface, and contain amino acid residues that directly interact with ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, the N-terminal region of RAD54B may affect the quaternary structure of DMC1 through these interactions, and may be critical for regulating the function of DMC1. Given that RAD54B stimulates the DMC1-mediated DNA strand exchange, one possibility is that the binding of RAD54B to DMC1 may trigger the conversion of the DMC1 structure from the octameric ring form to the active helical filament form. Another possibility is that the binding of RAD54B to DMC1 may promote the turnover of DMC1 from the DNA strand-exchange product, leading to the release of DMC1. Although these observations suggested that the interaction between RAD54B and DMC1 is functionally important, meiosis in the <italic>RAD54B</italic> knockout mouse seems to be unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). This may be due to the presence of an unidentified RAD54 paralog that functions in meiosis. Alternatively, RAD54B may have a relatively minor role in meiosis, and may function with DMC1 only under certain circumstances. Further <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses are required to elucidate the role of RAD54B in meiosis. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Proposed orientations of the RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub>-interacting regions of DMC1 in the helical filament form. DMC1 sites essential for the interaction with RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub> were mapped on the corresponding locations of the <italic>M. voltae</italic> RadA filament. The closeup view shows the ATP-binding site that is surrounded by the RAD54B<sub>26&#x02013;225</sub>-interacting regions.

We found several novel biochemical properties of the N-terminal region of RAD54B that were not previously shown for the corresponding region in RAD54. These activities may be essential for the specialized role of RAD54B in homologous recombination. More studies are required to understand the broad functional spectra of RAD54B in homologous recombination, including those that are unique to RAD54B and those that are commonly shared among RAD54 paralogs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Dr Takashi Kinebuchi (Olympus) for technical assistance.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Targeted Proteins Research Program (TPRP); RIKEN Structural Genomics/Proteomics Initiative (RSGI) of the National Project on Protein Structural and Functional Analyses, MEXT.
