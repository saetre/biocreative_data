Before the molecular era, the regulation of plant developmental processes was most often described as modifications in the hormonal balance, rather than as changes in the level of a single hormone. Subsequently, genetic screens led to tremendous advances in our understanding of the key components of the individual hormone metabolism and response pathways. As the understanding of these mechanisms grew, it became more apparent that the growth of plant organs is dependent on an intricate orchestration of hormonal and non-hormonal signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stepanova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swarup <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Identifying the central players in the interplay between different signalling pathways is critical to unravelling the complex mechanisms underlying the control of plant growth and development. Despite interactions between ethylene and auxin being among the most frequently addressed in hormonal cross-talk studies, little is known about the main actors that take part in this dialogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chae <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stepanova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2007</xref>).</p><p>The plant hormone auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), has long been recognized as being a major regulator of plant growth and developmental processes. It exerts its effects by modulating the expression of downstream genes that encode proteins involved in a vast array of physiological processes. Recent genetic and molecular studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have revealed that auxin regulates gene expression through an ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic signal transduction system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dharmasiri and Estelle, 2004</xref>). At the centre of the signalling cascade is the ubiquitin&#x02013;ligase complex; auxin binding to Transport Inhibitor Response1/TIR1 (or its paralogues, the F-box protein AUXIN RECEPTOR F-BOX/AFB1 and AFB3) promotes the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of a family of transcriptional regulators known as Aux/IAAs in an auxin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gray <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dharmasiri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005<italic>a</italic></xref>, <italic>b</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kepinski and Leyser, 2005</xref>). Aux/IAA proteins inhibit the activity of the DNA-binding auxin response factors (ARF) whereas their degradation leads to the activation of ARFs and to subsequent auxin-responsive gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reed, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tiwari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zenser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hagen and Guilfoyle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liscum and Reed, 2002</xref>). Aux/IAAs are therefore central to the regulation of auxin-mediated processes. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome encodes 29 Aux/IAA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Remington <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Overvoorde <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Biochemical and genetic studies indicate that they generally function as transcriptional repressors of auxin-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ulmasov <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiwari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Woodward and Bartel, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Gain-of-function mutations in several <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> genes have pleiotropic effects on plant growth, including altered root formation, apical dominance, stem/hypocotyl elongation, leaf expansion, and phototropism/gravitropism. These mutants have been identified in a variety of developmental and auxin-specific genetic screens. Each of these mutants is caused by a single mutation in domain II that results in the stabilization of the Aux/IAA. Strikingly, with the exception of the <italic>shy2</italic> mutant that displays subtle modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tian and Reed, 1999</xref>), none of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> &#x02018;null mutants&#x02019; show obvious visible phenotypes, suggesting considerable functional redundancy among <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Overvoorde <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The wide diversity of auxin responses and the tissue-specific expression of gene family members suggest, however, that individual Aux/IAAs have precise and distinct functions during normal plant growth and development. In both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tomato, <italic>Aux/IAAs</italic> are themselves auxin responsive. Moreover, it has been reported previously that tomato <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> gene family members can be regulated by ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jones <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Here, it is shown that Sl-IAA3, a tomato Aux/IAA, is critical to both auxin and ethylene signalling and is a key molecular link between ethylene and auxin responses in tomato plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Tomato [<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> cv.

To verify that the ripening-associated Sl<italic>-IAA3</italic> transcript accumulation was ethylene-dependent, the effect of exogenous ethylene was assessed on MG fruit that are responsive to exogenous ethylene but not yet producing elevated levels of ripening-associated ethylene, and, conversely, the effect of 1-MCP, a potent inhibitor of ethylene perception, on Br fruit producing elevated endogenous ethylene.

The possibility that the observed changes might result from a lack of specificity of the antisense strategy was ruled out by verifying that the expression of closely related <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> genes was not altered in the <italic>AS-IAA3</italic> transgenic lines. The sequence homology rule predicts that IAA3 antisense would primarily target IAA1, IAA4, and IAA17 among all members of the Aux/IAA gene family. However, none of the best potential Aux/IAA targets displayed detectable change in transcript accumulation in the <italic>AS-IAA3</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). Moreover, <italic>ARF2</italic> which showed down-regulation in the antisense lines displayed an extremely poor sequence match with <italic>IAA3</italic>. The present data strongly support the hypothesis that different members of the Aux/IAA family are involved in distinct developmental processes. This is also supported by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kloosterman <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> who showed that suppression of St<italic>-IAA2</italic> in potato results in distinctive phenotypes, including increased plant height, petiole hyponasty, and curvature of growing leaf primordia in the shoot apex.</p><sec><title>Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic> mediates auxin-dependent gene transcription and auxin-associated phenotypes</title><p><italic>Aux/IAA</italic> genes were originally identified based on their rapid induction by auxin in etiolated soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>) and pea (<italic>Pisum sativum</italic>) tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walker and Key, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Theologis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1985</xref>). Many <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> auxin-responsive genes contain the canonical auxin response elements (<italic>AuxRE</italic>), TGTCTC or GAGACA, in their promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guilfoyle and Hagen, 2007</xref>). The present <italic>in silico</italic> search led to the identification of two degenerate <italic>AuxRE</italic> elements in the Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic> promoter that may be responsible for the auxin responsiveness observed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).</p><p>Sl<italic>-IAA3</italic> transcript levels varied dramatically among the different tomato tissues, and analyses of tomato P<italic><sub>IAA3</sub></italic>::<italic>GUS</italic> lines revealed that basal levels of expression were spatially restricted within organs. In the root, Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic>-driven <italic>GUS</italic> expression was restricted to the root cap and lateral root meristems, in the leaves to the vasculature, and in the fruit to a narrow band defining the junction between placenta and pericarp. This well-defined tissue-specific expression pattern was abolished by exogenous auxin treatment leading to GUS staining throughout the whole fruit pericarp and leaf and root tissues. While the auxin responsiveness is in agreement with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jones <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), the expression pattern of Sl-IAA3 in the hook differed from that of the artificial auxin-responsive promoter, <italic>DR5</italic>, suggesting that a combination of promoter elements contributes to the precise tissue-specific pattern of Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic> expression. Because the expression of <italic>P<sub>IAA3</sub>::GUS</italic> and <italic>DR5::GUS</italic> gave similar staining in the root tips but not in the apical hook, the ethylene-induced expression of Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic> in the inner side of the apical hook cannot be ascribed to increased levels of auxin only. Nevertheless, auxin is also contributing to both the apical hook formation and the associated Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic> expression as suggested by the abolished hook and Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic> expression in NPA-treated seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8A</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> gain-of-function mutations that stabilize the <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reed, 2001</xref>) are, in most cases, associated with phenotypes reminiscent of reduced auxin responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nagpal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rogg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Since <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Aux/IAAs have been shown to repress <italic>DR5</italic>-driven transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ulmasov <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tiwari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), it was hypothesized that the down-regulation of Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic> would lead to enhanced auxin responses. Unexpectedly, the <italic>AS-IAA3</italic> lines have many phenotypes consistent with reduced auxin sensitivity. This suggests that, even though Sl-IAA3 has the capacity to repress auxin-responsive gene expression in protoplasts (see Fig. S2 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp009/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> available at <italic>JXB</italic> online), <italic>in planta</italic> the protein seems to act as a positive regulator of auxin responses. One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that <italic>in planta</italic> Sl-IAA3 may repress the expression of negative regulators of auxin responses. Two <italic>ARFs</italic> (<italic>ARF2</italic> and <italic>ARF8</italic>) and one <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> (<italic>IAA29</italic>) that were differentially regulated in the <italic>AS-IAA3</italic> lines, may contribute to the reduced auxin-responsiveness in <italic>AS-IAA3</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethylene-related expression and phenotypes</title><p>It has been shown previously that the accumulation of Sl<italic>-IAA3</italic> transcripts is enhanced by ethylene treatment in MG fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jones <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In the present work, it was shown that Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic> transcript accumulation mimicked both the dose-response and the time-course gradient of the well-characterized ethylene-responsive gene, <italic>E8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lincoln <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>). Importantly, Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic> had an ethylene-dependent, ripening-associated expression pattern that was revealed by a sharp reduction in Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic> transcripts when Br fruit were treated with the ethylene inhibitor, 1-MCP. Moreover, accumulation of Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic> transcripts was dramatically reduced in the tomato ripening mutants (<italic>rin</italic>, <italic>nor</italic>, and <italic>Nr</italic>) that lack the capacity to respond to autocatalytic ethylene and to undergo normal ethylene-regulated ripening processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Giovannoni, 2007</xref>). Given that SI-IAA3 is a presumptive auxin response regulator, these results strongly suggest that one of the roles for ethylene during climacteric fruit ripening is the modification of auxin responsiveness in the ripening fruit. Whereas these observations suggested that down-regulation of Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic> in transgenic lines may have resulted in a fruit ripening phenotype, none of the ripening features examined in the present study differed between antisense and wild-type lines (timing of the onset of ripening, levels of climacteric ethylene production, and pigment accumulation). Though it cannot be excluded that other ripening aspects may have been altered, the present data suggest that either the Sl-IAA3 is functionally redundant in fruit tissues or that residual levels of Sl-IAA3 were sufficient to drive the ripening processes that rely on the IAA3 protein.</p><p>Two other phenotypes in the <italic>AS-IAA3</italic> lines, the exaggerated apical hook formation and reduced epinasty, indicated that Sl-IAA3 is important for physiological responses involving ethylene. Apical hook formation in etiolated seedlings forms the classical ethylene triple response together with reduced hypocotyl and root elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bleecker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ecker, 1995</xref>). The involvement of both ethylene and auxin in this differential cell elongation has been demonstrated through the analysis of ethylene- and auxin-signalling mutants that are altered in the process of hook formation. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, mutants that are defective in ethylene perception and signalling, such as <italic>etr1-1</italic>, <italic>ein2</italic>, and <italic>ein3</italic>, do not form an exaggerated hook in response to ethylene treatment. By contrast, the constitutive ethylene response mutant, <italic>ctr1</italic>, develops an exaggerated hook in the absence of ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guzman and Ecker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kieber <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). Auxin promotes hypocotyl cell elongation and is unequally distributed in the apical hook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schwark and Schierle, 1992</xref>). The <italic>axr1</italic> mutant, which is altered in auxin responses, lacks a normal apical hook and the inhibition of auxin transport disrupts formation of the hook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lincoln <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>). Clearly, the apical hook is established and maintained by interplay between ethylene and auxin. The exaggerated apical hook phenotype in the <italic>AS-IAA3</italic> lines provides direct evidence that Sl-IAA3 is important in physiological processes that rely on both auxin and ethylene. Active ethylene signalling is essential for the appearance of the exaggerated hook phenotype since blocking ethylene perception with 1-MCP prevents hook formation in the <italic>AS-IAA3</italic> plants. The other aspects of the triple response, namely exaggerated hypocotyl elongation and the thickening and shortening of roots, were not altered in the <italic>AS-IAA3</italic> lines, indicating that Sl-IAA3 is specifically involved in differential growth processes. Ethylene treatment of etiolated seedlings increased the P<sub>IAA3</sub>::<italic>GUS</italic> expression in the inner surface of the apical hook (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). Likewise, P<sub>IAA3</sub>::<italic>GUS</italic> staining was also clearly delimited in epinastic petioles, suggesting that the ethylene-induced gradient of Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic> expression is involved in the differential growth associated with both apical hook formation and the petiole epinastic response. However, whereas down-regulation of Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic> resulted in an exaggerated ethylene-response of etiolated seedlings, it conferred reduced ethylene sensitivity in light-grown plants. The ability of ethylene to induce opposite growth responses in the dark and in the light have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smalle <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>) and could explain the seemingly contradictory phenotypes displayed by <italic>AS-IAA3</italic> plants in the seedlings and petioles. In keeping with this complex regulation of Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic>, the ethylene-induced expression of this gene in light-grown plants was found in the upper side of epinastic petioles, opposite to the pattern observed in the hook of etiolated seedlings.</p><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants with a loss-of-function mutation in <italic>HLS1</italic> are unable to form an apical hook even in the presence of ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lehman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). A mutation that reverses the <italic>hls1</italic> phenotype has been identified and was found to encode the auxin-response factor, <italic>ARF2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, the putative tomato orthologue of <italic>ARF2</italic> is also down-regulated in the <italic>AS-IAA3</italic> lines, suggesting that the process of hook formation may require an interplay between HLS1, IAA3, and ARF2. The previous model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> postulates that ARF2 acts downstream of HLS1. It was shown here that the expression of Sl-<italic>HLS</italic> is not altered in the <italic>AS-IAA3</italic> plants, suggesting that Sl-IAA3 and Sl-HLS may act in parallel pathways both of them involving ARF2 as a downstream component. On the other hand, it cannot be ruled out that Sl-<italic>HLS</italic> may also act upstream of Sl-<italic>IAA3</italic>.</p><p>The altered apical dominance found in the <italic>AS-IAA3</italic> lines was also observed in the previously described antisense Sl-<italic>IAA9</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Unlike Sl-IAA9, however, Sl-IAA3 has distinct roles in ethylene-related responses. By revealing that a number of transcription factors from the ARF (Sl-<italic>ARF2</italic> and Sl-<italic>ARF8</italic>), Aux/IAA (Sl-<italic>IAA29</italic>), and ERF (<italic>Ethylene Response Factor Pti4</italic>) families are under direct or indirect regulation by Sl-IAA3, the present study provides insights into how SI-IAA3 functions to bring about some of the observed phenotypes. While continued effort is required to gain a more complete understanding of the hormonal dialogue mediated by Sl-IAA3, the data described here confirm that Aux/IAA proteins have both distinct and overlapping roles and reveal that these proteins can be integral auxin as well as ethylene response regulators.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp009/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>.</bold> Percentage identity of the antisense region relative to the other members of tomato <italic>Aux/IAAs</italic> family.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp009/DC1">Table S2</ext-link>.</bold> Auxin- and ethylene-response genes.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp009/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>.</bold> Subcellular localization of Sl-IAA3 protein.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp009/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>.</bold> Sl-IAA3 protein represses the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of <italic>DR5</italic>.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp009/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>.</bold> Ethylene regulation of Sl<italic>-IAA3</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="erp009_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="erp009_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work forms part of the requirement for the degree of Ph.D. for S Chaabouni.
