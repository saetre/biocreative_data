Elg1, which forms an alternative RFC-like complex with RFC2-5, is required for the maintenance of genome stability in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> and its function has been linked to DNA replication or damage checkpoint response. Here, we show that Elg1 is involved in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DSB repair. Mutants of <italic>elg1</italic> were partially defective in HR induced by methylmethanesufonate (MMS) and phleomycin. Deletion of <italic>ELG1</italic> resulted in less efficient repair of phleomycin-induced DSBs in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase-arrested cells. During HR between <italic>MAT</italic> and <italic>HML</italic> loci, Elg1 associated with both the <italic>MAT</italic> locus near the HO endonuclease-induced DSB site, and the <italic>HML</italic> homologous donor locus. The association of Elg1 with the <italic>MAT</italic> locus was not dependent on Rad52. However, Elg1 association with the <italic>HML</italic> locus depended on Rad52. Importantly, we found that two of the later steps in HR-mediated repair of an HO endonuclease-induced DSB, primer extension after strand invasion and ligation, were less efficient in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants. Our results suggest that Elg1 is involved in DSB repair by HR.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Many overlapping mechanisms of genome surveillance and DNA repair reside in eukaryotic cells to ensure genome stability. Genomic instability, which occurs in normal cells at a low rate, is enhanced in cancer cells. Among the signs of genome instability observed in many cancer cells are elevated mutation rates, and gross chromosomal rearrangements, such as deletions and translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). The yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a simple eukaryote, is a useful model system for studying genome stability, because the basic repair pathways in yeast, and the regulatory mechanisms that control them, are well conserved across species. Elg1 (enhanced level of genome instability) was identified in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> as a genome stabilizer, and its human counterpart has also been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Elg1 exhibits sequence similarity to one of the five subunits of the replication factor C (RFC) complex, Rfc1, and replaces this subunit in the RFC complex. For this reason, Elg1-containing RFCs are called alternative RFCs.</p><p>RFC was originally identified as a protein complex required for SV40 DNA replication <italic>in vitro</italic>, and consists of five different subunits (RFC1-5 in humans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). During DNA replication, the classical RFC complex recognizes primer termini, and catalyzes loading of the sliding clamp, which includes proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), onto the DNA, not RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). PCNA remains associated with the DNA, and acts as a processivity factor for DNA polymerase &#x003b4; on either the lagging and/or leading DNA strand. At least three alternative forms of the RFC, including the Elg1-containing complex, have been identified recently in yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). The Rad24&#x02013;Rfc2-5 complex, in which Rfc1 is replaced by Rad24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), loads a PCNA-like heterotrimer clamp, consisting of Rad17, Ddc1 and Mec3, onto the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Both the Rad24/Rfc2-5 clamp loader and the Rad17/Ddc1/Mec3 clamp are required for activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>, and contribute to S phase checkpoint regulation. A third Rfc1-like protein, Ctf18, replaces Rfc1 the Ctf18&#x02013;Rfc2-5 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Ctf18/Rfc2-5 contains two additional subunits, Ctf8 and Dcc1, and mutations in any of these three proteins, <italic>ctf18</italic>, <italic>ctf8</italic>, or <italic>dcc1</italic>, results in defects in sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), the process by which newly replicated chromatids remain physically associated until entry into anaphase. Moreover, <italic>ctf18 rad24</italic> double mutants have a mild S-M checkpoint defect that is not evident in either single mutant, and have a defect in Rad53 phosphorylation, a hallmark of the DNA damage response, indicating that Ctf18 also contributes to the S phase checkpoint response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>in vitro</italic>, the Ctf18/Rfc2-5 complex can catalyze the loading and unloading of PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), however the biological significance of this activity is not well understood.</p><p>The Elg1&#x02013;Rfc2-5 complex was recently identified as a member of the group of alternative RFCs in yeast and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Elg1/Rfc2-5 interacts with PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), but the PCNA-clamp loading activity of Elg1/Rfc2-5 has not been demonstrated. In the absence of <italic>ELG1</italic>, increased rates of spontaneous recombination were observed during vegetative growth in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Allelic and ectopic intra and interchromosomal recombination, as well as recombination between sister chromatids, were elevated in this mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). A high rate of chromosomal loss, transposition and mutation, and elevated levels of gross chromosomal rearrangements were also detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). In addition, mutations in <italic>ELG1</italic> resulted in elongation of telomeres, and increased silencing of subtelomeric genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Mutants of <italic>elg1</italic> are sensitive to methylmethanesufonate (MMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). In an <italic>elg1 ctf18 rad24</italic> triple mutant, MMS-induced Rad53 phosphorylation was completely abolished, whereas it was intact in the <italic>elg1</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Thus, it seems likely that Elg1 is also involved in DNA repair; however this has yet to be confirmed.</p><p>One of the most dangerous DNA lesions is the DSB, which can be caused by ionizing radiation, or result from replication over single-strand breaks. When unrepaired, a DSB can cause permanent cell cycle arrest, and ultimately cell death. Several distinct mechanisms exist for the repair of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Accurate restoration of DNA broken ends can be achieved by HR, provided that homologous sequences are present elsewhere in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). In budding yeast, HR depends on the recombination factors Rad52&#x02013;Rad51, which initiate the search for homologous sequences. Alternatively, a DSB can be repaired by direct ligation in a process termed non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). With some exceptions, NHEJ is mediated by the Ku heterodimer, which binds to double-stranded DNA ends and facilitates ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we demonstrated that the repair of DSBs induced by phleomycin is inefficient in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants. We also showed that in contrast to the high incidence of spontaneous recombination in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants, the absence of Elg1 did not result in an increase in the incidence of damage-induced recombination. Our results suggest that Elg1 functions in one or more of the steps of recombination repair itself. The implications of Elg1 function in homologous recombination (HR) will be discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1.

Agarose plugs containing chromosomal DNA were prepared as described previously, with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). All plugs were subsequently treated with Zymolyase 100T (0.15 mg/ml) and Proteinase K (1 mg/ml) at 30&#x000b0;C for 24 h.

WCEs were mixed with an equal volume of EBX buffer and incubated for 10 min. WCEs were then centrifuged through a sucrose cushion, and the resulting pellet was examined by immunoblot analysis for the presence of Elg1-13Myc. Histone H3 was used as a loading control for protein levels in WCEs and chromatin pellet (ChP) fractions.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)</title><p>ChIP was carried out as described previously, with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Briefly, asynchronous cultures were grown overnight at 30&#x000b0;C in YP medium containing 2% raffinose. Nocodazole (15 &#x003bc;g/ml) was added to the cultures when they reached 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml, and they were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for 5 h to induce G<sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest. Expression of HO endonuclease was then induced by adding 2% galactose. The cultures were washed 1 h after the addition of galactose, and then treated with 2% glucose to repress the expression of HO endonuclease. Cells were harvested, and incubated in 1% formaldehyde for 15 min to cross-link proteins to DNA, then the reaction was quenched by incubating cells in 125 mM glycine for 5 min. Cells were lysed with glass beads, and extracts were sonicated to shear DNA to an average size of 1 kb. Extracts were then divided into two aliquots: Input DNA and IP DNA (1:20, respectively). Immunoprecipitation was carried out using a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5) (Roche), or a polyclonal anti-PCNA antibody (kind gift from Dr Sugino), and immune complexes were captured using Dynabeads Protein G (Dynal Biotech) for 4 h at 4&#x000b0;C. After a series of washes, proteins were released from the beads by incubation for 6 h at 65&#x000b0;C. The samples were treated with protenase K, and DNA was purified for PCR analysis using phenol extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation.</p></sec><sec><title>PCR amplification</title><p>The following primers were used to amplify immunoprecipitated DNA: P1 (5&#x02032;-TCCCCATCGTCTTGCTCT-3&#x02032;) and P2 (5&#x02032;-GCATGGGCAGTTTACCTTTAC-3&#x02032;), which span the <italic>MATZ</italic> locus; P1 and P3 (5&#x02032;-CCCAAGGCTTAGTATACACATCC-3&#x02032;), which span the <italic>HML</italic>&#x003b1; locus; or HO1-FW1 (5&#x02032;-CCAGATTTGTATTAGACGAGGGACGGAGTGA-3&#x02032;) and HO1-RV1 (5&#x02032;-AGAGGGTCACAGCACTAATACAGCTCGTAAT-3&#x02032;), which span the 2 kb region upstream of the HO endonuclease-induced DSB site.

These results suggested that Elg1 might also function in DNA repair. We extended this analysis by examining the sensitivity of the <italic>elg1</italic> single mutant to phleomycin as well as to MMS and HU. Phleomycin, like bleomycin, creates DNA DSBs, but in budding yeast, causes more significant DNA lesions than bleomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). In addition to previously reported data that <italic>elg1</italic> mutants were sensitive to MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), we further found that <italic>elg1</italic> mutants were also sensitive to phleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To further examine whether Elg1 binds to sites of DNA damage under conditions that preclude any potential interference of the DNA replication-related functions of Elg1, we analyzed the association of Elg1 with chromatin in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase-arrested cells after the induction of DNA damage by MMS and pleomycin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the amount of Elg1 in chromatin-containing fractions notably increased following exposure of cells to MMS or phleomycin, indicating that Elg1 functions in response to damaged DNA by binding to sites of DNA damage.</p></sec><sec><title>Elg1 is required for phleomycin-induced DSB repair in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase-arrested cells</title><p>We investigate whether Elg1 is involved in DSB repair, because we notably found that <italic>elg1</italic> mutants are sensitive to phleomycin, which creates DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). On the other hands, deletion of <italic>ELG1</italic> causes defects in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), and the replication defects in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants could potentially cause sequestration of recombination machinery components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). To avoid the potential influence of DNA replication-specific defects in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants, we examined the function of Elg1 in the repair of DSBs induced by phleomycin in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase-arrested cells. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>elg1</italic> cells arrested in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase showed a higher sensitivity to phleomycin than wild-type cells; however this result does not necessarily exclude the possibility that <italic>elg1</italic> cells are sensitive to phleomycin in other phases of the cell cycle. To monitor the formation and subsequent repair of DSBs, cells arrested in G<sub>2</sub>/M were treated with phleomycin, and then cultured in phleomycin-free medium containing nocodazole to maintain G<sub>2</sub>/M arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Chromosomal DNA was isolated and subjected to PFGE. Distinct chromosomal bands were absent following exposure to phleomycin in both wild-type and <italic>elg1</italic> cells, and concurrently, a low-molecular-weight DNA smear appeared, reflecting the accumulation of DNA DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Restoration of chromosome-sized DNA bands was observed in both wild-type and <italic>elg1</italic> mutants after culture in phleomycin-free medium. However, the reappearance of distinct chromosomal bands was less efficient in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants compared to wild-type cells. These results suggested that Elg1 is involved in DSB repair.</p></sec><sec><title>Elg1 is required for HR repair</title><p>DSBs can be repaired by the NHEJ pathway, which requires Yku70, or the HR pathway, which requires Rad52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). We next examined whether Elg1 was required for NHEJ-mediated or HR-mediated repair. To examine the involvement of Elg1 in NHEJ, single chromosomal DSB was induced in the <italic>MAT</italic> locus by expressing HO endonuclease in a galactose-dependent manner, in an <italic>elg1</italic> mutant strain in which use of the HR-mediated repair pathway was precluded, due to deletion of the homologous donor loci, <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Sustained expression of HO endonuclease leads to a continuous cycle of DNA cleavage and ligation. If cells are competent for error-prone repair by NHEJ, they will be able to grow in the presence of HO endonuclease, while cells deficient in NHEJ will not survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>).

In contrast, the viability of <italic>yku70</italic> mutants was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results indicated that Elg1 is not important for DSB repair by NHEJ.</p><p>To examine the involvement of Elg1 in HR, we investigated for an interchromosomal recombination event between heteroalleles <italic>his1-1/his1-7</italic>, using diploid <italic>elg1</italic> single mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We observed an increase in spontaneous recombination in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The incidence of heteroallelic recombination in wild-type cells increased with increasing concentrations of MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In comparison, the recombination frequency in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants was lower than that of wild-type cells. Moreover, the recombination frequency following exposure to phleomycin was also lower in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results suggested that Elg1 is required for efficient execution of damage-induced HR.</p></sec><sec><title>Elg1 association around DSB sites did not depend on Rad52</title><p>To characterize the sites of association of Elg1 in detail, we examined Elg1 recruitment to a single chromosomal DSB site in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase-arrested cells. Initially, we examined the kinetics of Elg1 recruitment to DNA sequences on both sides of the DSB site using yeast strain JKM179, which lacks both the <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> homologous donor sequences, in order to more easily capture the initial binding of proteins to the DSB site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A DSB in the <italic>MAT</italic> locus was induced by expression of HO endonuclease in JKM179 yeast expressing Myc-tagged Elg1 (Elg1-13Myc), and at various time points after induction (0, 1, 2 and 4 h), cell aliquots were removed and treated with formaldehyde to induce crosslinking of proteins to DNA, then subjected to ChIP analysis. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR for the presence of <italic>MAT</italic>-specific sequences from both sides of the DSB (CEN-proximal site, HO1; CEN-distal site, MATZ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). PCR primers corresponding to sequences in the <italic>SMC2</italic> locus (an independent locus on chromosome VI) were used as a control. Since the immunoprecipitation efficiency at each amplicon was different, amplified products were normalized to the zero time point value (Normalized IP). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, following induction of HO endonuclease expression, the DSB at the <italic>MAT</italic> locus was induced rapidly and efficiently. Remarkably, binding of Elg1 to DNA sequences on both sides of the DSB break site increased 2-fold after induction of HO endonuclease expression and DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). We also examined whether the binding of Elg1 around the DSB site was dependent on Rad52, which plays a major role during HR. The induction of DSB occurred in a similar manner in <italic>rad52</italic> mutants and wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Importantly, we found that the association of Elg1 with the MATZ and HO1 sites was not dependent on Rad52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Elg1 is recruited to homologous donor sites depending on Rad52</title><p>HR-mediated chromosomal DSB repair is a multiple-step process that includes recruitment of DNA repair enzymes to the DSB site, strand invasion by a homologous template, DNA synthesis, resolution of Holliday junctions and ligation. One of the best characterized systems for studying HR is HO endonuclease-induced <italic>MAT</italic> switching, using <italic>HML</italic> as the donor template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). In this system, repair of the HO endonuclease-induced DSB in the <italic>MAT</italic>a locus is accomplished through recombination with the homologous <italic>HML</italic>&#x003b1; locus. We investigated DSB repair by HR in wild-type and <italic>rad52</italic> mutants, using strain JKM161, which contains <italic>HML</italic>&#x003b1; <italic>MAT</italic>a as the donor template. By using a galactose-inducible <italic>GAL::HO</italic> gene, we were able to induce a DSB synchronously in all cells of the population. DSB formation at the HO recognition site and invasion of the <italic>MAT</italic> recipient strand into the donor strand (<italic>HML</italic>) were monitored by PCR using the primers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. The amount of PCR product corresponding to the <italic>MAT</italic>a locus was considerably decreased 1 h after induction of HO endonuclease in wild-type cells and <italic>rad52</italic> mutants; that is, cleavage at the <italic>MAT</italic> locus occurred within 1 h with high-efficiency. Strand invasion was detected 2 and 4 h after induction of HO in wild-type cells but not in <italic>rad52</italic> mutants, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>To examine whether Elg1 was recruited to both the <italic>MAT</italic> recipient locus and the <italic>HML</italic> donor locus during the process of recombination, we performed ChIP analysis using the primers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. Under the conditions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the association of Elg1 with the DSB site in the <italic>MAT</italic> locus was observed 1 h after induction of HO endonuclease in wild-type cells and <italic>rad52</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Importantly, the association of Elg1 with the <italic>HML</italic> donor strand was also observed and increased during incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). However, the association of Elg1 with the <italic>HML</italic> donor strand was not observed in <italic>rad52</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that Elg1 is recruited to DNA region required for HR repair.</p></sec><sec><title>Late stages of HR repair are inefficiently completed in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants</title><p>We next examined whether Elg1 was necessary for extension of the invading <italic>MAT</italic> DNA strand of the homologous <italic>HML</italic>&#x003b1; donor site, a step which requires DNA polymerization. DSB formation at the HO recognition site, primer extension following strand invasion on the donor strand and completion of repair (ligation) were monitored by PCR, using the primers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. Formation of a DSB occurred with the same kinetics in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants and wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, extension of the invading DNA strand was slightly reduced in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants, compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; left panel). Following strand invasion and resolution of Holliday junctions, the process of recombination repair is completed by DNA ligation. We monitored the completion of repair following extension of the invading DNA strand in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants. In <italic>elg1</italic> mutants, the completion of the late stage, post-synaptic DNA repair step was slightly delayed and reduced compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; right panel).</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of Elg1 on the recruitment of PCNA to the <italic>MAT</italic> recipient locus and the homologous <italic>HML</italic>&#x003b1; donor site</title><p>Elg1 and PCNA physically interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Moreover, over-expression of PCNA rescued the MMS sensitivity of <italic>elg1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Mutation of PCNA (<italic>POL30</italic>) results in a defect in primer extension during HO-induced HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), suggesting that Elg1 is required for loading of PCNA during recombination repair. We observed that the amount of PCNA, as well as Elg1, in chromatin-containing fractions notably increased following exposure to MMS or phleomycin (data not shown). To examine whether PCNA was recruited to the <italic>MAT</italic> recipient and the <italic>HML</italic> donor loci during the process of recombination, we performed ChIP analysis using the primers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. The association of PCNA with the <italic>MAT</italic> recipient and the <italic>HML</italic> donor loci was observed in both <italic>elg1</italic> mutants and wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Unexpectedly, the level of association of PCNA with these loci was almost the same in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants and wild-type cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the current study, we examined the role of Elg1 in the DNA damage response in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. Previous reports have suggested that Elg1 might function as a checkpoint sensor, similar to the RFC-like checkpoint protein Rad24, because <italic>elg1 rad24 ctf18</italic> triple mutants, which do not contain alternative RFC-like proteins, are completely defective in intra-S checkpoint control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Although the <italic>elg1</italic> single mutant is sensitive to DNA damaging agents, it is reportedly not defective in the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>The main finding of this study is that the Rfc1-like protein Elg1 participates in DNA damage-induced recombination repair itself. It was previously shown that deletion of <italic>ELG1</italic> increases the incidence of spontaneous recombination in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Previous studies have shown that an elevated frequency of mitotic recombination is a signal of DNA replication defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>), and it has been proposed that Elg1 is involved in efficient lagging strand DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Accordingly, one of the potential explanations for the observed spontaneous hyper-recombination of <italic>elg1</italic> mutants is that these cells are defective in DNA replication. In contrast to spontaneous recombination, we found that the frequency of MMS- or phleomycin-induced recombination was decreased in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>To avoid potential complications due to defects in DNA replication in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants, we examined the function of Elg1 in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase-arrested cells. We showed that the repair efficiency of phleomycin-induced DSB in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants was lower than wild-type cells in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the HO endonuclease-induced recombination system, Elg1 associated with both sides of the HO-induced DSB site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that Elg1 plays a role in early events in HR or the damage response. In response to DSBs, the MRX complex, a heterotrimeric protein assembly of Mre11, Rad50 and Xrs2, arrives first at DSB sites and performs nucleolytic resection to generate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This is essential for subsequent protein assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). ssDNA is recognized by the ssDNA binding protein RPA, and the DNA damage checkpoint factors, Rad24-RFC and Ddc1/Mec3/Rad17, are recruited in RPA-dependent manner. Lastly, the proteins that are directly involved in HR are recruited to the DSB site. The assembly of HR proteins on ssDNA is initiated by Rad52, which in turn causes strand invasion. We found that the association of Elg1 with DSB sites was not dependent on Rad52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Importantly, we found that Elg1 is also recruited to the <italic>HML</italic> donor locus, and that this was dependent on the function of Rad52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that Elg1 functions in HR after strand invasion has occurred. Alternatively, it may not be the donor locus <italic>per se</italic> that is associated with Elg1. In other words, the donor locus may only engage in preferential interaction with Elg1 when it has already formed a Holliday junction with the invading end. Thus, the interaction between Elg1 and the donor locus is probably a consequence of the complex that originally formed at the double-stranded break.</p><p>The <italic>MAT</italic> switching system provides a good model for DSB repair based on synthesis dependent strand annealing (SDSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). In this system, DNA synthesis is initiated from the end of the invading strand, as in leading-strand synthesis. The newly synthesized DNA is displaced from the template (<italic>MATY</italic>&#x003b1; region), returned to the original strand, and ligated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). After the removal of the non-homologous region (<italic>MATY</italic><bold>a</bold>) at the DSB site by probably Rad1-Rad10 and Msh2-Msh3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>), DNA synthesis is initiated from the second end of the DSB using the returning strand as the template, as in leading-strand synthesis, followed by ligation to form an intact double-strand. Of note, mutation of either RFC (<italic>CDC44</italic>) or PCNA (<italic>POL30</italic>) results in a defect in primer extension during HO-induced HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), suggesting that the RFC1 complex is required for loading of PCNA during DNA repair as well. It has been shown that Elg1 and PCNA physically interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Moreover, over-expression of PCNA rescued the MMS sensitivity of <italic>elg1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). In the current study, we show that <italic>elg1</italic> mutants are partially defective in MMS-induced recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), and Elg1 is also recruited to the homologous donor locus depending on Rad52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Recombination assay showed 2- to 4-fold reduction of MMS- or phleomycin-induced recombination frequency in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). In addition, we carried out PCR-based analysis of the efficiency of primer extension from the invaded strand, and ligation of the synthesized strand after induction of HO-induced DSB. The efficiency of primer extension and ligation of the synthesized strand slightly decreases in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). It seems likely that the defect in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants lies at the primer extension step or a step earlier than primer extension. Although it is unknown how Elg1 is recruited onto the donor sites at the molecular level, the interaction of Elg1 with the donor sites seems to facilitate the above steps in HR via PCNA-mediated DNA synthesis. Then we investigated the association of PCNA with the <italic>HML</italic> locus as well as the <italic>MATZ</italic> locus after induction of DSB by HO endonuclease, and confirmed the association of PCNA with these loci. Unexpectedly, the amount of PCNA associated these loci did not differ between <italic>elg1</italic> mutants and wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that Elg1 might be not involved in the loading of PCNA during HR. The defect in HO-induced HR repair in <italic>elg1</italic> mutants was relatively mild compared to that observed in phleomycin-induced HR. This may reflect the fact that the total number of DSBs induced by phleomycin is quite large, compared to the single DSB induced by HO endonuclease expression. Thus, we could not exclude the possibility that the sensitivity of ChIP assay was too low to detect the small difference between <italic>elg1</italic> mutants and wild-type cells due to main requirement of canonical RFC for the loading of PCNA.</p><p>If Elg1 is not involved in the loading of PCNA, what is the function of Elg1 in HR? It has been reported that mutants of DNA polymerase &#x003b4; (Pol3) and &#x0025b; (Pol2), <italic>pol3-14</italic> and <italic>pol2-18</italic>, show a mild defect in HR repair, while the PCNA mutants (<italic>pol30-52</italic>) are completely defective in HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Taken together, it seems conceivable that Elg1 plays a role in the efficient recruitment of either DNA polymerase &#x003b4; or &#x0025b;, directly or indirectly, by interacting with PCNA, or in choosing or switching to the optimum DNA polymerase for repair synthesis.</p><p>It has been reported that <italic>sgs1</italic> cells, which show spontaneous hyper-recombination, are defective in damage-induced recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). Thus, it is not surprising that <italic>elg1</italic> cells show not only spontaneous hyper-recombination but an apparent damage-induced hypo-recombination. Spontaneous hyper-recombination is one of the hallmarks of a defect in DNA replication, because many temperature sensitive mutants in DNA replication show hyper-recombination phenotypes. In agreement with the above notion, <italic>elg1</italic> cells show some defects in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). The classical RFC complex (without Elg1) is probably adequate for the mediation of the protein interactions required for the DNA repair process during normal growth (low level of DNA damage). However, upon induction of massive DNA damage, the classical RFC complex probably cannot accommodate any longer the full cellular demand for DNA repair. Thus, Elg1 is more important under damage-induced conditions than during normal cell growth. Even small defects in genome maintenance mechanisms should not be dismissed, however, as they may exert a significant influence on the fitness of an organism. Thus, <italic>ELG1</italic> is an attractive candidate as a novel anti-oncogene, as its deletion seems to result in significant genome instability, which is associated with an increased risk for cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Drs A.

A galactose-inducible HO endonuclease was integrated at the <italic>ADE3</italic> locus of a haploid yeast strain that was defective in HR-mediated DSB repair. Upon switching the cells to galactose, HO endonuclease is expressed, inducing a single DSB at the <italic>MAT</italic> locus.
