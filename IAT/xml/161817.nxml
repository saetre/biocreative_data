Proteins are targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation by attachment of a polyubiquitin chain. The addition of a polyubiquitin chain to a protein requires the sequential action of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. E3 activities are thought to be essential because they are involved in substrate recognition. SCF complexes are E3s composed of the Cullin family member Cul1 (Cdc53 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), as well as, Skp1, Roc1 (also called Rbx1 or Hrt1) and one of the numerous F-box proteins that act as a receptor for the substrate (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]).</p><p>The founding member of the SCF family, SCF<sup>Cdc4</sup>, was identified through genetic analysis of the G1/S transition in budding yeast and served as a model for the study of other SCF complexes. Mutations in the E2 enzyme Cdc34 or in any of the SCF<sup>Cdc4 </sup>components (Cdc53/Cul1, Skp1 and Cdc4) arrest cells at the G1/S transition because of a failure to degrade the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor Sic1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In a wild-type situation, G1 cyclin/CDK complexes phosphorylate Sic1 at the end of G1. This leads to Cdc34-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of Sic1. Phosphorylated Sic1, but not the unmodified protein, is recruited to the SCF complex by binding to the WD domain of Cdc4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The F-box motif of Cdc4 binds Skp1 so that the F-box protein acts as a bridge between substrate and the SCF complex. Cdc53 forms the core of the complex by binding Skp1, Roc1 and Cdc34. The Cdc53/Roc1 subcomplex stimulates the ubiquitination activity of Cdc34 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Upon association with the complex, Sic1 is extensively ubiquitinated and then degraded by the proteasome. While mutations in the <italic>CDC53 </italic>gene of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>eliminate SCF activity toward its many diverse targets, the phenotype is nonetheless specific. Presumably, arrest at the G1/S transition is a result of the thresholds and kinetics of action of the various substrates, which imparts special importance to the targeting of Sic1 for degradation. Mutations in the <italic>C. elegans </italic>ortholog <italic>Cul1 </italic>lead to increased cell number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] showing that in this organism a different aspect of cell cycle regulation is controlled in a Cul1 dependent fashion. It has been inferred that a deficit in Cul1 function results in defects in turn-over of specific proteins and that the phenotype varies between systems because of differences in the spectrum of proteins affected and differences in the importance of the targeted proteins.</p><p>The transcription factor E2F is an important regulator of the G1/S phase transition in metazoans and a major target of the tumor suppressor Rb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The mechanisms controlling E2F activity have not been completely elucidated. E2F is activated toward the end of G1 and it functions to promote S phase. Nonetheless, E2F is inactivated and/or downregulated upon progression to S phase, a regulatory feature that appears critical as E2F overexpression or ectopic activation induces apoptosis both in mammalian cells and in flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Inactivation of the DNA-binding activity of E2F-1 by the cyclin A/Cdk complex has been shown to be critical for proper S phase progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In mammalian cells, E2F-1 is also subject to proteasome-mediated degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and recent evidence indicates that E2F-1 degradation occurs in S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Control of E2F-1 stability has also been linked to its association with the F-box protein Skp2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] but this has not been tied to a specific phase of the cell cycle. In addition, Skp2 knock-out cells do not accumulate E2F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and an E2F mutant unable to bind Skp2 is still ubiquitinated and unstable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, the basis of S phase destruction of E2F-1 remains unresolved. Analysis of E2F levels in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>eye disc showed a disappearance of E2F staining in the S phase cells of the morphogenetic furrow, suggesting conservation of the S phase destruction of this regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>To explore potential roles for Cul1 in cell cycle control in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, we overexpressed mouse Cul1 (mCul1) in the wing imaginal disc and found that this overexpression has a dominant negative effect leading to a reduction in SCF function. A screen for modifiers of the resulting small wing phenotype identified E2F as a putative target of SCF action. Further analysis of genetic interactions implicated the SCF<sup>Slimb </sup>complex as a regulator of E2F function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Mouse Cul1 overexpression in <italic>Drosophila </italic>leads to reduced SCF function</title><p>Since genes encoding highly conserved activites often function across species boundaries, we attempted to evaluate mouse Cul1 (mCul1) function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. To this end, we used a GAL4 transgene to drive overexpression of mCul1 in the wing disc. <italic>MS1096 </italic>is an X-linked transgene that expresses GAL4 strongly on the dorsal surface and more weakly on the ventral surface of the wing primordium in third instar larval wing imaginal discs. Because of dosage compensation, GAL4 levels in males (<italic>MS1096/Y</italic>) are twice those in heterozygous females (<italic>MS1096/+</italic>). In males (<italic>MS1096/Y;UAS-mCul1/+</italic>), mCul1 overexpression led to a strong reduction in the size of the wing without any gross patterning defects (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,1B</xref>). Females (<italic>MS1096/+;UAS-mCul1/+</italic>) displayed a weaker phenotype that was sometimes indistinguishable from wild-type (see fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In males, further increasing expression by using two copies of the UAS-mCul1 transgene reduces the wing to a rudimentary stump (not shown). The reduced wings also occasionally showed a multiple wing hair phenotype in which several trichomes instead of just one were produced by individual intervein cells, particularly in the region near the anterior cross-vein. Introduction of a single mutant copy of the <italic>Cul1</italic><sup><italic>k</italic>01207 </sup>allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] or a deficiency that uncovers <italic>Cul1 </italic>(<italic>Df(2R)NCX8</italic>) dominantly enhanced the wing reduction (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In contrast, decreasing the level of endogenous <italic>Cul3</italic>/<italic>guftagu </italic>(another Cullin family member, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/"/>) or expressing a GFP marker had no effect.

The small wing phenotype seen in flies overexpressing mCul1 was enhanced when flies also had a deficiency uncovering this region (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,2B</xref>), while coexpression of dSkpA rescued the wing phenotypes (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C,2D</xref>). These results show that SCF function limits the mCul1 overexpression phenotype.</p><p>Cul1 and SCF function are required for proteasome-dependent degradation of a number of proteins in other organisms. We thus tested whether reduction in proteasome function would modify the phenotype caused by mCul1 overexpression. The <italic>DTS5 </italic>and <italic>DTS7 </italic>alleles are mutations in the &#x003b2;6 and &#x003b2;2 subunits of the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Both mutations, which have antimorphic activity, acted dominantly to strongly enhance the small wing phenotype generated by mCul1 overexpression (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>) supporting the idea that the phenotype is due to reduced degradation of an SCF substrate.</p><p>To directly assess Cul1 function, we sought a target protein whose destruction might be limited by the activity of the Cul1/proteasome pathway. While SCF triggers ubiquitination and proteasome action degrades many substrates to completion, a few targets are instead cleaved and partially degraded. This is true of the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci): it is cleaved and its C-terminal portion is degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Cleavage and degradation require phosphorylation, SCF<sup>Slmb</sup>, and proteasomal activity. While complete inactivation of SCF<sup>Slmb </sup>causes cell death, it was shown that a cell-viable hypomorphic <italic>slimb </italic>allele resulted in accumulation of unprocessed Ci. Based on this, and findings that Ci accumulation is especially sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome (data not shown), it appears that Ci levels are particularly sensitive to partial reduction in the activity of the SCF/proteasome pathway of protein processing/degradation. Inhibition of Ci processing can be scored by the accumulation of a C-terminal epitope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This assay showed that reduction in the function of Slimb or Roc1, two activities that contribute to SCF function, is associated with an increase in Ci staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Similarly, reduction of Cul1 function by mutation in Cul1 (data not shown and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]) or by overexpressing mCul1 (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>) led to Ci accumulation.</p><p>Together these results indicate that mCul1 overexpression leads to a Cul1 dominant negative action that reduces SCF function. Based on the strength of the phenotype and its enhancement by removal of an endogenous copy of Cul1, we infer that the mCul1 expression only partially suppresses Cul1 function to create a hypomorphic phenotype. We infer that the wing defect results from a reduction in the rate of degradation of one or more targets of SCF action.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduction in Cul1 function induces apoptosis</title><p>The reduction in wing size in mCul1 overexpressing flies could result from changes in cell size or cell number. Each cell of the wing blade produces a hair and hair density indicates cell density and hence cell size. Wing hair density was unchanged by mCul1 expression, even when there was a dramatic effect on wing size (62.6 &#x000b1; 3.0 cells/7950 &#x003bc;m<sup>2 </sup>for <italic>MS1096/Y</italic>; 60.8 &#x000b1; 2.3 cells/7950 &#x003bc;m<sup>2 </sup>for <italic>MS1096/Y;UAS-mCul1/+</italic>). This result suggests that mCul1 overexpression causes a reduction in cell number either by a coordinate reduction in cell growth and proliferation or by increasing cell death. To distinguish between these possibilities, we dissected wing imaginal discs from late third instar larvae and stained them for mitotic or apoptotic cells. Labelling with an anti-phospho-histone 3 antibody did not reveal any significant changes in the number of mitotic cells (not shown). However, acridine orange staining showed a large increase in cell death throughout the wing pouch when mCul1 was overexpressed (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,3B</xref>). Coexpression of baculovirus anti-apoptotic protein p35 rescued the reduction in wing size (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C,3D</xref>) indicating that mCul1 overexpression induces elevated apoptosis. mCul1-induced apoptosis was insensitive to the coexpression of dominant negative forms of p53 (not shown). p35 expression also suppressed the multiple wing hair phenotype indicating that this phenotype too requires apoptosis. As dead cells do not contribute to adult structures, this phenotype must be a secondary consequence of cell death. We conclude that limiting SCF function induces apoptosis. Note that this conclusion does not argue against a cell cycle role for SCF, as defects in cell cycle progression can trigger apoptosis.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Reduction in Cul1 function causes apoptosis. </bold>(A) Wild-type third instar wing discs stained with acridine orange show very little cell death.

Because SCF complexes have been implicated in cell cycle control in other organisms, we tested whether changing the dosage of cell cycle regulators dominantly modified the mCul1 overexpression phenotype. Reductions in the levels of a variety of cell cycle genes &#x02013; <italic>cyclin E</italic>, <italic>dacapo</italic>, <italic>roughex</italic>, <italic>DP</italic>, <italic>RBF</italic>, <italic>string</italic>, <italic>cyclin A</italic>, <italic>rca1</italic>, <italic>wee1 </italic>and <italic>cdc2 </italic>&#x02013; had no effect on wing size (not shown). In contrast, reducing the level of <italic>E2F </italic>by 50% completely restored wild-type wing size (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,4B,4C</xref>), an effect that correlated with a strong reduction in cell death in the disc (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E,4F</xref>). The presence of a single <italic>hs-E2F </italic>transgene gave a weak and incompletely penetrant enhancement in the absence of heat shock, and this enhancement was stronger and completely penetrant when the transgenic strain was exposed to a heat shock treatment every 24 h during third instar and early pupal development (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Since the presence of the <italic>hs-E2F </italic>transgene and its induction by our heat shock protocol (low level overexpression compared to Asano et al., 1996) had no phenotype when in a wild-type background, we conclude that mCul1 expression sensitizes the cells to E2F overexpression. The reciprocal suppression by E2F mutation and enhancement by E2F overexpression show that the apoptosis triggered by mCul1 is mediated by or requires E2F function. Because a high level of ectopic expression of E2F is known to induce apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], these results suggest that mCul1 overexpression might interfere with normal E2F downregulation.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Dominant negative Cul1 interacts with <italic>E2F</italic>. </bold>(A) Wild-type wing.

Since E2F is normally degraded prior to S phase, the overlap in staining suggests that the partial suppression of Cul1 caused by mCul1 expression slowed E2F destruction to the point that it persisted briefly in S phase. We suggest, but have not demonstrated, that the low percentage of cells showing the overlap in the staining is due to a remaining capacity of the residual SCF activity to promote slower but still effective elimination of E2F during S phase. In any case, our finding shows that when dCul1 function is reduced, the normal pattern of E2F degradation in S phase is disrupted, leading to inappropriate persistence of E2F.

As <italic>slimb </italic>null mutants die as first instar larvae, direct analysis of the mutant discs was not possible. The severity of the slimb mutant phenotype suggested that the mutation reduced crucial SCF functions much more than did expression of mCul1. We used a <italic>slimb </italic>mutant stock carrying a <italic>slimb </italic>transgene under the control of the HSP 70 promoter to modify the time of onset of the <italic>slimb </italic>mutant phenotype. In the absence of heat shock, <italic>slimb </italic>homozygotes exhibited the early lethality of <italic>slimb </italic>mutants, but a single 30 minute heat shock at 37&#x000b0;C during first instar was enough to allow some larvae to reach the wandering third instar stage 4 days later. These larvae have small imaginal discs. Labelling of these discs with the anti-E2F antibody revealed that nearly all cells expressed E2F (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Many of these cells also incorporated low levels of BrdU (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>), usually in regions of the nucleus with lower E2F staining. A few cells also had high levels of BrdU incorporation and these also expressed E2F, although at lower levels (asterisks on fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). An hour and a half after a heat shock that restored Slimb expression, BrdU-labelled cells no longer contained detectable levels of E2F (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D,7E,7F</xref>). No accumulation of E2F mRNA can be seen in <italic>slimb </italic>mutant discs (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) suggesting that any effect of Slimb on E2F occurs posttranscriptionnally.

If this is the case, it is expected that Slimb would recruit E2F to the complex. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether Slimb and E2F physically interact. To this end, <sup>35</sup>S-labelled E2F was produced in vitro in a wheat germ lysate and incubated with the WD repeat region of Slimb fused to GST and bound to beads. Analysis of bead associated proteins (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) showed association of radiolabeled E2F with the fusion containing the WD-repeat region of Slimb (lane 3) but not with GST (lane 2). The interaction between Slimb and E2F depends on a phosphorylation event as it is prevented by the presence of active alkaline phosphatase (lane 4) but not when the phosphatase is inhibited by sodium vanadate (lane 5). Similar results were obtained with E2F2, the other <italic>Drosophila </italic>E2F family member (not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Slimb and E2F associate in vitro. </bold>GST-Slimb(176&#x02013;510) can interact with E2F (lane 3) but not with another protein (luciferase, lane 1).

We first demonstrated that mouse Cul1 overexpression has a dominant negative effect on SCF function in the wing imaginal disc resulting in apoptotic cell death leading to a small wing phenotype in adult flies. Thus, SCF activity normally suppresses cell death. The cell death that occurred upon reduction of Cul1 function was suppressed when E2F function was reduced by mutation. This genetic interaction might be due to action of E2F and Cul1 in parallel pathways, one suppressing and one enhancing cell death, or they might act in opposite directions in the same pathway. Because SCF complexes are involved in controlling protein degradation, we favoured the hypothesis that Cul1 promotes the destruction of E2F and that the inappropriate persistence of E2F leads to cell death. Consistent with this idea, E2F overproduction can induce apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, cell cycle specific destruction of E2F was suggested by the finding that E2F protein becomes undetectable in the synchronised S phase cells of the morphogenetic furrow of the eye imaginal disc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Our double labelling analysis extended this finding to the asynchronously cycling cells of the wing imaginal disc and demonstrated that E2F is rapidly degraded prior to significant DNA replication. In contrast, we found that E2F was detected in a fraction of S phase cells when SCF function was reduced by mCul1. This shows that normal E2F downregulation is delayed or slowed by reduction in SCF function.</p><p>Although the dominant negative action of mCul1 in <italic>Drosophila </italic>was unanticipated, it offers a fortuitously convenient tool for the analysis of SCF function. The <italic>Drosophila </italic>Cul1 mutant is less useful because maternal contributions of Cul1 are so large that homozygous mutant animals develop to pupariation. Additionally, unlike the spatially restricted expression of mCul1, the strong Cul1 mutant alleles result in lethality. The stage and generality of the defects make analysis of the Cul1 mutant phenotype particularly difficult. In contrast, the induced expression of mCul1 in the wing disc does not compromise viability and it gives a distinctive graded phenotype well suited for the study of genetic modification. While the basis for the dominant negative effect of mCul1 remains unknown, it is important to recognize that inactivation of the endogenous Cul1 is incomplete so that a reduced level of Cul1 activity persists. One likely explanation for the negative effect is that mCul1 overexpression leads to sequestration of some limiting SCF components into weakly active complexes. This hypothesis is consistent with the fact that mCul1 retains some positive function in flies as revealed by its ability to prolong survival of <italic>dCul1 </italic>mutant flies (J.-K. H&#x000e9;rich&#x000e9; and P.H. O'Farrell, unpublished data).</p><p>The essentially complete suppression of the mCul1 phenotype by reduction of the genetic dose of E2F suggests a remarkable level of specificity, in which, among the many targets of Cul1 action, the destruction of E2F appears to be particularly important. Similarly, limitations of Cul1 function in other organisms also uncovered the disproportionate importance of particular substrates. For example, Cul1 mutations in mice result in the accumulation of the SCF substrate cyclin E but not of p27 another well characterized SCF substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Among all of the substrates targeted for degradation by SCF in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, it is the failure to degrade Sic1 that underlies the G1 arrest in cdc53 mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus, different substrates of the SCF appear to have particularly high dependence on SCF activity in different biological contexts. We suggest that our experimental context using mCul1 expression in the wing disc is particularly effective in exposing the involvement of SCF in E2F destruction.</p><p>Since SCF complexes function in conjunction with a variety of F-box proteins that act as specificity factors, mutations in individual F-box proteins ought to affect particular subsets of SCF substrates. In an extensive screen for loci that modify the reduction of function phenotype for Cul1, we identified the gene encoding the F-box protein Slimb as a modifier, and we failed to detect contributions of other F-box encoding genes to the phenotype. This implicates Slimb in the action of SCF on E2F. Analysis of E2F levels revealed that cell cycle oscillations in E2F levels were absent when Slimb function was severely reduced. Note that the severity of this E2F destruction phenotype in comparison to the mild defect in cell cycle programming of E2F destruction upon mCul1 expression is entirely consistent with the fact that the <italic>slimb </italic>mutant gives a stronger loss of function than the reduction of function imposed by mCul1 overexpression. The absence of cell cycle oscillation in E2F presence in the <italic>slimb </italic>mutant suggests that SCF<sup>Slmb </sup>is responsible for targeting E2F for S phase destruction. If this destruction is the consequence of direct action of SCF<sup>Slmb </sup>on E2F, we would expect the F-box protein to interact with E2F. We confirmed this prediction by pull-down experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the interaction between Slimb and E2F is dependent on phosphorylation, as expected for the interaction of F-box proteins with their substrates. We suggest that the S phase specificity of E2F destruction is regulated by a targeting phosphorylation event, but we have not yet investigated this level of the regulation.</p><p>While SCF was previously implicated in the destruction of E2F-1 in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], this earlier study appears to focus on a distinct action of SCF. The starting point for the analysis was an interaction between E2F-1 and Skp2, an F-box protein that is not the mammalian homolog of Slimb. Mutations of E2F-1 that disrupted this interaction increased E2F-1 stability in transfection experiments. However, there was no demonstration that this interaction was involved in or required for cell cycle oscillations in the level of E2F-1. Furthermore, Skp2 knockout cells show no defect in E2F-1 degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and E2F-1 proteins unable to interact with Skp2 are still unstable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our results implicate SCF<sup>Slmb </sup>rather than SCF<sup>Skp2 </sup>in cell cycle specific destruction of E2F and argue that this regulation is critical for cell viability at least in flies. As a unifying view, we propose that Skp2-mediated control and Slimb-mediated control of E2F activities occur at different times during the cell cycle and that SCF<sup>Slmb </sup>is responsible for the rapid destruction of E2F in S phase.</p><p>Since E2F is a positive regulator of the G1/S transition, it is not clear why S phase destruction of E2F is required. However, we note that <italic>slimb </italic>mutant cells do not replicate DNA normally and the replication defect is correlated with an increase in E2F in individual cells. This observation is consistent with previous reports indicating that E2F can limit DNA replication both in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and in flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This enigmatic feature of E2F regulation suggests that its continued presence has a negative effect on DNA replication and indicates that we still have much to learn about its roles in cell cycle regulation.</p><p>SCF<sup>Slmb </sup>appears to influence other cell cycle events, perhaps by actions on other substrates, or perhaps as a result of events that are secondary to its influence on E2F destruction. For example, a <italic>slimb </italic>allele shows defects in centrosome duplication control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and <italic>slimb </italic>null cells undergo apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Both effects could be explained by a failure to inactivate E2F, as E2F promotes centrosome duplication in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and E2F can induce apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A link between Slimb function and the RB/E2F pathway of cell proliferation control is also suggested by the genetic interaction between the <italic>C. elegans slimb </italic>ortholog <italic>lin-23 </italic>and the RBF ortholog <italic>lin-35 </italic>in which <italic>lin-35 </italic>function limits the severity of the loss of <italic>lin-23 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Since RBF is an important modifier of E2F activity, perhaps this interaction is a reflection of the action of both Lin-23 and Lin-35 on E2F. However, in our experimental situation, we did not observe any modification of the mCul1 overexpression phenotype by mutations in either the <italic>RBF </italic>or <italic>DP </italic>gene, two known partners of E2F. This result suggests that these factors are not limiting factors in this situation or that E2F acts independently of RBF and DP. The latter hypothesis is the most likely explanation for the lack of an RBF interaction for the following reason. The E2F/RBF complex has to be disrupted for E2F to drive cells into S phase and E2F degradation occurs after the G1/S phase transition which only happens after E2F has been released from its association with RBF. According to this view, we would predict that the mCul1-induced phenotype should be specifically sensitive to factors impinging on the elimination of E2F activity during S phase, and factors involved in the unknown processes by which persistence of E2F has negative outcome. Consequently, this experimental system may provide an avenue for the genetic dissection of this mysterious facet of E2F function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>To explore potential roles for Cul1 in cell cycle control in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, we overexpressed mouse Cul1 (mCul1) in the wing imaginal disc. We found that this overexpression has a dominant negative effect leading to a reduction in SCF function. We used the resulting small wing phenotype in a modifier screen to identify mutations in cell cycle genes capable of dominantly modifying the mCul1-induced phenotype. We found that E2F loss-of-function mutations were the strongest modifiers as they completely suppressed the phenotype. The reduction in SCF function associated with mCul1 overexpression also correlated with a failure to downregulate E2F normally in S phase. Additionally, mutations in <italic>slimb </italic>that reduced the function of the F-box protein Slimb enhanced the phenotype and led to persistence of E2F in S phase cells. Finally, this F-box protein interacts with E2F in vitro. These results indicate that an SCF<sup>Slmb </sup>complex is involved in regulating E2F activity during S phase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Identification of fly Cul1 and Skp1 orthologs</title><p>We identified several lead ESTs in the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project database.
