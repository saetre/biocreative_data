EHEC's virulence is dependent upon a type III secretion system (TTSS) encoded by 41 genes. These genes are organized in several operons clustered in the locus of enterocyte effacement. Most of the locus of enterocyte effacement genes, including <italic>grlA</italic> and <italic>grlR,</italic> are positively regulated by Ler, and Ler expression is positively and negatively modulated by GrlA and GrlR, respectively. However, the molecular basis for the GrlA and GrlR activity is still elusive. We have determined the crystal structure of GrlR at 1.9 &#x000c5; resolution. It consists of a typical &#x003b2;-barrel fold with eight &#x003b2;-strands containing an internal hydrophobic cavity and a plug-like loop on one side of the barrel. Strong hydrophobic interactions between the two &#x003b2;-barrels maintain the dimeric architecture of GrlR. Furthermore, a unique surface-exposed EDED (Glu-Asp-Glu-Asp) motif is identified to be critical for GrlA&#x02013;GrlR interaction and for the repressive activity of GrlR. This study contributes a novel molecular insight into the mechanism of GrlR function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Attaching and effacing pathogens are a group of enteric pathogens that includes the closely related enterohemorrhagic <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> (EHEC) and enteropathogenic <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> (EPEC). EPEC causes severe diarrhea in young children in developing countries, while EHEC is a causative agent of hemorrhagic colitis. A major infection mechanism employed by EHEC and EPEC is the type III secretion system (TTSS). TTSS is a syringe-like apparatus composed of approximately 20 proteins that serve to transfer virulence proteins from the bacteria directly into the host cytoplasm. The genes encoding for the TTSS components and related proteins are organized in several operons that are clustered in the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). GrlR and GrlA are LEE-encoded, newly identified, regulators that are common to all the attaching and effacing pathogens. This article reports the crystal structure of GrlR and explains how it can bind with GrlA to influence the activity of TTSS. Further, we have identified an EDED motif of GrlR crucial for the recognition of GrlA and activity.

EPEC, EHEC, and the mouse pathogen <named-content content-type="genus-species">Citrobacter rodentium</named-content> (CR) belong to a group of pathogenic bacteria that are defined by their ability to form &#x0201c;attaching and effacing&#x0201d; (AE) histopathology on intestinal epithelia. This histopathology is characterized by localized destruction of apical microvilli, followed by intimate adhesion of bacteria to the cell plasma membrane &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. A major virulence mechanism underlying AE-causing bacteria is the type III secretion system (TTSS), which is employed by the bacteria as a molecular syringe to inject (translocate) effectors into the host cell. These effector proteins subvert normal host cell functions to benefit the bacteria &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. TTSS components and related proteins are encoded by 41 genes organized in five major operons, <italic>LEE1</italic> through <italic>LEE5</italic>, and several additional transcriptional units, all clustered in the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Under repressive conditions, the entire LEE is silenced by the histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS). Activation of most LEE promoters is dependent on Ler, an H-NS paralogue encoded by <italic>LEE1,</italic> which functions as anti&#x02013;H-NS to alleviate the H-NS&#x02013;mediated silencing of most of the LEE promoters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, controlling the activity of the <italic>LEE1</italic> promoter (P<sub><italic>LEE1</italic></sub>) is critical for initiating a cascade that mediates the expression of all of the LEE genes.

These two proteins from EPEC and EHEC, respectively, exhibit about 98&#x00025; identities. GrlA acts as a positive regulator for P<sub><italic>LEE1</italic></sub>; moreover, GrlA and Ler form a positive transcriptional regulatory loop acting synergistically to strongly activate <italic>ler</italic> expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. It is suggested that in order to prevent the detrimental accumulation of Ler, the Ler&#x02013;GrlA feedback loop is negatively modulated by two checkpoints: (1) When Ler reaches the threshold concentration, it represses <italic>ler</italic> transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

In agreement with this hypothesis, GrlR interacts with itself and also with GrlA to form a macromolecular assembly in the cytoplasm of AE pathogens &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. It has been proposed that GrlR conveys a negative regulation through its interaction with GrlA and that this hetero-complex is functionally relevant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

GrlR has a typical &#x003b2;-barrel fold consisting of an internal hydrophobic cavity with a plug-like loop on one side of the barrel. Structure-based site-directed mutagenesis targeting the surface residues of GrlR showed that these residues are crucial for the ability of GrlR to bind GrlA and to carry out its regulatory function. In vitro and in vivo experiments further confirmed the vital role of these residues for the regulatory function of GrlR. Our finding represents a novel regulatory mechanism in the TTSS of pathogenic bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Structure of GrlR</title><p>The structure of recombinant GrlR from EHEC was solved by the multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion method from synchrotron data. The model was refined to a final R-factor of 0.215 (R<sub>free</sub> &#x0003d; 0.269) at 1.9 &#x000c5; resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030069-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) with good stereochemical parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030069-t001">Table 1</xref>). The GrlR model consists of residues from Met1 to Val111, with seven additional residues at the N-terminus (Gly-6, Leu-5, Val-4, Pro-3, Arg-2, Gly-1, and Ser0) resulting from the linker sequence of the (His)<sub>6</sub> affinity tag. The C-terminal residues from Asn112 to Lys121 had no interpretable electron density and were not modeled. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030069-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) and they are related by a 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry approximately parallel to the <italic>a</italic>-axis. Interestingly, these two molecules are packed in a perpendicular fashion to each other, resulting in a maximum interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030069-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>The GrlR molecule mainly consists of a single domain from residues Asp5 to Ile107 that forms a &#x003b2;-barrel. Residues Tyr59 to Asp70 form an extended loop that plugs one side of the cylindrical &#x003b2;-barrel structure. The &#x003b2;-barrel consists of eight anti-parallel &#x003b2;-strands running from one side of the molecule to the other. On one side of the &#x003b2;-barrel there are four long loops, including a plug-like structure, whereas on the other side, four tight &#x003b2;-turns are connecting the adjacent &#x003b2;-strands. Both ends of the &#x003b2;-barrel were closed off by the N-terminus (Met1 to Lys4) and plug-like loop residues Tyr59 to Asp70. The tip of the ten residue&#x02013;long plug-like loop, which is highly hydrophobic, may close or open the cavity primarily by hydrophobic interactions. The &#x003b2;-barrel cavity is highly hydrophobic in nature with side chains from seven Tyr, six Ile, seven Leu, four Val, and two Phe residues lining the inner cavity surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030069-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The approximate dimensions of the &#x003b2;-barrel are 35.2 &#x000c5; in height and 18.5 &#x000c5; in diameter.</p><p>GrlR shares 93&#x00025; to 100&#x00025; identity between different AE-causing <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> strains and EHEC (strain EDL933) and over 85&#x00025; sequence identity (CLUSTAL W &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;) with that of CR. There is no significant overall sequence identity with any other protein in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. A search for topologically similar proteins within the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database was performed with the program DALI &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. The highest structural homology is observed between GrlR and the electron transport domain of quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase (PDB code 1jju; with 18&#x00025; sequence identity; <italic>z</italic>-score 9.2 and 2.5 &#x000c5; RMSD &#x0005b;root mean square deviation&#x0005d; for 90 C&#x003b1; atoms). This is followed by a lipid-binding TTSS secretin pilotin protein, MxiM (PDB code 1y9t; with 16&#x00025; sequence identity; <italic>z</italic>-score 4.90 and 2.7 &#x000c5; RMSD for 77 C&#x003b1; atoms), which has a cracked barrel structure &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>During structure refinement, we noticed a small molecule composed of 12 atoms in the hydrophobic cavity of GrlR, which, subsequently, was identified to be the fragment of Triton-X100. It is worth mentioning here that the bacterial lysis buffer used for GrlR purification contained 1&#x00025; (v/v) of Triton-X100. The detergent may have bound tightly to the hydrophobic cavity of GrlR during this stage, and had co-crystallized with GrlR. The bound detergent is situated at the center of the cavity and is parallel to its axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030069-g001">Figure 1</xref>A); the interaction of the detergent with hydrophobic residues of the cavity may play a crucial role in increasing the solubility of GrlR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030069-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The ligand molecule is well defined in the electron density map. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030069-g002">Figure 2</xref>B shows the simulated annealing Fo-Fc omit map. The superimposed GrlR on lipid-bound MxiM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; indicated that the probability of having a lipid molecule in the hydrophobic pore of GrlR is not ruled out. Based on the structural homology, the bound ligand, and the hydrophobic nature of the cavity of GrlR, we suggest that the cavity may recognize a specific small hydrophobic ligand and interact with side chains of the cavity residues. Exact roles of this cavity and the plug-like loop for the function of GrlR are not yet established.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Dimers of GrlR</title><p>GrlR was found to exist as a homodimer in solution, with an apparent molecular weight of 29 kDa, as determined by gel filtration and dynamic light scattering. The analytical ultra centrifugation experiments also revealed the dimeric nature of GrlR. These results were consistent with a dimeric arrangement observed in the crystal structure, with the dimer having approximate dimensions of 46.5 &#x000d7; 32.6 &#x000d7; 35.2 &#x000c5;. The strong hydrophobic cluster at the dimeric interface is maintained by the side chains from residues Ile7, Ile23, Ile25, Val39, and Ile107 from both monomers of the dimer. In addition, six hydrogen bonding contacts (&#x0003c;3.2 &#x000c5;) mainly from Gln41, Glu108, His55, Pro109, and Val 111 of both monomers, as well as numerous hydrophobic interactions, are maintaining the dimer architecture. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030069-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows the electrostatic surface representation of the dimeric GrlR (GRASP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;). The observation of a dimeric GrlR for the wild-type as well as for mutants suggests a functionally important role for dimerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Identification of a Key Motif</title><p>GrlR was shown to associate with itself and with GrlA to mediate the regulatory network &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. GrlA is homologous to CaiF, a known DNA binding protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, and its sequence analysis identified a helix-turn-helix DNA recognition motif at the N-terminus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. The C-terminal region of GrlA is rich in basic residues (nine arginines and seven lysines), suggesting that it may have a role in the interaction with the acidic GrlR. A loop region in the crystal structure of GrlR, residues Glu46 to Asp49 (<sup>46</sup>EDED<sup>49</sup>), is highly exposed on the surface and is less well defined in electron density. It is worth noting here that GrlA and GrlR have extremely opposite charges: the calculated isoelectric points (pI) of GrlR and GrlA are 4.83 and 9.71, respectively. Taking together all of these facts, we now hypothesize that the negatively charged cluster (the EDED &#x0005b;Glu-Asp-Glu-Asp&#x0005d; motif) is involved in the GrlR&#x02013;GrlA interaction and thus may play an important role for repressing the ability of EHEC to perform TTSS-mediated protein secretion.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>EDED Motif Is Essential for the Recognition of GrlA</title><p>To test the above hypothesis, EDED residues were mutated and interactions of different GrlR mutants with glutathione-S-transferase (GST)&#x02013;GrlA were tested by pull-down assays followed by SDS-PAGE analyses. We found that GrlA was not stable on its own, but the GrlA fused with GST was sufficiently stable for pull-down experiments with both wild-type and mutants of GrlR to verify the binding between these two proteins. We have also confirmed that wild-type GrlR binds to GST-GrlA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030069-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), whereas no binding has been observed with GST alone. All of the four single mutants (E46A, D47A, E48A, and D49A) and the double mutant (E46A-D47A) of GrlR showed similar binding to GrlA in pull-down assays. However, the triple mutant (E46A-D47A-E48A) showed a significant drop in binding to GrlA. Whereas the EDED tetra mutant, with all of the four residues mutated to alanine, did not bind to GrlA, no protein band corresponding to GrlR was detected in the pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030069-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Bands corresponding to GST-fused GrlA and GrlR were analyzed with peptide mass finger printing and their identities were confirmed (unpublished data). To verify the integrity of secondary structures in the mutants, circular dichroism spectra were measured for wild-type GrlR as well as for all mutants. In all cases, the circular dichroism spectra showed the existence of similar &#x003b2;-sheet secondary structures, which is consistent with the crystal structure. These results indicated that the surface-exposed EDED motif is a key structural feature for the binding of GrlR to GrlA.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Regulatory Function of GrlR Is Mediated by EDED Motif</title><p>In order to elucidate the role of the wild-type and mutants of GrlR in the repression of TTSS, a protein secretion assay was carried out in EHEC. Bacteria containing different plasmids were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), and total secreted extracellular proteins were recovered from the medium and compared by SDS-PAGE. We used EspB, which is a major secreted protein of EHEC, as a representative marker and compared the secretion of EspB in wild-type and mutant GrlR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030069-g005">Figure 5</xref>, upper panel). The wild-type GrlR repressed the secretion of EspB. Single (E46A, D47A, E48A, D49A) and double mutants (E46A-D47A) showed similar reduced secretion of this protein, whereas the triple mutant (E46A-D47A-E48A) significantly reduced GrlR repression and the secretion of EspB was increased. However, the tetra mutant (E46A-D47A-E48A-D49A) totally abolished the repression effect of GrlR and the secretion was restored to a level similar to that of the control. We have also verified the expression level of all of the GrlR mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030069-g005">Figure 5</xref>, lower panel). These results are consistent with our previous pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030069-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), which showed that GrlR and GrlA binding was affected in the triple and tetra mutants.

Upon replacing the entire EDED motif with AAAA, GrlR was no longer capable of P<sub><italic>LEE1</italic></sub> repression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030069-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that the EDED motif is crucial for repression of P<sub><italic>LEE1</italic></sub> by GrlR. Overall, results of this <italic>gfp</italic> assay, with the exception of small variations, are comparable to EHEC experiments. These observed variations may be due to the difference in strains as well as the experimental conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The regulatory network that controls the expression of the virulence genes of AE pathogens is complex. Much of this complexity is merged at controlling the activity of the P<sub><italic>LEE1</italic></sub> and <italic>ler</italic> expression.

Iyoda et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030069-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d; reported recently that the GrlR&#x02013;GrlA complex also controls the expression of FlhDC, the flagella master regulator. Thus, the GrlR&#x02013;GrlA complex plays an important role in controlling the expression of two key master regulators, Ler and FlhDC. Structural study of GrlR identified the surface-exposed EDED motif and the importance of these residues was further investigated. Our in vivo and in vitro functional studies of wild-type and mutant GrlR showed that the EDED motif is crucial for the recognition of GrlA by GrlR and for the GrlR regulatory activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a key role of the EDED motif in bacterial regulation.</p><p>Based on the properties of these two proteins, the location of the EDED motif in the dimeric GrlR and the dimeric nature of most of the helix-turn-helix&#x02013;containing DNA-binding proteins, we propose that the GrlA may also exist as a homodimer, and that dimers of GrlR and GrlA in combination are involved in the regulatory mechanism<italic>.</italic></p><p>Our study provides a novel structural basis for an understanding of the regulatory mechanism of the GrlA&#x02013;GrlR complex and thus provides new insight into the complex regulatory network that governs the virulence of AE pathogens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmid and strain construction.</title><p>The bacterial stains and the plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030069-st001">Table S1</xref>.
