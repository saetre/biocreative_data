As regulators of T cell activation, dendritic cells (DCs) are important mediators of allergic asthma, yet the precise signals which render endogenous DCs &#x0201c;pro-asthmatic&#x0201d;, and the extent to which these signals are regulated by the pulmonary environment and host genetics, remains unclear. Comparative phenotypic and functional analysis of pulmonary DC populations in mice susceptible (A/J), or resistant (C3H) to experimental asthma, revealed that susceptibility to airway hyperresponsiveness is associated with preferential myeloid DC (mDC) allergen uptake, and production of Th17-skewing cytokines (IL-6, IL-23), whereas resistance is associated with increased allergen uptake by plasmacytoid DCs. Surprisingly, adoptive transfer of syngeneic HDM-pulsed bone marrow derived mDCs (BMDCs) to the lungs of C3H mice markedly enhanced lung IL-17A production, and rendered them susceptible to allergen-driven airway hyperresponsiveness. Characterization of these BMDCs revealed levels of antigen uptake, and Th17 promoting cytokine production similar to that observed in pulmonary mDCs from susceptible A/J mice. Collectively these data demonstrate that the lung environment present in asthma-resistant mice promotes robust pDC allergen uptake, activation, and limits Th17-skewing cytokine production responsible for driving pathologic T cell responses central to the development of allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Allergic asthma, a disease that continues to rise in both incidence and morbidity in the developed world, manifests as recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath and coughing in response to environmental stimuli. Although the origins of asthma are complex, it is accepted that asthma results from an inappropriate, Th2-dominated immune response to environmental allergens in genetically predisposed individuals. In asthmatic individuals, allergen exposure facilitates expansion of pathogenic, allergen-specific Th2 cells producing IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, cytokines which induce pulmonary eosinophilic inflammation, IgE synthesis, airway wall remodeling and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), hallmarks of allergic asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-WillsKarp1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, non-asthmatic individuals respond in a fundamentally different way, becoming tolerized through the activation of immunosuppressive CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x0002b; regulatory T cells secreting IL-10 and TGF&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Akdis1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Ling1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. However, despite an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the pathogenesis of allergic asthma, the factors that promote the initial development of a pathogenic versus protective T cell response remain unknown.</p><p>As professional antigen presenting cells, dendritic cells (DCs) are capable of skewing T cell differentiation towards a pathogenic or regulatory phenotype through a number of mechanisms. For example, the panel of co-stimulatory molecules expressed by DCs plays a role in the type of T cell response elicited - CD86 and OX40L contribute to the development of pathogenic Th2 cells, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-KeaneMyers1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Hoshino1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> while ICOS-L and PD-1/PD-L promote the development of protective regulatory T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Akbari1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Piconi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Identification of a DC-produced cytokine directly responsible for inducing the development of Th2 cells remains elusive, yet the Th2-skewing capacity of DCs can be influenced by a number of factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Ito1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Ritz1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, the recent identification of distinct DC subsets has provided another mechanism through which DCs may control the development of pathogenic or regulatory T cell responses. Myeloid DCs (mDCs), are effective T cell stimulators, inducing a variety of effector T cell responses (e.g. Th1, Th2 or Th17) dependent upon the types of stimuli they receive, and the compartment from which they are isolated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Denning1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Wang2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, while plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) strongly induce the development of regulatory T cells as a result of elevated PD-L1 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-deHeer1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Tokita1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, they can also induce the development of IFN&#x003b3;-producing Th1 cells after viral exposure, or Th2 differentiation after exposure to IL-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Ebner1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Ito2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, DCs can adapt to conditions present at the time of antigen encounter, promoting responses appropriate to the specific antigen, a response further fine-tuned by the types of DC subset involved in antigen presentation.</p><p>Dendritic cells in the lung play an important role in the development of allergic airway responses.

Indeed, transfer of Ag-pulsed, bone marrow-derived mDCs to the airways of na&#x000ef;ve animals is sufficient to sensitize mice for subsequent development of allergic asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Lambrecht3">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Graffi1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, <italic>in vivo</italic>, the precise subset of DCs responsible for inducing pathogenic versus protective T cell responses, the pattern of DC-derived cytokines that drive these T cell responses, and the extent to which DC subset recruitment and cytokine production are regulated by the pulmonary environment and genetics in asthma-susceptible and resistant hosts, remains unclear.</p><p>To address these questions, we utilized a murine model of susceptibility to allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) wherein intratracheal administration of house dust mite (HDM) induces the development of AHR in susceptible A/J animals, but has little impact on AHR in resistant C3H mice. Using this model, we demonstrate that following allergen exposure in susceptible hosts, allergen uptake is predominantly by pulmonary mDCs capable of high level co-stimulatory molecule expression and the production of Th17-promoting cytokines production (IL-6, IL-23), and that these factors are critical for the development of allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Moreover, transfer of mDCs with a susceptible phenotype completely reconstitutes susceptibility in resistant hosts. Taken together, our results suggest that factors in the pulmonary environment regulate the activation of mDCs, controlling the expression of high levels of co-stimulatory molecules, and Th17-promoting cytokines (IL-6, IL-23) critical for the development of T-cell dependent airway hyperresponsiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Development of HDM-based model of experimental asthma</title><p>To test the hypothesis that differences in susceptibility to allergen-driven AHR in A/J and C3H mice result from differential regulation of pulmonary DC recruitment or activity, we developed a model in which allergen sensitization occurs via the airways. Specifically, we examined the impact of i.t. administration of house dust mite extract (HDM), a natural aeroallergen, on subsequent development of allergen-induced AHR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003879-g001">Figure 1a</xref>, 24 hours after a second i.t. HDM exposure, AHR rose in A/J animals, reaching a plateau 4&#x02013;5 fold higher than baseline by 72 hours. In contrast, in C3H mice, airway responses remained indistinguishable from baseline at 24 hours, and were only modestly increased (&#x0003c;2-fold) 72 hours after allergen exposure. Interestingly, in spite of the well-documented role of IL-13 as a central mediator of allergic asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-WillsKarp2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) was similar in HDM re-stimulated lung cell cultures from A/J and C3H mice, while production of IFN&#x003b3; was induced only in lung cell cultures from C3H mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003879-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). However, the levels of IFN&#x003b3; are quite low, indicating a clear Th2 bias to immune response in both resistant and susceptible animals and suggesting that resistance is not associated with the preferential induction of a Th1 response in this model. Interestingly, lung cell cultures from susceptible A/J mice produced significantly greater amounts of IL-17A upon HDM-restimulation, suggesting that concomitant induction of Th2 and Th17 responses may be required for the manifestation of AHR in allergen-sensitized hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003879-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). HDM exposure also induced a similar degree of BAL eosinophilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003879-g001">Figure 1c</xref>), and total and HDM-specific IgE synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003879-g001">Figure 1d</xref>) in A/J and C3H mice. Interestingly, despite the elevated IL-17A production observed in HDM-restimulated lung cell cultures from A/J mice, the degree of BAL neutrophilia was indistinguishable in A/J and C3H mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003879-g001">Figure 1c</xref>). It is important to note that, while the C3H mice used in these studies possess a mutation in TLR4 rendering them resistant to LPS signaling, the inability to respond to LPS does not seem to underlie their genetic resistance, as C3H mice which do not possess the mutation in TLR4 (C3H/HeN) respond identically to HDM (data not shown). Thus, to assess the importance of endogenous DC subsets in controlling resistance or susceptibility in a genetic model of asthma, we made use of the HDM-based model of experimental asthma in subsequent studies.</p><fig id="pone-0003879-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003879.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Intratracheal HDM exposure induces AHR and a mixed Th2/Th17 cytokine profile in A/J, but not C3H mice.</title><p>A/J (solid bars) and C3H (open bars) mice were sensitized and challenged with PBS or HDM as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.

Interestingly, pDCs generally expressed lower levels of MHC Class II than mDCs from the same mouse (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003879-t001">Table 1</xref>), supporting previous reports suggesting that, compared to mDCs, pDCs have limited T cell stimulatory activity. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the development of AHR in genetically susceptible animals is associated with enhanced activation and function of pulmonary mDCs following allergen sensitization. In contrast, in resistant animals, there is a shift towards increased activation and allergen uptake by pulmonary pDCs.</p><fig id="pone-0003879-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003879.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Significantly enhanced co-stimulatory molecule expression on HDM-bearing mDCs from A/J mice.</title><p>A/J (solid bars) and C3H (open bars) mice were treated with PBS or AF405-labeled HDM as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.

Lung cells from HDM-pulsed BMDC-sensitized C3H mice produced both Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) and Th1 (IFN&#x003b3;) cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003879-g008">Figure 8c</xref>), similar to the pattern observed following sensitization with HDM, albeit &#x0223c;10-fold more intense (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003879-g001">Figure 1d</xref>). Interestingly, upon HDM-restimulation, lung cells from these BMDC-sensitized C3H mice produced levels of IL-17A 100-fold greater than those observed following intratracheal administration of HDM alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003879-g008">Figure 8c</xref>). The concomitant induction of a Th17 response, similar to that observed in A/J mice treated with intratracheal HDM, is likely the result of elevated p19 and IL-6 production observed in adoptively transferred DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003879-g007">Figure 7c</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that genetic resistance to allergen-induced AHR can be overcome by limiting the ability of pDCs to capture antigen and shifting the balance of antigen presentation towards highly activated, mDCs producing abundant Th17-skewing cytokines. Furthermore, these data also suggest that the pulmonary environment in which allergen encounter first takes place is of critical importance in directing the development of tolerance or allergen-induced AHR following initial allergen exposure.</p><fig id="pone-0003879-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003879.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Adoptive transfer of mDCs to resistant mice induces AHR and IL-17 production similar to that seen in susceptible animals.</title><p>C3H mice were sensitized with PBS-, or HDM-pulsed bone marrow-derived DCs on day 0.

Herein, we address these questions, demonstrating that while both mDCs and pDCs take up allergen in susceptible A/J mice, susceptibility to AHR is associated with preferential allergen uptake and increased co-stimulatory molecule expression by pulmonary mDCs. In contrast, in genetically resistant hosts, a greater frequency of pulmonary pDCs capture, and are activated by inhaled HDM. In addition, our studies provide several lines of evidence suggesting that susceptibility to allergen-induced AHR is associated with the capacity of mDCs to produce Th17-driving cytokines. First, pulmonary mDCs from genetically susceptible, allergen challenged mice produce high levels of IL-6 and IL-23, cytokines known to drive Th17 responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Bettelli1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Veldhoen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-McAllister1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

Collectively, our results suggest that in genetically susceptible animals, the pulmonary environment promotes allergen uptake and production of Th17-skewing cytokines by pulmonary mDCs that, in turn, promotes the development of pathologic T cell responses central to disease pathology.</p><p>Classically, Th2 cytokines are thought to be the principal effector molecules driving the development of experimental asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-WillsKarp2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Gavett1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Surprisingly, our results suggest that susceptibility to allergen-driven AHR is associated with a mixed Th2/Th17 cytokine profile in the lung as both susceptible and resistant mice produced equivalent Th2 cytokines, but only susceptible mice produced IL-17A following HDM exposure. Furthermore, while similar patterns of Th1 and Th2 cytokine production were observed in C3H mice undergoing weak or robust airway responses, robust airway responses induced by adoptive transfer of HDM-pulsed BMDCs in normally resistant C3H mice were accompanied by a dramatic upregulation of IL-17A synthesis. The involvement of a mixed Th2/Th17 cytokine profile in asthma pathogenesis is supported by human studies showing increased production of IL-17A and infiltration of Th17 cells in the lungs of asthmatics, particularly those with more severe disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Bullens1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Pene1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Although little is known about the specific role IL-17 plays in asthma, a recent report demonstrated that IL-17R-/- mice displayed reduced IgE production, airway eosinophilia and Th2 cytokine production, suggesting that IL-17A was required for allergic sensitization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-SchnyderCandrian1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in the same study, neutralization of IL-17A during the effector phase enhanced AHR, suggesting a protective role in later stages of disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-SchnyderCandrian1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. As we observe decreased production of Th17-skewing cytokines during the initiation of the response in genetically resistant animals, we speculate that Th17 cells play a pathogenic role in our model.</p><p>The observation of a mixed Th2/Th17 response in susceptible mice is in contrast to our previous observation of a clearly Th2-dominant pattern of cytokines in susceptible A/J mice and a preponderance of IFN&#x003b3; in C3H mice in an OVA-based model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Ewart1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.

The specific components of HDM that enhance its allergenicity remain unknown. However, while OVA is a single protein, HDM represents a complex mixture of components &#x02013; both protein and non-protein. Two of these proteins, Der p1 and Der p2, possess potent proteolytic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Hewitt1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Wan1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, with the capacity to activate PAR-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Sun1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, and regulate of IgE production by cleaving the low affinity IgE receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Schulz1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. All of these biologic activities may potentially contribute to the allergenicity of this mixture. Another significant component of the HDM extract used in these studies is contaminating LPS. While low levels of LPS enhance the development of Th2 responses in the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Eisenbarth1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>, and LPS responsiveness is limited in C3H/HeJ mice used in this study, we do not think that the failure of the C3H mice to respond to LPS is responsible for their lack of AHR in our model. While C3H mice are LPS-resistant, <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure to HDM&#x0002b;LPS induces similar levels of co-stimulatory molecule expression and allergen uptake in BMDCs from A/J and C3H mice. Moreover, we find that C3H/HeN mice, which possess a functional TLR4, respond to HDM identically to C3H/HeJ mice. Taken together these results suggest that any defects in allergen uptake or co-stimulatory molecule induction resulting from LPS unresponsiveness are overcome in the presence of HDM.</p><p>Interestingly, while <italic>in vivo</italic> HDM exposure inhibits allergen uptake, activation, and production of Th17-skewing cytokines by pulmonary mDCs from C3H mice, these parameters are maintained, or enhanced following exposure of bone marrow derived mDCs from resistant mice to HDM <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, while pulmonary mDCs from resistant mice fail to induce AHR, transfer of bone marrow-derived mDCs pulsed with HDM <italic>in vitro</italic> induces robust AHR, demonstrating that DCs from different compartments possess different functional characteristics. This is wholly compatible with previous reports demonstrating that the type of signals the DC receive during maturation, and the tissues from which they are derived strongly influences their function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Ebner1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Ito2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Piggott1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the precise signals provided by the lung environment in C3H mice that limit pulmonary mDC activation are unclear, there are several possibilities. First, it is possible that some factor(s) differentially produced in the lungs of resistant and susceptible animals regulate the ability of pulmonary mDCs to respond to HDM. Interestingly, in the data reported here, pro-asthmatic BMDCs from C3H mice were differentiated in the presence of GM-CSF. Supporting a role for GM-CSF in enhancing the pro-asthmatic capacity of DCs, this cytokine selectively promotes the expansion of myeloid DCs <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Pulendran1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>, increases the expression of MHC Class II and CD86 on DCs in a murine model of asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Cates1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, and enhances the capacity of DCs to support Th2 differentiation in both mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Lambrecht1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Pulendran1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref> and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Faith1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, GM-CSF also enhances the production of IL-6 and IL-23 from DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Sonderegger1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>, leading us to hypothesize that the reduced capacity for co-stimulatory molecule expression and Th17-skewing cytokine production observed in C3H pulmonary mDCs may be the result of limited production of, or responsiveness to, GM-CSF <italic>in vivo</italic>. Studies are currently underway to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Our observation that shifting the balance of antigen presentation from activated pulmonary pDCs to activated mDCs is sufficient to induce airway responses in genetically resistant hosts also suggests that the presence of activated pDCs may limit the pro-asthmatic capacity of pulmonary mDCs. Such pDC-mediated inhibition of AHR may occur in a number of ways. We have previously demonstrated that in an mDC:T cell co-culture, pDCs significantly inhibit mDC-mediated T cell activation, suggesting that pDCs can directly limit mDC activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Khl1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, while our <italic>ex vivo</italic> analysis of cytokine production by pulmonary pDCs did not reveal striking differences in cytokine production in pDCs between strains, it suggested that pDCs may be a source of IL-12, a cytokine that prevents allergen-induced AHR in this model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-KeaneMyers2">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, as pDCs have been shown to be potent inducers of regulatory T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-deHeer1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Tokita1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, the increased activation of pulmonary pDCs observed in allergen-challenged resistant mice may contribute to a regulatory response responsible for controlling AHR. Consistent with this possibility, we previously demonstrated that <italic>in vivo</italic> Treg depletion in C3H mice significantly increased pulmonary mDC activity and AHR, while having no impact on these parameters in A/J mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Lewkowich1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, through a variety of mechanisms, activated pDCs in the lungs of resistant animals may play a role in suppressing pulmonary mDC activation, and development of AHR.</p><p>The genetic factors underlying differential recruitment, capacity for allergen uptake, and Th17-driving cytokine production by pulmonary mDCs in susceptible and resistant mice remain unclear. However, we have previously identified two regions on murine chromosome 2 (<italic>Abhr1</italic> and <italic>Abhr2</italic>) that are strongly linked with asthma susceptibility in this model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Ewart1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. While mDCs from allergen-challenged A/J mice demonstrated enhanced capacity for allergen uptake (compared to those from C3H mice), fewer mDCs were present in the lungs of A/J animals, suggesting that genetic differences associated with susceptibility to allergen-induced AHR govern the function of distinct DC subsets, and not their selective recruitment. Close examination of the factors differentially expressed by pulmonary mDCs from A/J and C3H mice (IL-6, either IL-23 subunit, TNF&#x003b1;, co-stimulatory molecules) reveals that none are located within the genomic regions associated with susceptibility. However, C5a &#x0005b;absent in A/J mice due to a naturally occurring 2-base pair deletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Wetsel1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>&#x0005d;, located within <italic>Abhr1</italic> and strongly associated with the development of allergic asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Karp1">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>, has been shown to regulate IL-23 production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Hawlisch1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref> and the pulmonary mDC:pDC ratio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003879-Khl1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, in the lungs of resistant mice, production of complement components, likely by the epithelium, may negatively regulate mDC phagocytic capacity, activation, and production of Th17-driving cytokines, such that upon allergen exposure, the actions of pDCs predominate, and allow the development of an appropriate regulatory response.</p><p>Thus, our studies provide new insights into the phenotype of endogenous DCs that drive airway hyperresponsiveness. We demonstrate that genetic susceptibility to the development of allergen-induced AHR is the result of a pulmonary environment which, following allergen exposure, allows allergen presentation by mDCs expressing high levels of co-stimulatory molecules, and producing a Th17-promoting cytokine profile (IL-23 and IL-6). On the other hand, factors present in the lungs of resistant mice shift the balance of allergen uptake and activation from immunogenic mDCs to tolerogenic pDCs. Identification of the exact lung factors that preferentially regulate myeloid DC activation and promote the subsequent development of Th2/Th17 responses to harmless inhaled antigens should inform the development of improved therapies for the treatment of this ever increasing disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>Male A/J and C3H/HeJ mice (5&#x02013;6 weeks old, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility at Cincinnati Children's Hospital (Cincinnati, OH).
