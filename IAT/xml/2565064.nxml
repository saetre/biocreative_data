These cellular movements rely heavily on dynamic actin assembly. Rho with its associated proteins, including the Rho-activated formin, Diaphanous, are key regulators of actin assembly in cellular protrusion and migration. However, the function of Diaphanous in gastrulation cell movements remains unclear. To study the role of Diaphanous in gastrulation, we isolated a partial zebrafish diaphanous-related formin 2 (<italic>zdia2</italic>) clone with its N-terminal regulatory domains. The GTPase binding domain of zDia2 is highly conserved compared to its mammalian homologues. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we showed that zDia2 interacts with constitutively-active RhoA and Cdc42. The <italic>zdia2</italic> mRNAs were ubiquitously expressed during early embryonic development in zebrafish as determined by RT-PCR and whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analyses. Knockdown of <italic>zdia2</italic> by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) blocked epiboly formation and convergent extension in a dose-dependent manner, whereas ectopic expression of a human <italic>mdia</italic> gene partially rescued these defects. Time-lapse recording further showed that bleb-like cellular processes of blastoderm marginal deep marginal cells and pseudopod-/filopod-like processes of prechordal plate cells and lateral cells were abolished in the <italic>zdia2</italic> morphants. Furthermore, zDia2 acts cell-autonomously since transplanted <italic>zdia2</italic>-knockdown cells exhibited low protrusive activity with aberrant migration in wild type host embryos. Lastly, co-injection of antisense MOs of <italic>zdia2</italic> and zebrafish <italic>profilin I</italic> (<italic>zpfn 1</italic>), but not zebrafish <italic>profilin II</italic>, resulted in a synergistic inhibition of gastrulation cell movements. These results suggest that zDia2 in conjunction with zPfn 1 are required for gastrulation cell movements in zebrafish.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In teleosts, an embryo rapidly cleaves from one cell into thousands of blastomeres.

During gastrulation, tightly regulated cellular movements, which relies on the fast remodeling of the cytoskeleton, especially actin filaments, are required for proper development.</p><p>Dynamic remodeling of actin filaments has been heavily studied in cell division and cell migration. It involves several key cytoskeletal regulators.

Rho GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, are small GTP-binding proteins with intrinsic GTPase activity. They cycle between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound forms to regulate cytoskeleton-related cellular processes, including exocytosis, endocytosis, vesicle transport/secretion, cytokinesis, and cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003439-EtienneManneville1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Among Rho GTPases, Rho-dependent signaling has been most intensively studied.

The FH2 domain has actin-nucleation activity and often forms dimers associated with F-actin barbed ends. The F-actin barbed end capping activity is due to the &#x0201c;leaky capper&#x0201d; property of FH2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003439-Zigmond2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003439-Pring1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, which causes rate reduction in both polymerization and depolymerization of F-actin. However, formins also prevent other tight capping proteins such as capZ homologues and gelsolin from tight-capping to barbed ends of F-actin. As a result, formins accelerate instead of attenuate actin nucleation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003439-Zigmond2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to FH2 domain, another two conserved FH domains are the proline-rich FH1 and FH3 domains.

Although, the actin nucleating mechanisms and cellular functions of Drfs have been intensively studied, the roles of Drfs and other formins during embryonic development are still not well understood.

However, the inhibition of cytokinesis induced by blocking the FH protein hinders its functional study at the later gastrulation stage. The dynamic cellular migration during gastrulation is also difficult to monitor in an opaque <italic>X. lavis</italic> embryo. As a result, the zebrafish is an excellent model to study the gastrulating cellular movement, since zebrafish embryos are transparent throughout early development. Furthermore, a popular morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) gene knockdown approach allows easy manipulation of gene activity in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003439-Nasevicius1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Although MO is ineffective in blocking maternal protein activity, it is advantageous for allowing embryos to pass through the early cleavage period in the presence of MOs targeting cytokinesis-essential genes like Drfs. Therefore, the effects of Drfs on cell migration during gastrulation can be examined by applying the MO approach. We have identified a Diaphanous-related formin gene, <italic>zdia2</italic>, in zebrafish and found that it is ubiquitously expressed throughout early development. zDia2 was also shown to be essential along with the actin binding protein, profilin I, for epiboly formation and convergent extension, possibly via regulating gastrulating cell protrusive activities.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cloning, sequencing, and expression profile analysis of <italic>zdia2</italic></title><p>To investigate the roles of Diaphanous during embryonic development, we first cloned a <italic>diaphanous</italic> gene with the 5&#x02032; terminal partial sequence in zebrafish.

Membrane blebbing is the first sign of cell motility when non-motile blastomeres transform into motile blastula cells.

Two of them are ring-like structures which form at the interface between EVL and YSL and the margin of deep cells. These actin structures are essential for the completion of epiboly, since the progression of epiboly can be interfered by disrupting actin rings using cytochalasin B. The actin condensation at the front margin of deep cells we observed in this study is more like the so-called &#x0201c;mesh-like network&#x0201d; of cortical microfilaments described in Cheng's study. This mesh-like network has been described in the deep cells of killifish gastrula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003439-Hogan1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> and has been reported to play a major role in most crawling cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003439-Verkhovsky1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the thicker ring-like actin band recruited at the interface of EVL and YSL starting after 50&#x00025; epiboly was also examined in this study. By knocking down <italic>zdia2</italic> using MOs, we observed both a notable reduction in this F-actin condensation at the leading edge of the marginal deep cells, and abolished recruitment of actin band at YSL. This might lead to two possible outcomes, including abolishment of cell blebbing and prevention of F-actin mesh-like network constriction for epibolic movement. Subsequently, its cooperation with myosin via a so-called &#x0201c;purse-string mechanism&#x0201d;, which has been described in similar gastrulation processes such as dorsal closure in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003439-Martin1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, ventral closure in <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003439-WilliamsMasson1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, and possibly in epiboly of deep cells in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003439-Kane1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, would also be suppressed. Theses results confirm the presence of these F-actin structures around the margin of migrating blastoderm and their importance in epibolic movement. We also provide further evidence to show that zDia2 is necessary for the integrity of these F-actin structures. In addition, the necessity of Diaphanous gains further support in a recent report showing that Diaphanous is essential for contractile actomyosin assembly and stabilization during gastrulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003439-Homem1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>.

To determine the interactions of these small GTPases with zDia, we adopted the PROQUEST&#x02122; yeast two-hybrid system (Invitrogen), and all procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, constitutively active zebrafish Rho-GTPase genes, including G14VRhoA, G12VRac1, and Q61LCdc42 genes, were cloned into the pDBLeu vector, while the 5&#x02032; half of <italic>zdia2</italic> of 1487 bp from the start codon was cloned into the pPC86 vector. Active Rho-GTPases in the pDBLeu vector were co-transformed into host yeast cells (strain MaV203) with the 5&#x02032;half of <italic>zdia2</italic> in the pPC86 vector, respectively. Transformed cells containing both vector constructs were selected with nutrition-deficient medium plates lacking the essential amino acids, leucine and tyrosine. Finally, co-transformed cells were re-streaked onto plated medium lacking histidine with various concentrations of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazo (3AT), and left to grow at 30&#x000b0;C for 2 days. The interaction of the activation domain with the DNA-binding domain induces <italic>HIS3</italic> gene expression which was examined by the growth of yeast cells in medium plates without histidine.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Morpholino oligonucleotide microinjections</title><p>Antisense MOs were purchased or custom made by Gene Tools, LLC (Philomath, OR). A standard control MO (stdMO, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3&#x02032;</named-content>) with no sequence homology to any known zebrafish sequences was used. To knock down the <italic>zdia2</italic> gene activity, we used two different MOs targeting the translation initiation site and the splicing donor of the fourth intron to abolish translation and delete the core Rho-binding domain, respectively. The translation-blocking MO was designated tMO of the following sequence with the target site in parentheses: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-AGCTGCCTGCTGATCCATCTTTGGA-3&#x02032;</named-content> (&#x02212;7 to &#x0002b;18).

The MOs were dissolved in sterile double-distilled water to 1 mM and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. MOs were diluted to the desired working concentrations in 1&#x000d7; Danieau's buffer with 0.5&#x00025; phenol red and stored at 4&#x000b0;C before use. Thin-wall (1 mm (o.d.)&#x000d7;0.75 mm (i.d.)) glass capillaries with filaments (A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA) were pulled using a horizontal puller (P-97, Sutter Instrument, Navato, CA). Embryos at one-cell stage were immobilized at an injection trough on a 100-mm 2&#x00025; agar plate. MOs were prepared as described at designated concentrations and back-loaded into a pulled capillary. A loaded capillary was forced into the chorion and the yolk cells to reach the junction between the yolk cells and blastodisc where the solution was ejected by using a pressure injector (IM-300, Narishige, Japan). We estimated the injection volume by the clearance of cytoplasm (0.5&#x00025; of 1-cell yolk volume).
