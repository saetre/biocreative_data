After PH of 2-AAF treated rats, clusters of AFP positive cells occurred in the periportal region. In the Northern blot analysis, a positive hybridization signal for the full-length AFP-RNA was observed only in liver samples from 2-AAF treated rats after PH. In real-time PCR analysis, the full-length AFP-RNA was highly up regulated in the fetal liver (maximum at day 14: 21,500 fold); after PH of 2-AAF treated rats, the full-length AFP-RNA was also up regulated up to 400 fold (day 7 after PH).

The oval cells are not typical hepatocytes; they are indeed less mature cells that can function as progenitors for either hepatocytic or ductal cell lineages. This kind of cells express alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. AFP is an oncofetal gene, which occurs at high rate in the yolk sac, fetal liver and intestine; but is otherwise shut off in the first weeks after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the adult liver, AFP is expressed in only very small amounts; nonetheless, AFP expression can resume in certain pathophysiological situations, such as liver regeneration (<italic>e.g</italic>., after surgical resection) and liver carcinogenesis (<italic>e.g</italic>., hepatocellular carcinoma). Increased AFP gene expression occurs, for example, in humans suffering from chronic liver disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and was considered to be a marker for hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. For studying the expression of AFP, <italic>in vivo</italic>, different animal models of liver damage, regeneration and carcinogenesis are available. In the rat liver multiple AFP-RNA transcripts can be generated. The different AFP-RNA transcripts are differentially regulated during development, the full-length AFP-RNA [major form; 2.1 kilobases (kb)] is highly expressed in the fetal liver and the three smaller variants (1.7, 1.4 and 1.0 kb) are expressed in adult rat liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The full-length AFP-RNA, however, is strongly increased in rat livers with proliferation of a putative progenitor cell compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The smaller transcript sizes of the AFP-RNA are expressed in adult rat liver and their steady state level does not change significantly in regenerating livers after partial hepatectomy (PH) or after toxic liver injury.</p><p>For understanding the mechanism of liver regeneration and hepatocarcinogenesis, it might be important some further knowledge about the regulation of the AFP gene. The transcription of the AFP gene is under the control of, at least, three enhancers and one silencing element in rat and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These factors work in a highly tissue-specific manner in the three organs derived from the endodermal layer &#x02013; namely, the yolk sac, liver and intestine. In a carefully performed study, <italic>in vitro</italic>, and published recently, Bois-Joyeux <italic>et al </italic>. suggested that amounts and/or activities of the orphan nuclear receptors could modulate AFP gene expression in different pathophysiological conditions, such as liver regeneration and liver carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Two closely related groups of transcription factors seemed to be involved in the regulation of AFP gene expression, explicitly the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR) and Rev-Erb group. The first group contains three genes: ROR-&#x003b1;, ROR-&#x003b2; and ROR-&#x003b3; ; the second group includes Rev-Erb A and Rev-Erb B. The ROR-&#x003b1;, Rev-Erb A and Rev-Erb B gene products are co-expressed in several tissues, including the heart, brain, liver and skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The RORs act mostly as activators, whereas the Rev-Erb gene products most often act as transcription repressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Both families of transcription factors act together with cofactors, such as GRIP-1 for RORs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and N-CoR for Rev-Erbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. As both nuclear factors bind to regulatory sites with very similar DNA sequences, there is a possibility of a cross-talk between different signalling pathways. Furthermore, both ROR-&#x003b1; and Rev-Erb A modulate the effect of other nuclear factors such as T3 receptor on transcription level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>experiments suggested that the AFP gene is a target of ROR-&#x003b1;, Rev-Erb A and Rev-Erb B. Over-expression of ROR-&#x003b1; stimulated the activity of the AFP enhancers in a dose-dependent manner whereas overproduction of Rev-Erb A and Rev-Erb B had a down regulating effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to analyse the expression of full-length AFP-RNA, as a possible oval cell marker, and the expression of the orphan nuclear receptor (Rev-Erb A, Rev-Erb B and N-CoR) during liver regeneration [PH with or without 2-acetyl-aminofluren (2-AAF) treatment], acute liver injury [CCl<sub>4 </sub>treatment] and in the fetal rat liver. Therefore, we studied the distribution of the AFP-RNA (full-length as well as smaller sizes of AFP-RNA) by real-time PCR, by Northern blot and Western blot analyses, in rat liver after CCl<sub>4 </sub>treatment, after PH with and without 2-AAF treatment and in the fetal liver. Additionally, we studied AFP gene expression in the liver of rats after intramuscular injection of turpentine oil (model of acute phase response), as a control. At the same time points the expression of Rev-Erb A, Rev-Erb B and N-CoR were studied on mRNA level by real-time PCR.</p><p>We found that orphan nuclear receptor genes were not only down regulated when the "fetal" AFP gene was up regulated but also in cases where it was unchanged, questioning the regulatory role of those genes on expression of fetal AFP, <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of AFP protein in the different rat models</title><p>Liver cryostat sections were performed from all used animal models (normal liver regeneration, liver regeneration via oval cells, acute liver injury by CCl<sub>4</sub>-treatment and acute phase response by turpentine oil treatment). Immunostaining with an antibody against AFP showed that AFP-positive cells could be seen only in the liver of 2-AAF treated rats after PH. AFP-positive cells were localized in clusters of oval cells, in the periportal region, at day 7 after PH with 2-AAF treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). No AFP-positive cells could be seen during normal liver regeneration, after acute liver injury or after injection of turpentine oil.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Immunohistochemical detection of AFP in progenitor cells</bold>.

In rats treated with 2-AAF after PH, the proliferation of the hepatocytes is blocked and the regeneration of the liver takes place by differentiation of the oval cells into hepatocytes. By Northern blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), we could be shown that the full-length APF-RNA is expressed in this situation. For real-time PCR analysis two different primers pairs (AFP1 and AFP2) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) were designed. Real-time PCRs were performed at the same time points with those primers, interestingly in the case of primer AFP1 a strong increase of specific transcripts could be observed in comparison to the control and in case of primer AFP2 only a weak increase could be observed. To make sure that primer AFP1 can detect possibly the oval cell specific full-length AFP-RNA during liver regeneration in 2-AAF treated rats after PH, the amplification product of primer AFP1 was used as a probe for Northern blot analysis. The latter was performed with liver RNA samples of 2-AAF treated rats after PH and after sham operation. A positive hybridization signal, of about 2.1 kb, was observed only in liver samples from 2-AAF treated rats after PH; but not after sham operation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In order to support our assumption, the two primer pairs were also tested in fetal rat liver &#x02013; here, the full-length AFP-RNA is highly expressed. Real-time PCR analysis showed a strong increased expression of full-length AFP-RNA (AFP1) with a maximum at day 14 (21,500 fold) <italic>post coitum </italic>and only a weak expression (582 fold) of the smaller AFP-RNA variants (AFP2) at the same time points (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) could be demonstrated. Therefore, we concluded that primer AFP1 detects the full-length AFP-RNA and the primer AFP2 detects the truncated AFP.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Detection of the oval cell typical AFP-RNA product by Northern blot analysis</bold>.

In the middle RNA samples of sham operations at day 3 and day 7 are shown. The two lanes on the right site show RNA samples from day 3 and day 7 after partial hepatectomy of 2-AAF treated rats.

Therefore, Western blot analyses were performed with samples of PH rats with and without 2-AAF treatment. Actually, only human specific antibodies against Rev-Erb A and Rev-Erb B are available, whereas Rev-Erb B should cross-react with the rat. Those available antibodies have been not tested from the manufactures in "natural samples", they have only been tested in CHO-cells transfected with full-length Rev-Erb A and Rev-Erb B transcript. The protein size of the Rev-Erb A and Rev-Erb B is 70 kDa. In the Western blot analysis, no specific band could be detected at 70 kDa (data not shown). There are two possible reasons for our finding: (1) the antibodies are not specific for rat samples or (2) the protein level is too low, because Rev-Erb A and Rev-Erb B are down regulated in our models. Samples for Western blot analysis were also extracted from rat hepatoblasts and human hepatoma cells (Hep G2, Hep 3B); but also in these cell-lines no specific band could be detected at 70 kDa.</p><p>The same antibodies were also used for immunohistological techniques. Different immunohistological techniques (standard indirect peroxidase staining and enhanced peroxidase-based detection (Envision; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark)) were applied on differently fixated liver sections (methanol-acetone fixated and paraformaldehyde fixated) proved unsuccessful in the rat (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis of AFP expression in the different models</title><p>The expression of the AFP protein was analysed by Western blot technique. The full-length AFP-RNA, which is highly expressed in the fetal liver, is translated into 68 kDa and 70 kDa proteins, whereas the smaller AFP-RNA variants, which are expressed in the adult liver, are translated into smaller proteins of 58 kDa, 54 kDa and 44 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Firstly, we performed Western blot analysis with fetal liver (days 12, 14, 16 and 18) for verifying whether the used AFP antibody detected the full-length AFP-RNA protein of 68 kDa and 70 kDa. In the Western blot analysis at day 14, a strong band could be detected at 68 kDa and 70 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Western blot analysis of AFP expression in the rat liver</bold>.

After PH and 2-AAF treatment, a clearly weaker expression of proteins with a size of 68 kDa and 70 kDa could be seen; but no smaller protein products could be observed.

AFP is used as a serum marker for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Elevated serum AFP level has also been observed in various chronic liver diseases, where continuous hepatocellular damage occurs and hepatocellular regeneration is supposed to take place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In this case, mature hepatocytes are supposed to differentiate back to hepatoblasts and to be responsible for the increased serum levels of fetal AFP. Nevertheless, and in one study, AFP expression was not found in regenerating human liver after PH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Although many investigations on the function of AFP had been carried out, the regulation and biological role of AFP is still unclear.</p><p>The adult liver can regenerate by mature hepatocytes reentering into cell cycle after surgical resection or injury. However, this proliferative response is often impaired in chronic liver disease. Activation of a facultative stem cell compartment (oval cells) is considered as an alternative mechanism for regeneration in chronic liver disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In rodent models of hepatocarcinogenesis and non-carcinogenic injury models, it has been suggested that oval cells might represent a facultative hepatic progenitor/stem cell compartment proliferating and differentiating both into hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells, under certain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. PH combined with 2-AAF feeding is a traditional model to activate oval cells, in rat liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Several markers for oval cells have been suggested. However, many of those markers are not specific for oval cells; but are expressed by biliary epithelial cells (CK-7, CK-19) and by hematopoietic cells (c-kit, Thy-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. AFP gene expression seems to represent the most reliable marker for oval cells, because it is widely studied in human and animal models and it is not expressed by other cell types, with the exception of some hepatocellular carcimoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We studied the expression of the full-length AFP-RNA (major form, 2.1 kb mRNA) and of the smaller splicing variants during liver regeneration, acute liver injury, in the fetal liver and under conditions of acute phase response in the rat. Northern blot analysis showed that the full-length AFP-RNA occurs only after PH in 2-AAF treated rats; but not after sham operation of 2-AAF treated rats or in normal controls.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry revealed clusters of AFP-positive cells in the periportal region of 2-AAF treated rats after PH at day 7, the typical area in which early proliferation of oval cells takes place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. At the same time points, real-time PCR analysis were performed with the two different AFP primers (AFP1 and AFP2). Interestingly, and in the case of primer AFP1, a strong increase could be observed in comparison to the normal control and in case of primer AFP2 only a weak increase could be observed. For verifying whether primer AFP1 could possibly detect the full-length AFP-RNA during liver regeneration in 2-AAF treated rats after PH, the amplification product of primer AFP1 was used as a probe for Northern blot analysis. This was performed with liver RNA samples of 2-AAF treated rats, after PH or after sham operation. A positive hybridization signal of about 2.1 kb was observed only in liver samples from 2-AAF treated rats after PH; but not after sham operation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In order to support our assumption, the two primer pairs were also tested in fetal rat liver. In the fetal liver the full-length AFP-RNA is highly expressed. In real-time PCR analysis, a strongly increased expression of full-length AFP-RNA (AFP1) with a maximum at day 14 (21,500 fold) could be shown. Only a weak expression (582 fold) of the smaller AFP-RNA variants (AFP2) at the same time points was seen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Fetal AFP was not detected in the liver of animals after normal PH. In this vein, we concluded that primer AFP1 detects the full-length AFP-RNA and the primer AFP2 detects the truncated AFP. The full-length AFP-RNA is translated into a 68 kDa and 70 kDa protein. The AFP antibody we used for the Western blot analysis detected the 68 kDa and 70 kDa protein in fetal liver; a strong signal could be seen at those sizes. But in case of rats treated with 2-AAF and PH, only weak signals could be detected by 68 kDa and 70 kDa at the different time points; furthermore, smaller protein products could be not seen, however, no strong changes could be observed on protein level. The possible explanation for these findings is that the amount of the full-length AFP-RNA protein is very low in comparison with that contained in the fetal liver, therefore, no changes could be detected in those samples. The difference between fetal AFP gene expression in the fetal liver (maximum at day 14: 21,500 fold) and in the liver of 2-AAF treated animals after PH (maximum at day 7: 400 fold) was about 54 fold.</p><p>In the CCl<sub>4 </sub>rat model of acute liver damage an increase of full-length AFP-RNA (AFP1) up to 7 fold, and of the smaller splicing variants (AFP2) up to 5 fold could be observed after 72 h hours. Our results are similar to those of Lemire <italic>et al </italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; in fact, they described also the maximum increase of the full-length AFP-RNA after 72 hours and of the smaller transcripts up to 4 fold at the same time point.</p><p>In the model of normal liver regeneration (PH without 2-AAF treatment), the full-lenght AFP-RNA transcript (AFP1) is slightly down regulated at each time point, no really strong changes could be detected. But in case of the smaller AFP-RNA transcripts (AFP2), a continuous down regulation from 2 hours (- 4.7 fold) up to 16 hours (-25.7 fold) could be seen. Compared to 16 hours, an increase of the smaller splicing products up to -5.1 fold could be observed after 24 hours; then, the level of do not change up to 72 hours. The slight changes in the case of full-length AFP-RNA and the stronger chances in case of the smaller variants of AFP-RNA, as described above, support the theory that, in the adult liver, normally only the smaller variants were expressed and no regeneration takes place via oval cells. No induction of the full-length AFP-RNA or the smaller AFP-RNA transcript could be observed after induction of an acute phase reaction by turpentine oil in our control model.</p><p>So far, the exact regulation of AFP is still unknown; therefore, another aim of our study was to analyse the expression of the orphan nuclear receptors genes (Rev-Erb A, Rev-Erb B and N-CoR) suggested to control the expression of AFP negatively. Transfection experiments performed on human Hep G2 hepatoma cells showed that overproduction of ROR-&#x003b1; stimulated the activity of AFP enhancers in a dose-dependent manner, whereas that of Rev-Erb A and Rev-Erb B had the opposite effect. It was suggested that the activities of those orphan receptors in cells of hepatic or endodermal origin could modulate AFP gene expression, in response to a variety of developmental or carcinogenic stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In our study, the expression of the orphan receptors Rev-Erb A, Rev-Erb B and N-CoR was investigated, <italic>in vivo</italic>, and in different animal models of liver regeneration, liver injury, acute phase reaction and in the fetal liver. In these models, a down regulation of the orphan receptors (Rev-Erb A, Rev-Erb B and N-CoR) could be seen, at nearly all time points. The expression of the full-length AFP-RNA was up regulated after PH in 2-AAF treated rats (maximum at day 7: 400 fold) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and after acute liver damage (CCl<sub>4 </sub>treatment; maximum after 72 hours: 7 fold) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) at the same time points Rev-Erb A and Rev-Erb B were always down regulated. That means that at those time points no inhibitory effect of Rev-Erb A and Rev-Erb B of the AFP gene expression takes place. However, no AFP up regulation was observed in the other models when the genes of the orphan nuclear receptors were also down regulated. But the reason why the orphan nuclear receptors were down regulated at nearly all time points still remains unclear. Possible explanations for those findings are, on the one hand, that the regulation of the AFP gene and the orphan nuclear receptors differs in different organisms and, on the other hand, that <italic>in vivo </italic>some other additional factors may participate in the regulation of the AFP gene expression and of the orphan nuclear receptors. Because no rat specific antibodies against Rev-Erb A and Rev-Erb B were commercially available, an attempt to verify the results of the Real-time PCR at protein level could be not performed. Therefore, and as an alternative, we tried Western blot analysis and immunohistological staining with human antibodies; but no specific signal could be detected. Possible explanations for these findings are: (1) the antibodies do not react with the rat samples or (2) the protein level is too low. For addressing to the second point, we studied the relationship between full-length (fetal AFP) and adult (smaller variants) AFP on RNA level and, then, on protein level. The difference between expression of the full-length AFP-RNA in the fetal rat liver (maximum at day 14: 21,500 fold) and after PH in 2-AAF treated rats (maximum at day 7: 400 fold) was about 54 fold. On protein level, studied by Western blot analysis, we could reproduce these results. In comparison to the fetal liver, with a strong specific signal, the full-length AFP protein was only barely detectable in the total liver proteins of the rat livers after PH with after 2-AAF treatment. Therefore, it is understandable that the detection of transcription factors like the orphan nuclear receptors became even more difficult, because they are normally low expressed and in this study additional still down regulated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The proliferation of oval cells could be demonstrated in 2-AAF treated rats after PH, on RNA level by real-time PCR with a specific primer pair (AFP1) and on protein level by immunostaining. Only traces of the oval cell specific AFP transcripts could be observed in regenerating livers without 2-AAF treatment. The orphan receptor genes, which could influence the AFP gene expression <italic>in vitro</italic>, showed in the oval cell model (PH with 2-AAF treatment) and, in the model of acute liver damage, a down regulation of Rev Erb A and Rev Erb B at the same time points of the up regulation of the AFP gene expression. Yet, down regulation of the orphan nuclear receptor genes could also be observed nearly at all time points in the different model; therefore, the correlation of AFP gene and orphan nuclear receptors is not really clear. Further investigations will be necessary for understanding the regulation of AFP gene in rodent models of oval cell proliferation and in human hepatocellular carcinomas. Eventually, novel regulatory factors of AFP gene expression could be utilized as early markers of hepatocarcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male Wistar rats (180&#x02013;200 g) were provided by Winkelmann (Borchen, Germany) and used for animal models of acute liver injury or acute phase response and further used for studying liver regeneration after PH.
