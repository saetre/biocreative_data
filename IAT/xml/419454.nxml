The contact-based alignment routine optimizes the score of matched contacts, which involves four (two per contact) instead of two residues per match in pairwise alignments. The first contact refers to a real side-chain contact in a template sequence with known structure, and the second contact is the equivalent putative contact of a homologous query sequence with unknown structure. An algorithm has been devised to perform a pairwise sequence alignment based on contact information. The contact scores were combined with PAM-type (Point Accepted Mutation) substitution scores after parameterization of gap penalties and score weights by means of a genetic algorithm. We show that owing to the structural information contained in the CAO matrices, significantly improved alignments of distantly related sequences can be obtained. This has allowed us to annotate eight putative <italic>Drosophila</italic> IGF sequences. Contact-based sequence alignment should therefore prove useful in comparative modelling and fold recognition.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Protein sequence alignments reveal information about the relation between homologous sequences. Closely related sequences yield mostly unambiguous alignments, but distantly related sequences with sequence identities between 15 and 30&#x00025; (the so-called twilight zone) pose a difficult problem to sequence alignment routines, because the signal of similarity is heavily disturbed by &#x02018;noise&#x02019; from mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c1">1</xref>). Protein structure alignments serve as standard of truth for judging evolutionary relatedness, since structures are much better conserved than sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c2">2</xref>). Although the structure of most sequences is unknown, it can be inferred in many cases by comparative modelling and fold recognition. Comparative modelling delivers useful models that can attain a quality comparable to experimentally derived structures. However, the quality is crucially dependent on the accuracy of the underlying sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c3">3</xref>), which is exponentially decreasing with increasing evolutionary distance of the related sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c4">4</xref>).</p><p>In conventional sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c17">17</xref>), structural information available from the template is ignored, because alignment programs use PAM-type (Point Accepted Mutation) substitution matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c18">18</xref>), which incorporate only sequence information. For the purpose of improving sequence alignment accuracy, we introduce here an alignment method that uses structural information from side-chain contacts. Contacts describe constraints between residues and particularly long-range contacts can help defining the relative arrangement of sequence elements. Alignment scores are provided by the CAO substitution matrices (Contact Accepted mutatiOn), which are derived from an evolutionary Markov model of side-chain contact substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c19">19</xref>). The CAO matrices describe the mutation probability of side-chain contacts within a protein and therefore they combine sequence and structure information in a single scoring scheme. CAO scores often reflect evolutionary relatedness better than PAM scores. We introduce a contact-based sequence alignment algorithm, which transfers information from a template protein structure to the alignment process by means of CAO scores. The predictive power of the method is illustrated by the annotation of eight putative <italic>Drosophila</italic> IGF sequences through alignment to a human IGF-I sequence. The annotation is supported by a comparative model based on the contact-based alignment and independently generated <italic>de novo</italic> structural models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Programs were written in the &#x02018;ANSI C&#x02019; programming language and compiled with the GNU or Intel compiler on Linux 2.4.</p><sec><title>The CAO contact matrix</title><p>The CAO substitution matrix is based on a Markov model of protein side-chain contact evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c19">19</xref>). CAO scores are an intermediate between the purely sequence-based PAM scores and the purely structure-based &#x02018;Root Mean Square Deviation&#x02019; (RMSD) values. The CAO matrix comprises 400 &#x000d7; 400 contact substitution scores, where rows and columns consist of the 20 &#x000d7; 20 possible combinations of residue contacts, and each matrix cell contains a score for the evolutionary transition (mutation) from a contact denoted by the row axis to a contact denoted by the column axis. Thus, knowing the side-chain contacts within a template structure, an alignment of the template sequence with a query sequence can be scored by summing up the CAO substitution matrix values of all contacts.</p></sec><sec><title>The contact-based alignment algorithm</title><p>Structural information of the template is passed to the alignment program in the form of a side-chain contact map. A contact is defined if the distance between two side-chain spheres is smaller than the diameter of a solvent molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c19">19</xref>), which is 2.8 &#x0212b; for water. A sequence alignment method using the CAO matrix considers contact pairs consisting of four residues: two residues that are known to contact in the template sequence are aligned to two contact residues of the query sequence. For example, if the template residues A and B are in contact (A&#x0005f;B), and aligned to query residues X and Y, the CAO score of A&#x0005f;B:X&#x0005f;Y can be assigned (&#x02018;&#x0005f;&#x02019; indicates a contact, &#x02018;:&#x02019; indicates an alignment).</p><p>Needleman-Wunsch-type dynamic programming is not suited for using CAO contact scores directly, because the alignment of the second matched pair (B:Y) needs to be known to correctly score the first matched pair (A:X) and vice versa. This violates the independence assumption, i.e. the prerequisite that the score of each matrix cell should be independent of any other cell.</p><p>Therefore, we devised an alignment algorithm that incorporates CAO contact scores by pre-processing into a dynamic programming (DP) matrix, such that DP can be performed on this matrix after pre-processing. The algorithm works as follows: the structure of the query sequence (containing residues X and Y) is unknown and therefore the position of the putative homologous contact X&#x0005f;Y in the query is unknown. Thus, the query has to be probed for potential positions of this contact by testing all possible realizations on the query sequence, assuming that the query residues are in contact as well (X&#x0005f;Y) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f1">1</xref>). When this scheme is applied to a DP matrix, all contacts of the template are slid over the query sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f2">2</xref>). Each possible (and hypothetical) realization of a contact is probed with CAO scores: likely contact mutations yield positive scores, unlikely contact mutations yield negative scores. At each position of the sliding contact, the CAO score of the contact match is added to each of the two DP matrix cells involved. Most residues form multiple contacts, and their scores are summed up in the matrix. After scoring all contacts (pre-processing), the optimal alignment is found by forward score addition and back-tracing as in the standard DP alignment algorithms. Routines for local and global alignment have been implemented. To compensate for potentially missing local contact information in the template, the DP matrix is complemented with PAM-type substitution matrix scores.</p><p>The algorithm can be summarized as follows: (i) Slide each contact of the template over the query sequence and, at each position, add the (weighted) CAO score of the four involved residues to the two corresponding matrix cells. (ii) Fill the alignment matrix with PAM-type substitution scores. (iii) Find the optimal path through the matrix by forward score addition and back-tracing.</p><p>A complication is the use of float values in the CAO matrix, which can, without precaution, lead to rounding errors and failure of the DP routine during the traceback phase. This has been solved by incorporating a small allowance for score deviations caused by rounding errors.</p></sec><sec><title>Benchmarking</title><p>The contact-based alignment was benchmarked using the Homstrad database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c20">20</xref>). Only families containing two single-chain sequences were considered (624 alignments in total), since multiple alignments could change the pairwise relationships: the result of aligning two sequences in an optimal pairwise alignment or in a multiple alignment is not necessarily identical. Of the 5304 PDB structures used for the design of the CAO matrices, 355 (6.7&#x00025;) were contained in the Homstrad benchmark set. The fraction of identical alignment positions when comparing the CAO alignment with the reference Homstrad alignments served as quality measure (or fitness function) and was reported as &#x02018;fraction correct pairs&#x02019;. The T-Coffee alignment program (version 1.37) was used for comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c16">16</xref>). T-Coffee is invariably the top performing algorithm in recent multiple sequence alignment benchmarks.</p></sec><sec><title>Parameterization</title><p>To scale the CAO scores relative to PAM-type scores from Blosum62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c21">21</xref>) or PAM120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c18">18</xref>), four parameters were optimized by running the CAO alignment algorithm using a genetic algorithm (GA): a CAO matrix constant <italic>c</italic>, the relative weight <italic>w</italic> of CAO versus PAM-type scores, gap-opening penalty <italic>p</italic> and gap extension penalty <italic>q</italic>. Thus, CAO and PAM scores are combined to</p><p><italic>s</italic><sub>CAO</sub>(i,k) &#x0003d; <italic>s</italic><sub>PAM</sub>(i,k) &#x0002b; <italic>ws</italic><sub>CAO</sub>(i,j,k,l) &#x0002b; <italic>c</italic> and <italic>s</italic><sub>CAO</sub>(j,l) &#x0003d; <italic>s</italic><sub>PAM</sub>(j,l) &#x0002b; <italic>ws</italic><sub>CAO</sub>(i,j,k,l) &#x0002b; <italic>c</italic></p><p>while gap penalties <italic>p</italic>,<italic>q</italic> influence the final path through the matrix. The GA was performed with a population size of 100 individuals (genomes) over eight generations, where the 20 fittest individuals were selected for mating. Mating was performed on randomly chosen parent pairings (of the 20 fittest individuals) and the child inherited parameters from either parent at random. An individual&#x02019;s genome was composed of four parameter values (genes). The starting population was random with target ranges (step width in parentheses): CAO matrix constant <italic>c</italic> &#x0005b;0&#x02013;0.9 (0.1)&#x0005d;, relative weight <italic>w</italic> &#x0005b;0&#x02013;0.45 (0.05)&#x0005d;, gap-opening penalty <italic>p</italic> &#x0005b;5&#x02013;14 (1)&#x0005d; and gap-extension penalty <italic>q</italic> &#x0005b;0&#x02013;4.5 (0.5)&#x0005d;. Each GA run reached convergence within eight generations and was repeated three times. To prove the optimized parameters&#x02019; independence of the particular sequence set, the GA parameterization was additionally jack-knifed by splitting the database into two parts (first jack-knifing) and five parts (second jack-knifing). The variation of the parameters is given as standard deviation in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh566tb1">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> IGFs</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> protein sequences were downloaded from the Ensembl site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_fly/data/fasta/pep/">ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_fly/data/fasta/pep/</ext-link>). The first stage of the identification was achieved by pattern matching using the regular expression /<italic>C&#x0005c;w&#x0007b;11,14&#x0007d;C&#x0005c;w&#x0007b;4,&#x0007d;C&#x0005c;w&#x0007b;12,15&#x0007d;CC/</italic> that flexibly matches the canonical inter-chain disulfide bridges of insulin-like proteins. In the second stage, the programs Psi&#x0005f;Blast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c22">22</xref>) and Quest were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c23">23</xref>) with relaxed parameters (<italic>E</italic>-value &#x0003c; 10), since standard sequence searching methods failed to detect the (low) sequence similarity. The protein access codes of the identified sequences are AAF47991 (DIGF-1), AAF47993 (DIGF-2), AAF48005 (DIGF-3), AAF48006 (DIGF-4), AAF48007 (DIGF-5), AAF48078 (DIGF-6), AAF50020 (DIGF-7) and AAF51015 (DIGF-8). Most of the DIGFs are surely expressed as the cDNAs of all but DIGF-3 and DIGF-7 are known. Sequence alignments were produced using the contact-based sequence alignment algorithm with a CAO weight of 0.2. Comparative modelling was performed using the DeepView program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c24">24</xref>). The DIGF-3 query sequence was modelled onto the crystal structure of hIGF-I (PDB databank entry 1GZR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c25">25</xref>). Ten <italic>de novo</italic> structural models for the DIGF-3 sequence were predicted by the ROBETTA structure prediction server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c26">26</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Benchmarking</title><p>The improvement of the alignment quality in terms of structurally correct sequence relation was assessed using pairwise alignments from the Homstrad database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c20">20</xref>) as standard of truth. The agreement between the contact-based alignments with the Homstrad alignments was calculated as the fraction of identical alignment positions, given as &#x02018;fraction correct pairs&#x02019;. Optimized parameters resulting from GA runs contact-based alignment are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh566tb1">1</xref>. Each CAO score receives a weight factor <italic>w</italic> of 0.1 (in combination with Blosum62) to 0.2 (in combination with PAM120). Thus, CAO scores are one-tenth to one-fifth as important as PAM scores, but taking into account that each residue has about seven contacts, the overall contribution per residue is similar. The Blosum62 matrix performs better (81.8&#x00025;) than the PAM120 matrix (80.5&#x00025;). It is reasonable to use the CAO matrix with positive scores in combination with the Blosum62 matrix. The difference to the &#x02018;fraction correct pairs&#x02019; from Needleman-Wunsch alignment is plotted as a function of sequence identity in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f3">3</xref>. Alignment quality is improved in the region of low sequence identity.</p><p>We compared our method to the multiple alignment program T-Coffee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c16">16</xref>), which also yielded significant improvements over Needleman-Wunsch alignment, although for a different reason. The contact-based alignment routine adds structural information to the alignment, while T-Coffee combines local and global sequence information to optimize the alignment. Benchmark results are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh566tb2">2</xref>. The contact-based program performs well on the benchmark set and improves 64&#x00025; of the sequences when compared to Needleman-Wunsch alignment, and with 16&#x00025; more alignments than T-Coffee. The computational speed of the contact-based alignment is 1.6-fold slower than Needleman-Wunsch alignment, measured for a benchmark run over 624 sequences, but twice as fast as T-Coffee on the same sequence set. It is interesting to analyse the correlation between the contact-based alignments and T-Coffee alignments. The change in alignment quality of both methods was monitored by counting the number of correlated changes: 276 alignments (43&#x00025;) were improved, 76 (12&#x00025;) were worsened and 78 (12&#x00025;) were unchanged by both methods. About one-third of all alignments &#x0005b;203 (33&#x00025;)&#x0005d; showed no correlation. Thus, a combination of the two methods should further improve the quality of alignments with low sequence identity.</p><p>An example for the improvement by contact information is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f4">4</xref>. The C-terminal domain of the protein chondroitinase (Homstrad family &#x02018;Lyase&#x0005f;8&#x0005f;C&#x02019;) forms a &#x003b2;-sandwich, containing nine strands in <italic>Flavobacterium heparinum</italic> (top sequence) and eight strands in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. Repetitive secondary structure elements often exhibit a spurious sequence similarity, resulting in register-shifted alignments as shown in the T-Coffee example. In contrast, the contact-based alignment keeps the alignment in register except for the C-terminal short strand, and thus dramatically improves the alignment. The predominant 1 &#x02192; 3 side-chain contacts in &#x003b2;-sheets each correlate four residues and register shifts are less likely to yield high scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of contacts</title><p>By sliding contacts over the query sequence, we implicitly make the assumption that the distance between the contacting residues has been conserved. This assumption keeps the contact-based alignment algorithm computationally efficient and it holds for the majority of contacts, but obviously not for locations with insertion/deletion (indel) events, which disrupt the original local contact pattern. Contacts with changed residue distance add noise to the DP matrix by scoring non-homologous contact pairs, in most cases with negative scores. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f5">5</xref>A,B illustrates the conservation of sequence and structure information. Whereas the fraction of correctly aligned residues decreases toward zero with decreasing sequence identity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f5">5</xref>A), the fraction of conserved contacts (including the contact length) approaches 30&#x00025; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f5">5</xref>B). This is an illustration of the commonly known fact that &#x02018;structure is more conserved than sequence&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c2">2</xref>), and it supports the above approximation of conserved contact length. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f6">6</xref>A shows the distribution of contact distances averaged over the benchmark set of proteins from the Homstrad database. Many of the contacts are short ranged (about 24&#x00025;), within a distance of 1&#x02013;5 residues. The highest peaks (distances 1 and 3) originate from contacts within helices. Strands account for most of the contacts at a distance of two residues. The long-range contacts are quite evenly spread out over a large range of distances. Long-range contacts can be important in defining the correct relative arrangement of distant sequence elements, which is hard to achieve with classical sequence alignment. The distribution of contact numbers is given in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f6">6</xref>B. Most residues form about seven contacts, but the distribution is quite broad, leading to considerably different contributions of residues to the DP matrix.</p><p>In this context, it is instructive to plot the dependence of contact conservation upon contact distance, as given in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f7">7</xref>A. Surprisingly, the contact conservation is nearly invariant to the contact distance, with the exception of short-ranged helical contacts, which give rise to the peaks at distances 1 and 3 (compare to Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f6">6</xref>). However, the level of conservation is very dependent upon the number of contacts that each residue forms. The curve in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f7">7</xref>A reveals a good level of conservation for residues with 1&#x02013;8 contacts, and a steep decrease in conservation at higher contact numbers. A plausible explanation is that single contacts can be more easily replaced without losing essential interactions, because each single contact is less important.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> IGFs</title><p>Contact-based sequence alignment proved instrumental in our annotation of insulin-like <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome sequences. Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and insulin are hormones belonging to the insulin protein family. IGFs are essential growth factors in development, whereas insulin acts as a regulator of the blood glucose level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c27">27</xref>). The main structural difference between IGF and insulin is the post-translational tryptic cleavage of the C-peptide between A- and B-chain in insulin, while IGF remains a single-chain protein due to the lack of tryptic cleavage sites. The insulin protein family occurs predominantly in vertebrates, although insulin-like proteins are known in lower organisms, for example molluscan MIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c28">28</xref>), locust LIRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c29">29</xref>), bombyxin in the silkworm <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c30">30</xref>), insulin-like peptides in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c31">31</xref>) and DILPs in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c32">32</xref>). The reported DILP proteins possess tryptic cleavage sites in the C-peptide and therefore they are considered as insulin-type proteins.</p><p>We report here the identification of eight putative IGF-type sequences (DIGFs) in the genome of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c33">33</xref>) that have no tryptic cleavage sites. A multiple alignment of the DIGF sequences is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f8">8</xref>. The DIGFs exhibit a cysteine pattern that resembles closely the characteristic pattern of the insulin family. However, an excess amount of cysteines and the low sequence identity between human IGF (hIGF-I) and DIGFs render the matching of cysteines ambiguous when using sequence-only alignment.</p><p>Contact-based sequence alignment between the structure of hIGF-I and DIGFs yields an overall consistent picture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f9">9</xref>A). The multiple alignment between the hIGF-I sequence and some DIGFs was derived from pairwise contact-based alignments, and it illustrates the corresponding cysteine patterns (filled boxes); the connectivity is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f9">9</xref>B. The canonical inter-chain disulfide bridges C<sup>A7</sup>&#x02013;C<sup>B7</sup> and C<sup>A20</sup>&#x02013;C<sup>B19</sup> are conserved in DIGFs, but not the intra-chain disulfide bridge C<sup>A6</sup>&#x02013;C<sup>A11</sup>.</p><p>We have generated a structural model of DIGF by means of comparative modelling, based on the alignment in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f9">9</xref>A and the crystal structure of hIGF-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c25">25</xref>). The model shows that the spatial proximity of cysteines C<sup>A19</sup> and C<sup>B24</sup> allows for the formation of an additional inter-chain disulfide bridge. A slightly different pairing C<sup>A19</sup>&#x02013;C<sup>B19</sup> and C<sup>A20</sup>&#x02013;C<sup>B24</sup> has been proposed for insulin-like proteins of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c31">31</xref>). Both bonding patterns seem to be viable in principle when judged on the basis of our comparative model; however, the pattern proposed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f9">9</xref>B appears more favourable.</p><p>To further investigate our hypothesis about the insulin-like nature of the DIGFs, we submitted the DIGF-3 sequence to the ROBETTA structure prediction server that produces <italic>de novo</italic> structural models for submitted sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c26">26</xref>). Analysis of the 10 predicted structures reveals predominant topological features of A- and B-chain. The superposition of a selected model (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh566f10">10</xref>, yellow) with the hIGF-I chains (blue) illustrates the close resemblance. The B-chain is predicted to be &#x003b1;-helical in agreement with insulin-like B-chains. The A-chain tends to adopt the helix-coil-helix motif that is typical for the A-chain of insulin-like proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Contact-based sequence alignment closes a gap between pure sequence and pure structure alignments. Structural information can be used to improve alignments of homologous sequences, even if the structure of only one sequence is known. The described contact-based alignment algorithm is fast and produces improved alignments when compared to Needleman-Wunsch alignments.</p><p>The use of side-chain contact information in a sequence alignment routine introduces information about structural constraints between residues, which is ignored in classical PAM-type alignments, where the score of each aligned residue pair is independent of any other residue match. Contrastingly, in CAO contact-based alignment, the score of a residue pair match is dependent on the composition of a second match, because a contact consists of two (correlated) residues and the alignment of two contacts includes four residues. It proved advantageous to use CAO and PAM scores together, although the combination of two different scoring matrices (PAM and CAO) is non-trivial, in particular because the number of added CAO scores to a cell depends on the number of contacts the respective residue is involved in. This problem was addressed by using a GA.</p><p>Sequence alignment often serves as a first step in comparative modelling projects. Ambiguous regions in the resulting alignment are then corrected at a later stage according to the evidence from structural or functional investigations. The flow of information is typically in the order sequence &#x02192; structure &#x02192; function. In contact-based alignment, the flow of information is partially reversed to sequence &#x02190; structure, because structural information is incorporated <italic>a priori</italic>. The relevance of this method is illustrated here by its application in annotating eight putative IGF sequences from <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The structural information from the template hIGF-I is essential for the correct alignment of canonical cysteines and thus assignment of the A- and B-chain, from which a comparative model was derived. Independently generated <italic>de novo</italic> ROBETTA models support the comparative model.</p><p>Alignment routines operate with the information that is passed to them in the form of substitution scores and gap penalties. This fact has several implications: first, the scoring scheme has to match a variety of biological (evolutionary) processes; second, more information from distinct sources should improve alignments; and third, different scoring matrices can be combined but the scoring scheme requires careful parameterization. The alignment routine presented here demonstrates how, in principle, biological or physico-chemical information about sequence, structure and function can be summed up by pre-processing in a single DP matrix. Particularly interesting is the fact that long-range correlations between residues can be included. Here we have used contact information, but the scheme can be extended to include other classes of information such as phylogeny, motifs, solvation, fold, function and NMR constraints. One can envision a set of generic properties that characterize the specific features of a protein family. Similar approaches exist for fold recognition and threading tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh566c38">38</xref>), but in terms of sequence alignment, a systematic analysis remains to be performed.</p><p>Sequence similarity is a very good indicator for evolutionary relationship, because the enormous dimension of sequence space renders chance similarity highly improbable. Improving the alignment quality of distant sequences therefore allows for a better estimation of the common ancestry of proteins. Moreover, by finding appropriate features that can provide essential information to correct alignments, we might be able to learn more about the features that are important during the course of protein evolution.</p><sec><title>Availability</title><p>The contact-based alignment program &#x02018;ALICAO&#x02019;, the program &#x02018;GETCONT&#x02019; to compute contact maps from coordinate files (Protein Database format) and the CAO matrices are available from our website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ibivu.cs.vu.nl/ftp/">http://ibivu.cs.vu.nl/ftp/</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh566f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Principle of contact information transfer from structure to sequence.

Alignment of the homologous query sequence (DYG&#x02026;KIR) implies structural equivalence of the aligned residue pairs. Therefore, a contact can be tentatively assumed to exist in the query between D and K (dashed bracket). The CAO matrix yields a score for the contact match F&#x0005f;I:D&#x0005f;K.
