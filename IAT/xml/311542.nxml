Restriction enzyme mapping, heteroduplex analysis and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of nine exons. Six of these exons are homologous to the v-myb region while the other three exons are derived from the 5' region which is deleted in the viral oncogene. The sequences downstream to the sixth v-myb exon are not included in the 17 kbp of DNA sequences analyzed in this study. Comparison of the structure of the normal c-myb clone with its rearranged couterpart present in plasmacytoid lymphosarcomas revealed that the rearrangements occur in this locus as a result of viral integration. Present studies demonstrate that such a viral insertion interrupts the c-myb coding region at a region identical to that observed in the generation of the v-myb gene of avian myeloblastosis virus and results in the synthesis of mRNAs that lack the same 5' coding region.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00282-0194-a" xlink:role="5312"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00282-0199-a" xlink:role="5317"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00282-0191.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5309"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00282-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5310"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00282-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5311"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00282-0194.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5312"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00282-0195.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5313"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00282-0196.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5314"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00282-0197.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5315"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00282-0198.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5316"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00282-0199.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5317"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00282-0200.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5318"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00282-0201.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5319"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00282-0202.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5320"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
