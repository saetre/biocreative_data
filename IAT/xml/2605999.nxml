Previously, we identified caspase 8 as an effector of migration, promoting motility in a manner dependent upon phosphorylation on Tyr-380 by Src family kinases and its subsequent association with Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins. Here we demonstrate the regulation of the small GTPase Rab5, which mediates early endosome formation, homotypic fusion, and maturation by caspase 8. Regulation requires the Tyr-380 phosphorylation site but not caspase proteolytic activity. Tyr-380 is essential for interaction with the Src homology 2 domains of p85&#x003b1;, a multifunctional adaptor for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, that possesses Rab-GAP activity. Interaction between caspase 8 and p85&#x003b1; promotes Rab5 GTP loading, alters endosomal trafficking, and results in the accumulation of Rab5-positive endosomes at the edge of the cell. Conversely, caspase 8-dependent GTP loading of Rab5 is overcome by increased expression of p85&#x003b1; in a Rab-GAP-dependent manner. Thus, we demonstrate a novel function for caspase 8 as a modulator of p85&#x003b1; Rab-GAP activity and endosomal trafficking.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>CA107263</grant-num> (NCI, to D.

Rab5 cycling between the GDP- (inactive) and GTP-bound (active) forms is a process tightly controlled by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">2</xref> guanine nucleotide-exchange factors, and GDP dissociation inhibitors. This strict control is critical to the correct &#x0201c;activation&#x0201d; of Rab5 in time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>).</p><p>GTP-bound Rab5 binds many effectors, including EEA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>), Rabaptin5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>), Rabenosyn5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>), thus accounting for its influence on endosome tethering, fusion, and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). The amount of GTP-loaded Rab5 acts as a rate-limiting step influencing the extent of endosome docking and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Characterization of GAPs and guanine nucleotide-exchange factors continues to provide new insights on how membrane trafficking is regulated. Recently we characterized the p85&#x003b1; subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase as a Rab-GAP, binding Rab5 via its BH domain, providing a &#x0201c;timing&#x0201d; mechanism for GTP-bound Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Mutation in the BH domain (R274A) impairs Rab-GAP activity, altering the trafficking and degradation of tyrosine kinase receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>).</p><p>Caspase 8 is a cysteine protease that initiates apoptotic signaling via the extrinsic pathway in a manner dependent upon association with early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). However, increasing evidence has revealed unexpected non-apoptotic functions of caspase 8, including enhancement of cell adhesion and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). Importantly, after phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>) caspase 8 was shown to influence cell adhesion and migration via an interaction with p85&#x003b1; in a Rac-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, Rab5 was recently shown to regulate cell motility, acting in concert with Rac activation at the leading edge of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). As caspase 8 was previously shown to associate with peripheral endosomes, we speculated that caspase 8 might influence Rab function. Here we show that caspase 8 influences the organization of Rab5-containing early endosomes via association with, and sequestration of p85&#x003b1;. This promotes Rab5 GTP loading, inhibits endosomal maturation, and promotes accumulation of Rab5-positive endosomes at the edge of the cell. The caspase 8-dependent GTP loading of Rab5 can be overcome by increasing the expression of p85&#x003b1; but requires the phosphotyrosine binding activity of the SH2 domains as well as the Rab-GAP activity within the BH domain of p85&#x003b1;. Thus, we reveal a new function for caspase 8 as a regulator of p85&#x003b1; Rab-GAP activity and endosomal trafficking.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Materials</italic>&#x02014;Polyclonal anti-caspase 8 (catalog #559932) and monoclonal anti-caspase 8 (catalog #551242) antibodies were from BD Pharmingen.

After rinsing with PBS, cells were fixed in PBS, 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (5 min), and blocked with 2% BSA in PBS (30 min) at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with either monoclonal anti-Rab5 IgG (1:50), polyclonal anti-Rab7 IgG (1:50), polyclonal anti-M6PR IgG (1:50), or polyclonal anti-EEA1 (1:250) primary antibodies followed by incubation with the respective Alexa Fluor&#x000ae; conjugated secondary antibodies (1:250). Nuclei were stained with TO-PRO&#x000ae;-3 (1:500). Samples were then washed and mounted onto slides with the Vectashield Hard-Set mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, VT) and visualized on a Nikon Eclipse C1 confocal microscope with a 1.4 NA 60&#x000d7; oil immersion lens using minimum pinhole (30 &#x003bc;m). Images were captured using EZ-C1 3.50 imaging software and analyzed using National Institutes of Health ImageJ software.</p><p><italic>Image Analysis; Measurement of the Incidence of Cells with Peripheral Rab5</italic>&#x02014;Pictures were randomly chosen, and cells were comparatively defined as &#x0201c;positive for periphery Rab5 staining&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;negative for periphery Rab5 staining&#x0201d; based on the high or low relative staining for Rab5 at cell periphery. Then the percentage of &#x0201c;positive cells&#x0201d; was calculated with respect to the total cell number. Total cell number was counted by nuclear staining (ToPRO3). For quantification of peripheral Rab5, pictures were randomly chosen, and round-shaped cells were picked for individual analysis. Cell periphery was defined as the area between the cell surface and 2&#x02013;3 &#x003bc;m beneath (in cells ranging between 20 and 25 &#x003bc;m in diameter). This area corresponds to the &#x0223c;25% outer layer of the cell. Relative levels of Rab5 were calculated within this area by using the &#x0201c;Radial Profile Plugin&#x0201d; of the ImageJ software. A total of six cells per picture, five pictures per experiment in a total of three independent experiments was analyzed. For analysis, the red channel (Rab5 staining) was adjusted to a window/level of 160 pixels, and then a radial profile was drawn around the cell (outer circle). The integrated density of pixels was measured within this outer circle. Thereafter, a second radial profile (inner circle) was drawn with a radius of 3/4 of the outer circle. The integrated density of pixels was measured within this inner circle. Finally, an arbitrary estimation of the percentage of peripheral Rab5 was calculated as % peripheral Rab5 = 100 - (no. of pixels inner circle/no. of pixels outer circle).</p><p><italic>Co-localization Analysis</italic>&#x02014;ImageJ software was used for analysis. First, both red and green channels to be analyzed were adjusted to a window/level of 160 pixels, and the integrated intensity of pixels for each channel was measured. Thereafter, the integrated intensity of pixels co-localized was measured by using the &#x0201c;Co-localization RGB Plugin&#x0201d; of ImageJ.</p><p><italic>Immunoblotting</italic>&#x02014;Cell extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (100 m<sc>m</sc> Tris base, 150 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 1 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 m<sc>m</sc> NaF) containing protease inhibitors, boiled in Laemmli buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE on 10 or 12% acrylamide minigels (Bio-Rad) by loading 25 &#x003bc;g of total protein per lane and transferred to nitrocellulose.

Supernatants obtained after centrifugation (13,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic>, 5 min, 4 &#x000b0;C) were used for immunoprecipitation assays (500 &#x003bc;g of total protein per assay) with protein A/G beads-immobilized antibody. Caspase 8 was immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-caspase 8. The immunoprecipitated samples were solubilized in Laemmli buffer, boiled, and separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting as indicated above.</p><p><italic>GTP-loaded Rab5 Pulldown Assay</italic>&#x02014;The Rab5 pulldown assay was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>) with some modifications.

Extracts were incubated by 5 min on ice and clarified by centrifugation (10,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic>, 1 min, 4 &#x000b0;C). Post-nuclear supernatants were used immediately for pulldown assays by adding 150 &#x003bc;g of precoated beads. GSH beads were precoated with 100 &#x003bc;g of GST-R5BD by 1 h at 4 &#x000b0;C. Pulldown incubations were carried out by 15 min in a rotating shaker at 4 &#x000b0;C.

Briefly, cells were grown in 15-cm plates for 24 h in complete medium. Cell monolayers were washed in PBS and incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C with 5 ml of 2 mg/ml HRP in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10 m<sc>m</sc> glucose and 10 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES, pH 7.4 (internalization medium), at the indicated times.

Cells were scraped, collected by centrifugation at 1500 rpm at 4 &#x000b0;C for 5 min in a Sorvall RT 6000D centrifuge. Cells were then washed with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS, centrifuged at 1700 rpm at 4 &#x000b0;C for 5 min and finally resuspended in homogenization buffer (250 m<sc>m</sc> sucrose, 1 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA, 3 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole, pH 7.4), centrifuged at 2000 rpm at 4 &#x000b0;C for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 &#x003bc;l of homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitors and homogenized by 8 passages through a 22&#x000bd;-gauge needle in a 1-ml syringe (BD Biosciences). Post-nuclear supernatants were obtained by centrifuging homogenates 10 min at 3000 rpm at 4 &#x000b0;C in a bench Eppendorf centrifuge. The post-nuclear supernatants (PNS) was brought to 40.6% sucrose by mixing 400 &#x003bc;l of PNS with 600 &#x003bc;l of 60% sucrose in homogenization buffer buffer. A gradient was prepared by overlaying 1 ml of homogenate, 40.6% sucrose, 2 ml of 35% sucrose, 1.5 ml of 30% sucrose, 400 &#x003bc;l homogenization buffer (8% sucrose) in a SW55Ti centrifuge tube.

Endosome fractions were collected as follows; early endosomes at the 30/35% sucrose interface and late endosomes at the 8/30% sucrose interface. For protein screening, 45 &#x003bc;l of each fraction was mixed with sample buffer and loaded onto 10% acrylamide minigels.

Interestingly, Rac function is spatially regulated by the endocytic protein Rab5 during cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). To explore this potential link between caspase 8 and endocytic machinery, we first evaluated the cellular distribution of several endocytic markers in cells expressing or deficient for caspase 8. To this end we used the previously reported neuroblastoma cells NB7, which lack endogenous caspase 8 and those stably reconstituted for &#x0201c;physiological&#x0201d; levels of caspase 8 (<italic>i.e.</italic> higher expression than NB5 but lower than NB16) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). We assessed the distribution of early endosomal markers (EEA1 and Rab5) and late endosomal or lysosomal proteins (Rab7 and the cation-independent mannose-6 phosphate receptor (M6PR)) in this model. Interestingly, the localization of Rab5 differed in cells expressing caspase 8 relative to caspase 8-deficient cells, with accumulation of Rab5 in the cell periphery (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). This altered distribution was selective to Rab5, with no changes in expression or distribution of EEA1, Rab7, and M6PR (data not shown), suggesting that at physiological levels of expression caspase 8 did not influence all aspects of the endocytic pathway. We were unable to determine whether overexpression of caspase 8 could further augment this effect or could induce changes to secondary endosomal pathways, as overexpression of caspase 8 induces apoptosis (data not shown).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Caspase 8 induces accumulation of Rab5 positive early endosomes at the cell periphery.</bold><italic>A</italic>, localization of Rab5 in neuroblastoma cells.

The accumulation of Rab5 at the cell periphery was dependent upon expression of caspase 8, as suppression of caspase 8 with short hairpin RNA ablated the accumulation of Rab5 in the periphery (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). To further evaluate the extent of Rab5 accumulated at the cell periphery, we measured the relative levels of Rab5 within the area located within a distance of 2&#x02013;3 &#x003bc;m of peripheral edge of the cell (this distance represents &#x0223c;25% of the cell; supplemental Fig. 1). As expected, a 2-fold increase of peripheral Rab5 was associated to expression of caspase 8 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). These observations were confirmed in parallel studies expressing GFP-tagged caspase 8 in NB7 cells (supplemental Fig. 1). Overall co-localization of Rab5 with early (EEA1) or late endocytic proteins (Rab7, M6PR) was not generally affected by expression of caspase 8 (supplemental Fig. 2), confirming Rab5 as a specific target.</p><p>To extend these observations we also used A549 carcinoma cells in which endogenous caspase 8 was silenced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). In agreement with the previous results, caspase 8 expression was associated with peripheral accumulation of Rab5, whereas loss of caspase 8 promoted a more homogenous distribution throughout the cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>). The peripheral accumulation of Rab5 did not result from protein stabilization, as no significant differences in Rab5 protein levels were associated with caspase 8 expression (supplemental Fig. 3). Taken together, these data indicate that caspase 8 influences localization of Rab5 endosomes within the cell.</p><p>Importantly, most Rab5 (&#x0223c;95%) was found associated to membrane fractions, as revealed by subcellular fractionation (data not shown). These observations agree with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). Only a slight variation in membrane-associated Rab5 was detected in caspase 8-expressing cells (93 or 97% total Rab5 was found associated to membranes in cells lacking or expressing caspase 8, respectively). Because most Rab5 is membrane-associated regardless the caspase 8 status, it would appear that relevant changes are in subcellular distribution of membrane-associated Rab5. The possibility that caspase 8 affects Rab5 shuttling between different early endosome populations or between early endosomes and the plasma membrane is unexpected and potentially important.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Targeting of endocytosed HRP to late endosomes is decreased by caspase 8.</bold> Internalization assays (37 &#x000b0;C by 30 min unless otherwise indicated) were performed to analyze the distribution of HRP within late and early endosome fractions.

Analysis of purified endosome fractions (supplemental Fig. 4) revealed that the accumulation of HRP in late endosomes was substantially decreased in caspase 8-expressing neuroblastoma cells compared with caspase 8-deficient controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>left panel</italic>). Because substantial accumulation of HRP in late endosomes is observed only after 10&#x02013;15 min of internalization (data not shown), we assayed late endosomes at 30 min internalization. Similar trends were obtained after 10 min of internalization, although variation was higher (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref> and data not shown). Conversely, no differences were observed in early endosomal HRP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>right panel</italic>). Similarly, we observed an increased accumulation of HRP in late but not early endosomes from caspase 8-deficient carcinoma cells when compared with caspase 8-expressing control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). The overall internalization rate was independent of caspase 8 expression in both carcinoma and neuroblastoma cells (data not shown and see below), implicating caspase 8 in regulating the delivery of cargo between the early and late endosome.</p><p>To test this possibility directly we tracked the internalization and localization of two differentially sorted cargos; that is, transferrin (<italic>i.e.</italic> cargo destined for recycling) and LDL (a cargo destined for degradation). We observed no difference in uptake of transferrin or LDL nor did we observe any changes in transferrin recycling as a function of caspase 8 expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). The distribution of internalized transferrin was similar in these cells and co-localized to the same degree with EEA1 and Rab5 regardless of caspase 8 expression (data not shown). By contrast, the intracellular distribution of internalized LDL was markedly different when caspase 8 was expressed. Among caspase 8-deficient cells, LDL was detected throughout the cell body (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>upper left panel</italic>), whereas in caspase 8-reconstituted cells a considerable retention of LDL was seen at the cell periphery, even 30 min of post-internalization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>upper right panel</italic>). A partial co-localization of LDL with Rab5 was observed in caspase 8-expressing or -deficient cells, but this co-localization increased when caspase 8 was present (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). These data demonstrated that expression of caspase 8 influenced the localization and fate of cargo destined to late endosomes. In fact, we observed the accumulation of LDL in Rab7-positive late endosomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>) and M6PR-positive late endosomes and lysosomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>) selectively among cells lacking caspase 8 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). Importantly, caspase 8 did not affect expression or distribution of these protein markers for late endosomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that caspase 8 regulates the movement of cargo from early (Rab5) to late (Rab7) endosome compartments.</p><p><italic>Caspase 8 Catalytic Activity Is Not Required to Influence Rab5 Localization</italic>&#x02014;Proteolytic activity is required for the induction of apoptosis by caspase 8 but is dispensable for other activities, such as the promotion of cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Both apoptosis and cell migration are dependent upon endocytic processes, and it was therefore unclear whether proteolytic activity was required for caspase 8 to regulate the Rab5-mediated trafficking. Therefore, we tested a neuroblastoma cell line stably reconstituted for a catalytically inactive mutant of caspase 8 (caspase 8/C360A). Interestingly, this mutant displayed an apparent accumulation of Rab5 at the cell periphery similar to cells expressing native caspase 8 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Moreover, the expression of catalytically inactive caspase 8 resulted in decreased accumulation of HRP tracer in late, but not early, endosomes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Thus, the mutant recapitulated the caspase 8 phenotype indicating that caspase 8 activity is not required for regulation of Rab5-mediated endosomal targeting.</p><p><italic>Increased Rab5 GTP Loading in Cells Expressing Caspase 8</italic>&#x02014;The processes of early endosome fusion, early-to-late endosome conversion, and subcellular localization depend on proper Rab5 activation/inactivation in time and space, which is governed by cycling between GTP binding and subsequent hydrolysis to GDP (for review, see Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>).

Interestingly, the SH2 domains of p85&#x003b1; were recently shown to interact with a phosphorylated tyrosine (Tyr-380) located in a peptide loop between the small and large subunits of the catalytic domain of caspase 8. Interactions between SH2 domains and this tyrosine do not require caspase 8 catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Moreover, p85&#x003b1; acts as a Rab-GAP, promoting Rab5 hydrolysis of GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Therefore, we sought to determine whether p85&#x003b1; was a critical intermediate in the caspase 8-regulated Rab5 function.</p><p>We first evaluated whether caspase 8 and p85&#x003b1; interacted within our cells. Indeed, p85&#x003b1; co-precipitated with caspase 8 from cells stably (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>) or transiently (supplemental Fig. 5) expressing caspase 8. Next, we tested whether the expression of p85&#x003b1; influenced Rab5 loading. As shown for endogenous Rab5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>), caspase 8 induced an &#x0223c;8-fold increase in GTP loading of an exogenous Rab5 reporter (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref>). Importantly, p85&#x003b1; expression overcame the capacity of caspase 8 to promote Rab5 GTP loading (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref> and supplemental Fig. 5). Therefore, we sought to evaluate whether caspase 8 and p85&#x003b1; act reciprocally to control Rab5 activity. To test this possibility we used GFP-tagged caspase 8 mutants which were catalytically inactive (C360A) or unable to interact with p85&#x003b1; (Y380F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with these mutants confirmed that catalytic activity was not required for promotion of Rab5 GTP loading (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>). However, mutation of the SH2 binding site that disrupted p85&#x003b1; association (Y380F) abrogated the ability of caspase 8 to increase Rab5 GTP loading (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, <italic>A&#x02013;C</italic></xref>). The findings were extended using HEK293T cells transiently transfected with either GFP alone (control) or GFP-tagged caspase 8, caspase 8/C360A, or caspase 8/Y380F. As in the neuroblastoma cells, expression of both wild type caspase 8-GFP or caspase 8/C360A-GFP, but not caspase 8/Y380F-GFP, increased Rab5-GTP levels (supplemental Fig. 6). These data raised the notion that p85&#x003b1; association with caspase 8 might influence its ability to bind Rab5 and thereby promote GTP hydrolysis.</p><p>To address this, we expressed a p85&#x003b1;/R274A mutant (GAP-deficient) and a p85&#x003b1;/R368A/R649A double mutant (termed &#x00394;R) which lacked SH2-tyrosine binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) in neuroblastoma cells expressing caspase 8. Rab5 GTP loading was then measured. Although expression of wild type p85&#x003b1; suppressed Rab GTP loading, this required Rab5-GAP activity, as the p85&#x003b1;/R274A mutant could not overcome the caspase 8-mediated effect. Similarly, phosphotyrosine binding activity of p85&#x003b1; was critical to overcoming caspase 8-induced GTP loading, as loss of caspase 8 binding in the p85&#x003b1;/&#x00394;R mutants permitted caspase 8-induced Rab5 GTP loading (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>D</italic></xref>). Based on these results, we propose a simple initial model wherein caspase 8 may increase Rab5 GTP loading by interfering with Rab5 GAP activity of p85&#x003b1; via SH2 interactions with Tyr-380 of caspase 8 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Caspase 8 decreases delivery of endocytosed LDL to late endosomes.</bold><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, uptake of LDL (<italic>green channel</italic>) was performed and assessed with respect to delivery to late endosomes.

In these cases apoptosis is dependent upon caspase 8 activity. Here, we report a novel role for caspase 8 in controlling Rab5 localization, activity, and function. The presence of caspase 8 in a variety of cells was shown to modify early endosome topology; in particular, the accumulation of Rab5-positive endosomes at the cell periphery. In agreement with this we observed concurrent changes in cargo transport from early to late endosomes and found that these events were associated with caspase 8-dependent increases in the levels of GTP-bound Rab5.</p><p>Our results are somewhat surprising with respect to previous reports using overexpression strategies to map Rab5 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). We did not observe formation of enlarged early endosomes by caspase 8 (despite the fact that caspase 8 increased GTP loading of Rab5). Compared with the previously reported enlargement of early endosomes by expression of the Rab/Q79L mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>), the caspase 8 impact on Rab5 function was less pronounced. We could duplicate the prior reported effects by expression of Rab5/Q79L, but not Rab5/S34N, which led to formation of enlarged early endosomes in our cells. This approach revealed a substantial increase in co-localization of Rab5 with EEA1 (data not shown). Although informative, the concern with any overexpression system is that some of the effects observed may be exaggerated relative to a cell's normal physiology. Indeed, we observed no increase of EEA1/Rab5 colocalization among cells expressing caspase 8 (supplemental Fig. 2). Alternatively, such differences in localization may reflect the observation that caspase 8 also activates the small GTPase Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). Thus, it remains possible that coordinate Rac and Rab5 activation results in peripheral retention of early endosomes, which might not be observed after simple expression of active Rab5. Nonetheless, our data are consistent with a model proposing a dynamic and reversible assembly of Rab5 domains in early endosomes with a cycling-dependent &#x0201c;handoff&#x0201d; to Rab7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the role of caspase 8 during apoptosis, no proteolytic activity was required to modify endosomal targeting. These data differ from caspase-3, a related enzyme that has been reported to alter transport via a proteolysis-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). Nonetheless, recent evidence supports non-apoptotic functions for caspase 8 that are independent of catalytic activity, with several studies supporting a role for caspase 8 in cell migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). In fact, caspase 8 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine 380 in these studies. This event compromises caspase 8 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Molecular requirements for caspase 8-mediated Rab5 GTP loading.</bold><italic>A</italic>, Rab5 GTP loading was assessed by using the GST-R5BD pulldown assay among neuroblastoma cells expressing active caspase 8, inactive caspase 8(C360A), or a caspase 8 mutant deficient for phosphorylation at the Tyr-380 SH2 binding site.

This SH2 binding site has been shown to be critical for recruitment of caspase 8 to the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Thus, caspase 8 maturation and proteolytic activity could be regulated conformationally or via sequestration after SH2 binding. In this case we observe a robust association with p85&#x003b1;, a known Rab-GAP, and caspase 8, which is abrogated in a non-phosphorylated Y380F mutant. The adaptor protein p85&#x003b1; is a known regulator of endocytosis that can act through a number of mechanisms. Here we show that increased expression of p85&#x003b1; overcomes the effect of caspase 8 expression, decreasing Rab5 GTP loading; however, this requires both p85&#x003b1; Rab-GAP activity and SH2 binding function. Together the results suggest a model in which caspase 8 is located proximal to p85&#x003b1; and binds to it in a manner that influences its ability to regulate Rab5 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p>It is clear that alterations in endocytosis can affect a number of different cell pathways. In particular, cell migration and delivery of cell surface receptors are directly controlled by mechanisms involving Rab5 activation and re-localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). Our observation that caspase 8 influences endosome dynamics may provide mechanistic insights into how this protease regulates cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). The recently reported role of Rab5 in guiding Rac signaling has clear implications for cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). An intricate relationship between Rab5 and the integrin trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>) suggests coordinated signaling among endocytic, cytoskeletal, and apoptotic pathway during cell migration. These results provide a new basis to begin to understand the molecular mechanisms by which caspase 8 impacts tumor cell biology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M805878200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M805878200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs.
