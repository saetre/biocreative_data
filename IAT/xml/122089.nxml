Members of the ribonuclease III superfamily of endoribonucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] are the primary agents of dsRNA cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. RNase III orthologues are conserved in eukaryotes and in bacteria, with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] as the best characterized member. <italic>E. coli</italic> RNase III is active as a homodimer, and requires a divalent metal ion (preferably Mg<sup>2+</sup>) to hydrolyze phosphodiesters, creating 5'-phosphate, 3'-hydroxyl product termini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. <italic>E. coli</italic> RNase III cleaves rRNA and mRNA precursors as part of the respective maturation pathways. <italic>E. coli</italic> RNase III also initiates mRNA degradation, and participates in antisense RNA action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Bacterial RNase III orthologues exhibit the simplest primary structure, which includes a C-terminal dsRNA-binding motif (dsRBM), and an N-terminal catalytic (nuclease) domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The dsRBM is present in many other proteins that bind dsRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and is important for RNase III activity in <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The catalytic domain contains a number of conserved residues, including an 11 amino acid signature motif that is a distinguishing feature of RNase III orthologues. The isolated <italic>E. coli</italic> RNase III catalytic domain, which retains homodimeric behavior, can cleave dsRNA substrates under specific conditions <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The recently reported crystal structure of the catalytic domain of <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> RNase III reveals an extensive subunit interface, with the cleft between the subunits predicted to bind dsRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The two proposed active sites are positioned at each end of the intersubunit cleft and contain conserved residues from each subunit. Several highly conserved carboxylic acids in the active sites bind a single divalent metal ion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and one of these residues has been shown to be essential for catalytic activity of <italic>E. coli</italic> RNase III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Ribonuclease III superfamily members.

The RNase III orthologue "Dicer" (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) plays a central role in RNA interference (RNAi) by cleaving dsRNAs to ~21 bp fragments, termed small interfering(si) RNAs. The siRNAs are incorporated into a macromolecular complex which carries out degradation of homologous RNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Dicer action serves to inhibit viral infection and retroposon movement, and also plays a role in developmental pathways by cleaving precursors to small regulatory RNAs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]). The predicted sequence of the mouse Dicer polypeptide exhibits a single dsRBM and tandem catalytic domains. In addition, the N-terminal region contains a DExH/DEAH RNA helicase motif and a PAZ (Pinwheel-Argonaut-Zwille) domain, which is also present in other proteins involved in RNAi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The second mammalian RNase III orthologue also exhibits a single C-terminal dsRBM and tandem catalytic domains, but is otherwise structurally distinct from Dicer as it lacks the helicase and PAZ domains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Preliminary evidence indicates that this RNase III orthologue participates in rRNA maturation. Thus, a reduction in human RNase III levels <italic>in vivo</italic> causes the accumulation of specific rRNA processing intermediates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Consistent with this functional role, human RNase III localizes to the nucleolus in a cell-cycle-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A truncated form of human RNase III has been purified and shown to cleave dsRNA <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, little else is known of the functional roles or the mechanistic features of this enzyme. We report here (i) the characteristics of the cDNA sequence and predicted polypeptide of mouse RNase III, (ii) demonstrate transcript expression patterns, and (iii) report the chromosomal locations of the mouse and human RNase III genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Features of the mouse RNase III cDNA sequence</title><p>The mouse RNase III cDNA structure was determined by sequence analysis of individual cDNA clones (see Materials and Methods), whose sequences relative to the full-length sequence are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. The length of the mouse RNase III cDNA is 4487 nt (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>), and the predicted initiation codon is at position 243. This prediction is based on the occurrence of three in-frame stop codons upstream of the indicated ATG, within the 242 nt 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>). It is not firmly established if the reported 5' end nucleotide corresponds to the true 5' end of the mRNA. However, several independent partial cDNA clones (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) contain the same 5' nucleotide. There is no significant sequence similarity of the mouse 5'-UTR with that of human RNase III (245 nt). The 3'-UTR is 123 nt in size, and contains a consensus polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) 12 nucleotides from the poly(A) tail. The 3'-UTR exhibits 87% identity with the human 3'-UTR (372 nt) over a ~76 nt region, corresponding to positions 37&#x02013;113 of the mouse 3'-UTR and positions 39&#x02013;115 of the human 3'-UTR. A search of the NCBI mouse EST database yielded five independent clones which exhibit 100 percent sequence identity with the 3'-UTR (data not shown). The predicted 3'-UTR of the mouse RNase III mRNA and that of the rat RNase III mRNA share 85% nucleotide identity, and have the same lengths (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Positions of partial cDNA clones used to determine the complete cDNA sequence of mouse RNase III. The full-length cDNA is represented by the shaded bar at the top, with specific domains indicated, and the 5' and 3' UTRs marked by the hashed lines. The cDNA clones are identified by their accession numbers. The cDNA clone generated in-house from kidney cDNA is represented by a solid black line and is labeled "cDNA clone" (GenBank Accession #AF533013). The dotted line indicates the internal sequence missing from the clone. The Not1 restriction site is indicated by the asterisk and is the site of plasmid ligation for a number of the cDNA clones. That there is no missing sequence at this position is indicated by (i) the continuity of the open reading frame across this site, and (ii) an exact, continuous alignment with the human sequence across this site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-3-26-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Features of the predicted RNase III polypeptide</title><sec><title>The dsRBM and catalytic domains</title><p>Conceptual translation of the mouse RNase III cDNA, using the AUG at position 243 as the initiation codon, yields a polypeptide of 1373 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 158.8 kDa and a pI of 7.99. The polypeptide contains a single dsRBM and two RNase III catalytic domain elements (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>). The RNase III domain (i.e. the two catalytic domains and dsRBM) of the mouse and human sequences exhibit 99% amino acid identity and 88% nucleotide sequence identity. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> provides an alignment of the RNase III domains of the mouse, human, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> RNase III orthologues. The latter two sequences also exhibit strong conservation of sequence over the entire length of the region. Note also that <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNase III has a serine-rich C-terminal extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. There are two catalytic domain signature sequences present in these orthologues. The single signature sequence of bacterial RNase III orthologues not only provides residues essential for catalysis, but contributes to the subunit interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It is therefore likely that mouse RNase III is active as a homodimer. If so, the holoenzyme may contain four active sites.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Similarities of the RNase III domain (catalytic domains + dsRBM) of the human, mouse, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> RNase III orthologues.

Of the 63 prolines occurring in the PRR, 62 (98%) are conserved in the corresponding region of human RNase III. Repetitive proline sequences tend to adopt a polyproline II (PPII) helix, consisting of an extended structure with three residues per turn. A proline at every third position serves to stabilize the structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and also participates in hydrogen bonds as well as in hydrophobic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The presence of a PRR in mouse RNase III suggests protein-protein interactions important for function. PRR-mediated interactions are relatively weak and reversible, and occur with the PPII helix in the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II during transcription initiation and elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The Arginine/Serine (RS) domain</title><p>The mouse RNase III polypeptide contains an RS domain adjacent to the PRR (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>). The 13 positions containing the RS/SR dipeptide motif are shared between the mouse and human polypeptides, with an overall 87% sequence identity, with the human sequence containing an additional SR dipeptide. RS domains participate in protein-protein interactions, and RS domain-containing proteins play essential roles in constitutive or alternative mRNA splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. RS proteins bind RNA <italic>via</italic> an RNA recognition motif (RRM), allowing subsequent recruitment of splicing components <italic>via</italic> RS domain interactions. The presence of this domain in mouse RNase III suggests similar protein-protein interactions involved in RNA maturation, which may be functionally associated with components of the RNA splicing and transport machinery.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential sites of post-translational modification</title><p>Psort analysis of the predicted mouse RNase III amino acid sequence indicates three potential nuclear localization signals positioned at residues 254, 355 and 508 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>). A Prosite scan identified multiple potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C, casein kinase II and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (data not shown). Some of these signals may be involved in protein localization, as it has been shown that human RNase III localizes to the nucleolus during the cell cycle S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Mouse RNase III transcript expression patterns</title><p>The transcript expression patterns were analyzed by RT-PCR and by northern blot (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,4B</xref>). The analyses show that the mouse RNase III transcript is expressed in all adult organs examined, as well as in the E13.5 midgestation embryo, the extraembryonic yolk sac, and the placenta. Northern analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) reveals a transcript size of ~4.5 kb, which is consistent with the predicted length of the cDNA, including a poly(A) tail. The northern analysis also reveals that the transcript is heavily expressed in brain tissue and perhaps also heart tissue, while only lightly expressed in skeletal muscle. The reason(s) for the differential levels of expression is unclear, but it is of interest to note that the mouse Dicer transcript is also prominently expressed in brain and heart tissue, while only lightly expressed in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Interestingly, an additional species (~3.5 kb) is present in testis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), which may represent an alternatively processed form of the transcript. This species is not seen in the testis lane of the RT-PCR analysis, since the PCR primers are targeted to the 3'-UTR, which is most likely the same for the two transcripts.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Expression analysis of the mouse RNase III transcript. <bold>A.</bold> RT-PCR analysis of the RNase III transcript in adult mouse organs, in day 13.5 (E13.5) mouse embryo ("Embryo"), and in extra-embryonic organs ("Placenta" and "Yolk Sac").

However, the presence of an additional RNase III-specific transcript in at least one tissue indicates the possibility of alternative forms of RNase III. The broad expression pattern suggests a conserved cellular function for mouse RNase III. In this regard, sequence database searches and a southern "zoo" blot (data not shown) indicate significant conservation of the RNase III gene among many other vertebrates, including rat, rabbit and cow. However, functional roles for mammalian RNase III have yet to be fully defined. A role in rRNA maturation is suggested by the observation that antisense oligodeoxynucleotide-mediated reduction in human RNase III levels also causes a decrease in the amount of 5.8 S rRNA and a concomitant increase in the 12 S precursor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A similar defect in rRNA maturation is seen upon U8 snoRNA depletion in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. As U8 snoRNA participates in rRNA maturation, it is possible that an RNase III-dependent step also involves U8 snoRNA. Alternatively, a role for RNase III in the maturation of U8 snoRNA (as well as other snoRNAs) is a possibility. In this regard, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> RNase III orthologue Rnt1p not only cleaves the 35 S rRNA precursor within the 3'-ETS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], but also processes snoRNA and snRNA precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Further biochemical studies are required to identify the RNA targets for mammalian RNase III and to determine its involvement in RNA maturation pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Chemicals and reagents were molecular biology grade or reagent grade and were purchased from Fisher Scientific or Sigma Chemical Company.
