The nucleotide sequence of the cloned fragment has been determined. A sequence encoding the amino-terminal portion of mature alkaline phosphatase is found and it is preceded by a sequence encoding the signal peptide. The signal peptide consists of 21 amino acids; Met-Lys-Gln-Ser-Thr-Ile-Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu-Leu-Pro-Leu-Leu-Phe-Thr-Pro-Val-Thr-Lys-Ala. The translation initiation codon is GUG, which is preceded by the Shine-Dalgarno sequence GGAG. Upstream to these sequences, there is a typical procaryotic promoter. TATAGTC for the Pribnow box. Around the Pribnow box, there are several dyad symmetrical sequences, which may probably be concerned with the regulation of this gene.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5671"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5672"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5673"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0170.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5674"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0171.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5675"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0172.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5676"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0173.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5677"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0174.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5678"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
