GLUT8 carries a [D/E]XXXL[L/I]-type dileucine sorting signal that has been postulated to retain the protein in an endosomal/lysosomal compartment via interactions with clathrin adaptor protein (AP) complexes. However, contradictory findings have been described regarding the subcellular localization of the endogenous GLUT8 and the adaptor proteins that interact with its dileucine motif. Here we demonstrate that endogenous GLUT8 is localized in a late endosomal/lysosomal compartment of spermatocytes and spermatids, and that the adaptor complexes AP1 and AP2, but not AP3 or AP4, interact with its N-terminal intracellular domain (NICD). In addition, fusion of the GLUT8 NICD to the tailless lumenal domain of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain (TAC) protein (interleukin-2 receptor &#x003b1; chain) targeted the protein to intracellular membranes, indicating that its N-terminal dileucine signal is sufficient for endosomal/lysosomal targeting of the transporter. The localization and targeting of GLUT8 show striking similarities to sorting mechanisms reported for lysosomal proteins. Therefore, we suggest a potential role for GLUT8 in the so far unexplored substrate transport across intracellular membranes.</p><p><bold>Structured digital abstract</bold></p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MINT-7035377">MINT-7035377</ext-link>: <italic>GLUT8</italic> (uniprotkb:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="Q9JIF3">Q9JIF3</ext-link>) <italic>physically interacts</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MI:0915">MI:0915</ext-link>) with <italic>AP2</italic> (uniprotkb:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="P62944">P62944</ext-link>) by <italic>pull down</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MI:0096">MI:0096</ext-link>)</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MINT-7035218">MINT-7035218</ext-link>: <italic>GLUT8</italic> (uniprotkb:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="Q9JIF3">Q9JIF3</ext-link>) <italic>physically interacts</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MI:0915">MI:0915</ext-link>) with <italic>AP1</italic> (uniprotkb:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="O43747">O43747</ext-link>) by <italic>pull down</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MI:0096">MI:0096</ext-link>)</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MINT-7035273">MINT-7035273</ext-link>: <italic>GLUT8</italic> (uniprotkb:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="Q9JIF3">Q9JIF3</ext-link>) <italic>physically interacts</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MI:0915">MI:0915</ext-link>) with <italic>AP1</italic> (uniprotkb:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="P22892">P22892</ext-link>) by <italic>pull down</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MI:0096">MI:0096</ext-link>)</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MINT-7035235">MINT-7035235</ext-link>: <italic>GLUT8</italic> (uniprotkb:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="Q9JIF3">Q9JIF3</ext-link>) <italic>physically interacts</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MI:0915">MI:0915</ext-link>) with <italic>AP1</italic> (uniprotkb:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="Q8R525">Q8R525</ext-link>) by <italic>pull down</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MI:0096">MI:0096</ext-link>)</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MINT-7035360">MINT-7035360</ext-link>: <italic>GLUT8</italic> (uniprotkb:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="Q9JIF3">Q9JIF3</ext-link>) <italic>physically interacts</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MI:0915">MI:0915</ext-link>) with <italic>AP2</italic> (uniprotkb:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="Q9DBG3">Q9DBG3</ext-link>) by <italic>pull down</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MI:0096">MI:0096</ext-link>)</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MINT-7035789">MINT-7035789</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MINT-7035807">MINT-7035807</ext-link>: <italic>lamp1</italic> (uniprotkb:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="P11438">P11438</ext-link>) and <italic>GLUT8</italic> (uniprotkb:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="Q9JIF3">Q9JIF3</ext-link>) <italic>colocalize</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MI:0403">MI:0403</ext-link>) by <italic>fluorescence microscopy</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MI:0416">MI:0416</ext-link>)</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MINT-7039929">MINT-7039929</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MINT-7039945">MINT-7039945</ext-link>: <italic>lamp2</italic> (uniprotkb:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="P17047">P17047</ext-link>) and <italic>GLUT8</italic> (uniprotkb:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="Q9JIF3">Q9JIF3</ext-link>) <italic>colocalize</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MI:0403">MI:0403</ext-link>) by <italic>fluorescence microscopy</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="MI:0416">MI:0416</ext-link>)</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adaptor proteins</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>glucose transporter</kwd><kwd>GLUT8</kwd><kwd>lysosomes</kwd><kwd>targeting</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Facilitative hexose transport is mediated by 14 isoforms of the glucose transporter protein family (GLUT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>].

With the exception of the myo-inositol transporter HMIT [H(+)-myo-inositol transporter GLUT13], which is recruited from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane in response to various stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>], no mechanism for translocation of class III family members has been described, therefore questioning their functional significance in mediating hexose transport across the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>].

Stably overexpressed GLUT8 co-localized with the late endosomal/lysosomal protein LAMP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>]. This localization is probably mediated by its N-terminal [D/E]EXXXL[L/I] consensus sequence, which represents a late endosomal/lysosomal sorting signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>].</p><p>GLUT8 is mainly expressed in testis and to a lesser extent in brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]. Contradictory data exist regarding its localization in the tissues in which it is most abundant. GLUT8 has been found to be localized to the acrosomal membrane of mature spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>], while another report found that the protein was localized to the acrosome, mid- and endpiece of spermatozoa, as well as in Leydig cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>]. A third study detected GLUT8 only in differentiating spermatocytes but not in mature spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>].</p><p>Heterotetrameric adaptor protein (AP) complexes mediate membrane protein sorting in the secretory or endocytotic pathway by recognizing specific signals within the cytoplasmic portion of their respective cargo proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. The various AP complexes (AP1&#x02013;4) control protein trafficking to and from various compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. Signals known to interact with AP complexes conform either to tyrosine-based (YXX&#x000f8;) or dileucine-based ([DE]XXXL[LI]) consensus sequences (where X represents any amino acid and &#x000d8; is a bulky hydrophobic residue) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>]. For GLUT8, interaction of the dileucine motif with subunits of AP1 and AP2 has been reported on the basis of glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) pulldown assays with recombinant AP subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>]. However, the findings have been contradictory with regard to localization of the endogenous GLUT8 in testis, the nature of its sorting, and the interaction of its N-terminal dileucine motif with the various AP subunits. The [DE]XXXL[LI] signal of GLUT8 has been shown to bind to the &#x003b2;2-adaptin subunit of AP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>], but a second study identified &#x003b3;/&#x003b4;1 and &#x003b1;/&#x003b4;2 hemicomplexes of AP1 and AP2 as the subunits responsible for the interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we aim to resolve some of these discrepancies in order to (a) identify the subcellular localization of GLUT8 in testis, (b) elucidate the role of APs in GLUT8 sorting, and (c) understand the role of the EXXXLL motif in GLUT8 sorting. The data provide evidence that endogenous GLUT8 co-localizes with the lysosomal proteins LAMP1 and LAMP2 in spermatocytes and spermatids. The EXXXLL motif interacts with AP1 and AP2 but not with AP3 or AP4, and appropriate targeting of GLUT8 is dependent on both AP1 and AP2, while AP3 is not required. Using lumenal domain of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain (TAC) chimeric proteins we demonstrate that the dileucine motif of GLUT8 represents a strong internalization signal that appears to be sufficient to retain the transporter in an endosomal/lysosomal compartment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>GLUT8 co-localizes with lysosomal proteins in mouse testis sections</title><p>In order to identify the subcellular localization of endogenous GLUT8, we performed co-localization studies with markers of various intracellular compartments, using fluorescence labelling and confocal microscopy. Immunohistochemistry of GLUT8 in tissues such as testis or brain has been performed previously, but inconsistent results were obtained with regard to its subcellular localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>]. In order to verify the specificity of the GLUT8 antibody, we used testis sections from GLUT8 knockout mice that have previously been shown to represent appropriate controls for this antiserum in conventional 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine-based immunohistochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>]. In addition, absence of the protein in mouse testis from GLUT8 knockout mice was demonstrated by western blot analysis of extracts of total membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>, GLUT8 co-localizes with LAMP1, as indicated by the yellow punctured structures in the merged picture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C,F</xref>).

However, in these studies, GST pulldown assays were performed using recombinant AP subunits that yielded conflicting results with regard to the AP subunits that interact with the [DE]XXXL[LI] motif. In order to re-investigate this issue, we performed GST pulldown experiments using the N-terminal intracellular domain (NICD) of GLUT8 fused to GST. To date, the interaction of GLUT8 with AP3 or AP4 has not been addressed. AP3 mediates sorting of membrane proteins from endosomal compartments to late endosomes/lysosomes, and AP4 has been demonstrated to mediate direct sorting to lysosomes from the <italic>trans-</italic>Golgi network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. As GLUT8 is localized in a late endosomal/lysosomal compartment, a site where AP3- or AP4-mediated sorting might be required, we used GST pulldown experiments to investigate whether the NICD of GLUT8 interacts with AP3 or AP4. We incubated the immobilized fusion proteins with detergent-lysed rat brain homogenates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>), HEK293 cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>), clathrin-coated vesicle membranes isolated from porcine brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>), and lysates from mouse testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2D</xref>) containing endogenous AP complexes. HEK293 cell lysates were required in order to test interaction with AP4, as commercially available antibodies react with the human AP4 protein only (&#x003b5;-subunit). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A,B</xref>, the GST&#x02013;NICD fusion protein specifically binds to AP1, but not to AP3 or AP4 complexes. Mutation of the two adjacent leucines within the [DE]XXXL[LI] motif (LL/AA mutant) resulted in loss of AP1 binding, suggesting that an acidic cluster dileucine signal within the GLUT8 NICD is the major determinant for its association with AP1. Interaction of GLUT8 with recombinant AP2 has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>]. As we were unable to detect binding to AP2 in cell homogenates (data not shown), we repeated the experiment using clathrin-coated proteins from brain and mouse testis lysates as a source of native AP1/AP2 complexes. Using these protein extracts, binding of both AP1 and AP2 to the GST&#x02013;NICD fusion protein was readily detectable. However, mutation of the dileucine motif (LL/AA mutant) in GLUT8 did not completely abolish AP1/ and AP2/GLUT8 NICD interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). This residual association with AP1 and AP2 might be due to high and variable concentrations of AP1 and AP2 in these extracts or could result from indirect binding of GLUT8 to AP complexes via unidentified tissue-specific bridging proteins. No specific interaction was observed with the GST control.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The [DE]XXXL[LI] motif of GLUT8 interacts with endogenous AP1 and AP2 in GST pulldown assays.

Given that sorting of several lysosomal proteins carrying a [DE]XXXL[LI] motif has been shown to involve AP3, we wished to determine whether AP3 is required for proper sorting of GLUT8, despite the fact that we were unable to detect an association between the proteins by GST pulldown assays. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from mice carrying mutations in AP3 subunits have already been widely used to study AP3-mediated sorting of lysosomal proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>]. We therefore analysed the localization of GLUT8 and the GLUT8-LL/AA mutant in cells that lack specific subunits of AP3. The mouse mutants <italic>mocha</italic> and <italic>pearl</italic> are deficient in the AP3 &#x003b4; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>] and &#x003b2;3A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>] subunits, respectively. Failure to express one of the AP3 subunits leads to destabilization of the tetrameric complex and loss of AP3 functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>]. GLUT8 tagged within its extracellular loop with a haemagglutinin epitope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>] or the corresponding LL/AA mutant were overexpressed in wild-type, <italic>mocha</italic> or <italic>pearl</italic> fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). By differential staining under non-permeabilizing or permeabilizing conditions, we found that GLUT8 was localized in intracellular punctae resembling late endosomes and lysosomes in all cell lines studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A,C,E</xref>). By contrast, the LL/AA mutant was found predominantly at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B,D,F</xref>). Consistent with these data, GLUT8 co-localized with LAMP1 in wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A&#x02013;C</xref>) and in AP3-deficient mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4G&#x02013;I</xref>).

Thus mutations leading to disruption of AP3 do not affect the steady-state distribution of GLUT8, nor do they affect its co-localization with the late endosomal/lysosomal marker protein LAMP1, a finding that is in agreement with our <italic>in vitro</italic> binding data.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>GLUT8 sorting is not altered in <italic>mocha</italic> and <italic>pearl</italic> cells lacking AP3 subunits.

Intracellular targeting of surface accessible GLUT8 was then assayed using an antibody feeding protocol. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref>, the siRNAs were capable of specifically downregulating their respective target AP subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref>). 96 hours post-transfection of scrambled or target siRNAs Hela cells were exposed to antibodies directed against the haemagglutinin-tag of GLUT8, LAMP1 or to FITC-labeled transferrin. LAMP1 and LAMP2 both contain tyrosine based signals that bind to the &#x003bc; subunits of AP adaptor complexes [45]. Sorting of LAMPs to lysosomes occurs directly from the TGN as well as via an indirect pathway involving clathrin/AP2 [40]. Cells transfected with scrambled siRNA displayed an unperturbed localization of internalized LAMP1 and TfR in distinct endosomal compartments. GLUT8 was not detectable by antibody feeding in this assay, suggesting that surface exposed pools of GLUT8 are very small under these conditions. Previous experiments demonstrated that plasma membrane GLUT8 can be detected that originates from the biosynthetic pathway traversing the plasma membrane [4]. Knockdown of AP1 caused a comparably minor re-distribution for LAMP1 to peripheral endosomal puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>) and led to a modest accumulation of GLUT8 at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>). Knockdown of AP2 or AP1 and AP2 in combination resulted in a major redistribution of both LAMP1 and the TfR to the cell surface, reflecting the contribution of clathrin/AP2-mediated endocytosis to the sorting of both proteins. In line with this interpretation, a similar phenotype was observed following knockdown of clathrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>). Strikingly, GLUT8 accumulated at the plasma membrane in cells depleted of either AP2 or clathrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>). These data indicate that sorting of GLUT8 to lysosomes occurs via adaptor complex mediated mechanisms involving both AP2 and also AP1. This is also consistent with a previous report [20]. The current data examining GLUT8 sorting suggest that a fraction of GLUT8 traverses the plasma membrane, from where it is endocytosed via an AP2 and clathrin-dependent mechanism before being sorted to its final late endosomal/lysosomal destination.</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>GLUT8 accumulates at the plasma membrane when cells are depleted of adaptor proteins or the clathrin heavy chain. (A) HeLa cells were transfected twice within 5 days with siRNA for AP1, AP2, AP1/AP2 or the clathrin heavy chain (CHC).

(B) Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated transferrin uptake or LAMP1 antibody internalization were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>]. AP2 and CHC knockdown dramatically affects LAMP1 and transferrin receptor trafficking, leading to accumulation of the two proteins at the plasma membrane. Knockdown of AP1 leads to a modest level of GLUT8 in plasma membrane. In contrast, GLUT8 accumulates at the plasma membrane in cells transfected with AP2 or CHC siRNA.

We thus examined the effect of AP or clathrin downregulation on the localization of GLUT8 to LAMP1-positive late endosomes/lysosomes. GLUT8 and LAMP1 co-localized in cells treated with either control or target siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2</xref>). However, differences were observed with regard to the intracellular distribution of LAMP1/GLUT8-containing organelles. Depletion of AP2 or clathrin resulted in a compact, perinuclear distribution of the organelles containing both proteins, whereas knockdown of AP1 had little effect. These data confirm the results obtained by antibody feeding of GLUT8, and suggest that clathrin/AP2-mediated endocytosis greatly contributes to the endosomal/lysosomal targeting of GLUT8 in HeLa cells.</p></sec><sec><title>The N-terminal domain of GLUT8 contains a transplantable internalization signal</title><p>To determine the significance of the N-terminal dileucine signal in GLUT8 for its intracellular sorting, we constructed chimeric proteins comprising a truncated version of TAC (lacking its cytoplasmic tail) fused to various dileucine-based sorting motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>). TAC chimeras were overexpressed in HeLa cells, and their endocytosis was followed using an antibody internalization approach. The tailless TAC reporter protein lacking its cytoplasmic domain has been demonstrated to localize to the plasma membrane using a similar approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>]. Fusion of the dileucine motif derived from the CD3 &#x003b4; chain to tailless TAC was sufficient to target the chimera for internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B,d</xref>) as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>]. No plasmalemmal signal was detected for the corresponding GLUT8&#x02013;TAC chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B,g</xref>) by either the antibody feeding approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B,g</xref>) or antibody labelling by immunocytochemistry of the permeabilized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B,h</xref>). Instead, only intracellular GLUT8&#x02013;TAC chimeric protein was detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B,h</xref>). This suggests that either internalization of this construct is too fast and efficient to be detected by this approach (similar to the antibody feeding in HeLa cells overexpressing GLUT8 and described above) and/or that its intracellular sorting occurs predominantly via a direct route from the <italic>trans-</italic>Golgi network, presumably involving AP1. In contrast, when the antibody feeding experiment was performed using with the LL/AA mutant GLUT8&#x02013;TAC fusion protein, no endocytosed protein was labelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B,j</xref>), while overall antibody staining detected the chimeric protein almost exclusively at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B,k</xref>).</p><fig id="fig06" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>The [DE]XXXL[LI] motif of GLUT8 is sufficient for its intracellular retention.

The [DE]XXXL[LI] sorting motif of GLUT8 interacts with AP1 and AP2 but not with AP3 or AP4. Furthermore, the [DE]XXXL[LI] motif represents a strong intracellular retention/sorting signal that is sufficient to target GLUT8 to its intracellular location, depending on its interaction with AP1 and/or AP2.</p><p>The physiological role of the evolutionarily &#x02018;oldest&#x02019; class III GLUT family isoforms is not understood &#x02013; especially in the context of their intracellular localization as described for all class III members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>]. This raises the question of whether these transporters are involved in intracellular substrate transport, or whether so far unknown conditions exist that result in a plasma membrane function for class III GLUTs.</p><p>Intracellular hexose transport has been shown to occur across lysosomal membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>], and has been postulated to occur in the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>]. Based on these data, it seems reasonable to speculate that transport of hexoses or other metabolites occurs across intracellular membranes. However, transporters accounting for glucose release from the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>] or export of sugars from lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>] have not yet been identified. The phenotype of GLUT8 knockout mice does not indicate a role for this transporter in embryo development as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>] or in regulation of whole-body glucose homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>]. The results from two groups investigating the phenotype of <italic>Slc2a8</italic> null mice only show mild alterations in the metabolic profile of those animals, while indicating a significant physiological role for GLUT8 in the testis as well as in the brain, the tissues in which it is most abundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>]. In order to obtain further insights into a possible functional role of GLUT8, we attempted to clarify its endogenous localization in the testis and to link those findings with a more in-depth characterization of the cell biology of the transporter. We were able to show for the first time that endogenous GLUT8 co-localizes with the late endosomal proteins LAMP1 and LAMP2. We provide clear evidence that, in the tissue in which it is most abundant, GLUT8 does not localize to the plasma membrane but is restricted in its localization to lysosome-related organelles. These data are in accordance with previous studies performed in cell lines showing a late endosomal/lysosomal localization for GLUT8. In addition, recent immunohistochemical findings demonstrated a diffuse cytoplasmic localization of the transporter in spermatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>].</p><p>Based on a yeast two-hybrid assay and GST pulldown experiments, the dileucine motif of GLUT8 was indicated to interact with the &#x003b2;-subunits of AP1 and AP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>]. Although &#x02018;tyrosine-based&#x02019; sorting signals conform to either the NPXY or YXXO consensus sequence and interact with AP1&#x02013;4 via their &#x003bc; subunits, the exact nature of AP interaction with dileucine signals of the [D/E]XXXL[L/I] motif is controversial. Recently, using yeast three-hybrid assays and GST pulldown experiments using recombinant AP subunits, various laboratories have shown that the [D/E]XXXL[L/I] motif interacts not only specifically but also selectively with hemicomplexes of AP1 &#x003b3;/&#x003c3;1, AP2 &#x003b1;/&#x003c3;2 or AP3 &#x003b4;/&#x003c3;3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>]. In addition, the N-terminus of GLUT8 has been shown to interact with hemicomplexes of AP1 &#x003b3;/&#x003c3;1 and AP2 &#x003b1;/&#x003c3;2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>]. More recently, X-ray crystallography provided a structural explanation of how a [D/E]XXXL[L/I] motif is recognized by AP2, and identified the &#x003c3;2 subunit as the major site of interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>]. Rather than using recombinant AP subunits for GST pulldown experiments, we used native proteins to demonstrate that the [D/E]XXXL[L/I] motif of GLUT8 interacts with AP1 and AP2, but not with AP3 or AP4. Based on the late endosomal/lysosomal localization of GLUT8, we initially hypothesized that sorting of GLUT8 might involve interaction of its dileucine motif with AP3 and/or AP4. In addition to demonstrating that GLUT8 does not interact with AP3 or AP4, we showed that localization of the transporter is not altered in cells lacking AP3. Our findings are in accordance with other studies showing that the steady-state localization of lysosomal proteins is not significantly affected in cells lacking AP3 subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>].</p><p>The siRNA approach has been successfully used to analyse AP- or CHC-mediated sorting for LAMP1 and LAMP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>]. AP2 or CHC siRNA treatment in HeLa cells stably expressing GLUT8 resulted in accumulation of the protein in plasma membranes, whereas AP1 knockdown led to only a moderate alteration of its subcellular localization. We also demonstrated that knockdown of AP1 or AP2 affected the distribution of both GLUT8 and LAMP1. The effect of AP knockdown on LAMP1 localization observed here is in agreement with findings that elucidated the role of AP in sorting mechanisms of integral lysosomal membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>]. It was shown that mainly AP2 and clathrin are required for efficient delivery of LAMPs to lysosomes, implying that a significant population of LAMPs traffic via the plasma membrane en route to lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>]. Our data suggest that sorting of GLUT8 shows similarities to that of LAMPs. At steady state, GLUT8 does not recycle, and is found to be exclusively associated with intracellular membranes. In addition, a biosynthetic pathway appears to exist that involves sorting of GLUT8 via the plasma membrane, as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>].</p><p>Using the TAC chimera approach, we were able to demonstrate that the dileucine signal of GLUT8 is sufficient for its intracellular retention and represents a strong intracellular sorting signal. Our data are supported by a recent study that compared the [D/E]XXXL[L/I] sorting motifs between GLUT8 and GLUT12, showing that this sorting signal very specifically controls localization and sorting of both transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>]. The absence of the GLUT8&#x02013;TAC chimera at the plasma membrane indicated that a majority of the chimeric protein is directly sorted to an intracellular compartment and/or that AP2-dependent endocytosis occurs very rapidly. Mutating the LL signal to AA in the TAC chimeric protein totally abolished sorting of the chimera to an intracellular location, and led to mis-routing to the plasma membrane and/or blocking of its endocytosis.</p><p>Although the physiological role of GLUT8 remains unknown, our data may provide a link between cell biological data and observations from phenotypical analysis of GLUT8 knockout mice. GLUT8 may be involved in intracellular transport of metabolites thereby secondarily affecting ATP concentrations and mitochondrial function as observed in GLUT8 deficient sperm cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>].

The &#x003b3; subunit of CD3 has been extensively studied, and the TAC chimera approach has been proven to be a valuable tool to study sorting motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>]. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the TAC tailless, TAC&#x003b3;t<sub>3</sub>-t<sub>2</sub>, TAC&#x02013;GLUT8 and TAC&#x02013;GLUT8-LL/AA constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, cells were labelled with anti-TAC IgG (1 : 1000 diluted in Opti-MEM; Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 30 min at 4 &#x000b0;C. After one change of medium (to Opti-MEM at 37 &#x000b0;C), plasma membrane antigens were allowed to internalize for 30 min at 37 &#x000b0;C. The cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, Seelze, Germany) for 10 min on ice, and surface-bound TAC antibody was blocked using goat anti-mouse serum [goat anti-mouse IgG from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany) at a 1 : 5 dilution in goat serum dilution buffer, consisting of 30% normal goat serum, 450 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl in NaCl/P<sub>i</sub> pH 7.4] for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized and blocked with goat serum dilution buffer containing 0.2% saponin for 10 min. For detection of internalized TAC antibody, a goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated IgG (Invitrogen) was added for 1 h. Cells were then washed three times for 10 min each with NaCl/P<sub>i</sub>/0.02% saponin. For total TAC staining (intracellular and cell surface), the specimens were incubated for 1 h with the TAC antibody diluted 1 : 1000 as described above. As secondary antibody, an Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was added for 30 min, and nuclei were stained using TOPRO-3 iodide. Cells were washed, and cover slips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs). Specimens were examined using a Leica LCS confocal laser scanning microscope in sequential scanning mode.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the expert technical assistance of Mrs Brigitte Rischke.
