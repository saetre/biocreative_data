Pax6 is also involved in corticoneurogenesis, being expressed by radial glial progenitors that give rise to cells that also sequentially express Tbr2, NeuroD and Tbr1, genes temporally downstream of Pax6. In this study, using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, we analysed the expression of <italic>EMX2</italic>, <italic>PAX6</italic>, <italic>TBR2</italic>, <italic>NEUROD</italic> and <italic>TBR1</italic> mRNA in the developing human cortex between 8 and 12 postconceptional weeks (PCW). <italic>EMX2</italic> mRNA was expressed in the ventricular (VZ) and subventricular zones (SVZ), but also in the cortical plate, unlike in the rodent. However, gradients of expression were similar to that of the rodent at all ages studied. <italic>PAX6</italic> mRNA expression was limited to the VZ and SVZ. At 8 PCW, <italic>PAX6</italic> was highly expressed rostrally but less so caudally, as has been seen in the rodent, however this gradient disappeared early in corticogenesis, by 9 PCW. There was less restricted compartment-specific expression of <italic>TBR2</italic>, <italic>NEUROD</italic> and <italic>TBR1</italic> mRNA than in the rodent, where the gradients of expression were similar to that of <italic>PAX6</italic> prior to 9 PCW. The gradient disappeared for <italic>TBR2</italic> by 10 PCW, and for <italic>NEUROD</italic> and <italic>TBR1</italic> by 12 PCW. These data support recent reports that EMX2 but not PAX6 is more directly involved in arealization, highlighting that analysis of human development allows better spatio-temporal resolution than studies in rodents.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>arealization</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>subventricular zone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cortical arealization controls the differentiation of the early embryonic cortical primordium, a neuroepithelial sheet that lacks any apparent regional-specific morphology or function, into the complex, regionally diverse mature cerebral cortex.

The genes controlling neocortical arealization are assumed to be expressed in graded or restricted patterns in order to be able to specify regional identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Job &#x00026; Tan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Mallamaci &#x00026; Stoykova, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Two genes meeting these criteria in the rodent are <italic>Emx2</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">O&#x02019;Leary &#x00026; Nakagawa, 2002</xref>). <italic>Pax6</italic> encodes a protein containing a paired domain and a homeodomain, and is mutated in patients with aniridia and in the mouse mutant small eye, <italic>sey</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Ton <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">1992</xref>), while <italic>Emx2</italic> is a homeobox-containing gene encoding a transcription factor that is one homologue of the anterior-head-specific <italic>Drosophila empty spiracles</italic> head gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Simeone <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). In mice, both <italic>Pax6</italic> and <italic>Emx2</italic> expression are found in the telencephalon during neurogenesis (E10.5&#x02013;18.5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Walther &#x00026; Gruss, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Simeone <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). In Pax6 <italic>sey/sey</italic> mutant mice, studies of the expression of areal markers such as <italic>Cad6</italic>, <italic>Cad8</italic> and <italic>Id2</italic>, have indicated a reduction in size of rostro-lateral areas and expansion of caudo-medial regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bishop <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2002</xref>). In Emx2 null mice, a reduction in size of caudal/medial cortical regions, together with an enlargement of those with rostral/lateral identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bishop <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>) is seen. Emx2 shows a complementary expression pattern to Pax6, and they downregulate each other in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Muzio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Pax6 also controls glutamatergic neuronal cell fate in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kroll &#x00026; O&#x02019;Leary, 2005</xref>), and that the expression pattern of the T-box domain containing transcription factor <italic>Tbr2</italic>, a gene expressed by basal progenitors in the subventricular zone (SVZ), exhibits a similar high rostro-lateral, low caudo-medial expression pattern as that of <italic>Pax6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bulfone <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Glutamatergic projection neurons and their progenitors sequentially express Pax6 followed by Tbr2 during development. This sequence of expression is followed by the basic helix-loop-helix, pro-neural gene NeuroD and the Tbr2-related layer VI marker, Tbr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Hevner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the rodent, Emx2 and Pax6 are expressed in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the dorsal telencephalon that gives rise to cortical neurons, along two complementary tangential gradients. Although many mechanisms involved in rodent cortical development are shared in common with humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Monuki &#x00026; Walsh, 2001</xref>), the human cortex is composed of different and more complex local area identities that reflect differences in structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Hill &#x00026; Walsh, 2005</xref>). These differences need to be considered when extending findings from rodents to humans, and an important first step is to analyse expression patterns directly in humans. Therefore we analysed the temporal and spatial mRNA expression patterns of <italic>EMX2</italic> and <italic>PAX6</italic>, as well <italic>TBR2</italic>, <italic>NEUROD</italic> and <italic>TBR1</italic> from 8&#x02013;12 postconceptional weeks (PCW).

At 8 postconceptional weeks (PCW) <italic>EMX2</italic> and <italic>PAX6</italic> are localized within the proliferative zones of the developing cortex in opposing rostro-lateral/caudo-medial gradients. From 9 to 12 PCW onwards the majority of <italic>EMX2</italic> expression is found in the cortical plate (CP), where a similar gradient exists to that observed in the subventricular zone (SVZ)/ventricular zone (VZ).

The <italic>TBR1</italic> gradient is also observed from 8 PCW and encompasses all compartments outside of the VZ, most prominently within the CP, but disappears before 12 PCW.

Here we report the expression of <italic>EMX2</italic> during the early stages of CP formation, where the functions of this gene are thought to be critical in modulating arealization mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Cecchi &#x00026; Boncinelli, 2000</xref>). A principal finding of this study is that <italic>EMX2</italic> mRNA expression in the developing human cortex differs from that reported in rodents. In the rodent, <italic>Emx2</italic> mRNA localized chiefly to the VZ/SVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Cecchi, 2002</xref>), whereas in the human, expression of <italic>EMX2</italic> was present in the VZ/SVZ only during the early stages of CP formation; however, from 10 PCW onwards expression had switched predominantly to the CP. Emx2 has been reported to be expressed at low levels in the rodent CP, but only in the apical dendrites of CP neurons synapsing with the Cajal&#x02013;Retzius cells of the marginal zone. In rodents, expression of <italic>Emx1</italic>, a transcription factor that is related to <italic>Emx2</italic>, is found to be expressed within the CP, but is not thought to be involved in mechanisms regulating cortical arealization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Gulisano <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). However, double mutants indicate that Emx1 co-operates with Emx2 to regulate cortical size, lamination, neuronal differentiation, development of cortical efferents and thalamocortical path finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bishop <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Our observations that <italic>EMX2</italic> expression in the CP is reminiscent of that of <italic>Emx1</italic> in rodents lead to the intriguing possibility that <italic>EMX1</italic> in humans may take over <italic>EMX2</italic> function in cortical arealization in humans. However, the majority of <italic>EMX1</italic> expression is also found in the CP (in supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2</xref>) and this is consistent with previous reports in rodents.</p><p>We have previously demonstrated the early expression of the <italic>PAX6</italic> gene during human development, specifically within the dorsal forebrain at 6.5&#x02013;7 PCW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kerwin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Lindsay <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) by ISH, and from 8 to 12 PCW during early cortical development by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Bayatti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). We have extended these observations by analysing the extent and localization of <italic>PAX6</italic> mRNA expression during early human neocortical development. Unlike <italic>EMX2</italic>, the general laminar expression of <italic>PAX6</italic> in humans resembled that described in the rodent, being confined to the proliferative zones at all ages studied. The observation that <italic>PAX6</italic> and <italic>EMX2</italic> laminar-specific expression diverged as early as 9 PCW implies differing roles for these transcription factors during cortical development, whilst EMX2 and PAX6 may be important in regulating processes leading to the initial formation of the CP (at/or before 8 PCW; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Gotz &#x00026; Huttner, 2005</xref>). Additionally, PAX6 expressed in the human SVZ has been implicated in controlling the neurogenesis of &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Letinic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mo &#x00026; Zecevic, 2008</xref>). Recently, analysis of a transgenic mouse model that carries several copies of the human <italic>PAX6</italic> locus, expressing up to three times more protein than the wild-type, provided evidence that PAX6 may not be directly involved in arealization. These mice exhibited no changes in Emx2 protein localization, and expression of the areal markers Id2 and Ephrin-B2 were also unaffected. However, reductions were seen in thickness of cortical layers, probably due to a reduced rate of proliferation in overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Manuel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>A study identifying genes regulated by Emx2 in neuronal precursors <italic>in vitro</italic> has identified a gene profile that would be consistent with conferring maturation, i.e. differentiation of early precursors and/or induction of a migratory specification to these normally resident cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Gangemi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Given its expression gradient and location within the CP in humans, EMX2 may also be involved in the early stages of arealization and may control expression of areal markers directly. Recently, a study using nestin-Emx2 transgenic mice observed rostro-lateral shifts in the primary sensory and motor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hamasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). As these mice do not show defects in thalamocortical pathfinding, regional-specific loss in cortical tissue or differences in <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression, which previously obscured interpretation of the function of Emx2 in Emx2 null mice, the authors concluded that Emx2 is directly involved in the mapping of primary cortical areas. Whilst our findings support these conclusions, we propose that in humans, due to its extended presence, EMX2 acts predominantly in the CP, in contrast to rodents where Emx2 in progenitors in the VZ is thought to impart positional identity to neuronal progeny.</p></sec><sec><title>EMX2 and PAX6 gradients during early human cortical development</title><p>It has been proposed that Emx2 and Pax6 are two key regulatory genes that control neocortical arealization through expression in graded, restricted patterns in the embryonic cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">O&#x02019;Leary &#x00026; Nakagawa, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Job &#x00026; Tan, 2003</xref>). This study demonstrates that in the developing human neocortex, <italic>EMX2</italic> and <italic>PAX6</italic> are expressed in counter caudomedial/rostrolateral gradients, in a similar manner to that observed in rodents. However, this pattern of expression is restricted to the period of development up to 9 PCW. Following this, <italic>EMX2</italic> maintains a gradient whereas <italic>PAX6</italic> becomes uniformly expressed throughout the proliferating zones of the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3D and H</xref>, respectively). If <italic>EMX2</italic> and <italic>PAX6</italic> play a role in cortical arealization in human development they are only able to interact up to the time the CP is initially formed and very soon thereafter.</p><p>PAX6 may therefore affect arealization indirectly. The first cells to populate the CP form layer VI and contribute cells to the subplate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kostovic &#x00026; Rakic, 1990</xref>). These cells are crucial in guiding thalamic afferents to different regions of the cortex, as they send out axons to the thalamus that meet incoming thalamic axons, providing guidance cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Molnar &#x00026; Blakemore, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hevner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The regional identities of primary areas of the cortex are influenced by the thalamic innervation they eventually receive. Pax6 mutant mice exhibit defects in this thalamic innervation as well as in reciprocal cortical pathfinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hevner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), as axons do not reach their targets suggesting that Pax6 is important in the cortex for such events. As the first CP cells do not express Pax6, Pax6-dependent processes such as pathfinding may be mediated by other transcription factors such as Tbr1 and NeuroD that are expressed in differing compartments downstream of Pax6 during the process of progenitor migration and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Hevner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Localization and gradients of PAX6, TBR2, NEUROD and TBR1</title><p>Although <italic>PAX6</italic> mRNA does not exhibit a gradient of expression from 9 PCW onwards in humans, it is possible that downstream transcription factors may be responsible for further arealization mechanisms in differentiating neurons migrating towards the pial surface. The compartmental localization of <italic>TBR2</italic> and <italic>TBR1</italic> mRNA is consistent with previous studies of the protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Bayatti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Our results further indicate that in addition to <italic>TBR2</italic>, <italic>NEUROD</italic> and <italic>TBR1</italic> form gradients similar to that of <italic>PAX6</italic> in compartments through which progenitors and subsequent immature neurons migrate during cortical development (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). <italic>TBR2</italic> forms a gradient in the SVZ from 8 to 10 PCW, whilst <italic>NEUROD</italic> and <italic>TBR1</italic> also exhibit gradients in this compartment. Interestingly these gradients are also present in the CP for <italic>TBR1</italic> and <italic>NEUROD</italic> from 8 and 9 PCW, respectively, until at least 10 PCW. During this period TBR1, which is expressed by &#x02018;early-born&#x02019; neurons including SP neurons and those in layer VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bulfone <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hevner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), is expressed throughout the CP. Our previous observations show that the layer V marker Er81 appears later than 12 PCW in the human cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Bayatti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). All four of these transcription factors are localized within the SVZ, suggesting that PAX6&#x02013;TBR2&#x02013;NEUROD&#x02013;TBR1 transitions all occur within this compartment. Considering the relative size and degree of differentiation of the human SVZ during development compared with that of the rodent, this observation supports a fundamental role for this compartment during corticogenesis. This study has highlighted that the location of <italic>TBR2</italic> is a particularly good marker for the SVZ at early stages. In particular it predominantly localizes to the inner subventricular zone (ISVZ) characterized in the macaque at E46, before the differentiation of the SVZ and appearance of an outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Smart <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The majority of <italic>TBR2</italic> expression is maintained in the ISVZ at later stages and corresponds to the junction between the ISVZ and VZ. Future experiments should characterize whether the SVZ contributes to arealization mechanisms, and if EMX2 and these transcription factors are expressed within the same cells during their migration and development. In addition, putative interactions between these transcription factors and EMX2 should be analysed, in a similar manner to that which PAX6 and EMX2 regulate each other in the VZ of rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Muzio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, during human neocortical development, <italic>EMX2</italic> and <italic>PAX6</italic> expression patterns diverge at an early stage, when in rodents they are still presumed to be regulating the initial phases of arealization by reciprocal gradients of expression. However, <italic>TBR2</italic>, <italic>NEUROD</italic> and <italic>TBR1</italic>, temporally downstream genes of <italic>PAX6</italic>, maintain early PAX6-like gradients until 12 PCW in different compartments of the developing cortex (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). The extended period of gestation in humans, as compared with that in rodents, enables finer spatiotemporal resolution of overlapping gene expression patterns. The majority of neurogenesis in the human forebrain occurs between 8 and 16 PCW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">ten Donkelaar, 2000</xref>), in comparison to rodents in which similar events occurs within days. All the transcription factors described in this study are likely to possess additional functions during this extended period of human cortical development. Further analysis of the actions of these genes in humans using <italic>in vitro</italic> models may shed light on their functions during human development.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The human embryonic and foetal material was provided by the Joint MRC-Wellcome Trust Human Developmental Biology Resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hdbr.org">http://www.hdbr.org</ext-link>) at the IHG, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.
