The progression of disease in <italic>S. aureus</italic> is subject to multi-factorial regulation, in response to the environments encountered during growth. This adaptive nature is thought to be central to pathogenesis, and is the result of multiple regulatory mechanisms employed in gene regulation. In this work we describe the existence of a novel <italic>S. aureus</italic> regulator, an as yet uncharacterized ECF-sigma factor (&#x003c3;<sup>S</sup>), that appears to be an important component of the stress and pathogenic responses of this organism. Using biochemical approaches we have shown that &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> is able to associates with core-RNAP, and initiate transcription from its own coding region. Using a mutant strain we determined that &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> is important for <italic>S. aureus</italic> survival during starvation, extended exposure to elevated growth temperatures, and Triton X-100 induced lysis. Coculture studies reveal that a &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> mutant is significantly outcompeted by its parental strain, which is only exacerbated during prolonged growth (7 days), or in the presence of stressor compounds. Interestingly, transcriptional analysis determined that under standard conditions, <italic>S. aureus</italic> SH1000 does not initiate expression of <italic>sigS</italic>. Assays performed hourly for 72h revealed expression in typically background ranges. Analysis of a potential anti-sigma factor, encoded downstream of <italic>sigS</italic>, revealed it to have no obvious role in the upregulation of <italic>sigS</italic> expression. Using a murine model of septic arthritis, <italic>sigS</italic>-mutant infected animals lost significantly less weight, developed septic arthritis at significantly lower levels, and had increased survival rates. Studies of mounted immune responses reveal that <italic>sigS</italic>-mutant infected animals had significantly lower levels of IL-6, indicating only a weak immunological response. Finally, strains of <italic>S. aureus</italic> lacking <italic>sigS</italic> were far less able to undergo systemic dissemination, as determined by bacterial loads in the kidneys of infected animals. These results establish that &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> is an important component in <italic>S. aureus</italic> fitness, and in its adaptation to stress. Additionally it appears to have a significant role in its pathogenic nature, and likely represents a key component in the <italic>S. aureus</italic> regulatory network.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a major human pathogen that is a leading agent of both nosocomial and community acquired infections.

One of the overwhelming reasons that <italic>S. aureus</italic> is such a successful and diverse pathogen is the arsenal of virulence determinants encoded within its genome, which include hemolysins, toxins, adhesins and other exoproteins, such as proteases, staphylokinase and protein A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Lowy1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Novick1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

This responsive and adaptive nature is thought to be central to the disease-causing ability of the organism, and is largely the result of the multiple regulatory mechanisms it employs in gene regulation.</p><p>The large and wide reaching regulatory network employed by <italic>S. aureus</italic> encompasses a variety of common bacterial regulatory mechanisms, including two-component regulators, DNA binding proteins, regulatory RNAs, sigma factors and a quorum sensing system. There are thought to be sixteen two-component systems in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, including those that are responsible for the modulation of autolysis (ArlRS, LytRS), virulence (AgrAC, SaeRS) cell wall synthesis/drug resistance (GraRS, VraSR), and the sensing of external iron (HssRS) and oxygen (SrrRS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Meehl1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Yarwood1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

With this in mind we decided to test the ability of SACOL1827 to initiate transcription from its own locus by transcriptional run off analysis. Core-RNAP was preincubated with purified SACOL1827 protein for 15 mins at 4&#x000b0;C, before the addition of an 1168 bp DNA-fragment containing the <italic>sigS</italic> coding region and 945 bp of upstream sequence. After further incubation (at 37&#x000b0;C for 15mins) transcription was initiated by the addition of rNTPs, and allowed to proceed for 30 mins. The mixture was then cleaned via two acid-phenolchloroform extractions (to remove DNA contamination), and an isopropanol precipitation. The purified mRNA transcript was then subject to a 1-step RT-PCR reaction with primers internal to the SACOL1827 coding region (104 bp from the initiation codon to 137 bp from the termination codon). This experiment was repeated with controls, where either purified SACOL1827 protein or core-RNAP was omitted from the reaction mixture. The RT-PCR reactions were then resolved on a 2&#x00025; agarose gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003844-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), and revealed that only the SACOL1827-core-RNAP complex lane yielded the expected DNA fragment of 274 bp. The 2 control lanes demonstrated an absence of bands, indicating that the acid-phenolchloroform extractions effectively removed the template DNA. As the SACOL1827-core-RNAP complex is capable of specifically initiating transcription, we termed the SACOL1827 gene <italic>sigS</italic>, and its resultant protein &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Analysis of a <italic>sigS</italic> mutant reveals a role for &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> in the <italic>S. aureus</italic> stress response</title><p>A common role of ECF-sigma factors is to protect bacterial cells against external stress.

These experiments are facilitated by the fact that the &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> mutant is marked with a tetracycline resistance cassette; thus plating dilutions of the coculture on both TSA (Tryptic Soy Agar) and TSA containing tetracycline, allows derivation of exact colony counts for each strain, and thus calculation of the competitive index (CI).

Indeed, whilst little variation from non-stressed conditions was observed after 24 hours growth, significant differences were observed after 7 days growth.

As &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> seems to have a role in autoinducing its own transcription, it follows that if SACOL1828 were to inhibit the activity of the &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> protein, then a SACOL1828 mutant would have higher <italic>sigS</italic> expression, as a result of an increase in free &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> protein.

Such loci, whilst not always directly controlling virulence determinant production, are no less important to the virulence process, as they facilitate the rapid physiological switching that is a hallmark of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. This kind of responsiveness is commonly induced in other organisms by sigma factors, as they present a rapid and direct way of modulating stimulons in response to change. Rather unusually, <italic>S. aureus</italic> seemingly achieves its versatile and adaptive nature with only a limited selection of sigma factors. So far only three have been documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Deora1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Morikawa1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Wu1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, and only one of these (&#x003c3;<sup>B</sup>) has been shown to have a role in cellular adaptation and virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Horsburgh2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Kullik1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Jonsson1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The work presented in this current study demonstrates that an additional, and as yet uncharacterized, 4<sup>th</sup> sigma factor (&#x003c3;<sup>S</sup>) exists in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> appears to be a member of the ECF-family of sigma factors, and likely represents an important component of the stress and pathogenic responses of this organism.</p><p>Using biochemical approaches we have shown that &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> is able to associates with core-RNAP, and initiate transcription from its own coding region. The autoregulation of ECF-sigma factor expression is a common hallmark of this family of regulators, and has been observed amongst a great many of their number <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Helmann1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, using a <italic>sigS</italic> mutant of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, we have shown that &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> contributes to the protection against external stress, and plays a role in cellular fitness and survival. This is not unexpected, as the majority of ECF-sigma factors studied have been shown to function in the adaptation to stressful conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Chi1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Xiao1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study we present that &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> is important for <italic>S. aureus</italic> cellular survival when faced with prolonged starvation, and extended exposure to elevated growth temperatures. Additionally a <italic>sigS</italic> mutant is seemingly less able to survive, at least initially, the attack on cell wall stability posed by Triton X-100. The observation of these phenotypes for &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> is not out of keeping with other ECF-sigma factors, as a number are known to contribute to either heat shock responses and/or modulate cell wall stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Helmann1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>On the other hand, using disc diffusion analysis, we were unable to find any increased sensitivity of the <italic>sigS</italic> mutant to a variety of chemical stresses, including those generating oxidative stress (H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2</sub>, cumene hydroperoxide, diamide, methyl viologen, menadione, plumbagin, pyrogallol), nitric oxide stress (sodium nitroprusside), detergent stress (SDS, Triton X-100), acid and alkali stress (HCl, NaOH), alcohol stress (ethanol) and antibiotic stress (vancomycin, penicillin G, puromycin). Whilst this may appear unusual, given that a number of ECF-sigma factors in other organisms respond to these conditions, it is not entirely inexplicable. ECF-sigma factors are selectively induced in response to the specific stress that they are intended to combat. Thus it is likely the case that in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> is not the primary arbiter of adaptation to the stresses listed above. This is particularly pertinent to oxidative and antibiotic stress, as <italic>S. aureus</italic> has a variety of mechanisms by which to circumnavigate and survive these threats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Clauditz1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Utaida1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore it is probably that the efforts exerted in the present study have yet to hit upon the specific condition to which &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> is required to respond. Indeed it possible, given the data generated by our animal studies, that the specific stress(es) &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> responds to are not ones that can be simulated <italic>in vitro</italic>, but are uniquely associated with the <italic>in vivo</italic> lifestyle of <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p><p>With that said, it is apparent that <italic>sigS</italic> does present some benefit to the cell during <italic>in vitro</italic> growth. In our coculture studies, where the parent and mutant strain were grown together under a variety of conditions, it was clear that &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> was a significant aid to the survival and fitness of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. When the SH1000 <italic>sigS</italic> mutant was forced to compete with its parental strain, it displayed significantly reduced abilities for growth and survival. This phenotype was only exacerbated during prolonged growth periods (7 days), or in the presence of external stressor compounds. This would tend to suggest that <italic>sigS</italic> presents a selective advantage to <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells both during standard growth conditions, as well as during times of starvation and/or stress. Therefore it would seem logical that &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> is a valuable component for maintaining cellular harmony and stability, and as such likely represents an important mechanism by which <italic>S. aureus</italic> protects itself against the harsh environments encountered during growth.</p><p>Our transcription profiling studies of <italic>sigS</italic> turned up some interesting information regarding its expression. It appears that during growth under standard conditions, <italic>S. aureus</italic> SH1000 cells do not initiate expression from the <italic>sigS</italic> locus. Our studies, which were sampled every hour for 3 days, consistently revealed expression in the typically background range of 0&#x02013;1 Miller units. Only in 2 instances during growth did we detect anything higher than these values (32&#x02013;36 h, and 48&#x02013;52 h), and even then maximal expression was only 19 Miller units. We have generated a number of <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter-fusion strains in a variety of <italic>S. aureus</italic> backgrounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Horsburgh2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Shaw1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Shaw3">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref> (unpublished data), and have never seen a strain that displays such limited expression under specific analysis. Even upon the analysis of apparently very lowly expressed genes (e.g. SH1000 <italic>ssp</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion), which display little to no blueness on TSA X-gal plates, we routinely observe expression units in the hundreds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Horsburgh2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. With this in mind, and given the length of our transcription experiment, it is likely that even these 2 windows of minor expression may be the result of something other than actual induction of the <italic>sigS</italic> operon (e.g. cellular lysis). Therefore, as asserted above, this would tend to suggest that <italic>sigS</italic> is not expressed in SH1000 during growth under standard conditions.</p><p>This is certainly an unusual observation, but as ECF-sigma factors are commonly inducibley expressed in response to stress conditions, it perhaps not surprising. Indeed, analysis of the ECF-sigma factors of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> provides similar examples of transcriptional regulation. For example it has been reported that transcription of the ECF-sigma factor &#x003c3;<sup>Z</sup> from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is undetectable during growth in rich and minimal media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Horsburgh6">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>. Further, specific analysis of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ECF-sigma factor expression, conducted by Asai et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Asai1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>, revealed that the expression of &#x003c3;<sup>V</sup>, &#x003c3;<sup>Y</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>YlaC</sup>, in addition to &#x003c3;<sup>Z</sup>, were all equally low, and barely detectable during growth under standard conditions. In a study aimed at defining conditions conducive to &#x003c3;<sup>W</sup> expression in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, by Cao et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Cao1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, an elegant disc-diffusion reporter-gene fusion method was employed. Cells bearing a <italic>sigW</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion were grown on LB agar containing X-GAL, and overlayed with filter discs containing a variety of antibiotics. Using this approach, chemicals conducive to &#x003c3;<sup>W</sup> expression yielded a halo of blue around the edge of the filter disc. We employed just such an approach with our SH1000 <italic>sigS</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion, using the chemicals previously tested in sensitivity assays with the SH1000 <italic>sigS</italic> mutant. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we found none of the chemicals tested resulted in an increase in &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> expression. This would tend to add further weight to our assertion that in the present study have yet to hit upon the specific condition to which &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> is induced in <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p><p>Further transcriptional analysis focused on the role of SACOL1828 on &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> expression. As referred to above, ECF-sigma factors are often encoded upstream of an ORF that specifies an anti-sigma factor. As &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> seems to have a role in autoinducing its own transcription, it follows that if SACOL1828 were to inhibit the activity of the &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> protein, then a mutation in SACOL1828 would have higher <italic>sigS</italic> expression as a result of more free and active &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> protein. Indeed similar approaches have been used to analyze the putative anti-sigma factors of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ECF-sigma factors, including &#x003c3;<sup>YlaC</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>X</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Matsumoto1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003844-Huang1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>. Our analysis found that inactivating SACOL1828 did not result in an increase in <italic>sigS</italic> expression, as would have been predicted if SACOL1828 were to function as an anti-sigma factor. We suggest, however that this observation may be explained by the apparent lack of <italic>sigS</italic> expression in SH1000. If, as we find, there is little to no <italic>sigS</italic> expression in SH1000 during growth under standard conditions, then it follows that there is little to no &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> protein present in the cell. Therefore the inactivation of a &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> anti-sigma factor would not bring about the predicted snowballing of <italic>sigS</italic> expression, resulting from free &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> protein being able to auto-stimulate its own transcription. Thus it appears that further investigation is required before we can specifically determine whether SACOL1828 plays any role in the regulation of &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> activity.</p><p>The most striking, and indeed important, role we have defined for &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> is its role in the virulence of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Using our murine model of septic arthritis infection we have demonstrated that in each of the tests applied, to determine the extent and severity of disease, <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells lacking a functional <italic>sigS</italic> gene were significantly impaired in their ability to establish and maintain infection. Mice infected with <italic>S. aureus</italic> in this model lose weight, undergo extreme destruction of joints, bone and cartilage, and ultimately die. However those mice infected with the <italic>sigS</italic> mutant lost significantly less weight, developed septic arthritis at considerably lower levels, and most tellingly, had considerably increased survival rates. In addition, our studies of mounted immune responses by infected mice reveal that those animals infected with the <italic>sigS</italic> mutant had significantly lower levels of IL-6, indicating only a very weak immune response to the invading pathogens. Finally, a major hallmark of septic arthritis is systemic dissemination, moving from the site of infection into the kidneys. Our analysis reveals that mice infected with the parental strain possessed large numbers of <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells in the kidneys of infected mice. However when the same analysis was conducted with the <italic>sigS</italic> mutant it was apparent that strains of <italic>S. aureus</italic> lacking a functional <italic>sigS</italic> gene were far less able to undergo systemic dissemination. Collectively, the virulence data that we present speaks very strongly to the importance of &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> in the ability of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to cause disease, a fundamental cornerstone of its innate behavior.</p><p>From our investigations presented here we have demonstrated that &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> is important for the <italic>S. aureus</italic> stress response, aiding in the protection against unfavorable conditions. In addition we have shown that it is vital for the infectious nature of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, as a <italic>sigS</italic> mutant is attenuated in virulence in a murine model of septic arthritis infection. However the specific and mechanistic role of &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> in <italic>S. aureus</italic> biology remains unknown. It is unlikely; thought not impossible, that &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> wields its role via direct regulation of virulence determinant expression. A more probable scenario is that &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup>, as with other ECF-sigma factors, is responsible for sensing and responding to discrete external cue(s); and changing <italic>S. aureus</italic> gene expression profiles so as to protect the cell. It is the current and future purpose of our laboratory to explore and develop an understanding of the role of &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup>, which will doubtlessly further our knowledge of this important human pathogen and its disease causing abilities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions</title><p>The <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, along with the plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003844-t002">Table 2</xref>. <italic>E. coli</italic> was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37&#x000b0;C. <italic>S. aureus</italic> was grown in 100 ml TSB (1&#x02236;2.5 flask/volume ratio) at 37&#x000b0;C with shaking at 250 rpm, unless otherwise indicated.

Mice were individually monitored for up to 14 days by an observer (CL) blinded to the identity of the experimental groups for general appearance, weight change, mortality, and the development of arthritis, before being sacrificed. Clinical arthritis, defined by visible erythema and/or swelling of at least one joint, was scored from 0 to 3 for each limb (1, mild swelling and/or erythema; 2, moderate swelling and erythema; 3, marked swelling and erythema). An arthritic index was generated by adding the scores for each limb of a given animal. Histopathological evaluations of the limbs were performed after routine paraformaldehyde fixation, decalcification, paraffin embedding, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Tissue sections were evaluated for synovitis and joint destruction by an observer (CL) blinded to the identity of the groups.
