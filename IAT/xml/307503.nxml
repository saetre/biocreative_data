Previously this complex was known to consist of at least four subunits. We here report the identification of a fifth RF-C subunit from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, encoded by the RFC5 (YBR0810) gene. This subunit exhibits highest homology to the 38 kDa subunit (38%) of human RF-C (activator 1). Like the other four RFC genes, the RFC5 gene is essential for yeast viability, indicating an essential function for each subunit. RFC5 mRNA is expressed at steady-state levels throughout the mitotic cell cycle. Upon overexpression in Escherichia coli Rfc5p has an apparent molecular mass of 41 kDa. Overproduction of RF-C activity in yeast is dependent on overexpression of the RFC5 gene together with overexpression of the RFC1-4 genes, indicating that the RFC5 gene product forms an integral subunit of this replication factor.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0064-a" xlink:role="4990"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0060.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4986"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0061.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4987"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0062.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4988"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0063.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4989"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0064.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4990"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00024-0065.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4991"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
