It has been well established that receptor activator for nuclear factor &#x003ba; B ligand (RANKL, also known as TRANCE, ODF, OPGL, and TNFSF11) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) are required during osteoclast differentiation. Recent evidence suggests that immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) containing adapter proteins, DAP12 or Fc&#x003b5; receptor I &#x003b3; chain (FcR&#x003b3;), are critical for osteoclast maturation and function under normal physiologic conditions <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Humphrey1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Mocsai1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon activation, the tyrosines in the ITAM, YxxL/Ix6-8YxxL/I (where x represents any amino acid), are phosphorylated by members of the <italic>Src</italic> kinase family. The tyrosine kinase <italic>Syk</italic> is then recruited to initiate a signal transduction cascade, which includes phospholipase C&#x003b3; (PLC&#x003b3;), calcium mobilization, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), Ras, nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF&#x003ba;B), and nuclear factor for activation of T cells (NFAT).</p><p>With minimal extracellular domains, DAP12 and FcR&#x003b3; have no known ability to bind ligands. Therefore, they are insufficient to sense the local microenvironment alone. The DAP12 and FcR&#x003b3; signaling adapters associate with innate immune transmembrane receptors that have ligand recognition domains. Innate immune receptors are genetically encoded to sense environmental changes and provide front line defense against infection. Certain activating innate immune receptors, such as Dectin-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Herre1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, use intrinsic ITAMs to transduce activating signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Humphrey1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>; however, there is also a class of innate immune receptors that lack signaling motifs in their intracellular domains. Instead, these receptors with minimal cytoplasmic domains partner with ITAM-containing adapter proteins, like DAP12 or FcR&#x003b3;, and form protein complexes to mediate their downstream signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Koga1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Kim1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. ITAM-bearing adapter-associated receptors expressed in preosteoclasts or osteoclasts include triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM2), osteoclast-specific activating receptor (OSCAR), myeloid DAP12-associating lectin-1 (MDL-1), signal regulatory protein-&#x003b2; (SIRP&#x003b2;), and paired-Ig-like receptor-&#x003b1; (PIR&#x003b1;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Humphrey1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Depending on the structural properties of their transmembrane regions, these receptors will associate with either DAP12 or FcR&#x003b3; to transduce downstream signals. Mice that are doubly deficient in both adapter proteins, DAP12 and FcR&#x003b3;, have severe osteopetrosis with a trabecular bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) around 60&#x00025; and single nucleated osteoclasts both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Mocsai1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Mice that are deficient in a single adapter protein, either DAP12 or FcR&#x003b3;, have moderate or mild osteopetrosis, respectively. These data indicate that ITAM signaling mediated by these distinct groups of receptor-adapter protein complexes can compensate partially for each other. Poorly functional osteoclasts in double-deficient mice suggest that ITAM-containing adapter-associated receptors and their ligands present in the microenvironment are critical for osteoclast differentiation in normal bone remodeling.</p><p>Specific ligands that activate ITAM signals in osteoclast precursors have not been identified. It is also unknown whether ligands in the bone microenvironment are subjected to change in different physiological conditions. The mouse ovariectomy (OVX) model has been a useful tool to study rapid bone remodeling, induced by estrogen-deficiency that proceeds after bilateral oophorectomy. During OVX-induced bone loss, several genes have been identified to be essential in osteoclastogenesis, including &#x003b2;3 integrin, MIF, IGF-I, thrombospondin-2 and PAI-1. The deficiency of these genes has been shown to protect mice from bone loss in OVX studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Zhao1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Daci1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>; however, the role of ITAM signaling in bone remodeling during estrogen-deficiency has not been addressed.</p><p>Using the OVX model in mice that are deficient for either one or both ITAM-containing adapter proteins, we examined whether acute estrogen-deficiency would increase bone remodeling at several bone locations.

Eight-week-old female mice underwent sham operation (SHAM) or bilateral ovariectomy (OVX), and bone remodeling was evaluated at 6 weeks post-procedure. At the time of sacrifice, uterine atrophy confirmed successful ovariectomy in all four OVX groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000586-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). At 4 weeks after operation, urine and blood samples were collected to evaluate bone remodeling, using serum osteocalcin, a bone formation marker, and urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD), a bone resorption marker. Serum osteocalcin was increased in the OVX group of WT and <italic>DAP12-/-</italic> mice compared to their SHAM groups.

Notably, <italic>DAP12-/-</italic> and <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> mice had higher trabecular numbers compared to WT and <italic>FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000586-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). In all four groups of mice, only the <italic>DAP12-/-</italic> OVX group showed a statistically significant reduction in trabecular number. However, thinning of trabeculae and reduction in trabecular counts were not observed in the <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> OVX group compared to SHAM. These data suggest that ITAM adapter signaling is required for estrogen deficiency-related bone loss in the vertebrae, and the expression of either DAP12 or FcR&#x003b3; ITAM adapter is sufficient to mediate bone remodeling signals in vertebrae after OVX.</p><p>Cortical bone remodeling has been demonstrated to respond to estrogen-deficiency in mice. Therefore, we determined whether ITAM-adapter signaling is required during this process. We analyzed cortical bone proximal to the tibiofibular joint by &#x000b5;CT.

Thus, as in lumbar vertebrae, ITAM-adapter signaling is required for cortical bone loss induced by acute estrogen-deficiency.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Estrogen-deficiency induced trabecular bone loss in long bones is ITAM-adapter independent</title><p>MicroCT evaluation of the distal femur and proximal tibia was performed at 6 weeks post-OVX or SHAM operations.

The biggest decrease of BV/TV was seen in <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> mice, 21.3&#x00025; compared to 2.8&#x00025; in WT, 8.4&#x00025; in <italic>DAP12-/-</italic> and 5&#x00025; in <italic>FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> mice.</p><p>Mean density of the trabecular region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000586-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>) showed strong correlation with BV/TV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000586-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), whereas the mean density of trabeculae stayed constant in both groups from all four different mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000586-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>), indicating the bone loss was due to structural destruction of trabeculae. &#x000b5;CT-based structural analysis showed similar findings. Consistent with dysfunctional osteoclasts under normal bone remodeling conditions, <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> mice had the highest trabecular number and thickness in the SHAM group, followed by <italic>DAP12-/-</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000586-g003">Fig 3E, 3G</xref>). A statistically significant reduction in trabecular number was seen in all OVX groups at 6 weeks post operation compared to their SHAM groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000586-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Smaller trabecular spacing was also observed in all ITAM-adapter deficient mice SHAM groups compared to WT SHAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000586-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). Among them, <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> mice had the smallest spacing, about 1/3 of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000586-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>).

OVX induced a decrease in trabecular thickness in all four OVX groups compared to the SHAM groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000586-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>). Interestingly, while <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> OVX group still maintained higher trabecular number and smaller trabecular spacing among all OVX groups (p&#x0003c;0.05), the difference in trabecular thickness was no longer statistically significant after OVX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000586-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>). Similar bone losses were observed in the proximal tibia at 6 weeks in all OVX groups (data not shown). Thus, ITAM-adapter signaling is not required for estrogen-deficient bone loss in the trabecular rich regions of long bones, indicating that these bone microenvironments have an ITAM-adapter independent mechanism to generate active osteoclasts. Furthermore, mice deficient in DAP12 alone or in combination with FcR&#x003b3; deficiency had significantly more absolute bone loss than WT mice, suggesting loss of an inhibitory signal required to limit bone loss induced by OVX.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Estrogen-deficiency induces an increased number of multinucleated osteoclasts in DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/- mice in vivo</title><p>Although <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> mice failed to lose trabecular bone in their vertebrae and cortical areas under estrogen-deficient conditions, they showed a substantial trabeculae bone loss of 38&#x00025; in long bones. <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> osteoclasts have been shown to be defective in function both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro,</italic> with mononuclear osteoclasts having poor bone resorbing ability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Koga1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Mocsai1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Additionally, in the absence of RANKL, TNF&#x003b1; following TGF&#x003b2; treatment effectively induced multinucleated TRACP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> osteoclast formation in WT BMM.

ITAM signaling requires multiple components including ITAM-containing adapter proteins, adapter-associated downstream signal mediators, receptors, and their putative ligands. Variation in the local expression any of these ITAM signaling components may contribute to the changes in bone remodeling observed in unique bone microenvironments. The deficiency of ITAM-containing adapter proteins leads to a disconnection of intracellular signaling from the osteoclast microenvironment sensed by the receptors mediating these ITAM signals. Here we show that acute estrogen-deficiency induced osteoporosis is differentially affected by deficiency of ITAM adapter proteins. ITAM-adapter deficiency (<italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic>) leads to a complete blockade OVX induced bone loss in vertebrae and cortical bones. However, quite unexpectedly, ITAM signaling is bypassed in the estrogen-deficient state with losses of significant amounts of trabecular bone in the femur and tibia. More interesting, the mechanism bypassing ITAM signaling was not readily explained by our current understanding of requirements for osteoclastogenesis.</p><p>Severe osteopetrosis in the <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> mice suggests that ITAM-adapter signaling plays an important role in normal bone remodeling. Unlike other severely osteopetrotic mice, such as those deficient in MCSF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-VanWesenbeeck1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, PTHrP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Philbrick1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, c-fos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Wise1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, or RANKL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Kim3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> mice have tooth eruption, suggesting that there are mechanisms that allow normal osteoclastogenesis in the absence of ITAM-adapter signals. Thus, even under normal physiological conditions, distinct localized regulation of bone remodeling in <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> mice already exists. Signals that can bypass the need for ITAM-adapter signaling to induce the necessary osteoclast differentiation activity for tooth eruption are not known. Severe osteopetrosis in the long bones in <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> mice suggests that during normal physiological conditions osteoclastogenesis is largely controlled by ITAM-adapter signals transduced through a ligand-receptor-adapter axis, presumably involving interactions with the microenvironment. The exception of tooth eruption and bone mobilization during estrogen-deficiency suggests that there is an alternate signaling pathway that can be elicited in specific sites during certain stresses to induce bone remodeling.</p><p>Here we showed that during bone remodeling following acute estrogen-deficiency, the defect of osteoclastogenesis and function could be rescued in ITAM-adapter deficient mice in trabecular long bone. Our data suggest that during a physiological state of estrogen-deficiency, such as lactation, <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> mice would be able to mobilize calcium to nutritionally support bone growth of the next generation. This emergency signaling pathway, which is quiescent during normal physiological conditions, activates osteoclasts and mobilizes mineral without utilizing ITAM-adapter signaling. We applied different models and theories to expand our understanding about how ITAM-adapter signaling is bypassed during estrogen-deficiency in ITAM-adapter deficient mice. Estrogen-deficiency can rescue the osteoclast defect of ITAM-adapter deficient mice stimulating osteoclast multinucleation and promoting bone resorption <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, unlike wild-type mice, this enhanced osteoclastogenesis was not intrinsic to BMMs or preosteoclasts in ITAM-adapter deficient mice, as shown in the <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures. Secondly, estrogen-deficiency induces changes in cytokine and hormone levels, including increased levels of TNF&#x003b1; and FSH. Both TNF&#x003b1; and FSH have been shown to stimulate or even substitute for RANKL during osteoclastogenesis through different mechanisms. TNF&#x003b1;, in combination with TGF&#x003b2;, can induce osteoclast differentiation and multinucleation in the absence of RANKL in normal osteoclasts derived <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Kim2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, as shown in this study, these two new models could not explain the increase in multinucleated osteoclasts seen in the <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> OVX mice.</p><p>Although we investigated alternative methods of osteoclast activation, one important mechanism that we did not address is the role of T lymphocytes in acute estrogen-deficiency induced bone loss. However, Pierre Jurdic and colleagues (Lyons, France) have recently investigated the role of mature lymphocytes and ITAM-adapter signaling in bone remodeling induced by OVX (A. Anginot, <italic>et. al.</italic>, PLoS One, in press). They have completed similar studies examining the role of DAP12 signaling and mature T and B cells in the acute estrogen deficient state in constitutively inactive DAP12 (<italic>K&#x00394;75</italic>), RAG1 (<italic>RAG1-/-</italic>), or double deficient (<italic>RAG1-/-</italic>; <italic>K&#x00394;75</italic>) mice. Their results demonstrate increased bone loss in the double deficient (<italic>RAG1-/-; K&#x00394;75</italic>) mice suggesting that DAP12 ITAM signals negatively regulate bone remodeling in <italic>RAG1-/-</italic> mice consistent with our observations. Furthermore, <italic>RAG1-/-</italic> and <italic>RAG1-/-;K&#x00394;75</italic> mice lose significant bone after OVX indicating that mature T and B cells are not needed for estrogen-deficiency induced bone loss and do not provide the missing signal for osteoclastogenesis. Combined with our own studies, these results strongly suggest a novel, still to be discovered, osteoclast activation mechanism <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The complexity of the different roles of ITAM-adapter signaling in different local microenvironments is consistent with the nature of the associated receptors. TREM2 and OSCAR are immunoglobulin superfamily innate immune receptors expressed on osteoclasts. TREM2, associated with DAP12, is considered a putative pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) because it recognizes a wide variety of anionic ligands, including dextran sulfate and bacterial products such as lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Daws1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. PRRs are genetically coded and able to recognize conserved structural features in a large range of pathogens. Being able to sense these environmental changes, PRRs could respond upon ligand binding as a first line of defense. Presently, specific ligands in the bone for these two receptors are still unidentified.</p><p>Recent findings convincingly show that ITAM-containing adapter-receptor protein complexes can also send inhibitory signals, although the mechanism is still unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Turnbull1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Hamerman1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

It has been suggested that the type of downstream signals induced (activating or inhibitory) is dependent on the affinity and avidity of the extracellular ligands. High affinity or avidity ligands have been proposed to initiate activation, whereas low affinity or avidity ligands may cause inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000586-Turnbull1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have observed evidence of a dual function of ITAM-adapter signaling in osteoclasts. The absence of downstream activation signal in ITAM-adapter deficient mice accounts for the osteopetrosis and defective osteoclastogenesis in ITAM-adapter deficient mice during normal physiological conditions. In our study, <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> mice lose about 40&#x00025; trabecular long bone following OVX, which is similar to wild type, <italic>DAP12-/-</italic>, and <italic>FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> mice. However <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> and <italic>DAP12-/-</italic> mice have much higher baseline bone mass. If the absolute bone loss is taken into consideration, <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> mice and <italic>DAP12-/-</italic> quantitatively lose more bone compared to wild-type mice. One possible explanation is that a low affinity ligand in the bone marrow compartment is engaged by TREM2/DAP12 that initiates an inhibitory signal in osteoclasts through DAP12 to fine-tune the resorption magnitude. In the absence of both ITAM-adapter proteins, the &#x0201c;inhibitory&#x0201d; signals cannot be used to regulate bone resorption, which leads to an extremely high absolute trabecular bone loss in <italic>DAP12-/-FcR&#x003b3;-/-</italic> and <italic>DAP12-/-</italic> OVX mice. Thus, ITAM signaling adapters may have multiple functions in the regulation of osteoclasts. It will be necessary to identify these putative ligands in the bone to gain further insight into signals regulating these responses to local microenvironmental changes at distinct location and different stimuli in bone remodeling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal procedures were performed in accordance with American Association for the Accreditation of laboratory Animals (AAALC) guidelines and were approved by the VA Animal Care Committee.
