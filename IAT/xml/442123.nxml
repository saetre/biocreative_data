One morphological characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis is loss in the phospholipid asymmetry of the plasma membrane and exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer membrane leaflet. Surface exposure of phosphatidylserine is required for phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages and fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>A putative receptor for phosphatidylserine binding was cloned from human and mouse macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The receptor (PSR) was identified by phage display as the antigen for a monoclonal antibody generated against stimulated human macrophages. This antibody inhibited uptake of apoptotic cells by macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells.</p><p>When cells that do not express the receptor and cannot engulf apoptotic cells normally, like Jurkat T, were transiently or stably transfected with PSR they gained the ability to phagocytose apoptotic cells in a phosphatidylserine specific manner. Additionally it was demonstrated that, dependent on their interaction with phosphatidylserine, phagocytosing macrophages release cytokines to suppress the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In further studies it was shown that the interaction of phosphatidylserine with PSR is not so much involved in tethering the apoptotic cell towards the phagocyte but rather needed for ingesting it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Anti-PSR antibodies prevented the stereospecific phosphatidylserine dependent uptake of artificial target particles. Recently it was also supposed that PSR is involved in annexin-1 mediated apoptotic cell engulfment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. New work from <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>describes that embryonic cell corpses persisted for an average of 55% longer in PSR mutants when compared to wild type animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Mice deficient in PSR showed a much stronger phenotype. They died shortly after birth due to respiratory failure and exhibited an accumulation of non-ingested dying cells in the lung together with the recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes. They also showed hyperblastic brain malformations that in some aspects were similar to such observed in caspase-9 and APAF-1 knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>A very striking feature of PSR is its enormous conservation between mammals, flies and nematodes. This initiated our interest in the question of whether this protein was also present in <italic>Hydra </italic>and if conservation of its function was preserved.</p><p>We identified a <italic>Hydra </italic>cDNA encoding PSR with high homology to the mammalian, <italic>C. elegans </italic>and <italic>Drosophila </italic>genes. Absolutely conserved between PSR from all species are three nuclear localisation signals and an AT-hook DNA binding motif. In accordance with this we found <italic>Hydra </italic>PSR localised in the nuclei of transfected <italic>Hydra </italic>cells. Mutation of one of its nuclear localisation signals blocked this localisation. We have also identified a striking structural homology of all PSRs with the enzymatic domain of FIH-1 (factor inhibiting HIF) which has a 2OG-and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our data suggest that the primary function of PSR in <italic>Hydra </italic>is nuclear and not directly linked to phagocytosis. This idea may also apply to mammalian PSR. Very recent work shows nuclear localisation for human PSR in a number of mammalian cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Isolation and characterisation of a <italic>Hydra </italic>homologue of PSR</title><p>We first isolated <italic>Hydra </italic>PSR using sequence information from an alignment of human and mouse PSR with the predicted ORFs from <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Degenerated primers were designed and RT-PCR was carried out with hydra mRNA as template. PCR revealed a 0.5 kb product. It contained an ORF that showed substantial homology with the published PSR sequence. We labelled the PCR product with DIG and used it as a probe to screen a cDNA library. We obtained a full-length <italic>Hydra </italic>PSR clone.</p><p>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows an alignment of <italic>Hydra </italic>PSR with PSR from human, mouse, <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. The middle part of the molecule (red box) comprises the region with most conservation between species and contains a very ancient structurally conserved domain, the cupin fold. It is characterized by a &#x003b2;-barrel structure and has been found in prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins including metalloenzymes, sugar binding proteins and a number of seed storage proteins (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). More recently this cupin fold was detected in members of the jumonji (JmjC) family of transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Comparing domain structures of proteins containing JmjC domains revealed striking similarity of PSR with the HIF-inhibitory protein (FIH, factor inhibiting HIF, GenBank accession number Q9NWT6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). Both, PSR and FIH contain only one JmjC domain. The structure of human FIH-1 has recently been solved. The core of FIH-1 forms a &#x003b2;-barrel structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). It also contains a H-X-D/E dyad and a histidine residue located C-terminally of this motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These are features of a number of Fe(II) dependent enzymes that oxidise peptide substrates and 2-oxoglutarate using O<sub>2</sub>. In accordance with this structure it has been shown that FIH-1 is able to hydroxylate a specific asparagine residue within the transactivation domain of its substrate, HIF (hypoxia inducing factor). This allows the regulation of HIF activity in response to oxygen.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Hydra </italic>PSR sequence </bold>Clustal alignment of PSR sequences from <italic>Hydra </italic>(H. vul, accession number AY559448), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>(C. ele, NP500606), <italic>Drosophila </italic>(D. mel, NP651026), mouse (M. mus, AK122317.1) and human (H. sap, BAA25511).

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows an alignment of the FIH-1 &#x003b2;-barrel with the corresponding region in <italic>Hydra </italic>PSR. Arrows indicate extended &#x003b2;-strands as they were predicted by <bold>PredictProtein </bold>for PSR; extended &#x003b2;-strands for FIH-1 were taken from the published crystal structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. There is an obvious similarity in the arrangement of &#x003b2;-strands between the central domain of PSR and FIH-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Moreover, closer analysis of the 3-D structure of the &#x003b2;-barrel that is formed by the depicted &#x003b2;-strands of FIH-1 revealed the hydrophobic residues that stabilise the barrel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These are also conserved between PSR and FIH-1, making it very likely that the conserved core domains of both proteins adapt the same fold. Moreover, amino acids that are diagnostic for 2-OG and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenases are conserved (e.g. the H-X-D dyad, that coordinates the catalytic Fe (II) is represented by H199 and D201 in FIH-1 and by H187 and D189 in PSR, and the C-terminal histidine H279 in FIH-1 that corresponds to H272 in PSR, moreover a lysine residue that binds 2-OG, K214 in FIH-1 and K204 in PSR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, residues T196 in FIH-1 (=T184 in PSR) and N294 in FIH-1 (=N286 in PSR) in the active site are also conserved, whereas the neighbouring residues that line the active site pocket differ and N205 and F207 in FIH-1 correspond to A195 and N197 in PSR. This strongly suggests that the core domain of PSR could catalyse a similar oxidative reaction as FIH-1 or other members of the enzyme superfamily. The differences in the active site pocket, however indicate that PSR most likely has a different substrate specifity. Experimental proof for this prediction has to await the identification of a substrate for such an activity.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Alignment of the conserved core of human FIH-1 with the homologous region from <italic>Hydra</italic>-PSR </bold>Alignment of the conserved core of human FIH-1 forming the central &#x003b2;-barrel structure that harbours the active site with the homologous region from <italic>Hydra</italic>-PSR.

N-terminally to the central enzymatic domain the motif KTVRGRPKLS is found. It is completely conserved in PSR from <italic>Hydra </italic>to <italic>Homo sapiens </italic>(except an R-K exchange on position 4 in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>) and has high similarity with an AT-hook motif. This is a short DNA binding motif first described in the high mobility group of non-histone chromosomal proteins (HMG). Since then it has been discovered in a large number of DNA binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The motif is centred on the three amino acids GRP that are necessary and sufficient to bind to DNA.</p><p>Another conserved feature in PSR from <italic>Hydra </italic>to human are several putative nuclear localisation signals. They are (141) PKKRK (145) and (167) KRRPP (171) in the predicted cytoplasmic domain and (377) KRRK (380) in the predicted extracellular domain (illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> we have also indicated the putative transmembrane domain that was postulated by Fadok [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, none of the transmembrane prediction programs we used (see Methods) could identify a transmembrane domain in this region or anywhere else in the hydra PSR molecule.</p><p>This prompted us to investigate the subcellular localisation of this protein. Based on the described function of human PSR in phagocytosis a membrane association was expected.</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular localisation of PSR and its NLS-mutants</title><p>We expressed both, N-terminal (GFP-PSR) and C-terminal (PSR-GFP) GFP fusion proteins with PSR in hydra under the control of an actin promoter (B&#x000f6;ttger 2002). Subcellular localisation of the GFP-fusion proteins was observed in living animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and also after fixation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Both fusion proteins were clearly localised to the nucleus of hydra epithelial cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

In order to look for membrane localisation we used the vital membrane stain FM-464 (Molecular Probes) on non-fixed animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).

After deletion of NLS 1 or NLS 2, nuclear localisation could still be observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Deletion of both these NLS sequences did not change the nuclear localisation of the protein either (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). However, deletion of the most C-terminal NLS compromised nuclear localisation of the fusion protein dramatically. This is depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref> and in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>. In GFP-PSR&#x00394;NLS3 GFP is distributed throughout the cell, both in fixed and in non-fixed hydra cells. An additional GFP fusion protein only containing the JmjC domain of PSR is localised in the same way (not shown). Interestingly, although not nuclear, these mutants are not localised to the membrane either.</p><p>From these data we concluded that <italic>Hydra </italic>PSR is normally localised in the nucleus. Nuclear localisation depends on a C-terminal nuclear localisation signal. The nuclear function of this protein has still to be established. The presence of an AT-hook in the sequence suggests an attachment to DNA. More strikingly, the putative dioxygenase activity of this molecule that is inferred by comparison of its sequence and secondary structure with FIH-1, could point to a function in the regulation of nuclear proteins by hydroxylation. This regulation would be dependent on the concentration of oxygen, as it has been described for FIH-1 and oxygen dependent activation of HIF.</p><p>The question remained, if <italic>Hydra </italic>PSR also has a function in phagocytosis. We followed the fate of GFP-PSR in transfected hydra cells after induction of apoptosis with colchicine or with the PI(3) kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Both treatments lead to massive apoptosis of interstitial cells in <italic>Hydra </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These dying cells display phosphatidylserine on their surface and are phagocytised by epithelial cells. This was demonstrated by staining apoptotic hydra cells with annexin-V-fluorescin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). We could not observe a change in the nuclear localisation of GFP-PSR in epithelial cells that were in the process of phagocytising apoptotic cells. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> shows an epithelial cell that has ingested two apoptotic cells and appears to be in the process of phagocytising one more that is in its close proximity. GFP-PSR is still present in the nucleus and no GFP-PSR is localised to the membrane.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Phosphatidylserine on the extracellular face of apoptotic hydra cells </bold>(A) annexin-V-fluorescin label of a hydra cell after induction of apoptosis with colchicine, (B) phase contrast image of the cell, (C) absence of propidium iodid (PI) staining: PI can only enter cells after membrane integrity is lost, absence of PI staining indicates that annexin-V-fluorescin binds the extracellular face of the membrane.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-5-26-6"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>PSR stays in the nucleus of phagocytising cells </bold>Hydra epithelial cell expressing GFP-PSR in the nucleus.

We suggest that it is a nuclear dioxygenase that is capable of modifying nuclear proteins. We can, however, not exclude that the protein excerts an indirect effect on apoptosis and phagocytosis. The implied oxygen dependence of its putative enzymatic activity could interact with apoptotic mechanisms. This would also provide an additional explanation for the dramatic effect on lung development observed in PSR knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].

The 8 bit greyscale single channel images were overlayed to an RGB image assigning a false colour to each channel, and then assembled into tables using Adobe Photoshop 5.5.</p><p>Apoptosis was induced with 1 &#x003bc;M wortmannin for 4 hours before cells were analysed. For annexin-V-fluorescin staining apoptosis was induced with 0.4% colchicine for 6 hours. Animals were then dissociated with pronase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and incubated with annexin-V-fluorescin and PI. The two fluorochromes and the phase contrast were scanned as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural predictions</title><p>PSORT II[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] was used to predict the nuclear localisation signals.
