Linkage between actin filament retrograde flow and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) in growth cones is thought to be one of the mechanisms for axon outgrowth and guidance. However, the molecular basis for this linkage remains elusive. Here, we show that shootin1 interacts with both actin filament retrograde flow and L1-CAM in axonal growth cones of cultured rat hippocampal neurons, thereby mediating the linkage between them. Impairing this linkage, either by shootin1 RNA interference or disturbing the interaction between shootin1 and actin filament flow, inhibited L1-dependent axon outgrowth, whereas enhancing the linkage by shootin1 overexpression promoted neurite outgrowth. These results strengthen the actin flow&#x02013;CAM linkage model (&#x0201c;clutch&#x0201d; model) for axon outgrowth and suggest that shootin1 is a key molecule involved in this mechanism.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: CAM, cell adhesion molecule; DIC, differential interference contrast; NES, nuclear export signal; PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide-3-kinase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The nerve growth cone is the migrating tip of growing neurites and plays a central role in axon outgrowth and guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ramon y Cajal, 1890</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bray and Hollenbeck, 1988</xref>).

Previous studies demonstrated that CAMs such as apCAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Suter et al., 1998</xref>), Nr-CAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Faivre-Sarrailh et al., 1999</xref>), integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grabham et al., 2000</xref>), and L1-CAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kamiguchi and Yoshihara, 2001</xref>) are coupled with actin filament retrograde flow in growth cones. Consistently, coupling between apCAM and actin filament retrograde flow produced mechanical tension and induced protrusion of growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Suter et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>L1 is a single-pass transmembrane protein expressed predominantly in developing neurons and involved in axon outgrowth and guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lemmon et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dahme et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamiguchi et al., 1998</xref>). A recent study showed that ankyrin<sub>B</sub> promotes neurite initiation by coupling F-actin flow to L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nishimura et al., 2003</xref>). However, ankyrin<sub>B</sub> was involved neither in their coupling in growth cones nor in L1-mediated neurite elongation, and the molecular basis for the actin flow&#x02013;CAM linkage in growth cones remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Suter et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gil et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nishimura et al., 2003</xref>). It is also unanswered whether coupling of this linkage is involved in the regulation of axon outgrowth. Recently we described a novel brain-specific intracellular protein, shootin1, which is involved in axon formation and polarization of cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Toriyama et al., 2006</xref>). Shootin1 accumulates in axonal growth cones, and its accumulation in growth cones dynamically enhances neurite elongation. Shootin1 was shown to act upstream of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). However, shootin1-induced axon formation was not fully suppressed by a PI 3-kinase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Toriyama et al., 2006</xref>), which suggests the existence of an additional mechanism for axon outgrowth. Here, we show that shootin1 interacts with both actin filament retrograde flow and L1-CAM in growth cones. Our data suggest that shootin1 mediates the linkage between actin retrograde flow and L1-CAM to promote axon outgrowth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Shootin1 interacts with both actin filament retrograde flow and L1-CAM in growth cones</title><p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> shows shootin1 immunoreactivity in a cultured rat hippocampal neuron.

To elucidate the association of shootin1 with cytoskeletal dynamics in growth cones, we performed fluorescent speckle microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Waterman-Storer and Salmon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Watanabe and Mitchison, 2002</xref>). We performed live imaging of EGFP-shootin1 expressed at a low level in cultured hippocampal neurons. EGFP-shootin1 appeared as discrete speckle signals that serve as fiduciary marks, allowing measurement of molecular movement of shootin1.

To confirm this, we inhibited actin polymerization near the leading edge of lamellipodia with cytochalasin. As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Forscher and Smith, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Medeiros et al., 2006</xref>), treatment of XTC fibroblasts with 1 &#x003bc;M cytochalasin D led to disruption of the peripheral regions of actin filament networks in lamellipodia. The boundary of the mCherry-actin speckles moved from the leading edge of lamellipodia at 1.3 &#x000b1; 0.3 &#x003bc;m/min (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10), and the flow speed of actin speckles was reduced to 0.9 &#x000b1; 0.1 &#x003bc;m/min (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and Video 4). Concurrently, the boundary of EGFP-shootin1 speckles moved rearward at the same rate (1.2 &#x000b1; 0.4 &#x003bc;m/min, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10) and the speed of shootin1 speckles was also reduced to 1.0 &#x000b1; 0.1 &#x003bc;m/min (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10), thereby indicating that the signals of shootin1 coincide with the redistribution of actin filament networks. Similar rearward movement of the boundary of EGFP-shootin1 speckles and a reduction of the speed of shootin1 speckles were also induced by cytochalasin D in filopodia and lamellipodia of axonal growth cones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref> and Video 5).

Together, these results indicate that L1 is linked to actin filament retrograde flow in the axonal growth cones of hippocampal neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Shootin1 mediates the linkage between actin filament retrograde flow and L1 in growth cones</title><p>To examine whether shootin1 mediates this linkage, we first suppressed shootin1 expression in hippocampal neurons using short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Neurons expressing shRNA against shootin1 were immunostained by anti-shootin1 antibody after the observation of actin filament retrograde flow in growth cones (Fig. S2, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712138/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712138/DC1</ext-link>).

In addition, there was no significant difference in the levels and organization of actin filaments in growth cones expressing shootin1 shRNA and those expressing control shRNA (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; three independent cultures, 150 growth cones examined; P &#x0003d; 0.27; Fig. S2 C).</p><p>However, suppression of shootin1 by shRNA significantly reduced the flow velocity of L1-Fc&#x02013;coated beads (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 71, P &#x0003d; 0.0000035 compared with control; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A, B, and E</xref>; and Videos 6 and 7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712138/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712138/DC1</ext-link>), although it did not affect the percentage of the beads that showed retrograde flow. The peak velocity of moving beads declined substantially from 0.8&#x02013;1.0 &#x003bc;m/min to 0.4&#x02013;0.6 &#x003bc;m/min. In addition, expression of an RNAi refractory myc-shootin1 rescued the effect of shootin1 RNAi (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 44; P &#x0003d; 0.85 compared with control; P &#x0003d; 0.00024 compared with RNAi; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C&#x02013;E</xref>). Each L1-Fc&#x02013;coated bead probably binds to multiple L1 molecules in growth cones, thereby monitoring the engagement of multiple L1 molecules with actin filament retrograde flow. Thus, the reduction in the flow velocity of L1-Fc&#x02013;coated beads by RNAi without a change in the actin filament retrograde flow rate suggests that suppression of shootin1 in growth cones reduces the number of L1 molecules linked to actin flow. We do not rule out the alternative possibility that L1 can bind to F-actin flow weakly even in the absence of shootin1. In such a case, shootin1 down-regulation would lead to a decrease in the number of L1 molecules strongly linked to F-actin flow. Concerning the percentage of the moving beads, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gil et al. (2003)</xref> found that the stationary behavior of beads bound to cell surface L1 is mediated by ankyrin. The percentage of moving L1-Fc&#x02013;coated beads may therefore be mainly regulated by this molecule. Together, these results suggest that shootin1 mediates the linkage between actin filament retrograde flow and L1 in growth cones.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Repression of shootin1 expression by RNAi weakens the actin flow&#x02013;L1 linkage.</bold> (A, B, and D) DIC micrographs showing retrograde movement of L1-Fc&#x02013;coated beads on axonal growth cones (two days in vitro) expressing a control shRNA (A), the shRNA designated against shootin1 (B), or the shRNA designated against shootin1 together with the mutant myc-shootin1 (D), which is refractory to the shRNA (left), and time series of the indicated areas at 30-s intervals (right).

Actin flow&#x02013;CAM linkage has also been found to produce mechanical tension in nonneuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Felsenfeld et al., 1996</xref>) and has been implicated in cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Felsenfeld et al., 1996</xref>) and the relocation of cell&#x02013;cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kametani and Takeichi, 2007</xref>). Concerning the actin flow&#x02013;CAM linkage in growth cones, a critical question that remains to be addressed is the molecular basis for the linkage. It is also unknown whether coupling of this linkage induces axon outgrowth. Here, we have shown that shootin1 interacts with both actin filament retrograde flow and L1 in axonal growth cones and provided evidence that shootin1 mediates the linkage between them. When this linkage was impaired by shootin1 RNAi or NES-&#x00394;N-shootin1, axon outgrowth was inhibited in an L1-dependent manner. However, enhancing the linkage by shootin1 overexpression promoted L1-dependent neurite outgrowth. We previously found that shoootin1 overexpression induced formation of multiple axons on coverslips coated with polylysine and laminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Toriyama et al., 2006</xref>). As laminin binds to multiple CAMs, including L1 and its chicken relative NgCAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grumet et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brummendorf and Rathjen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hall et al., 1997</xref>), we considered the fact that the coverslips coated with polylysine and laminin could monitor L1-dependent neurite outgrowth by shootin1. Collectively, the present results suggest that shootin1 is a key molecule involved in the actin flow&#x02013;CAM linkage for axon outgrowth.</p><p>We do not rule out the involvement of other molecules in the linkage between actin filament flow and L1, or the possibility that shootin1 may couple actin flow to other CAMs. Unknown molecules may mediate the interaction between shootin1 and L1, as we could not obtain evidence that shootin1 directly interacts with L1. At present, it is also unknown whether shootin1 interacts directly with actin filaments or through association with other molecules. The velocity of L1-Fc&#x02013;coated microbeads on growth cones was slower than those of shootin1 and actin filament retrograde flows. Therefore, the couplings between shootin1 and L1 may incorporate &#x0201c;clutchlike&#x0201d; slippages as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1988</xref>), or this may simply be reflective of the fact that the retrograde flow has to move a heavy bead. Recently, we detected phosphorylated forms of shootin1 in cultured hippocampal neurons (unpublished data). It will be intriguing to learn whether phosphorylation of shootin1 is involved in modulation of actin flow&#x02013;CAM linkage, which has been implicated in regulation of axon outgrowth and guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Suter et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Suter and Forscher, 2000</xref>). Detailed molecular mechanisms involved in actin filament&#x02013;shootin1 linkage and shootin1-L1 linkage remain important issues for future analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, this study has shown that shootin1 mediates the linkage between actin filament retrograde flow and L1 in growth cones.

Unexpectedly, myc-&#x00394;N-shootin1 preferentially accumulated in the neuronal nucleus, whereas it was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of XTC cells. To express myc-&#x00394;N-shootin1 in the cytoplasm of neurons, we fused the NES LSLKLAGLDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukuda et al., 1996</xref>) to the N terminus of &#x00394;N-shootin1.

For vector-based RNAi of L1, we also used the BLOCK-iT Pol II miR RNAi Expression Vector kit (Invitrogen). The targeting mRNA sequence 5&#x02032;-ATCATTCAGACTACATCTGCA-3&#x02032; corresponds to nucleotides 605&#x02013;625 in the coding region of rat L1, whereas the control vector pcDNA 6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR-neg encodes an mRNA not to target any known vertebrate gene. To ensure a high-level expression of shRNA before neurite elongation, hippocampal neurons prepared from embryonic day 18 rat embryo and transfected with the expression vector shRNA were plated on uncoated polystyrene plates. After a 20-h incubation to induce shRNA expression, the cells were collected and cultured on coverslips coated with polylysine, L1-Fc, or N-cadherin&#x02013;Fc.
