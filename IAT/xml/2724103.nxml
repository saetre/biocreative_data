One such effector, SptP, functions early during pathogen entry to deactivate Rho GTPases and reverse pathogen-induced cytoskeletal changes following uptake. SptP also harbors a C-terminal protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) domain with no clear host substrates. Investigating SptP's longevity in infected cells, we uncover a late function of SptP, showing that it associates with SCVs, and its PTPase activity increases pathogen replication. Direct SptP binding and specific dephosphorylation of the AAA&#x0002b; ATPase valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97), a facilitator of cellular membrane fusion and protein degradation, enhanced pathogen replication in SCVs. VCP and its adaptors p47 and Ufd1 were necessary for generating <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced filaments on SCVs, a membrane fusion event characteristic of the pathogen replicative phase. Thus, <italic>Salmonella</italic> regulates the biogenesis of an intracellular niche through SptP-mediated dephosphorylation of VCP.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>MICROBIO</kwd><kwd>SIGNALING</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>To initiate infection of humans and animals, the intracellular pathogen <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium invades nonphagocytic intestinal cells, remodeling the host actin cytoskeleton and manipulating signal transduction pathways to induce membrane ruffling and trigger pathogen uptake by macropinocytosis.

Although SCVs transiently display markers characteristic of early endosomes, e.g., Rab5 and transferrin receptor, they rapidly uncouple from the default endocytic pathway so that interaction with host lysosomes is limited and bacterial degradation is evaded (<xref rid="bib15 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Garvis et&#x000a0;al., 2001; Steele-Mortimer et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>).

While SPI-1-delivered effectors are translocated during the initial entry process, those delivered by SPI-2 are expressed later in SCVs. Nevertheless, it has become evident that several SPI-1-delivered effectors persist and influence postentry events (<xref rid="bib3 bib16 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Brawn et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Hernandez et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Steele-Mortimer et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>).

The SPI-1 effector SopB also associates with vesicular membranes, where its phosphoinositide (PI) phosphatase activity leads to the accumulation of PI(3)P on the SCV and enhancement of membrane fusion with other PI(3)P-containing vesicles (<xref rid="bib16 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hernandez et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Marcus et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). The SPI-1 effector SptP (<italic>Salmonella</italic> protein tyrosine phosphatase) has an N-terminal domain that functionally mimics GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) by deactivating the Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42 and reversing the cytoskeletal rearrangements induced by the SPI-1 SopE/E2/SopB effectors to effect uptake (<xref rid="bib13 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Fu and Galan, 1999; Patel and Galan, 2006</xref>).

HeLa cell infections were initiated by incubation with this strain for 1 hr, after which extracellular bacteria were killed by adding the antibiotic gentamicin, which does not penetrate HeLa cells. Host cells were lysed at intervals up to 8&#x000a0;hr postinfection, and T3SS-delivered SptP<sup>FLAG</sup> was detected at all time points by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). This observation confirmed and extended data (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kubori and Galan, 2003</xref>) showing that SptP persists a long time after bacterial internalization by avoiding proteasome-dependent degradation (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>A). Immunofluorescence of the infected HeLa cells indicated that SptP<sup>FLAG</sup> accumulated around 15% &#x000b1; 3% of intracellular bacteria, as exemplified at the 8 hr point in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B. Further immunofluorescence microscopy showed that SptP-positive bacteria were found to reside within SCVs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>B). To localize T3SS-delivered SptP<sup>FLAG</sup> with more precision, we mechanically fractionated HeLa cells 8 hr postinfection and verified separation of the pellet containing plasma membranes (marked by caveolin), nuclei (histone), and bacteria (AcrB) from internal membranes (calnexin) and cytoplasm (Hsp90) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C).

To assess whether SptP<sup>FLAG</sup> might influence these postinvasion events, HeLa cells were infected in parallel by wild-type <italic>Salmonella</italic>, an <italic>sptP</italic> chromosomal deletion mutant (<italic>&#x00394;sptP</italic>), and the mutant complemented with a recombinant <italic>sptP</italic> gene on a plasmid (<italic>&#x00394;sptP</italic> pSPTP, which translocates 50% more SptP<sup>FLAG</sup> than wild-type bacteria [<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>A] [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cain et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>]).

At 6 hr, Sif formation was clearly visible in 54.6% &#x000b1; 1.1% of wild-type infected cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>B). Although SptP was apparently excluded from Sif structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B), their formation was reduced to 26.4% &#x000b1; 1.1% with the <italic>&#x00394;sptP</italic> mutant and was restored to wild-type levels by complementing with pSPTP. This was mirrored in intracellular replication assayed at 8 hr (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D, open squares versus circles), which was reduced from 14.3- &#x000b1; 1.4-fold to 4.2- &#x000b1; 2.6-fold with the <italic>&#x00394;sptP</italic> mutant, but was recovered&#x02014;indeed, enhanced&#x02014;to 35.2- &#x000b1; 2.8-fold when <italic>&#x00394;sptP</italic> was complemented with pSPTP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D, open triangles versus circles).

Nevertheless, disabling the active site of PTPases stalls catalysis and can stabilize target binding to allow the capture of trapped substrates (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Flint et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>). SptP carrying the aspartate-to-alanine substitution at residue 441 was fused to GST, immobilized onto glutathione Sepharose beads, and used to probe porcine brain extract for potential host targets. Following parallel incubation of immobilized GST-SptP<sup>D441A</sup> (SptP<sup>D441A</sup>) and wild-type GST-SptP (SptP<sup>WT</sup>) with brain extract (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A, upper), the beads were washed (W) and mammalian proteins eluted with extract buffer containing vanadate (V), a phosphotyrosine mimic that competitively inhibits PTPase-substrate binding (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Huyer et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>). Remaining SptP was then eluted with extract buffer containing reduced glutathione (G). While SptP<sup>WT</sup> did not isolate any host protein discernable by Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE, SptP<sup>D441A</sup> captured a protein migrating at approximately 100 kDa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A, upper p100). Capture of this protein by SptP<sup>D441A</sup> was blocked by preincubating the brain extract with vanadate prior to addition of the beads (data not shown). The putative p100 target was isolated and identified, using mass spectrometry, as VCP (valosin-containing protein, also named p97), a eukaryotic <underline>A</underline>TPase associated with a variety of activities (AAA&#x0002b; family) that facilitates disassembly of protein complexes during membrane fusion and protein degradation (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Ye, 2006</xref>). Immunoblotting the same fractions from the pull-down experiments with antisera against VCP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A, lower) reconfirmed that the SptP<sup>D441A</sup>-bound protein was VCP, and also indicated a weaker interaction between VCP and SptP<sup>WT</sup>. When recombinant His-tagged VCP (VCP<sup>WT</sup>) was generated and incubated in binding buffer with immobilized SptP<sup>D441A</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B), direct interaction was evident and could be disrupted with 1 M NaCl (N), demonstrating that binding requires no additional factors and probably involves charge-charge associations. To ascertain whether the SptP PTPase domain alone is sufficient for VCP binding, the GAP (residues 162&#x02013;290) and PTPase<sup>D441A</sup> (residues 300&#x02013;542) domains were fused independently to GST and purified. In agreement with published findings (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fu and Galan, 1998</xref>), both GST-GAP and GST-PTPase domains retained their enzymatic activity (data not shown), but neither SptP GAP or PTPase<sup>D441A</sup> was able to bind recombinant VCP<sup>WT</sup>, as shown in empty lanes (N) in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C, or endogenous porcine VCP (data not shown).</p><p>To assess further whether VCP is an SptP PTPase substrate, purified VCP<sup>WT</sup> was first tyrosine phosphorylated in&#x000a0;vitro (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A; VCP<sup>phos</sup>). The major site of phosphorylation in VCP is known to be tyrosine 805 (<xref rid="bib10 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Egerton and Samelson, 1994; Zhao et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), and VCP phosphorylation at this functionally relevant tyrosine was confirmed by marked reduction in phosphorylation when tyrosine 805 was substituted for phenylalanine to generate VCP<sup>Y805F</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A; VCP<sup>phos</sup>). When phosphorylated VCP<sup>WT</sup> (2 &#x003bc;M) was incubated with even low picomolar concentrations of SptP<sup>WT</sup>, it was dephosphorylated, while phosphorylation of control proteins N-WASP and aldolase was unaffected, even by nanomolar concentrations of SptP<sup>WT</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B; VCP<sup>phos</sup>, N-WASP<sup>phos</sup>, aldolase<sup>phos</sup>).

Parallel immunofluorescence, as exemplified in the inset boxes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B), indicated that VCP localized to approximately 12% &#x000b1; 4% of intracellular bacteria up to 8 hr postinfection.

The heterodimeric adaptors Npl4 and Ufd1 associate with VCP during protein degradation, while VCP controls membrane fusion events via its adaptor, p47.

For example, VCP-p47 complexes associate with the t-SNARE syntaxin5, which is a VCP adaptor involved in membrane fusion events (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Rabouille et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>). The association of VCP-p47 with syntaxin5 is known to be promoted by dephosphorylation of VCP, and this leads to increased membrane fusion events (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lavoie et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether SptP-dependent dephosphorylation of VCP promotes associations with syntaxin5 during HeLa cell infection. First, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a mammalian expression vector encoding HA-tagged syntaxin5, which was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and assessed for coprecipitated VCP by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C). In all cases, VCP was predominantly observed in the unbound supernatant fraction, but VCP was also coprecipitated by immobilized syntaxin5 from noninfected controls cells (bound VCP). There was a clear enhancement in the amount of bound VCP in cells infected with wild-type <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, whereas this increase was not evident when cells were infected with the <italic>&#x00394;sptP</italic> null mutant (&#x02212;). When HeLa cells were infected with the <italic>&#x00394;sptP</italic> strain delivering plasmid-encoded SptP (pSPTP), the levels of bound VCP were enhanced considerably over that isolated from noninfected control cells and those infected with the <italic>&#x00394;sptP</italic> null mutant alone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we reveal a late function for the <italic>Salmonella</italic> SPI-1 effector SptP. We show that this effector persisted for at least 8 hr after <italic>Salmonella</italic> internalization into HeLa cells, and that like the other late-acting effectors, SopB and SipA, it was located at internal membranes, including SCVs. Our initial data indicated that, in infected cells, the SptP PTPase activity promotes bacterial replication in SCVs, so we set out to identify the putative host cellular substrate(s) of the SptP PTPase. By using the D441A variant of SptP, in which the PTPase site was specifically disabled, we were able to trap a single substrate and identify it as VCP, a host AAA&#x0002b; ATPase that performs a motor-like function to facilitate protein complex disassembly in diverse cellular processes (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Ye, 2006</xref>).</p><p>We showed that SptP-VCP interaction in&#x000a0;vitro is direct, requiring no third protein, but the SptP PTPase domain alone was not sufficient to enable VCP binding and in&#x000a0;vitro dephosphorylation. This requirement for both SptP effector domains could explain why VCP was not previously identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using only the isolated SptP PTPase domain (this work indicated the intermediate filament protein vimentin as a potential binding partner for SptP, but the significance of this remains unclear [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Murli et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>]). The dual activities of SptP contrast to the situation in <italic>Yersinia</italic>, which has two distinct SptP homologs; the Rho GAP mimic YopE acts on Rho GTPases (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Black and Bliska, 2000</xref>), while the PTPase YopH targets tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins at focal adhesion complexes (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Black and Bliska, 1997</xref>). Our data indicate that fusion of the GAP and PTPase moieties is required for SptP-dependent VCP dephosphorylation, compatible with evidence from many mammalian tyrosine phosphatases that employ noncatalytic domains to mediate substrate interactions (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Tiganis and Bennett, 2007</xref>), and is presumably responsible for the observed specificity of SptP. Consistent with this hypothesis, GAP-defective SptP<sup>R209A</sup> binds and dephosphorylates VCP in&#x000a0;vitro (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>).</p><p>We were able to confirm that SptP specifically dephosphorylates host VCP during cell infection, and this did not occur when the PTPase active site was disabled. This dephosphorylation event appears to promote <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>A). Depleting the phosphorylated form of VCP through augmenting delivered SptP levels enhanced pathogen replication in SCVs, whereas replication of the <italic>&#x00394;sptP</italic> strain, which is unable to dephosphorylate VCP, is impaired (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>B). We found that RNAi depletion of VCP increased intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication. However, unlike the increase seen when SptP delivery was augmented, this was due to induced SCV instability and consequent bacterial release into the nutrient-rich cytoplasm (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>C). This is not entirely surprising, as VCP depletion impairs multiple cellular processes (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Wojcik et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). To probe the role of VCP in SCV biogenesis more precisely, we additionally targeted the major pathway-specific adaptors through which VCP effects its myriad functions (<xref rid="bib9 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Dreveny et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Ye, 2006</xref>). VCP promotion of Sif formation and intracellular wild-type <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication was impaired by knockdown of either the membrane fusion adaptor p47 or the protein degradation adaptor Ufd1 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>D), as observed following infection with the <italic>&#x00394;sptP</italic> strain. Although Npl4 forms a heterodimeric complex with Ufd1, we observed no effect following Npl4 depletion. This may be due to the relative inefficiency of the Npl4 RNAi knockdown. Interestingly, the VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 pathway has been shown to be required for replication of the intracellular pathogen <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dorer et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). We show that <italic>Salmonella</italic> exploits both p47- and Ufd1-dependent pathways to promote SCV biogenesis.</p><p>How does dephosphorylation affect VCP function? The distribution of VCP, including its recruitment to the SCV, was found to be independent of SptP (data not shown), suggesting that dephosphorylation does not influence localization. However, the sheer abundance of VCP (up to 1% of total cellular protein) means we cannot rule out subtle changes in the distribution of small subpopulations. A low proportion of SCVs localized with VCP, as was also the case for SptP, indicating that interactions with the SCV are likely transient or, alternatively, that the site of action of VCP is not the SCV itself. Indeed, we identified a significant pool of both VCP and SptP on other internal membranes that may interact with the SCV during its maturation. In addition, the substrate-trap SptP<sup>D441A</sup> was absent from SCVs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>A), implying that SptP may target VCP at membranes distinct from the SCV.</p><p>The activities of pathway-specific VCP-adaptor complexes are further defined by interaction with specific coadaptors and/or substrates in a hierarchical manner (<xref rid="bib9 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Dreveny et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Schuberth and Buchberger, 2008</xref>). Over forty proteins are currently known to bind VCP, and the molecular details of these interactions are only beginning to emerge (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Yeung et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Several VCP adaptors and coadaptors whose binding is prevented by VCP phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib22 bib23 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Madsen et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Zhao et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>) have, however, been identified. Both p47 and Ufd1-Npl4 have been shown to bind to N-terminal regions of VCP, distal to the site of tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pye et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). However, the binding of VCP-p47 and VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 complexes to various coadaptors can involve the C-terminal phosphotyrosine (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Madsen et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). One such example is the interaction of VCP-p47 with the t-SNARE syntaxin5, which is known to be promoted by dephosphorylation of VCP and leads to increased membrane fusion events (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lavoie et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). SptP may therefore manipulate VCP function by regulating its interaction with specific coadaptors. Indeed, we show that during infection, SptP-mediated dephosphorylation leads to an increase in the binding of VCP to syntaxin5. In the absence of SptP, this interaction was greatly reduced. By enhancing VCP-syntaxin5 association, SptP thus promotes fusion events within the cell that are likely crucial for the maturation and maintenance of the SCV (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>). This is consistent with the accelerated acquisition of LAMP1 observed in strains delivering augmented levels of SptP. Further work is required to determine whether any other of the plethora of VCP-interacting proteins are also regulated by <italic>Salmonella</italic> in this manner. Our findings uncover a target for the enigmatic SptP PTPase domain that reveals a mechanism by which <italic>Salmonella</italic> subverts host processes to promote the biogenesis of its intracellular niche.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Bacterial Strains and Plasmids</title><p>The <italic>&#x00394;sptP</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;invG sptP::3&#x000d7;FLAG</italic> mutants and wild-type <italic>sptP::3&#x000d7;FLAG</italic>, <italic>sopE2::3&#x000d7;FLAG</italic>, and <italic>sopB::3&#x000d7;FLAG</italic> were constructed using &#x003bb; Red recombination as described for <italic>sipA::3&#x000d7;FLAG</italic> (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Brawn et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), and the bacterial expression plasmid pSPTP has been described (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cain et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>).
