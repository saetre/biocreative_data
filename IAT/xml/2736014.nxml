ROS functions in the regulation of many cellular responses, including autophagy&#x02014;a response to stress conditions such as nutrient starvation and metabolic stress. In this study, we show that TIGAR can modulate ROS in response to nutrient starvation or metabolic stress, and functions to inhibit autophagy. The ability of TIGAR to limit autophagy correlates strongly with the suppression of ROS, with no clear effects on the mTOR pathway, and is p53 independent. The induction of autophagy in response to loss of TIGAR can function to moderate apoptotic response by restraining ROS levels. These results reveal a complex interplay in the regulation of ROS, autophagy and apoptosis in response to TIGAR expression, and shows that proteins similar to TIGAR that regulate glycolysis can have a profound effect on the autophagic response through ROS regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>ROS</kwd><kwd>TIGAR</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autophagy&#x02014;a mechanism that results in lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic constituents&#x02014;is a critical response to metabolic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Meijer and Codogno, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mizushima, 2007</xref>). Limited autophagy in response to nutrient starvation has been shown to provide a survival function, and specific removal of damaged mitochondria by autophagy can also help prevent the activation of apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). However, in some systems, the induction of autophagy has been shown to contribute to, or enhance, the apoptotic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Crighton <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The contribution of autophagy to tumour progression is complex, although evidence from animal studies suggests that autophagy can have an important tumour suppressive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Qu <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Yue <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Marino <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Although autophagy in response to nutrient deprivation or metabolic stress is mediated through the regulation of the TSC-mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Reiling and Sabatini, 2006</xref>), recent studies have also highlighted the important contribution of mitochondrially generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) to this response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Scherz-Shouval <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Chen and Gibson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). ROS are produced as a normal by-product of cellular metabolism and function as signalling molecules that are involved in numerous pathways regulating cell proliferation, senescence, apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Martindale and Holbrook, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Balaban <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). ROS have been shown to induce autophagy through several distinct mechanisms involving the Atg4 family of protein proteases, the mitochondrial electron transport chain and catalase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Yu <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Scherz-Shouval <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>p53 is a tumour suppressor protein that has a critical function in inhibiting cancer development, and mutation in the p53 pathway is an extremely common event in most human cancers. p53 induces many responses&#x02014;including cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptotic cell death&#x02014;each of which may contribute to tumour suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Murray-Zmijewski <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). However, in addition to the ability to block cell proliferation, several activities of p53 that contribute to cell survival have also been described. These include functions of p53 as an anti-oxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Sablina <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) and in the regulation of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Matoba <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bensaad and Vousden, 2007</xref>). Although the induction of survival signals seems to be inconsistent with the well-understood apoptotic function of p53, it has been suggested that this response may contribute to repair and recovery under conditions of mild stress, whereas more severe damage elicits the apoptotic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Vousden and Lane, 2007</xref>). It is not clear how this switch in p53 responses is regulated, but this is likely to be an important factor in determining the success of p53-based therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Vousden and Prives, 2009</xref>). Intriguingly, the p53 tumour suppressor gene has recently also been shown to function to both induce and inhibit autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Crighton <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Tasdemir <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), although the contribution of this response to tumour suppression is not fully resolved.</p><p>A key mechanism of function of p53 is as a transcription factor, and the DRAM proteins have been identified as important mediators of the induction of autophagy by p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Crighton <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, other p53-target genes that contribute to the regulation of metabolic pathways and oxidative stress may also have a function in the regulation of autophagy. Several p53-inducible genes encode proteins that can function as anti-oxidants, and the constitutive p53-dependent expression of these anti-oxidant proteins under normal growth conditions <italic>in vivo</italic> helps to protect cells from the accumulation of ROS-associated DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Sablina <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). This can help to prevent the accumulation of mutations that might not only lead to genomic instability and cancer development, but has also been associated with a role for p53 in preventing premature ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Matheu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). One of the p53-target genes that contributes to the regulation of intracellular ROS levels encodes TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator), which indirectly affects ROS through the modulation of the glycolytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bensaad <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The TIGAR protein shows similarity to the bisphosphatase domain of PFK-2/FBPase-2 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase), an enzyme that has an essential function in the regulation of glycolysis. Recently, TIGAR has been shown to function to hydrolyse fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Li and Jogl, 2009</xref>), two activities that lead to the same effects on glycolysis. Expression of TIGAR results in a decreased levels of Fru-2,6-P<sub>2</sub> and a decreased glycolytic rate, which in some cells was shown to be pro-apoptotic. However, dampening of flux through the glycolytic pathway by TIGAR also leads to the redirection of glycolytic metabolic intermediates to the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. One consequence of this function of TIGAR is an increased NADPH production, which contributes to the scavenging of ROS by reduced glutathione. Induction of this pathway by TIGAR results in decreased intracellular ROS levels and a lower sensitivity of cells to oxidative stress-associated apoptosis, including that induced by p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bensaad <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, ROS levels will also impact autophagy, so we have investigated the effects of TIGAR expression on the autophagic and apoptosis response in non-stressed cells and after conditions of nutrient starvation or metabolic stress.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>TIGAR regulates intracellular ROS levels in response to nutrient starvation or metabolic stress</title><p>We have shown previously that TIGAR expression can modulate intracellular ROS levels in response to oxidative stress inducing signals such as DNA damage or p53 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bensaad <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). We extended these studies to examine the effect of TIGAR on intracellular ROS levels after nutrient starvation or metabolic stress in U2OS cell lines that constitutively over-expressed ectopic TIGAR, or after siRNA-mediated inhibition of endogenous TIGAR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Consistent with our earlier observations, we found that in these tissue culture systems even background levels of ROS were lower in cells constitutively expressing TIGAR compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, nutrient starvation or metabolic stress strongly elevated ROS levels and over-expression of TIGAR effectively inhibited this enhancement of ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). Conversely, knockdown of TIGAR expression resulted in an increase in ROS levels, and the increase in ROS induced by nutrient starvation and metabolic stress was further elevated after inhibition of the endogenous TIGAR protein by siRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TIGAR expression modulates autophagy</title><p>Recent results have shown that the autophagic response to nutrient starvation or metabolic stress involves ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Scherz-Shouval <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). To determine whether changes in TIGAR expression and the consequent modulation of ROS levels can affect autophagy, we examined the response of cells to nutrient starvation or metabolic stress, two signals that have been shown to effectively induce an autophagic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Munafo and Colombo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Jin and White, 2007</xref>). Autophagy was monitored by measuring the formation of autophagosomes, as measured in cells by the accumulation of GFP-tagged LC3 puncta by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Klionsky <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). As expected, either nutrient starvation or metabolic stress resulted in a strong activation of autophagy, which was significantly reduced in the TIGAR over-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). We have found previously that siRNA depletion of TIGAR expression in U2OS cells sensitized them to ROS-dependent apoptotic signals, and therefore we investigated the effect of TIGAR knockdown on the induction of autophagy. Interestingly, removal of TIGAR enhanced autophagy in unstressed cells, as well as in response to nutrient starvation or metabolic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). There was a very close correlation between the activation of autophagy and the elevation of ROS levels after knockdown of TIGAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2B</xref>). The increase in autophagy after siRNA-mediated inhibition of TIGAR expression was seen in various cell lines, including other transformed cells and untransformed primary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>To further validate the effects of TIGAR expression on autophagy, we analysed several other parameters of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Klionsky <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). The lipidation of the ubiquitin-like protein LC3 during the process of autophagy can also be used as a marker. The modification of LC3-I to form LC3-II during autophagy was measured by western blot, in which the increase in modification and conversion to LC3-II (indicative of autophagy) correlated with levels of TIGAR expression after treatment with different siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). Conversely, less LC3-II was formed in cells over-expressing TIGAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). The degradation of p62, which serves as a link between LC3 and ubiquitinated substrates, and the mitochondrial protein COX-IV also serve as markers of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Klionsky <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). A decrease in the levels of both of these proteins was observed after inhibition of endogenous TIGAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether TIGAR expression is regulated after starvation or metabolic stress, we examined protein levels in various cell lines over a time course of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). These results did not show a clear difference in overall levels of TIGAR expression, consistent with our observation that TIGAR depletion enhances autophagy even under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). Glucose starvation has been shown to induce a p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Jones <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), which might be expected to induce TIGAR expression. However, under the short-time course examined here, in which a clear autophagic response was seen, we did not note strong activation of p53 as measured by increase in p53 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>), or enhanced expression of another p53-target gene, p21 (data not shown). However, the expression of TIGAR in these cells is, to some extent, dependent on basal levels of p53, as siRNA-mediated reduction of p53 leads to a drop in TIGAR levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TIGAR expression modulates autophagy independently of p53</title><p>The formation of GFP-LC3 vesicles is a convenient way to measure autophagy, but could result from either the increased rate of autophagosome formation or an inhibition in their turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Klionsky <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). To determine whether TIGAR expression is promoting the degradation or inhibiting the formation of autophagosomes, we examined the accumulation of LC3 vesicles in cells treated with bafilomycin A1, which prevents degradation of autophagic vacuoles by inhibiting fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Yamamoto <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). If the effect of TIGAR knockdown is to drive accumulation of vesicles through inhibiting their maturation, we would expect bafilomycin A1 treatment to neutralize the effect of TIGAR. However, even in the presence of bafilomycin A1, there was still a clear increase in autophagosome formation after inhibition of TIGAR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that TIGAR can have a function in inhibiting the formation of autophagosomes rather than activating their degradation, and that removal of TIGAR promotes the autophagic response.</p><p>Earlier studies have shown that p53 can contribute to both the induction and inhibition of autophagy, and that nutrient starvation/metabolic stress can induce p53. The ability of p53 to regulate autophagy has been shown to be dependent both on direct cytoplasmic activities of p53, as well as on the activity of p53-inducible genes such as DRAM, which promotes autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Crighton <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Tasdemir <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). As TIGAR is a p53-target gene that seems to have a function in limiting autophagy, we were interested to determine the interplay between p53 and TIGAR, or DRAM and TIGAR, in the regulation of this process. The enhanced autophagic response to TIGAR inhibition was clearly retained in cells depleted of p53, indicating that p53 is not required for TIGAR-dependent modulation of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, p53 was clearly required for the autophagic response to nutrient starvation in cells that retain TIGAR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results suggest a balance in which p53 has a function in enhancing autophagy in these cells (possibly through regulation of DRAM expression), with TIGAR serving to dampen this response by decreasing ROS levels. As p53 regulates TIGAR expression, TIGAR levels were significantly lower after siRNA-mediated depletion of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, even these reduced TIGAR levels were sufficient to limit autophagy in both untreated cells or in response to starvation, as shown by the enhanced autophagy after inhibition of TIGAR expression in p53 siRNA-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). To more directly assess the function of DRAM in the regulation of autophagy, we used siRNA to deplete cells of DRAM expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Crighton <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). As expected, inhibition of DRAM expression reduced the autophagic response under all conditions, although starvation still enhanced autophagy in the absence of DRAM, suggesting that other p53-dependent genes may have a function in promoting autophagy under these conditions. Knockdown of TIGAR enhanced autophagy regardless of the presence or absence of DRAM, showing that these two proteins function independently to promote and inhibit autophagy, respectively.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Modulation of ROS by TIGAR correlates with modulation of autophagy</title><p>To determine whether the autophagy induced in our cell systems was dependent on increased ROS, we modulated ROS levels directly by treatment with <italic>N</italic>-acetyl cystein (NAC) and <sc>L</sc>-ascorbic acid, direct scavengers of ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>) or hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to enhance intracellular ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). Both nutrient starvation and metabolic stress-induced autophagy were lowered by the anti-oxidant treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). We were, however, unable to completely prevent the autophagic response by NAC and ascorbate treatment, suggesting that some ROS-independent autophagy was also being induced in these cells after these treatments. Treatment of cells with increasing concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> enhanced intracellular ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>) to levels comparable with those seen after knockdown of TIGAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, enhanced ROS in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also promoted autophagy, even in the absence of further stresses, to levels very similar to those seen after TIGAR depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that the changes in ROS levels seen after alterations in TIGAR expression may be responsible for the effects on autophagy. Further support for this model was provided by the observation that although anti-oxidant treatment with NAC and ascorbate effectively lowered autophagy in response to nutrient starvation or metabolic stress, this treatment had little further effect on decreasing autophagy in TIGAR over-expressing cells, in which autophagy in response to either nutrient starvation or metabolic stress was already lower compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). The earlier described effects of TIGAR in lowering intracellular Fru-2,6-P<sub>2</sub> levels, promoting the pentose phosphate pathway and decreasing intracellular ROS levels, are consistent with the ability of TIGAR to carry out the bisphosphatase function of the bifunctional enzyme PFK-2/FBPase-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bensaad <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Li and Jogl, 2009</xref>). We have shown previously that the activities of TIGAR can be mimicked by the expression of the isolated bisphosphatase domain (FBPase-2) from PFK-2/FBPase-2. Accordingly, expression of the isolated bisphosphatase domain also inhibited starvation or metabolic stress-induced autophagy to levels comparable to that seen after over-expression of TIGAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, the effect of expression of the isolated FBPase-2 domain was also lost after anti-oxidant treatment, as seen for TIGAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). Similar results were obtained in cells stably over-expressing TIGAR (data not shown) and in cells treated with a number of other anti-oxidants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results are, therefore, consistent with a function for TIGAR in preventing autophagy by lowering ROS levels, as the effect of TIGAR is greatly diminished when ROS are removed by another mechanism (NAC and ascorbate). Conversely, the autophagic response induced after inhibition of endogenous TIGAR expression by treatment with siRNA was reduced after anti-oxidant treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>), which correlated with a decrease in ROS levels after anti-oxidant treatment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TIGAR does not clearly affect the mTOR signalling pathway</title><p>Although we have concentrated on a function for TIGAR in regulating autophagy through the control of ROS, it is possible that other functions of TIGAR might control other pathways important in the regulation of autophagy. The most obvious of these is signalling through mTOR, the inhibition of which has been shown to be a critical component driving the activation of autophagy in response to nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Meijer and Codogno, 2004</xref>). A decrease in mTOR signalling in response to nutrient deprivation can be assessed by a reduction in phosphorylation of the downstream target proteins p70 S6 kinase and S6 ribosomal protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Averous and Proud, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). Depletion of TIGAR expression, which results in enhanced autophagy, had no effect on the overall levels of p70 S6 kinase or S6 ribosomal protein. Furthermore, knockdown of TIGAR expression did not result in any clear reduction in the basal phosphorylation levels of either S6 kinase or S6 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>), and did not change the kinetics of the disappearance of the phosphorylated forms. Similarly, inhibition of TIGAR expression did not prevent the reappearance of phosphorylated S6 kinase and S6 after nutrient restimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). The lack of effect of TIGAR knockdown on mTOR signalling was also noted in H1299 and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3B and C</xref>), as well as RKO and RPE cells (data not shown). Finally, over-expression of TIGAR did not clearly delay the loss of S6 kinase or S6 phosphorylations (data not shown). These results suggest that there is no clear effect of TIGAR on mTOR signalling and indicate that this is not the principal mechanism by which TIGAR prevents autophagy.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TIGAR modulates ROS levels upstream of the autophagic response</title><p>Our model suggests that TIGAR lowers ROS levels and as a consequence decreases the levels of ROS-dependent autophagy. However, it is clear that autophagy itself can lower intracellular ROS levels (mainly by eliminating dysfunctional mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>)), creating a loop in which autophagy and ROS can modulate each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Azad <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). We therefore wished to investigate the effect of inhibition of autophagy on the ability of TIGAR to regulate ROS. The autophagic process can be blocked by removal of the ATG5 or ATG10 proteins, whose expression is essential for autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Suzuki <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Xie and Klionsky, 2007</xref>). ATG5 and ATG10 expression was reduced by using previously described siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Boya <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Crighton <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and validated in our cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Knockdown of ATG5 or ATG10 strongly decreased the formation of GFP-LC3 vesicles in response to starvation and/or TIGAR depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). As seen earlier, ROS levels were increased in starved cells, and this effect was further enhanced by loss of TIGAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly, the inhibition of autophagy by ATG5 or ATG10 knockdown further enhanced ROS levels under the same conditions, consistent with a function for autophagy in the removal of mitochondria (the main source of ROS generated during starvation) and the protection of cells from increased ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results show that the increased ROS levels seen after TIGAR depletion are not dependent on the ensuing autophagy&#x02014;rather that the induction of autophagy limits, to some extent, this accumulation of ROS in the cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TIGAR modulation of autophagy influences apoptosis</title><p>A complex interplay between apoptosis and autophagy has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Suzuki <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Maiuri <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). In some systems, the induction of autophagy can enhance apoptotic cell death, although the mechanisms underlying this cooperation are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Crighton <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). More straightforward is the ability of autophagy to decrease apoptosis, an effect that seems to be a reflection of the ability of autophagy to modulate ROS levels&#x02014;as shown above&#x02014;and remove damaged mitochondria. This prevents the release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c from the mitochondria and the activation of the apoptotic cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Colell <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Our earlier studies have shown that TIGAR can function to inhibit apoptosis by limiting ROS levels in response to p53 activation or genotoxic stress, although TIGAR was not effective in modulating apoptosis that was not dependent on ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bensaad <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Treatment of cells with a caspase inhibitor to block apoptosis had no effect on the formation of autophagosomes after nutrient starvation, and TIGAR was equally efficient in inhibiting autophagy in these cells in the presence or absence of caspase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). The induction and modulation of autophagy was, therefore, not dependent on apoptosis. On the other hand, however, we found that the apoptotic response was affected by the modulation of autophagy. Consistent with a model in which autophagy can limit ROS levels by preventing the generation of ROS by mitochondria, and in agreement with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>, inhibition of autophagy by depletion of ATG5 or ATG10 resulted in significantly enhanced apoptosis in response to either nutrient starvation or metabolic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B and C</xref>), correlating with the observed elevation of ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). In keeping with an anti-oxidant function for TIGAR, ectopic expression of TIGAR inhibited apoptosis, and this anti-apoptotic effect of TIGAR was even more profound after inhibition of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). The reduction in autophagy after TIGAR expression was not compensated by an increase in other forms of cell death, as overall cell survival was also enhanced by TIGAR expression in both the absence and presence of a caspase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), which reduced the apoptotic rate to background levels in these cells (data not shown). These results suggest that TIGAR, through lowering ROS, reduces both apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Conversely, knockdown of TIGAR expression enhanced apoptosis under all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that the ability of TIGAR to down-regulate ROS levels can limit both apoptosis and autophagy, although autophagy itself can also function to decrease ROS levels and so lower apoptosis.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our earlier work described an ability of TIGAR to decrease ROS levels through modulation of the glycolytic pathway, and an anti-apoptotic effect of TIGAR expression through this mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bensaad <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). We have now found that the ability of TIGAR to modulate ROS levels also has a profound effect on autophagy, with loss of TIGAR dramatically increasing autophagy, even in otherwise unstressed cells. This regulation of autophagy by TIGAR seems to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of the control of ROS by TIGAR, an effect similar to that seen in response to the modulation of the levels of catalase, a major ROS scavenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Yu <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Changes in TIGAR expression do not clearly alter the levels of p70 S6 kinase or the ribosomal S6 protein phosphorylation in the short term, suggesting that the control of autophagy by TIGAR through ROS regulation is not directly mediated by the mTOR signalling pathway. Interestingly, in this system autophagy can limit apoptosis, and so the two activities of TIGAR in reducing both autophagy and apoptosis would seem to be contradictory. This is apparent from the observation that direct inhibition of autophagy by knockdown of ATG5 or ATG10 further enhanced the increase in apoptosis seen in response to inhibition of TIGAR expression. These results further highlight the complex interplay of responses to modulation of ROS levels in determining the outcome of cell death or survival in response to stress.</p><p>The identification of an autophagy-regulating function for TIGAR further increases the intricacy of possible responses to p53 activation. Both TIGAR and DRAM can be transcriptionally activated by p53, and we show here that the autophagy inhibition function of TIGAR and the autophagy promoting activity of DRAM are independent, with both influencing the ultimate outcome. The ability of p53 to function in the cytoplasm to limit autophagy adds more complexity to the response. Furthermore, a number of other p53-regulated genes, in addition to TIGAR, are involved in the control of ROS. This anti-oxidant activity of p53 is important even in the absence of acute stress and functions to control tumour progression by preventing DNA damage and genetic instability. The Sestrin proteins have also been identified as an important component of the regulation of ROS by p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Budanov <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). This family of proteins was initially shown to function through the reduction, and thereby regeneration, of sulphinylated peroxiredoxins&#x02014;which can catalyse the reduction of hyperperoxides. The expression of Sestrins in response to p53 was shown to be important to lower ROS levels in cells with activated Ras and so control genetic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kopnin <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Given the similarity of function between the Sestrins and TIGAR, it might be predicted that Sestrins expression would also inhibit autophagy by removing ROS. However, more recently, Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 have been shown to activate activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to the inhibition of mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Budanov and Karin, 2008</xref>). This function of the Sestrins, which seems to be unrelated to the anti-oxidant activity, would be expected to have the opposite effect on autophagy, as inhibition of mTOR activity promotes autophagy. Although the ability of Sestrins to regulate autophagy has not been tested directly, it seems likely that there will be a balance between the positive regulation through mTOR inhibition and the negative regulation through anti-oxidant activity. A more recent study suggesting that Sestrin2 does not function as a peroxiredoxin reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Rhee <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>) also raises the possibility that the anti-oxidant activity of at least this member of the Sestrin family may be mediated through a different mechanism. In conclusion, TIGAR does not clearly impact the mTOR signalling pathway, and so the opposing function on autophagy that may be shown by the Sestrins is not shared by TIGAR. Importantly, our results also provide a link between the direct regulation of glycolysis by TIGAR and the control of autophagy through ROS, rather than the mTOR pathway.</p><p>Our results also suggest that the basal levels of TIGAR expression seen in our cell culture models (that are p53 dependent) are sufficient to modulate the autophagic response and that no increase in TIGAR expression is necessary. These results do not, however, preclude the existence of other mechanisms that control TIGAR function in response to nutrient starvation, such as alteration of subcellular localization, post-translational modification or interaction partners.</p><p>Apoptosis has a clear function in preventing tumour development, although the function of autophagy is less clear. Although the survival functions of autophagy suggest that this response may contribute to tumour development, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of mice deficient in the autophagic response suggest a tumour suppressive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Botti <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Overall, a tumour suppressive function of TIGAR would be consistent with its activity as a mediator of the p53 response, and could reflect multiple consequences of TIGAR contributing to the control of ROS levels, preventing the accumulation of genetic damage and protecting cells from apoptosis to allow repair of genotoxic damage. Loss of TIGAR leads to enhanced ROS-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bensaad <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), although this is balanced to some degree by an increase in autophagy, which dampens the increase in ROS and the extent of the apoptotic response. Several activities of p53 have been described that function to lower ROS levels, alter metabolism and promote cell survival. Although these may be entirely legitimate functions in response to p53 activating signals, to either help prevent damage or allow for repair, these activities would require close control, as their inappropriate expression could help to assist malignant transformation. Indeed, there is evidence that some of the survival and anti-oxidant responses to p53 are down-regulated under conditions of sustained stress when the cells shift to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Sablina <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bensaad <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). It therefore seems possible that deregulated and sustained activation of these p53-response pathways (e.g. the inappropriate maintenance of expression of TIGAR in cells that are switching to an apoptotic response) may contribute to tumour development. Given these potentially opposing functions of TIGAR in suppression and promotion of tumourigenesis, it is difficult to predict the effect of modulation of TIGAR expression on cancer development. Most clearly, inhibition of TIGAR expression promotes ROS-dependent apoptosis, and it seems likely that cancer cells will be particularly susceptible to such a response. The recently reported structure of TIGAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Li and Jogl, 2009</xref>) will help in the development of small molecule modulators of TIGAR activity that will ultimately allow direct testing of the effect of TIGAR inhibition on tumour cell growth and survival.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Flag-tagged-TIGAR was obtained by RT&#x02013;PCR using sense primer CGGGATCCCGCACCATGGACTACAAG and antisense primer CGGGATCCTTAGCGAGTTTCAGTCAGTCC, then subcloned into pcDNA3.1 to create pcDNA3.1-Flag-tagged-TIGAR.
