Mutations in type X collagen cause metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid (MCDS), a disorder characterised by dwarfism and an expanded growth plate hypertrophic zone. We generated a knock-in mouse model of an MCDS&#x02013;causing mutation (<italic>COL10A1</italic> p.Asn617Lys) to investigate pathogenic mechanisms linking genotype and phenotype. Mice expressing the collagen X mutation had shortened limbs and an expanded hypertrophic zone. Chondrocytes in the hypertrophic zone exhibited endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and a robust unfolded protein response (UPR) due to intracellular retention of mutant protein. Hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation and osteoclast recruitment were significantly reduced indicating that the hypertrophic zone was expanded due to a decreased rate of VEGF&#x02013;mediated vascular invasion of the growth plate. To test directly the role of ER stress and UPR in generating the MCDS phenotype, we produced transgenic mouse lines that used the collagen X promoter to drive expression of an ER stress&#x02013;inducing protein (the cog mutant of thyroglobulin) in hypertrophic chondrocytes. The hypertrophic chondrocytes in this mouse exhibited ER stress with a characteristic UPR response. In addition, the hypertrophic zone was expanded, gene expression patterns were disrupted, osteoclast recruitment to the vascular invasion front was reduced, and long bone growth decreased. Our data demonstrate that triggering ER stress <italic>per se</italic> in hypertrophic chondrocytes is sufficient to induce the essential features of the cartilage pathology associated with MCDS and confirm that ER stress is a central pathogenic factor in the disease mechanism. These findings support the contention that ER stress may play a direct role in the pathogenesis of many connective tissue disorders associated with the expression of mutant extracellular matrix proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Mutations in genes for extracellular matrix proteins are generally thought to exert their pathogenic effects because of resulting defects in extracellular matrix. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that such mutations can also have significant effects inside the cell due to the induction of ER stress. Mutations in type X collagen cause a dwarfism called metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid. A gene targeted mouse model expressing mutant type X collagen exhibited an expanded hypertrophic zone of the growth plate and significant increases in cellular ER stress, as noted previously. VEGF expression was disrupted leading to decreases in the rate of vascular invasion. To directly assess the role of elevated ER stress in disease pathogenesis, transgenic mouse lines expressing an exogenous, ER stress&#x02013;inducing protein (<italic>cog</italic> mutant of thyroglobulin&#x02014;Tg<sup>cog</sup>) targeted to hypertrophic chondrocytes were generated. Mice expressing Tg<sup>cog</sup> protein showed elevated ER stress, an expanded hypertrophic zone, and reduced bone growth demonstrating that elevated ER stress and the resultant UPR is the principal pathogenic mechanism causing this cartilage pathology. It is possible that therapeutic strategies aimed at alleviating ER stress may be beneficial in this and other connective tissue diseases caused by mutant extracellular matrix genes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most bones in the body grow by a process of endochondral ossification in which a cartilage template is laid down and subsequently converted to bone. The process takes place in well-defined growth plates at the ends of long bones. Longitudinal bone growth is achieved in a tightly controlled process in which chondrocytes first proliferate forming columns, then exit the cell cycle, hypertrophy and mineralise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Aszdi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Zuschik1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Collagen X is expressed solely and specifically by hypertrophic chondrocytes although the precise function of this protein in bone growth remains controversial. Roles for collagen X as an extracellular scaffold or in the mineralisation of hypertrophic growth plate have been proposed and yet most studies have shown that gene ablation does not produce an overt phenotype in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Chan1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Bateman1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes die by programmed cell death as blood vessels invade the calcified region of the growth plate. The vasculature introduces osteoclasts which erode the mineralised cartilage matrix and osteoblasts which replace the cartilage matrix with bone. The differentiation process is controlled by a cascade of growth factors including PTHrP, Indian Hedgehog and VEGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Zuschik1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Kronenberg1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Zelzer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Mutations in cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as collagens II, IX, X and XI, aggrecan, COMP and matrilin 3 disrupt growth plate differentiation and cause chondrodysplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Kuivaniemi1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Newman1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In these types of dysplasia, it is generally thought that the pathology arises as a result of an ECM that is either defective due to the incorporation of the mutant protein or alternatively, deficient in the protein due to intracellular degradation of the mutated protein prior to secretion. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the synthesis of mutant proteins destined for the ECM can trigger ER stress in affected cells eliciting an UPR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Wilson1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Bateman2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The UPR is orchestrated through the interaction of the molecular chaperone BiP (Grp78) with a set of transmembrane ER stress sensors (IRE1, ATF6, PERK). BiP normally binds to these membrane bound sensors but as ER stress increases, BiP is sequestered into the ER lumen by interaction with accumulating unfolded proteins. Loss of BiP binding causes the stress sensors to activate resulting in downstream events such as Xbp-1 splicing, ATF6 cleavage, eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation and ATF4 translation (extensively reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Bernales1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Schrder1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>). As a result, the synthesis of stress related proteins such as chaperones like BiP are increased to enhance the protein folding capacity of the ER. General protein synthesis is decreased through phospho eIF2&#x003b1;-dependant translational suppression of 5&#x02032; cap containing mRNAs to slow down the entry of unfolded protein into the ER. In addition, relevant pathways for disposing of misfolded proteins such as ER associated degradation or autophagy are up-regulated.</p><p>Mutations in type X collagen, predominantly clustered in the C-terminal non collagenous (NC1) domain that is required for collagen trimer assembly, cause MCDS, a relatively mild form of dwarfism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Bateman1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Warman1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Wallis1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Nevertheless, the Tg<sup>cog</sup> -expressing mouse exhibited an expanded growth plate hypertrophic zone with decreased numbers of osteoclasts at the vascular invasion front and decreased rates of bone growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g009">Figure 9</xref>), a phenotype reminiscent of the mutant collagen X mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, Tg<sup>cog</sup> caused changes in the expression patterns of other genes in the hypertrophic zone similar to those produced by MCDS-causing mutant forms of collagen X reported here and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g010">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Tsang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Ho1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>). These data from the <italic>ColXTg<sup>cog</sup></italic> mouse demonstrate that the predominant pathological features of MCDS can be phenocopied by simply elevating ER stress and provoking an UPR in hypertrophic chondrocytes. We therefore conclude that potential extracellular consequences of the secretion of mutant collagen X do not appear to play a major role in the pathogenic mechanism. Furthermore, since the wildtype collagen X synthesised by the <italic>ColXTg<sup>cog</sup></italic> mouse was not retained but secreted normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g009">Figure 9B</xref>), the defective secretion of a putative binding partner for collagen X seems unlikely as a potential pathogenic factor. The phenotype of the <italic>ColXTg<sup>cog</sup></italic> mouse demonstrates mechanistically the central role played by ER stress in the MCDS disease process.</p><p>How might the UPR be inducing the disruption in hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation resulting in the MCDS phenotype? In both the <italic>Col10a1</italic> p.Asn617Lys and <italic>ColXTg<sup>co</sup></italic><sup>g</sup> mouse lines, hypertrophic differentiation appeared to start normally with the up-regulation of collagen X expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g010">Figure 10</xref>). However, in these mouse lines, the expression of the collagen X gene equates to the induction of increased ER stress and an UPR due to the synthesis of a mutant protein (collagen X and Tg<sup>cog</sup> in the respective mouse models). Expression of either of the mutant proteins correlated directly with the induction of mRNA for BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g010">Figure 10</xref>) which is indicative of an UPR. Subsequently, the levels of mRNAs encoding the mutant proteins decreased dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g010">Figure 10</xref>) and this is presumably accompanied by a decreased rate of synthesis of the ER stress-inducing protein. The closely related reduction in BiP mRNA suggests that at this point, hypertrophic chondrocytes had established an UPR which was effectively dealing with the accumulated unfolded protein thus restoring homeostasis to the ER. Supporting this contention is the observation that a reduction in the intracellular accumulation of mutant collagen X and its delayed secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g004">Figure 4A</xref> inset) appeared to correlate with the generalised down-regulation of BiP mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). One possible explanation for how an UPR could cause a reduction in steady state levels of mRNA for particular genes may reside in the accompanying attenuation of general protein synthesis due to eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Bernales1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Schrder1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> which could impact upon steady state levels of transcription factors driving the chondrocyte differentiation process. Decreases in these transcription factors would result in transcriptional attenuation for dependant genes. Such an explanation would account for why the wildtype collagen X gene expressed in the <italic>ColXTg<sup>cog</sup></italic> mouse was down-regulated in a similar fashion to the Tg<sup>cog</sup> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g010">Figure 10</xref>) and demonstrates that the effects of an UPR on transcription are generic and not in some way targeted at loci producing the mutant transcripts. The loss of these transcription factors would also explain the failure to induce significant expression of VEGF which, as discussed above, results in the expanded hypertrophic zone. Alternatively, the rapid degradation of a subset of ER-localised mRNAs catalysed by IRE1 in response to increased ER stress has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Hollien1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> and a similar phenomenon may be occurring in hypertrophic chondrocytes. The relationship between UPR and transcription is complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Rutkowski1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> and future work will address this relationship in these mouse lines.</p><p>Once the initial ER stress induced by the expression of mutant collagen X or the Tg<sup>cog</sup> transgene has been dealt with, the chondrocytes appear to revert to a prehypertrophic phenotype characterised by the re-expression of collagen II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g010">Figure 10</xref>), PTHrP receptor and Indian hedgehog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Tsang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Ho1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and data not shown) prior to re-initiating terminal differentiation including collagen X expression. This re-engaging of the differentiation process is not synchronised in the lower half of the expanded hypertrophic zones and gives rise to the characteristic &#x02018;speckled&#x02019; pattern of gene expression seen. Completion of the terminal differentiation step, hypertrophy, is achieved in a highly synchronised fashion in the normal growth plate as evidenced by the expression of markers such as osteopontin by a one or two cell deep layer adjacent to the vascular invasion front (wildtype, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g010">Figure 10</xref>). However, individual cells scattered throughout the lower half of the expanded hypertrophic zones express osteopontin in a non-coordinated fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g010">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Tsang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Ho1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>). The disruption and delay in the terminal differentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes including the reduced VEGF signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g010">Figure 10</xref>) caused by the UPR results finally in reduced rates of bone growth. It is noteworthy that for mice heterozygote for the collagen X mutation and mice hemi- or homozygous for the <italic>ColXTg<sup>co</sup></italic><sup>g</sup> allele, reduced rates of bone growth could only be detected in juvenile, rapidly growing animals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000691-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g009">Figure 9</xref> respectively). In all these genotypes, the bone lengths achieved by 10 weeks of age were not significantly different from wildtype controls meaning that the decreased rates of bone growth exhibited in juvenile mice were compensated for as bone growth rates decreased into adulthood (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000691-t001">Table 1</xref>). In the case of the <italic>ColXTg<sup>co</sup></italic><sup>g</sup> mouse line, it is possible that the regression of the pathology is in part due to transgene silencing in maturing animals as reported for the <italic>Col10al.13 del</italic> mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Tsang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Tg<sup>cog</sup> and elevated BiP expression were still detectable in animals at 6 weeks of age (data not shown). In addition, the promoter used in the current study to drive Tg<sup>cog</sup> expression was significantly longer than that used in the previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Tsang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and contained all the sequences necessary to direct <italic>bona fide</italic> collagen X expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Zheng1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. The regression of pathology in the wt/m <italic>Col10a1</italic> mutant mouse is unlikely to be due to gene silencing since in this line, expression was driven by the endogenous collagen X promoter. It seems more likely that, as discussed below, regression of pathology is related to reduced levels of ER stress being experienced in the growth plate as the rates of growth decrease into adulthood. In humans it has also been reported that some of the milder skeletal changes associated with MCDS appear to regress with age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Savarirayan1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>These observations raise several important points and questions. Firstly, how does disease severity relate to the level of ER stress experienced? Several different factors may influence the level of ER stress experienced by a cell. Previous studies have clearly demonstrated a gene dosage effect relating the level of mutant collagen X expression, and therefore the level of ER stress experienced, to the disease severity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Tsang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Ho1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Likewise, in this study, wt/m and &#x0002b;/c mice had significantly milder phenotypes than their homozygote counterparts. Natural, growth-related alterations in the level of gene expression may account in part for the transient expansion of the hypertrophic zone apparent in growth plates of wt/m and &#x0002b;/c animals at 3 weeks of age as peak growth rates are achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000691-g009">Figure 9</xref>). In addition, the milder phenotype of mice homozygous for the <italic>Tg<sup>cog</sup></italic> allele which exhibit no permanent dwarfing in comparison with the mutant <italic>Col10a1</italic> allele may relate to the fact that the former transgene is expressed at only around one third the level of the latter. It is also possible that different mixed genetic backgrounds account for some of the variations in phenotype noted between lines such as the earlier onset of hypertrophic expansion apparent in the &#x0002b;/c mice at birth. Other factors that will influence the level of ER stress experienced by a cell include: the nature of the mutation which may interfere with protein folding in different ways producing misfolded proteins that are more or less easily dealt with by the cell; and the behaviour of the misfolded protein is also critical since, as recently demonstrated for mutant forms of type I collagen, aggregates in the ER trigger autophagy whereas non-aggregated forms are subject to ER associated degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Ishida1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. In this manner, different mutations in the same protein may produce different levels of ER stress and therefore account, at least in part, for the spectrum of clinical phenotype seen in MCDS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Bateman1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Secondly, the transient nature of the phenotype in our heterozygote mouse lines coupled to the fact that some of the skeletal pathology associated with MCDS in humans appears to regress with age raises the possibility that relatively modest decreases in the level of ER stress may produce significant improvements in clinical severity. Methods of reducing ER stress using chemical chaperones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Cohen1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> or drugs designed to reduce ER stress by targeting pathways that control the stress response itself or mechanisms of degradation for misfolded proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Kim2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> are being developed and these represent possible novel therapeutic opportunities for treating MCDS. Finally, the fact that increased ER stress and the resulting UPR is of pathogenic significance in chondrocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> (as shown here and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Tsang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Ho1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>) supports the contention that such stress may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of many of the connective tissue diseases that are caused by mutations in ECM or related genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Tsang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Bateman2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of mutant mice</title><p><italic>Col10a1</italic> p.Asn617Lys mouse line: Gene targeting was performed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000691-Talts1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.
