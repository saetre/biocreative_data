In the present study, two trihelix family transcription factor genes <italic>GmGT-2A</italic> and <italic>GmGT-2B</italic> from soybean were identified to be stress-responsive and conferred stress-tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants through regulation of downstream genes. This study adds the trihelix family members to those transcription factors that can improve plant stress-tolerance.</p><p>The GmGT-2B exhibited transcriptional activation activity in both the yeast assay and the protoplast assay, whereas the GmGT-2A did not have this activity. This difference in transcriptional activation ability may result in the differential gene expressions in the transgenic plants, with more genes being highly or specifically expressed in the <italic>GmGT-2B</italic>-transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006898-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). The activation domain of the GmGT-2B was also analyzed in detail and it appears that the N-terminal peptide of 153 residues is the minimal domain for transcriptional activation. Neither the N-terminal trihelix domain (90&#x02013;153) nor its N-terminal sequence (1&#x02013;89) themselves has the ability to activate transcription. The role of the minimal activation domain needs to be further tested in plant system. A rice GT-2 protein has also been found to function as a transcriptional activator. However, the activation domain was not identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006898-Ni1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Arabidopsis GT-1 also has transactivation function in both yeast and plant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006898-LeGourrierec2">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. However, ASIL1 functions as a repressor for embryonic and seed maturation genes in Arabidopis seedlings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006898-Gao1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. The present GmGT-2A does not have transcriptional activation ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006898-g003">Fig. 3C, G</xref>). Whether it has repression activity needs further study.</p><p>The GmGT-2B, unlike the GmGT-2A, has the ability to dimerize, and the dimerization seems to happen through interaction of the middle part of the protein. No heterodimers could be formed between GmGT-2A and GmGT-2B. The biological significance of such interaction is not known. It is possible that the interaction would modify the transcriptional activation ability and then affect the downstream gene expressions. Arabidopsis GT-3a and GT-3b could form homo or heterodimers, and the dimerization domain seemed to be located at the C-terminus. However, no interaction was observed between each of the two proteins with the GT-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006898-Ayadi1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The trihelix domain is generally believed to be the DNA-binding domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006898-Hiratsuka1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006898-Kuhn1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. In the yeast one-hybrid assay, both the N-terminal and C-terminal trihelix-domain-containing region of the GmGT-2A and GmGT-2B can bind to the three elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006898-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). In addition, the GmGT-2A can bind to the GT-1 bx whereas the GmGT-2B can't. These different features imply that the two genes may play some different roles in plant. However, since the two genes also have common features in gene expression and DNA-binding, they should also have similar functions in addition to their specific functions.</p><p>Seed germination and seedling morphogenesis can be inhibited by ABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006898-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The germination rates of the <italic>GmGT-2A</italic>- and <italic>GmGT-2B</italic>-transgenic seeds were similar to that of the wild type seeds with ABA treatment (data not shown), indicating that the two genes did not affect ABA-regulated germination process. It is interesting to find that the morphogenesis of the <italic>GmGT-2B</italic>-transgenic seedlings but not the <italic>GmGT-2A</italic>-transgenic seedlings was less affected by ABA treatment. This fact suggests that the <italic>GmGT-2B</italic>-transgenic plants have reduced sensitivity to ABA, and <italic>GmGT-2B</italic> may function as a negative regulator to suppress the ABA effects on morphogenesis. Downstream gene analysis revealed that a number of genes had much higher expression in the <italic>GmGT-2B</italic>-transgenic plants than that in the <italic>GmGT-2A</italic>-transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006898-g007">Fig. 7</xref>), and these genes may contribute to the reduced ABA sensitivity in the <italic>GmGT-2B</italic>-transgenic plants. Alternatively, these <italic>GmGT-2B</italic>-upregulated genes may reflect a positive feedback of the ABA response due to the reduction of ABA sensitivity. In fact, several ABA-regulated or related genes including <italic>NCED3, LTP3, LTP4</italic> and <italic>PAD3</italic> etc. were enhanced in the <italic>GmGT-2B</italic>-transgenic plants. These studies on ABA effects may also suggest that <italic>GmGT-2B</italic> plays larger roles than <italic>GmGT-2A</italic> in regulation of seedling morphogenesis.</p><p>The <italic>GmGT-2A</italic> and <italic>GmGT-2B</italic> showed differential expression in response to ABA and other stresses. However, expression of their homologue <italic>GmGT-2</italic> was not induced by these treatments, suggesting that the <italic>GmGT-2A</italic> and <italic>GmGT-2B</italic> have specific roles in abiotic stress responses. Overexpression of both the <italic>GmGT-2A</italic> and <italic>GmGT-2B</italic> greatly improved plant tolerance to salt, freezing and drought stresses as can be seen from the survival rates of the transgenic plants, the dry weight and the water loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006898-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006898-g006">6</xref>). The regulation of stress tolerance may be achieved through control at levels of transcriptional activation, DNA binding, and dimerization and/or by other unknown mechanisms. These controls at different levels will finally affect gene expressions, through which the stress tolerance can be achieved in plants. Actually, many genes have been found to be upregulated in the transgenic plants. Among these, three C2/H2 zinc finger-type transcription factors were increased and may play significant roles since two of the genes <italic>STZ</italic> and <italic>RHL41/Zat12</italic> have been found to promote stress tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006898-Davletova1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006898-Sakamoto1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006898-Vogel1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>DREB2A</italic> gene and a peroxidase gene <italic>RCI3</italic> were also highly expressed in the <italic>GmGT-2A</italic>- and <italic>GmGT-2B</italic>-transgenic plants. These two genes have been found to improve stress tolerance in transgenic plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006898-Llorente1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006898-Sakuma1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the GmGT-2A and GmGT-2B may at least activate these gene expressions either through direct binding to promoter of each gene or in a manner of indirect regulation. Expression of a few genes were also suppressed by the two <italic>GmGT</italic> genes. The <italic>VAMP711</italic>, a gene encoding a protein related to vesicle trafficking, was downregulated. Suppression of the <italic>VAMP711</italic> inhibited the fusion of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-containing vesicle to the tonoplast, leading to improved vacuolar functions for plant salt tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006898-Leshem1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore possible that the present two GmGT genes conferred stress tolerance at least through activation of STZ/ZAT and DREB2A transcription factors as well as the antioxidative system. Moreover, the <italic>GmGT-2B</italic>-transgenic plants appeared to be slightly more tolerant to stresses than the <italic>GmGT-2A</italic>-transgenic plants did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006898-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006898-g006">6G</xref>). This difference is most likely due to the higher expressions of the specific genes in <italic>GmGT-2B</italic>-transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006898-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). It should be mentioned that overexpression of the transcription factors in Arabidopsis plants might induce tolerance observations not related to activation of specific pathways but rather indirect or pleiotropic effects. Further transgenic analysis in soybean plants may disclose such a possibility.</p><p>Overexpression of the <italic>GmGT-2B</italic> gene resulted in reduced ABA sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006898-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), but still improved plant tolerance to salt, drought and freezing stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006898-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006898-g006">6</xref>). This phenomenon appears to be inconsistent with the notion that ABA insensitivity would generally lead to reduced stress tolerance. However, our results were in line with several reports showing that genes conferring reduced ABA sensitivity can increase stress tolerance. Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006898-Yang1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref> found that Lily hydrophilin gene <italic>LLA23</italic>-transgenic seeds showed reduced sensitivity to ABA, however, its transgenic plants exhibited tolerance to salt, osmotic and drought stresses. An ABF2-interacting protein gene <italic>ARIA</italic>-overexpressing plants are hypersensitive to ABA but also sensitive to high osmolarity during germination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006898-Kim1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. Transgenic plants overexpressing <italic>GmbZIP44</italic>, <italic>GmbZIP62</italic> and <italic>GmbZIP78</italic> from soybean show reduced sensitivity to ABA but enhanced tolerance to salt and freezing stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006898-Liao1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It should be mentioned that the GmGT-2A does not have transcriptional activation activity and could not form homo or heterodimers. However, it still can bind to <italic>cis</italic>-DNA elements and improve stress tolerance through alteration of gene expressions. The GmGT-2A may need post-translational modification to achieve its transcriptional activation. Other mechanisms may also be involved.</p><p>Overall, we have identified two GT factors GmGT-2A and GmGT-2B from soybean, whose overexpression differentially regulated seedling morphogenesis and improved plant tolerance to abiotic stresses. The stress tolerance conferred by these two factors is achieved by upregulation of a number of downstream genes. Further study should disclose more about the mechanism through which the two GT factors regulate plant stress responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant growth</title><p>Seeds of soybean (Glycin max, Nannong 1138-2) were grown in pots at 25&#x000b0;C under continuous light.
