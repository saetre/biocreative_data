The low frequency of BAV (1&#x00025; of general population) limits our ability to perform genome-wide association studies. We present the application of four <italic>a priori</italic> SNP selection techniques, reducing the multiple-testing penalty by restricting analysis to SNPs relevant to BAV in a genome-wide SNP dataset from a cohort of 68 BAV probands and 830 control subjects. Two knowledge-based approaches, CANDID and STRING, were used to systematically identify BAV genes, and their SNPs, from the published literature, microarray expression studies and a genome scan. We additionally tested Functionally Interpolating SNPs (fitSNPs) present on the array; the fourth consisted of SNPs selected by Random Forests, a machine learning approach. These approaches reduced the multiple testing penalty by lowering the fraction of the genome probed to 0.19&#x00025; of the total, while increasing the likelihood of studying SNPs within relevant BAV genes and pathways. Three loci were identified by CANDID, STRING, and fitSNPS. A haplotype within the AXIN1-PDIA2 locus (<italic>p</italic>-value of 2.926&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;06</sup>) and a haplotype within the Endoglin gene (<italic>p</italic>-value of 5.881&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;04</sup>) were found to be strongly associated with BAV. The Random Forests approach identified a SNP on chromosome 3 in association with BAV (<italic>p</italic>-value 5.061&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;06</sup>). The results presented here support an important role for genetic variants in BAV and provide support for additional studies in well-powered cohorts. Further, these studies demonstrate that leveraging existing expression and genomic data in the context of GWAS studies can identify biologically relevant genes and pathways associated with a congenital heart defect.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The aortic valve, as formed during embryonic heart development, is comprised of three cusps divided by three commissures. Cusp fusion, or the failure of the cusps to separate during heart development, can produce a valve with two cusps (bicuspid) or one cusp (unicuspid) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Fedak1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In a bicuspid valve, the two conjoined cusps form a larger cusp that operates with the remaining, normal cusp to perform the valve function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-American1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. While the prevalence of BAV is approximately one percent of live births (13.7 per 1,000), one third of the aortic valves replaced are found to be bicuspid at the time of valve replacement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Turri1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Thoracic ascending aortic aneurysms (TAA) are also found in patients with BAV, sometimes even in pre-teen children.</p><p>Consistent with a strong genetic predisposition the heritability estimates of BAV range from 0.75 to 0.89 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Cripe1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Studies conducted in 13 families with BAV suggest that BAV and TAA are independent manifestations of a single underlying gene defect with incomplete penetrance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Loscalzo1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Biner1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. NOTCH1 mutations have been found in sporadic cases of BAV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Mohamed1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Garg1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>; however, a consistent role for NOTCH1 gene variants in BAV has not been found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Ellison1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite a high heritability, challenges remain in determining the genetic cause of BAV. First, few multigenerational pedigrees contain BAV as an isolated trait to enable gene identification by traditional approaches. Second, large, well phenotyped BAV cohorts are not readily available due to the relative rarity of BAV in the general population. Third, it can be difficult to determine non-invasively whether a thickened and calcified aortic valve is bicuspid or tricuspid in adults; direct, surgical inspection is often required to determine whether a BAV is present, which limits subject recruitment. Finally, the phenotypic diversity observed within BAV implies an assortment of developmental pathways ultimately converging around a single, uniquely identifiable phenotypic outcome: aortic valve formation and valve disease.</p><p>Due to the complexity of the developmental processes that contribute to heart valve formation and valve disease, candidate gene approaches are unlikely to identify the genetic determinants of BAV. The application of a broader form of analysis is needed to identify the complex genomic contributors to BAV in an unbiased manner. Traditional genome-wide association study (GWAS) approaches have identified genes that contribute to common diseases including coronary artery disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Deangelis1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Liu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. GWAS studies have also proven particularly effective in identifying disease-related genes for highly heritable disorders such as age-dependent macular degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Edwards1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. With the addition of haplotype-based analyses, a wide spectrum of observed variant frequencies can be useful with regard to analysis of both common, complex disorders as well as highly heritable but relatively rare disorders (such as BAV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Pawitan1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Pritchard1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. While an unbiased approach offers significant potential for discovery of single, potent, highly penetrant genetic determinants of BAV, the multiple-testing load inherent to this approach weakens our ability to detect important associations. To control for random associations, generated <italic>p</italic>-values typically must reach &#x0201c;genomic&#x0201d; levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-deBakker1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, and adopting such stringent standards is likely at the expense of weak but biologically plausible associations, especially in settings with obligate limitations to sample sizes.</p><p>These limitations have led to the development of two primary strategies for applying gene network-based analysis to genome-wide SNP datasets. The first, a knowledge-based approach, leverages existing annotations, public expression data, previously published associated genes or chromosomal regions, and any other quantifiable information that has been the output of directed study. These data are computationally combined into interaction pathways that extend from the input genes, genomic regions, and specific protein/protein interactions into the broader pathways that these elements inhabit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-vonMering1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Aerts1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, starting from lists of the most differentially expressed genes within a trait, the multiple gene partners, alternate transcripts, functionally similar genes, conserved structural motifs or sequences, and any other quantifiable aspect of a protein or gene region can be added, allowing for the construction of a gene network relevant to the underlying disorder in question. This final list of network genes forms a prioritized list from which available probes located within these genes (or the regulatory regions surrounding them) are selected for association analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Li1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. A related approach, employed by tools such as Endeavour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Tranchevent1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, assumes a robustly defined set of &#x0201c;known genes&#x0201d; that make up a phenotypic signature, usually based on expression data. Endeavour applies many annotation categories and a text-based search to find genes with signatures similar to the training set, returning a rated list of genes for future study that should inform and extend the &#x0201c;known&#x0201d; training set. While this approach is quite powerful, it presupposes a well-understood and robustly described starting point in the form of a training set. The complex genetic data, much of it poorly understood or contradictory, that currently describes BAV implies the need for more inclusive initial approaches that start from the various known genes but extend from there, including while broadening what is known to also include what is likely.</p><p>The second type of analysis, a machine learning approach, leverages the ability of multiply partitioned datasets to select a subset of SNPs within the overall set of available probes most likely to be informative at defining the phenotype in question <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Bureau1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Lunetta1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here we describe the application of these two strategies to the analysis of a genome-wide SNP dataset for BAV. Furthermore, we characterize the effects of using differing techniques within these strategies on the outputted association results. Specifically, we examine STRING<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-vonMering1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and CANDID <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Hutz1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, competing knowledge-based methods for forming genetic and protein interaction networks. We also apply two other approaches to forming an <italic>ab initio</italic> list of SNPs likely to have high information content: fitSNPs and Random Forests. FitSNPs are a collection of variants gleaned from exhaustive searches of public expression data and are highly likely to be functionally relevant SNPs (but are not associated with a specific disease or phenotype). Random Forests are included as an unbiased probeset, selected by perceived information content of the included SNPs relative to their capability to partition our dataset relative to trait (e.g. BAV). We hypothesize that collections of SNPs selected by multiple probe prioritization strategies within haplotype blocks strongly associated with BAV will help identify genes relevant to this disorder. The product of these studies offers a comprehensive analysis of a limited cohort while still respecting the rules of multiple testing.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>BAV Cohort</title><p>We collected DNA from 68 probands found to have BAV by direct visualization at the time of aortic valve replacement or by echocardiography. The average age of BAV Genetics Study participants at the time of enrollment was 53 years (range 18 to 85), and the majority of subjects were men (54 of 66). Echocardiography demonstrated normal aortic valve function in 18 subjects, moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis was detected in 38 subjects, and three subjects had isolated severe aortic valve regurgitation. We included six subjects that had coarctation of the aorta (all repaired) and 19 who had TAA (17 repaired) in our cohort since the BAV-associated aortic phenotypes are considered to be independent manifestations of a single underlying gene defect with incomplete penetrance (5). Genomic DNA from these individuals was genotyped on the Illumina 370CNV array.

First, we selected MeSH terms (including OMIM headings) that characterize BAV and its associated syndromes. Second, we identified genes differentially expressed in the aorta of subjects with BAV compared with a normal tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset GDS2922.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008830-Majumdar1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> Analysis of these arrays was carried out by both parametric (limma) and non-parametric (RankProd) methods. These two approaches predominantly selected different gene-sets relative to observed expression levels in experimental (BAV, TAA) versus control (TAV, TAA) patients.

The three most associated SNPs are in medium to high linkage disequilibrium with each other, and reconstructing haplotypes across this region functions to segregate affected from unaffected individuals. The presence of two Protein Disulfide Isomerase family A, member 2 (PDIA2) peptide modifying SNPs in the first two positions of this haplotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008830-g003">Figure 3</xref>) provides a compelling potential functional mechanism. It is difficult to speculate the potential role for the PDIA2 coding SNPs in BAV, as the role of PDIA2 in heart valve formation is not known. It is worth noting that each of the haplotypes containing one of these two shifts is at least moderately significant relative to the trait. Further genotyping is required to determine the relative contribution of AXIN1 and PDIA2 variants to BAV.</p><p>Endoglin (ENG), as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008830-g005">Figure 5</xref>, represents an instance in which a minor allele resulting in a conservative peptide shift is observed in the only haplotype associated with trait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008830-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

We consider our identification of a SNP in chromosome 3 associated with BAV to be hypothesis generating pending replication in independent cohorts because the SNP occurs in a relatively low-probe-density region and the marginal significance of the null-model haplotype weakens the likelihood of overall locus significance. While further analysis is needed to establish the durability of this isolated observation, the presence of a strong haplotype across a coding region implies a potential functional outcome, the biological impact of which remains uncertain.</p><p>Probe prioritization in our case offered <italic>at least</italic> an order of magnitude of multiple-testing relief. In the case of the CANDID probe collection (which employs the largest number of probes of any set used in this study) the probe prioritization process reduced the fraction of the genome analyzed to 0.19&#x00025; of the total. This directed specificity is not reflected in current, overly strict correction methodology. Further complications emerge in the apparent genetic heterogeneity underlying the singular phenotype of BAV.

We hypothesize that any cohort of BAV individuals is likely to be a mixed representation of various possible BAV-causing developmental defects, further eroding the capability of small cohorts to describe the condition fully at the genetic level. We describe a method for prioritization of specific SNPs that both directly addressed these potential issues and successfully identified biologically plausible genomic loci associated with BAV. The identification of genes with known biological roles in heart valve formation (AXIN1 and ENG) and additionally within pathways and regulatory networks previously associated with BAV in family-based studies demonstrates the power of association testing that incorporates biological knowledge.

Total genotyping rate across all individuals (66 cases, 830 controls) was 0.98, and after all pruning the initial probe number (from which all described priority and GWAS probes were drawn) was 311,399.

Logistic analysis is indicated for the discrete disease trait (BAV/no-BAV) and the covariate adjustment is included for gender and, ultimately, for returned p-values relative to number of tests performed.
