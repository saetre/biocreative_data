The molecular mechanisms of these reactive M&#x000fc;ller cell alterations, resulting in disturbed retinal homeostasis, remain largely unknown. Here we show that experimental detachment of mouse retina induces mislocation of the inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir4.1) and a downregulation of the water channel protein (AQP4) in M&#x000fc;ller cells. These alterations are associated with a strong decrease of Dp71, a cytoskeleton protein responsible for the localization and the clustering of Kir4.1 and AQP4. Partial (in detached retinas) or total depletion of Dp71 in M&#x000fc;ller cells (in Dp71-null mice) impairs the capability of volume regulation of M&#x000fc;ller cells under osmotic stress. The abnormal swelling of M&#x000fc;ller cells In Dp71-null mice involves the action of inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we investigated whether the alterations in M&#x000fc;ller cells of Dp71-null mice may interfere with their regulatory effect on the blood-retina barrier. In the absence of Dp71, the retinal vascular permeability was increased as compared to the controls. Our results reveal that Dp71 is crucially implicated in the maintenance of potassium homeostasis, in transmembraneous water transport, and in the M&#x000fc;ller cell-mediated regulation of retinal vascular permeability. Furthermore, our data provide novel insights into the mechanisms of retinal homeostasis provided by M&#x000fc;ller cells under normal and pathological conditions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glial cells are crucially implicated in retinal function and integrity.

In the normal retina, the Dp71 protein shows the same expression pattern as Kir4.1 and AQP4; it has been shown to be involved in the targeting of these channels to specific membrane microdomains via a macromolecular protein complex composed by Dp71 and dystrophin-associated proteins (DAPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Dalloz1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Fort1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Genetic inactivation of Dp71 (in Dp71-null mice) alters Kir4.1 and AQP4 distribution in M&#x000fc;ller glial cells and this mislocation increases the vulnerability of retinal nerve cells to transient ischemia which is associated with neuronal cells death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Dalloz1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Fort1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Together, these two types of glial channels play a key role in K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and water balance processes; noteworthy, their expression and/or cytotopographical distribution are altered in many instances of retinal injuries, including transient ischemia/reperfusion, diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal detachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Dalloz1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Rehak1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Wurm1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the early mislocation of Kir4.1 is accompanied by a dramatically decreased K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> conductance and a depolarization of the glial cell membrane which, in turn, impairs the function of the electrogenic uptake carriers for glutamate and GABA, subsequent neurotransmitter recycling, and other glia-neuron interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Newman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Barnett2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the functional implication of Dp71 and the associated protein complex in the M&#x000fc;ller cell-mediated maintenance of retinal integrity. For this purpose, we applied experimental retinal detachment as a well-established model of retinal injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Lewis1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Pannicke3">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> to both control (C57BL/6) and Dp71-null mice, and studied (i) the expression and cellular localization of the relevant proteins in M&#x000fc;ller cells, (ii) the K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> currents across the M&#x000fc;ller cell membrane, (iii) the swelling of M&#x000fc;ller cell somata under osmotic challenge, and (iv) the permeability of retinal blood vessels. We found that experimental retinal detachment causes alterations in water transport and impairments in fluid absorption of M&#x000fc;ller cells, associated with a downregulation of Dp71 expression. Similar functional deficits were observed in M&#x000fc;ller cells from Dp71-null mice even without experimental retinal detachment; moreover, the permeability of the blood-retinal barrier was dramatically increased already in untreated Dp71-null mice as compared to the controls. These results support the view that Dp71 and the DAPs, by controling the expression and subcellular distribution of K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and water channels, are essential for crucial glial cell functions such as retinal water homeostasis and maintenance of the BRB.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experimental Retinal Detachment induces reactive gliosis and alterations in protein expression in M&#x000fc;ller cells</title><p>To prove the induction of reactive M&#x000fc;ller cell gliosis by experimental detachment, the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was assessed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Lewis2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

To further characterize utrophin localization and expression in detached retina, we performed immunohistochemistry and Western blot. In control retinas, utrophin was localized around blood vessels and in the inner limiting membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007329-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>).

This may indicate that generally, the mislocation of Kir4.1 channels in reactive M&#x000fc;ller cells results from an alteration in Dp71 expression. This hypothesis is supported by earlier data showing that Dp71 is required for proper clustering and precise membrane localization of Kir4.1 and AQP4 channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Connors1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Fort1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our present results confirm that functional expression of Dp71 is necessary for the highly asymmetric expression of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1 in M&#x000fc;ller cells, and suggest that Dp71 downregulation is one step upstream of the Kir4.1 and AQP4 channel alterations in the signaling cascade of reactive gliosis.</p><p>This idea is further supported if the consequences of Dp71 deficiency are studied one step downstream of the channel alterations, by assessing the swelling properties of M&#x000fc;ller cells. We observed a similar anomalous osmotic swelling in M&#x000fc;ller cells from untreated Dp71-null mice and in cells from C57BL/6 after detachment-induced gliosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007329-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).

We thus suggest that M&#x000fc;ller cells of Dp71-null mice undergo a chronic inflammation which contributes to the alterations in their physiological parameters. Indeed, the gene expression of cyclooxygenase-2, known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammation, was up to 7-fold elevated in retinas of Dp71-null mice at postnatal day 6 as compared to C57BL/6. However, there was no significant difference between the cyclooxygenase-2 level of retinae from C57BL/6 and those from Dp71-null adult mice (unpublished data).

This latter observation is in accordance with previous reports showing that M&#x000fc;ller cells participate in the maintenance and the proper functioning of the BRB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Tout1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Tretiach1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In the retina, Dp71 is mainly expressed in M&#x000fc;ller cells endfeet and processes surrounding blood vessels. It is thus conceivable that the lack of Dp71 results in morphological and functional alterations of these vitread and perivascular M&#x000fc;ller cell compartments and that these impairments lead to a dysregulation of retinal vascular permeability. Presently the underlying molecular signaling cascade of this putative pathomechanism is completely unclear. It may be noteworthy in this context that M&#x000fc;ller cells are capable of secreting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Eichler1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007329-Kaur1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, a key player in increasing the retinal vascular permeability.

Very probably, the animals develop partial compensatory mechanisms; however, this remains to be proven by the future generation of conditional Dp71 KO mice.</p><p>In conclusion we show here that depletion of Dp71, a cytoskeleton protein associated to the membrane, leads to physiological alterations in M&#x000fc;ller cells similar to those observed in injured or diseased retinas; this involves a mislocation of potassium and water channels (Kir4.1 and AQP4) and a consequent dysregulation of water transport through M&#x000fc;ller cells. Furthermore, we show that the early, acute downregulation of Dp71 in normal animals may be an important, decisive step in the development of reactive gliosis, upstream of the physiological alterations. Finally we show the altered M&#x000fc;ller cell properties in Dp71-null mice may increase the retinal vascular permeability, via a hitherto unknown mechanism. Taken together, Dp71-null mice appear as a versatile, promising model to develop novel drugs for the resolution of retinal edemas such as observed in human diabetic retinopathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal procedures were conducted in accord with UPMC University and INSERM Institutional Animal Care Committee guidelines.
