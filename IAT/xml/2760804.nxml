The FGF1 gene contains four tissue-specific promoters allowing synthesis of four transcripts with distinct leader regions. Two of these transcripts contain internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), which are RNA elements allowing mRNA translation to occur in conditions of blockade of the classical cap-dependent mechanism. Here, we investigated the function and the regulation of FGF1 during muscle differentiation and regeneration. Our data show that FGF1 protein expression is induced in differentiating myoblasts and regenerating mouse muscle, whereas siRNA knock-down demonstrated FGF1 requirement for myoblast differentiation. FGF1 induction occurred at both transcriptional and translational levels, involving specific activation of both promoter A and IRES A, whereas global cap-dependent translation was inhibited. Furthermore, we identified, in the FGF1 promoter A distal region, a <italic>cis</italic>-acting element able to activate the IRES A-driven translation. These data revealed a mechanism of molecular coupling of mRNA transcription and translation, involving a unique process of IRES activation by a promoter element. The crucial role of FGF1 in myoblast differentiation provides physiological relevance to this novel mechanism. This finding also provides a new insight into the molecular mechanisms linking different levels of gene expression regulation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1 or aFGF) is a member of the heparin-binding growth factor family of proteins with mitogenic, angiogenic, mesoderm-inducing and neurectoderm-modulating activities. FGF1 belongs to the FGF family currently composed of 22 members which have important roles in embryogenesis and differentiation in organisms as diverse as <italic>Xenopus laevi</italic> and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). FGFs (especially FGF1 and FGF2) are classically considered as mitogens behaving as inhibitors of myoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, intracellular FGF1 has been described as a myoblast differentiation activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Furthermore, although it has been proposed as a negative regulator of muscle development, elevated levels of FGF1 have been observed in regenerating muscle cells of dystrophin-deficient mice (mdx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and in Facioscapulohumoral muscular dystrophy patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Thus, FGF1 is clearly implicated in myogenesis and muscle regeneration, but its role in muscle development is complex and involves non-elucidated mechanisms.</p><p>The <italic>fgf1</italic> gene, expressing a single protein isoform, has four alternative tissue-specific promoters designed A to D and is subjected to a process of alternative splicing conserved among mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Transcription results in mRNAs differing by their 5&#x02032; untranslated region (5&#x02032;UTR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Thus, each promoter leads to synthesis of an mRNA containing a distinct 5&#x02032; untranslated exon, suggesting specific translational regulation of FGF1 expression by such 5&#x02032;UTRs as a consequence of the promoter usage. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>FGF1 expression and knock-down during myogenesis.

Translation initiation can occur by a cap-dependent or cap-independent mechanism. The former is mediated by the mRNA 5&#x02032;cap structure and represents the standard mode of translation used by most cellular mRNAs. It is predominantly controlled by the availability of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), comprised of the 5&#x02032;cap binding protein eIF4E, the scaffold protein eIF4G and an ATP-dependent helicase eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). eIF4E availability for eIF4F formation is modulated by sequestration by eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The most abundant, 4E-BP1, is inactive when hyperphosphorylated by the kinase mTOR and activated when mTOR activity is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). </p><p>Cap-independent translation is mostly mediated by mRNA structural elements called IRESs (Internal Ribosomal Entry Sites) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). IRESs are able to recruit ribosomes either by themselves or with the help of cellular proteins called ITAFs (IRES trans-acting factors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). IRESs have been identified in several mammalian mRNAs, mainly in control genes such as growth factors or transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). IRESs allow translation of such mRNAs when cap-dependent translation is blocked in conditions of stress or during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However they also allow a subtle regulation of mRNA translation in pathological and physiological situations such as hyperglycemia, hormone stimulation, ischemia or brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21">18&#x02013;21</xref>). We have identified IRESs in the FGF1 5&#x02032;UTRs A and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p><italic>Fgf1</italic> gene expression is strictly regulated during development and in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Surprisingly, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating its expression. While poorly expressed in adult tissues, it can become overexpressed in some pathophysiological situations such as during muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that the FGF1, required for myoblast differentiation, is induced during this process as well as in regenerating muscle by a novel mechanism of coupled transcription and translation involving FGF1 promoter A and IRES A.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>Plasmids (P1A-luc, P1B-luc, P1C-luc and P1D-luc) used to measure promoter activities were kindly provided by Dr I.M.

We used this approach to study FGF1 expression in regenerating muscles. We observed that the FGF1 protein level started to increase 3 days after cardiotoxin injection and continued to rise after 7 days. The early induction of FGF1 at Day 3 was concomitant with the expression of myogenin, a specific marker of myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>In order to determine whether FGF1 induction is connected to myoblast differentiation, we used the murine myoblast C2C12 cell line which can be induced to differentiate into myotubes by serum-deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). We observed that FGF1 starts to accumulate in C2C12 cells after 2 days of serum-deprivation, when myoblasts begin to differentiate into myotubes, as visualized by myogenin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>To evaluate the importance of intracellular FGF1 during myoblast differentiation, we knocked down its expression in C2C12 cells by siRNA transfection experiments. FGF1 knock-down in the early-differentiation stages prevented the strong myogenin induction observed at Days 2 and 3 with the control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). A smaller induction of myogenin was observed later, at Day 4, concomitantly with an increase of FGF1 expression indicating that FGF1 knock-down was temporary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, right panel).</p><p>Myotube formation was observed from Day 2 to Day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). Strikingly, the C2C12 cell aspect was already different at Day 3, since the FGF1 knock-down resulted in anarchical cell layout. Furthermore, this phenotype was aggravated at Days 4 and 5 when formation of myotubes occurred. Indeed, these myotubes appeared irregular and abnormal.</p><p>These results showed that FGF1 is induced during muscle differentiation/regeneration and required for correct myoblast differentiation into myotubes. FGF1 knock-down did not prevent myotube formation, but resulted in an anarchical cell layout starting from Day 3 of myoblast differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>The FGF1 promoter A is strongly activated during myogenesis</title><p>To investigate the mechanism of FGF1 induction during myoblast differentiation, quantitative real-time RT&#x02013;PCR (RT&#x02013;qPCR) analysis was performed to detect the endogenous FGF1 mRNA. Data showed that the total level of FGF1 mRNAs increased 9-fold at Day 2 of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The level of transcript A followed the same pattern of induction with a 35-fold increase, suggesting a main contribution of promoter A to FGF1 mRNA induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and C).</p><p>To confirm this hypothesis, activities of the four FGF1 promoters were evaluated using gene reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

Other post-translational modifications that can render 4E-BP1 data analysis even more complex are that the phosphorylated protein can be ubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Furthermore, phosphorylation at sites initially considered as important for 4E-BP1 dissociation from eIF4E may not affect directly 4E-BP1 affinity for eIF4E, but may serve instead as priming events for another type of a yet unknown post-translational modification that is actually required for 4E-BP1 dissociation from eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Therefore, we directly tested whether modifications in 4E-BP1 electrophoretic properties were correlated to changes in 4E-BP1 affinity for eIF4E by co-immunoprecipitation experiments.

We demonstrate that FGF1 up-regulation is required for myoblast differentiation and results from a concomitant and specific activation of both FGF1 promoter A and IRES A, when the cap-dependent translation is blocked, in differentiating myoblasts as well as in regenerating mouse muscle. Furthermore, our data show that the IRES A-dependent translation is strongly activated in the presence of the FGF1 promoter A, revealing a novel mechanism of coupled translation and transcription.</p><sec><title>FGF1 has a double role in myogenesis</title><p>FGF1 induction during muscle regeneration is concomitant with the apparition of myotubes. Furthermore, our data clearly show that FGF1 knock-down attenuates the myogenin induction peaking at Day 2 and generates formation of abnormal myotubes. This observation could seem discordant with the known function of FGFs as myoblast differentiation inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). However FGF1, in contrast to other members of the FGF family, is expressed in dystrophic muscle, suggesting a positive role in the regeneration of skeletal muscle fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The double role of FGF1 as a proliferation activator as well as a differentiation inducer may result from its different functions as an extracellular or intracellular factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Extracellular FGF1 would activate myoblast proliferation by activating the FGF-signaling pathway mediated by FGFR1 receptor upregulated in proliferating myoblasts, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In contrast, intracellular FGF1 would act on differentiation by an intracrine pathway. Alternatively, the different roles of FGF1 could be due to differential expression of FGF receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). FGFR1 and FGFR4 are the most prominent FGF receptors in muscle cells. FGFR4 has been recently shown to be strongly up-regulated during myoblast&#x02013;myotube transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Fgfr4<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> mice show impaired muscle regeneration with slowed maturation of regenerating fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Translational regulation during myoblast differentiation</title><p>It has been well established that cap-dependent translation is tightly regulated during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). However, little is known about translational control of gene expression during cell differentiation. Our work shows that cap-dependent translation is repressed during myoblast differentiation. This suggests that, at this stage, the global translation is blocked in cells, whereas a small number of mRNAs may be translated through cap-independent mechanisms. This is the case for FGF1 whose induction is not affected by eIF4E sequestration, concomitant with the activation of its IRES A. Thus, our results together with previous studies show that IRESs play a key role in gene expression during differentiation of different cell types and during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37 B38 B39 B40">37&#x02013;40</xref>).</p><p>The role of IRES in FGF1 expression was further confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> during muscle regeneration. The importance of IRES-dependent translation during muscle regeneration has also been shown for utrophin A, a structural protein of the skeletal muscle fiber, mainly expressed at the neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). In contrast to utrophin A, FGF1 has no structural role, but a regulating function during the myogenesis process. The importance of the IRES-mediated translational control for two proteins with such different roles but both involved in the muscle fiber regenerative response suggest that the IRES-dependent process could drive expression of a subclass of mRNAs whose coordinated induction would ensure the success of the muscle regeneration process.</p></sec><sec><title>Coupling between transcription and IRES-dependent translation</title><p>Among the four FGF1 alternative promoters, A and B have been reported to be tissue-specific whereas C and D are inducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Our results reveal that promoter A is active in skeletal muscle, and demonstrate its inducibility during myoblast differentiation. Interestingly, the activity of IRES A, contained in the transcript generated by promoter A, specifically increases during myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration.</p><p>Coordinated activation of IRES with the corresponding promoter in conditions of cap-dependent translation blockade has been reported for the Drosophila insulin-like receptor, underlining the key role of IRESs in the activation of gene expression when global translation is silenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). The coupling of translation with transcription shown in our study goes further by suggesting the existence of a molecular mechanism of IRES A activation depending on a <italic>cis</italic>-acting element in the promoter. One could argue that the higher IRES A activity in the presence of promoter A could result from the weakness of this promoter, whereas the strong CMV promoter would result in mRNA overexpression and decreased IRES A activity due to titration of a limiting ITAF. This was proposed in a previous study showing that the c-myc IRES is higher with the SV40 promoter than with the CMV promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). However, in our study, the strength of the FGF1 promoter A is similar to that of the CMV promoter (data not shown), and the deleted versions of promoter A, which render the promoter very weak, are not related to any IRES activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). This clearly shows that the FGF1 promoter A has a positive effect on FGF1 IRES-driven translation. Our data suggest the existence of a translation&#x02013;transcription coupling mechanism requiring an element in the distal part of promoter A, upstream from nt 392.</p><p>Such coupling of transcription with translation would appear as a novel mechanism completing the complex network of coupled interactions in gene expression proposed by Maniatis and Reed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). That model proposes coupling of transcription with subsequent steps of mRNA processing and export, in gene expression factories anchored to the nuclear substructure, where DNA is reeled through the RNA polymerase as the nascent mRNA is extruded through its exit channel. Such gene expression factories contain all machineries involved in transcription, capping, splicing and polyadenylation. Our data suggest that IRES-dependent translation could also be controlled in these gene expression factories, due to a co-transcriptional &#x02018;loading&#x02019; of ITAFs on nascent mRNA. Consistent with this hypothesis, most ITAFs identified so far are nuclear or nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins implicated in a staggering array of cellular activities, ranging from transcription and pre-mRNA processing in the nucleus, to cytoplasmic mRNA translation and turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>).
