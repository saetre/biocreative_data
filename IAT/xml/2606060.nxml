Mutations in CBS are the most common cause of severe hereditary hyperhomocysteinemia. A yeast two-hybrid approach to screen for proteins that interact with CBS had previously identified several components of the sumoylation pathway and resulted in the demonstration that CBS is a substrate for sumoylation. In this study, we demonstrate that sumoylation of CBS is enhanced in the presence of human polycomb group protein 2 (hPc2), an interacting partner that was identified in the initial yeast two-hybrid screen. When the substrates for CBS, homocysteine and serine for cystathionine generation and homocysteine and cysteine for H<sub>2</sub>S generation, are added to the sumoylation mixture, they inhibit the sumoylation reaction, but only in the absence of hPc2. Similarly, the product of the CBS reaction, cystathionine, inhibits sumoylation in the absence of hPc2. Sumoylation in turn decreases CBS activity by &#x0223c;28&#x00025; in the absence of hPc2 and by 70&#x00025; in its presence. Based on these results, we conclude that hPc2 serves as a SUMO E3 ligase for CBS, increasing the efficiency of sumoylation. We also demonstrate that &#x003b3;-cystathionase, the second enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway is a substrate for sumoylation under in vitro conditions. We speculate that the role of this modification may be for nuclear localization of the cysteine-generating pathway under conditions where nuclear glutathione demand is high.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cystathionine &#x003b2;-synthase (CBS)<sup>1</sup> catalyzes the pyridoxal 5&#x02032;-phosphate-dependent condensation of serine and homocysteine to form cystathionine, which represents the first committed step in the transsulfuration pathway for cysteine synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Banerjee1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Miles1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Curiously, a subset of pathogenic CBS mutations when mimicked in vitro exhibit no apparent biochemical penalty, and in fact, sometimes display higher activity than wild-type enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Janosik1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Evande1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. This has led us to suggest the hypothesis that these mutations may disrupt interactions between CBS and other proteins, which are important for its cellular functions. In an effort to identify such interacting partner proteins, a yeast two-hybrid screen was undertaken and furnished a disproportionate number of proteins related to the sumoylation pathway including the SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) conjugation enzyme Ubc9 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), the SUMO ligases, PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT1) and PIAS3, the RanGTPase binding protein, RanBP, and human polycomb group protein 2, hPc2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Kabil1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

The human genome encodes three functional isozymes of SUMO: SUMO-1, -2 and -3 that are expressed ubiquitously, whereas the paralog, SUMO-4, may not be fully processed and exhibits a more restricted tissue distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-GeissFriedlander1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Owerbach1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Posttranslational modification by SUMO is one mechanism for dynamic regulation of target proteins and elicits diverse effects including subcellular relocalization typically to the nucleus, changes in protein partner interactions and modulation of the DNA-binding and/or transactivation activities of transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Hilgarth1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The coordinated activities of SUMO activating, conjugating and ligating enzymes are required for sumoylation, a process that has parallels with ubiquitination. The first step in this mechanism is catalyzed by the E1 ubiquitin-activating heterodimeric enzyme, Aos1-Uba2, and results in the formation of a thioester bond between the C-terminal glycine residue in SUMO and a cysteine residue in Uba2. The next step involves transfer of SUMO to the active site cysteine residue in the E2 ubiquitin carrier protein, Ubc9. In the final step, the activated carboxyl group of the terminal glycine residue in SUMO is transferred to the &#x003b5;-amino group of a lysine residue in the target protein to form an isopeptide bond. This step is often facilitated by an E3 ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase but some targets are efficiently sumoylated by E2 alone under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Hilgarth1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The mechanism by which E3 ligases enhance the kinetics, specificity and/or efficiency of Ubc9-mediated sumoylation remains unclear, and they might be particularly important for SUMO conjugation to substrate proteins that contain variant consensus motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Martin1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

CBS is a heavily regulated enzyme at the homocysteine metabolic junction and defects in CBS result in severely elevated homocysteine levels and multiorgan deficits, whose molecular basis is poorly understood. A yeast two-hybrid analysis conducted in our laboratory identified a number of proteins involved in the sumoylation pathway as potential interacting partners of CBS including a number of E3 ligases e.g. PIAS1, PIAS3 and hPc2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Kabil1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. It was speculated that the multiplicity of E3 ligases identified by the yeast two-hybrid approach could have been a consequence of complex formation between the E3 prey and the endogenous yeast E2, which in turn interacted with the CBS bait. The PIAS proteins are members of the largest family of E3 ligases whereas hPc2 has a much more limited range of substrates possibly because of its nuclear localization in polycomb bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Wotton2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast, an internal sumoylation site is absent in SUMO-1 and ligation of only monomeric units is observed with this modifier. Since SUMO-1 was used in the assay mixtures, the observation of multiple bands corresponding to sumoylated CBS in the vitro assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004032-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), which has also been reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Kabil1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and to CSE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004032-g004">Figure 4</xref>) suggests that sumoylation occurred at more than one site. Although SUMO is an &#x0223c;11 kDa protein, modification of the target proteins typically results in an &#x0223c;20&#x02013;30 kDa band shift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Matunis1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

Hence, the presence of either serine or homocysteine, cysteine and homocysteine or the product, cystathionine, results in a markedly reduced efficiency of SUMO modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004032-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004032-g003">3</xref>). This suggests that substrate binding induces a conformational change that reduces the efficiency of interaction between Ubc9 and CBS. While the K<sub>M</sub> for homocysteine (5 mM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Taoka1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>) and cysteine (6 mM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Chen1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>) are high compared to the intracellular concentrations of homocysteine and cysteine in mammalian cells, which is in the 10&#x02013;100 &#x000b5;M range, the intracellular concentration of serine is significantly higher (&#x0223c;560 &#x000b5;M) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Chen1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> while the K<sub>D</sub> for serine for human CBS is low (7.5 &#x000b5;M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Taoka2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>). This suggests that in the cytoplasm, sumoylation of CBS may be largely inhibited under most circumstances.</p><p>Although the majority of SUMO targets are nuclear proteins, a growing number of non-nuclear targets in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane and mitochondria have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-GeissFriedlander1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Sumoylation of CBS could trigger its nuclear localization. Enhanced sumoylation of CBS in the presence of hPc2 might be expected to occur in the nucleus since hPc2 has a restricted subnuclear localization within polycomb bodies. We note however that initial nuclear localization studies on CBS have revealed its presence in the nuclear scaffold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Kabil1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. We also note that most SUMO targets do not exhibit quantitative modification. Rather, a small proportion of the target protein tends to be modified and low-level sumoylation can have significant cellular effects as described for transcription factors and for thymine DNA glycosylase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-GeissFriedlander1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The significance of SUMO modification of CBS is not known nor is the role of this protein in the nuclear compartment. Similarly, it is not known whether CSE is sumoylated in the cell and whether some proportion of this enzyme is found in the nucleus. One possibility is that the nuclear CBS moonlights in an altogether different role, which remains to be identified. An alternative is that sumoylation leads both enzymes of the transsulfuration pathway into the nucleus where they function locally in the removal of homocysteine, in the provision of cysteine and/or H<sub>2</sub>S, a gaseous signaling molecule. Of these, cysteine production may be the most significant since this amino acid is the limiting reagent in the synthesis of glutathione. The nuclear&#x02236;cytoplasmic ratio of glutathione varies from &#x0223c;1 to 4 depending on the cell cycle stage and the nuclear pool peaks just prior to exponential cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Markovic1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. It is estimated that between 4 to 8 percent of glutathione synthesis occurs in the nucleus and activities for the biosynthetic enzymes, &#x003b3;-glutamyl cysteine ligase and glutathione synthetase, have been reported in this compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Ho1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Peak telomerase activity is correlated with high nuclear glutathione levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Borras1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, and it is believed that a reducing environment might be important for the optimal functioning of other nuclear proteins. CBS activity also varies with the stage of cell-growth with maximal expression occurring during cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Maclean1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, nuclear localization of the transsulfuration pathway enzymes, CBS and CSE, might be a strategy for ensuring local delivery of cysteine under conditions of high glutathione demand in the nucleus.</p><p>A potential problem with this model for SUMO-dependent translocation of the transsulfuration pathway enzymes is that sumoylation of CBS is associated with inhibition of its activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004032-t001">Table 1</xref>). Hence, if sumoylation is required to bring CBS (and potentially, CSE) into the nucleus, desumoylation of nuclear CBS would be needed for the enzyme to be active. We note that SUMO modification is dynamic and the modified targets can be rapidly desumoylated by isopeptidases that are efficient at removing SUMO. CBS is a long-lived protein with a half life that is estimated to be &#x0223c;49 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Prudova1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, once it is translocated into the nucleus and desumoylated, it could potentially function as a catalyst in this compartment for some time.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0004032-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004032.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Sumoylation inhibits CBS activity.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0004032-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0004032.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0004032-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Additions<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">a</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-incubation time</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Activity &#x000b5;mol h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Percent activity remaining<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">b</xref></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CBS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">none</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">286&#x000b1;36</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CBS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 h</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">157&#x000b1;21</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CBS&#x0002b;hPc2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 h</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">180&#x000b1;11</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CBS&#x0002b;SUMO-1<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">a</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 h</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">121&#x000b1;25</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CBS&#x0002b;SUMO-1&#x0002b;hPc2<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">a</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 h</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50&#x000b1;13</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label>a</label><p>In vitro sumoylation of CBS was performed as described under <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>.</p></fn><fn id="nt102"><label>b</label><p>The activity remaining after 6 h of incubation needed for the sumoylation reaction is reported relative to the average of the CBS and CBS&#x0002b;hPc2 assay mixtures (169 &#x000b5;mol h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>It is interesting to note that a component of the well-studied cytoplasmic folate cycle has been demonstrated to have a nuclear localization that is dependent on SUMO modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004032-Woeller1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.
