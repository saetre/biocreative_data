The deregulation of these proteins can contribute to the development of a variety of diseases such as cancer. As a nonhistone chromosomal protein, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) has recently been identified as the product of a novel tumor suppressor gene (TSG), promoting the transcription of p19<sup><italic>ink4a </italic></sup>and p16<sup><italic>arf</italic></sup>.

Such packaging is not only important for the storage of genetic information with high fidelity and integrity, but also the transfer of genetic information from DNA to RNA in a tightly controlled manner. Proteins that bind to DNA to form chromatin are traditionally divided into two general classes: histones and nonhistone chromosomal proteins. Histones are a group of highly conserved DNA binding proteins and their various post-translational modifications constitute the 'histone code' that guides the packaging of DNA or chromatin remodeling. The histone code is initiated, maintained and interpreted largely by nonhistone chromosomal proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. For example, the acetylation of lysine residues on histone tails by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) neutralizes their charge and decreases the affinity of histones with DNA, making DNA accessible for transcriptional factors to initiate gene transcription. Conversely, the deacetylation of these residues by histone deacetylases (HDACs) restores this affinity and can withdraw DNA from transcriptional machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition to acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation of histone tails are important for the dynamic association of DNA with transcriptional machinery and other chromosomal proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Nonhistone chromosomal proteins play important roles in the interpretation of histone code by forming chromatin remodeling complexes. Both histones and nonhistone chromosomal proteins are important for the regulation of gene expression, DNA replication and DNA repair. The deregulations in the expression and activity of these proteins could result in the development of a variety of diseases such as cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In a recent study, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) was identified as a novel tumor suppressor gene (TSG) in neuroblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. CHD5 belongs to a superfamily of SWI2/SNF2-related ATPases, one major group of nonhistone chromosomal proteins. CHD5 encodes a unique combination of functional domains consisting of two N-terminal chromodomains, followed by a SWI2/SNF2-like ATPase/helicase domain and a DNA-binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. By regulating chromatin structure, CHD5 can promote the expression of p19<sup>arf </sup>that functions to stabilize p53, the tumor suppressor inactivated in more than half of human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. CHD5 is present at a gene locus (1p36.31) deleted in about 35% of neuroblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. CHD5 was previously thought to be specifically expressed in the nervous system, but its role in cancer in other tissues is starting to emerge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. CHD5 gene was found significantly deleted in glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Apart from gene deletion, CHD5 can be suppressed by other mechanisms. In some cases of neuroblastoma, there are evidence that CHD5 expression is epigenetically suppressed by promoter hypermethylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], although this observation was not confirmed by another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Recently, the CHD5 promoter has been found to be methylated in small subsets of breast (4.4%), colon (10%), ovarian (15%) and glioma (17%) tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], suggesting epigenetic silencing of CHD5 by methylation may play a partial role in tumorigenesis in these tissues. Here we found that, in contrast to other types of cancer reported so far, CHD5 was frequently hypermethylated in gastric cancer (73% of tumors and 100% cell lines). The ectopic expression of CHD5 in gastric cancer cells led to a significant growth inhibition. This striking correlation of the epigenetic suppression of CHD5 and gastric cancer suggests a previously unknown relationship between this TSG and gastric tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue culture and RNA/DNA extraction</title><p>All gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, Kato III, MKN28, MKN45, SNU1, SNU16 and NCI-N87) were obtained from Riken Gene Bank (Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan) and American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). All cancer cell lines were established from carcinomas of gastric epithelial cells. Unless specifically indicated, cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 95% humidity. For pharmacological demethylation, cells were treated with 5 &#x003bc;M 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza) (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for three consecutive days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Aza was replenished every 24 hours. An equivalent concentration of the vehicle (DMSO) was used as the control. For the primary tissues, the normal gastric tissues were defined as non-inflammation and non-tumor tissues. All gastric carcinoma tissues are adenocarcinoma tissues.

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosohate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control of RNA integrity.

In this study, CHD5 was identified as another potential TSG whose epigenetic inactivation may contribute to gastric carcinogenesis. It was frequently down-regulated through promoter hypermethylation in gastric cancer cell lines. The ectopic expression of CHD5 led to the growth inhibition of gastric cancer cells, indicating that CHD5 functions as a TSG epigenetically silenced in gastric cancer.</p><p>Promoter hypermethylation of CHD5 in cancer has been observed in other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, the incidence of CHD5 promoter methylation in gastric cancer cell lines and tumors was found in this study to be relatively high, compared to the frequency of CHD5 methylation in other cancers (generally below 20%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Of course, more samples should be used to confirm this result with the same MSP primers in the following studies. Nevertheless, our finding suggests that CHD5 inactivation might be mediated by different mechanisms in different tissues. Whereas CHD5 is inactivated through copy number abnormality in various cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) indicated that 1p36, the CHD5-containing gene locus, is not significantly imbalanced in gastric cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Instead, as shown in this study, CHD5 appears to be silenced predominately by promoter hypermethylation in gastric cancer.</p><p>There is growing evidence that hypermethylation of TSG promoter represents one of major molecular alterations in cancer development. The high incidence of CHD5 promoter hypermethylation in gastric cancer can be explored not only as a gastric cancer diagnosis but also prognosis prediction. To this end, it is important to characterize the CHD5 promoter methylation in association with clinical characteristics, such as age, gender, H. pylori infection, tumor grade, Lauren classification and differentiation. Given that the high heterogeneity of primary gastric carcinoma tissues, methylation analyses with higher resolution such as quantitative methylation specific analysis using sequenom or Taqman real-time PCR will be helpful to assess whether CHD5 promoter methylation is useful for early gastric cancer detection and prognosis prediction.</p><p>Although promoter methylation frequently inactivates CHD5 in gastric cancer cell lines, we cannot exclude the presence of other mechanisms for the loss function of CHD5 in gastric cancer. CHD5 expression is extremely low in MKN28 and SNU16 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), however, the promoter of CHD5 was only partially methylated in these two cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), indicating that other mechanisms may be responsible for the silencing of CHD5 in some of gastric cancer cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CHD5 was frequently down-regulated through promoter hypermethylation in gastric cancer cells.
