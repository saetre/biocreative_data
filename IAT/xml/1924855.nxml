At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), agrin/MuSK signaling, by triggering downstream pathways, causes clustering and phosphorylation of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs).

The neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a model synapse in the peripheral nervous system, forms by the contact of motor neurons and muscle fibers. These interactions lead to a polyinnervated synapse at birth, in which acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) are clustered in a flat, plaque-like postsynaptic membrane. In a postnatal phase of elimination, NMJs mature and AChRs become stabilized at the crests of postjunctional folds to form pretzel-shaped areas, while all but one axon withdraw in a process in which adjacent AChRs are destabilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Mechanisms of stabilization of AChR clusters are thus important for proper postnatal maturation of the NMJ, which ultimately will allow for correct nerve-evoked muscle contractibility.</p><p>The molecular processes that first form NMJs are well known. Neural agrin, by activating the kinase MuSK, plays a crucial role by triggering downstream signaling pathways that cause clustering and tyrosine phosphorylation of AChRs, as reviewed recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Neural activity dissolves receptor clusters that are not protected by local agrin deposition in the basal lamina, thereby shaping the postsynaptic architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In cultured myotubes, a short pulse of agrin leads to long-lasting MuSK phosphorylation and normal AChR clustering much later, implying that, once activated, a balance of downstream protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) keeps postsynaptic clustering mechanisms activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Much less is known about the molecular pathways that mature NMJs postnatally and stabilize adult pretzel-shaped AChR clusters. Although MuSK is involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], these pathways differ from those in NMJ induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Stability of AChR clusters can be modeled in cultured myotubes, by adding and then removing agrin, and studying cluster dispersal in the withdrawal phase. Despite the difference in time scale, this method reveals many parallels to postnatal stabilization of the NMJ <italic>in vivo</italic>, which can be assessed by electroporating interfering constructs into mouse soleus muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, the protein complex associated with utrophin including the components dystroglycan and dystrobrevin, and Src-family kinases (SFKs), stabilize the postsynapse and AChR clusters both <italic>in vivo </italic>and in cultured myotubes <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. SFKs are activated by agrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], interact with AChRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and maintain AChR &#x003b2; subunit phosphorylation and interaction of the receptor with its anchoring protein rapsyn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In cultured <italic>src</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>fyn</italic><sup>-/- </sup>myotubes, agrin or laminin induce normal AChR clustering, but the clusters dissemble rapidly within a few hours after withdrawal of these factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. SFKs act in a dual mechanism with cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains related to lipid rafts, as SFKs promote normal microdomain assembly, while the microdomains allow SFKs to act upon postsynaptic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, interfering with SFK function causes postsynaptic disintegration of adult NMJs. Interestingly, decreasing or increasing SFK activity through expression of dominant-negative (kinase-dead) or constitutively active Src both cause disassembly of AChRs aggregates <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This raises the possibility that balanced SFK activity is important for postsynaptic stability and suggests that PTPs may be involved in stabilization of AChR clusters as well. One PTP known to be enriched at the NMJ is the non-receptor phosphatase SHP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. SHP-2 can modulate agrin/MuSK signaling and neuregulin-regulated AChR transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], making it a good candidate for postsynaptic signaling processes.</p><p>We have therefore analyzed the role of PTPs, especially SHP-2, in the stabilization of AChR clusters, and their interplay with SFKs. We find that phosphatases such as SHP-2 stabilize AChR clusters after withdrawal of agrin from cultured myotubes. SHP-2 is also necessary to stabilize adult AChR pretzels at NMJs in mouse soleus muscle <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, in <italic>src</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>fyn</italic><sup>-/- </sup>myotubes SHP-2 is overexpressed, and blocking PTP activity restores AChR cluster stability completely, showing that a fine balance of PTPs with SFKs is crucial for maintaining AChR clusters.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PTP inhibition by pervanadate reduces the stability of agrin-induced AChR clusters</title><p>To address the role of the activity of PTPs in the stabilization of agrin-induced AChR clusters, we made use of the potent PTP inhibitor sodium pervanadate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and cultured C2C12 myotubes, in which AChRs were visualized by treatment with fluorescent &#x003b1;-bungarotoxin (&#x003b1;-BTX). PTP inhibition did not lead to any change in the number of spontaneous AChR clusters observed per field when compared to the untreated control (data not shown). The stability of AChR clusters can be modeled in cell culture by incubating C2C12 myotubes with agrin to induce maximal clustering, followed by agrin withdrawal, washing the cells, incubating them in agrin-free medium for a number of hours, and counting clusters at the end of this withdrawal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. When pervanadate was added at the time of agrin withdrawal, significantly less AChR clusters were observed after a 16 h withdrawal period than in controls lacking pervanadate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These data show that block of PTP activity enhances the disintegration of pre-existing agrin-induced AChR clusters and that therefore, PTPs are required to stabilize clusters of AChRs. This is a specific process operating in cells that were previously exposed to agrin, since block of PTP activity as such does not alter the level of spontaneous AChR clustering.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>PTP inhibition by pervanadate reduces the stability of agrin-induced AChR clusters in C2C12 myotubes</bold>. (A) Myotubes were treated with agrin (1 nM) for 6&#x02013;8 h, after which PTPs were blocked with 20 &#x003bc;M pervanadate at the point of agrin withdrawal (Agrin + Withdr. + PV) for a withdrawal period of 16 h. In controls, cultures were left untreated (No Agrin), treated with agrin alone for 6&#x02013;8 h (Agrin), or treated with agrin followed by withdrawal for 16 h (Agrin + Withdr.). Cells were also treated with agrin for 6&#x02013;8 h + 16 h, and this produced the same amount of clusters as a 6&#x02013;8 h agrin incubation (data not shown). AChRs were stained with rhodamine-&#x003b1;-BTX and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Scale bar, 40 &#x003bc;m. (B) The number of AChR clusters per field was calculated using ImageJ software, using fixed intensity thresholds (150&#x02013;255) and minimum area of 100 pixels occupied by a cluster. The number of AChR clusters per field (400&#x000d7; magnification) is shown as the percentage of clusters in agrin-treated cells (Agrin) (means &#x000b1; SEM, <italic>N </italic>= 50 from four similar experiments).

In <italic>src</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>fyn</italic><sup>-/- </sup>myotubes, agrin induces normal AChR clustering, but the clusters disassemble rapidly within few hours upon agrin withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We analyzed whether under these circumstances PTPs may also influence the stability of AChR clusters. For this purpose we treated <italic>src</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>fyn</italic><sup>-/- </sup>myotubes with agrin to induce maximal clustering, then withdrew agrin and added pervanadate at the same time, for a withdrawal period of 5 h. This pervanadate treatment prevented AChR clusters from disappearing, such that clusters remained completely stable during the withdrawal period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, B</xref>). In sharp contrast, omitting pervanadate led to disassembly of the agrin-induced clusters down to spontaneous levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, B</xref>). Thus, block of PTP activity causes stabilization of AChR clusters in the absence of Src and Fyn. This is a specific process that only affects pre-existing agrin-induced clusters, because pervanadate treatment alone did not alter the levels of spontaneous clusters (data not shown). Moreover, when added together with agrin, pervanadate did not affect the extent of agrin-induced AChR clustering (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>AChR cluster stability is rescued by PTP inhibition in <italic>src</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>fyn</italic><sup>-/- </sup>myotubes and PP2-treated C2C12 myotubes</bold>.

Myotubes were treated with agrin for 6&#x02013;8 h in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;M PP2 for the last 2 h (these 2 h were chosen to ensure that PP2 was effective at the point of agrin withdrawal). Agrin was removed and myotubes incubated with agrin-free medium in the presence of pervanadate and PP2 for 16 h (Agrin + Withdr. + PP2 + PV). In controls, cultures were treated with agrin followed by withdrawal for 16 h in the presence or absence of PP2 (PP2 was added 2 h before agrin removal) (Agrin + Withdr.; Agrin + Withdr. + PP2). AChRs were stained with rhodamine-&#x003b1;-BTX, analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Scale bar, 40 &#x003bc;m. (D) The number of AChR clusters per field (400&#x000d7; magnification) was calculated, as described in Figure 1, as the percentage of agrin-treated C2C12 cells (Agrin) (not shown) (means &#x000b1; SEM, <italic>N </italic>= 30 from three experiments). *** indicates significant difference to the other two bars (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001; two-tailed paired <italic>t </italic>test). Blocking SFKs with PP2 reduces the stability of pre-existing clusters in C2C12 myotubes, and pervanadate restores the stability to normal levels.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2202-8-46-2"/></fig><p>Src and Fyn are not the only members of this family of kinases present in myotubes. A third member of the SFKs, Yes, is present in muscle and upregulated in <italic>src</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>fyn</italic><sup>-/- </sup>myotubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This led us to investigate whether the observed destabilizing effect of PTPs was solely due to the absence of Src and Fyn, or whether this effect would also occur when all members of the SFKs in muscle were blocked. We therefore made use of the specific inhibitor PP2 to block SFKs in C2C12 myotubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We again induced AChR clustering by agrin and then removed agrin to analyze the effect on the stability of these AChR clusters. We found that when added together with agrin, PP2 had no effect on the level of clustering induced by agrin (data not shown), as has been previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, upon removal of agrin, blocking SFKs with PP2 led to a two-fold decrease in the number of remaining AChR clusters, almost down to spontaneous levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, D</xref>). This instability was completely prevented when PTPs were inhibited with pervanadate in the withdrawal phase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, D</xref>). These data confirm those from <italic>src</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>fyn</italic><sup>-/- </sup>myotubes and show, firstly, that SFK activity maintains the stability of AChR clusters in cultured wild-type myotubes, similar to recent findings in muscle <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Secondly, PTPs destabilize AChR clusters in the absence of SFK activity and could indeed be the key destabilizing factor for agrin-induced AChR clusters in the absence of SFKs. Taken together, these data show that the stability of agrin-induced AChR clusters following the withdrawal of agrin requires a fine balance between the kinase activities of SFKs and the phosphatase activities of PTPs.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 increasingly associates with MuSK upon agrin stimulation</title><p>We wanted to identify possible PTPs that play a role in stabilization of AChR clusters. An example of how the activity of a PTP is required in positively controlling the actions of a kinase is the regulation of Src activity by the SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. SHP-2 is enriched at neuromuscular synapses and colocalizes with AChRs <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In cultured myotubes, SHP-2 is a major PTP and can control the phosphorylation level of MuSK and the extent of agrin-induced AChR clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. SHP-2 is therefore a likely candidate PTP for playing roles in the stabilization process of AChR clusters.</p><p>We first determined whether SHP-2 is in a position to affect cluster stabilization by testing its association with MuSK. We treated C2C12 myotubes with agrin to induce MuSK phosphorylation, following which we immunoprecipitated MuSK and probed for both MuSK and SHP-2. We found that SHP-2 is co-immunoprecipitated together with MuSK, also without agrin treatment, and that the association between the two proteins increases 2.3-fold following MuSK phosphorylation by agrin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 increasingly associates with MuSK upon agrin stimulation</bold>. (A) C2C12 myotubes were treated with 0.5 nM agrin for 40 min. Following MuSK immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting for SHP-2 and MuSK was carried out, followed by reprobing for phosphorylation of MuSK. Levels of SHP-2 co-precipitated with MuSK were quantitated (normalized for the amount of precipitated MuSK) as percentage of No Agrin control. Co-immunoprecipitation of SHP-2 with MuSK indicates its specific association with MuSK, which increases significantly upon agrin-induced MuSK phosphorylation (means &#x000b1; SEM, from seven experiments; * <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05; two-tailed unpaired <italic>t </italic>test). As a control, the MuSK antibody was omitted in the immunoprecipitation, leading to no substantial signal in the Western blots (not shown). (B)COS cells were co-transfected with SHP-2-Flag and MuSK-myc constructs. Cells were then fixed and stained with anti-Flag/Alexa488 and anti-myc/Alexa546 antibodies. SHP-2 localizes throughout the whole of the cytoplasm, while MuSK localization is concentrated along the plasma membrane. White arrowheads in the overlay indicate a colocalization of MuSK and SHP-2 along membrane ruffles on the plasma membrane. Scale bar, 40 &#x003bc;m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2202-8-46-3"/></fig><p>Since SHP-2 is known to colocalize with AChRs and hence presumably also with MuSK at NMJs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], we investigated this association between MuSK and SHP-2 further using a heterologous cell system. We transfected COS cells with <italic>myc</italic>-tagged MuSK and <italic>Flag</italic>-tagged SHP-2 constructs, and visualized MuSK and SHP-2 in the transfected cells by immunocytochemistry. As expected, being a ubiquitously-expressed non-receptor PTP, SHP-2 was localized throughout the whole of the cell, but also along membrane ruffles on the plasma membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). On the other hand, MuSK showed more of a membrane localization, characteristic for a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). SHP-2 and MuSK colocalized within these membrane ruffles present along the plasma membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). They however did not cause the relocalization of one another, since singly-transfected COS cells also exhibited similar distribution patterns of the expressed proteins (data not shown).</p><p>From these results we can conclude that MuSK and SHP-2 colocalize in ruffles along the plasma membrane. They also associate with one another, and SHP-2 increases its association to MuSK upon MuSK activation by agrin, perhaps through an interaction of the SH2 domains in SHP-2 with MuSK phosphorylation sites.

We cloned three short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) loops into the <italic>pSUPER.gfp </italic>vector and tested their efficacy in downregulating SHP-2 expression in C2C12 myotubes. We used shRNA loops generated against different regions of the murine SHP-2 open-reading frame (ORF), based on already published and successfully used siRNA or shRNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These constructs co-expressed EGFP, allowing easy identification of the successfully transfected myoblasts, and observation of the differentiation of these myoblasts into mature myotubes. Transfection efficiencies at the myoblast level were 40&#x02013;50%, which upon differentiation and fusion led to close to 100% of the myotubes expressing EGFP (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). By Western blot analysis of C2C12 myotube lysates we probed for the effective suppression of endogenous SHP-2 protein.

This instability is also present in the absence of Src and Fyn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], or upon blocking SFKs with the inhibitor PP2, and is rescued completely by inhibition of phosphatase activity by pervanadate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Thus, PTPs such as SHP-2 stabilize AChR clusters under normal circumstances, but when these PTPs are not balanced by SFKs, they render clusters unstable.</p><sec><title>PTPs such as SHP-2 stabilize AChR clusters</title><p>We used two approaches to illustrate the role of PTPs in the maintenance of AChR clusters: inhibiting the activity of all PTPs by pervanadate, and testing the role of a candidate PTP, SHP-2. The stability of AChR clusters was modeled in cell culture, by adding and then removing agrin, and pervanadate was added at the point of agrin withdrawal to specifically test its effect on the maintenance of pre-existing agrin-induced clusters. The withdrawal and washing procedure removes the vast majority of agrin from cells, such that signaling processes in the myotubes during the withdrawal phase do not reflect the activity of extracellular agrin but ongoing processes within the myotubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. When agrin is withdrawn from wild-type myotubes, AChR clusters slowly disintegrate over the course of several hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Block of PTPs by pervanadate accelerated the decay of clusters, showing that PTP activity is a requirement for optimal AChR cluster stability. This was a specific process, since pervanadate as such did not alter levels of spontaneous AChR clustering. Rather, following an agrin stimulation to produce maximal aggregates, PTPs act to fully maintain these clusters.</p><p>PTPs exist in many families, as receptor tyrosine phosphatases or cytosolic non-receptor phosphatases, similar to kinase families. While several PTPs could share the function of maintaining AChR clusters, we identified SHP-2 as one PTP that plays such a role. SHP-2 has previously been put into the context of the NMJ as a regulator of AChR synthesis and MuSK activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and we first further verified whether SHP-2 is located to play a postsynaptic role. We found SHP-2 to associate with MuSK, and this association to be increased (2.3-fold) by an agrin treatment that caused heavy MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation. In COS cells, MuSK and SHP-2 showed colocalization in membrane ruffles at the plasma membrane, implying that they can interact with each other independently of muscle-specific linker proteins. These data show that SHP-2, by increasingly interacting with MuSK, is positioned to control postsynaptic stability of AChR clusters.</p><p>We determined the role of SHP-2 in the stabilization of AChR clusters by an RNAi strategy, using vector-driven shRNA and short-hairpin loops that were previously used to knock down SHP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. One of the shRNA constructs tested (<italic>pSUPER.shSHP2</italic>) was effective in myotubes when using an efficient transfection protocol that allowed its expression in nearly 100% of myotubes. <italic>pSUPER.shSHP2 </italic>massively reduced protein amounts of SHP-2 without significantly interfering with other postsynaptic proteins such as MuSK, Src, rapsyn and &#x003b2;-dystroglycan or with levels of functional AChR at the cell surface. This specificity in knockdown allowed the study of the role of SHP-2 in AChR cluster stability.</p><p>In the absence of normal SHP-2 levels, spontaneous AChR aggregates were present and AChR clusters were induced by agrin, but the stability of these clusters was reduced compared to controls, showing that, similar to the results described above with pervanadate, SHP-2 stabilizes AChR clusters. SHP-2 was also important at NMJs <italic>in vivo</italic>, because electroporation of <italic>pSUPER.shSHP2 </italic>into adult mouse soleus muscle led to disassembly of the postsynapse: pretzel-shaped AChR-rich areas became fragmented and some lost their overall pretzel outline, and sometimes myonuclei were no longer packed subsynaptically but more loosely associated with fragmented AChR cluster remnants. Taken together, our data show that SHP-2 is a PTP that, perhaps together with other PTPs, contributes to the maintenance of AChR clusters at NMJs <italic>in vivo </italic>and in cultured myotubes <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Upon knockdown of SHP-2, fragments of AChR clusters were visible at NMJs but not in cultured myotubes from which agrin had been withdrawn. In myotubes, cluster disappearance appears as a statistical process whereby some clusters still exist while others have vanished and are outside the detectable ranges used in our method. This could point towards differences in cluster dynamics between our <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>systems. Such differences could result from one or more of several possibilities: at NMJs, the turnover of AChRs is much slower and the subsynaptic cytoskeleton more elaborate, presumably immobilizing the AChR in a stronger fashion; cultured myotubes lack innervation and the continuous presence of basal lamina-anchored agrin as seen <italic>in vivo</italic>; and the timing of AChR cluster disassembly is different as indicated by the different time scale of our <italic>in vivo </italic>vs. <italic>in vitro </italic>analysis. However, equally likely is the possibility that upon SHP-2 knockdown and agrin withdrawal, AChR cluster fragments do exist in cultured myotubes but cannot be visualized due to low intensity; in comparison the density of AChRs in pretzels is much higher <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, fragments of AChR pretzels may completely disappear from <italic>pSUPER.shSHP2</italic>-expressing myofibers after prolongated times.</p><p>There are several possibilities of how SHP-2 could act to maintain clusters. The agrin-induced increase in MuSK-SHP-2 interaction is very similar to SHP-2 association with tyrosine phosphorylated DOK1, a member of insulin receptor substrate protein family that binds &#x003b2;3. Association with DOK1 also occurs under basal conditions, and upon stimulation of DOK1 by insulin-like growth factor I (IGI-I), SHP-2-DOK1 association increases 2.7-fold. This association is important for DOK1 to present SHP-2 to downstream SHPS-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In a similar fashion, SHP-2 associates, via its SH2 domains, to other RTKs including the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In SHP-2, the engagement of the N-SH2 domain is required for its activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. By inference, in our case, SHP-2 recruitment to tyrosine phosphorylated MuSK may allow for proper SHP-2 localization at the muscle membrane, and at sites where its phosphatase activity would be required in postsynaptic stabilization. Possible downstream targets of recruited SHP-2 could be MuSK itself, allowing fine-tuning of MuSK phosphorylation levels in a feedback mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] or SFKs. SHP-2 is known to interact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and positively regulate Src activity, either directly or through intermediate proteins such as PAG and Csk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. SHP-2 could also associate with and dephosphorylate the AChR as proposed earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]; the AChR is known to undergo dephosphorylation in myotubes, since pervanadate treatment rapidly causes strong AChR &#x003b2; phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The balance does the trick: upon lack of balance by SFKs, PTPs destabilize AChR clusters</title><p>We unraveled the mechanism by which PTPs such as SHP-2 act in stabilizing postsynaptic AChR clusters by testing their interplay with SFKs. We used two models: <italic>src</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>fyn</italic><sup>-/- </sup>myotubes, and wild-type (C2C12) myotubes treated with the specific inhibitor PP2. In both situations, agrin induced normal AChR clusters, but upon agrin withdrawal these clusters disintegrated more rapidly than in the parallel controls. Importantly, in both <italic>src</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>fyn</italic><sup>-/- </sup>myotubes and PP2-treated C2C12 myotubes, blocking PTPs with pervanadate after agrin induction restored stability of the pre-existing agrin-induced clusters. This stabilization was a specific process by several criteria: pervanadate did not alter levels of spontaneous clusters; the stability, not the formation of clusters was affected by having less SFKs; and when added together with agrin, pervanadate did not affect formation of AChR clusters in <italic>src</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>fyn</italic><sup>-/- </sup>myotubes. Interestingly, <italic>src</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>fyn</italic><sup>-/- </sup>myotubes were found to have substantially elevated levels of SHP-2 protein. The elevated amounts may be the result of changes in SHP-2 synthesis, turnover or degradation, and the amounts may be an attempt of <italic>src</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>fyn</italic><sup>-/- </sup>myotubes to produce normal SFK activity, because SHP-2 is known to activate SFKs, at least in other cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Along the same lines, levels of the SFK member Yes are upregulated in <italic>src</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>fyn</italic><sup>-/- </sup>myotubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Collectively, our data show that in the absence of normal SFK activity, PTPs no longer act to stabilize AChR clusters (as is normally the case). Rather, PTPs, when not counterbalanced by SFKs, destabilize the clusters, and blocking PTP activity restores cluster stability. In a related mechanism, agrin activates PTKs as well as PTPs in <italic>Xenopus </italic>muscle cells, and this allows formation of new AChR clusters but at the same time causes disassembly of pre-existing spontaneous AChR hotspots. Hotspot disassembly is blocked by pervanadate, implying that agrin-activated PTPs disassemble AChR clusters when they are not protected by local agrin-activated PTKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Our findings strengthen the proposal that it is the balance between PTKs such as SFKs and PTPs such as SHP-2, which controls AChR cluster stability. In <italic>src</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>fyn</italic><sup>-/- </sup>myotubes, elevated SHP-2 levels could be causing the instability of AChR clusters. Using the inhibitor pervanadate on these myotubes could bring down the phosphatase activity, normalizing the PTP-PTK balance in the system, and allowing for more stable AChR clusters. On the other hand, in wild-type myotubes phosphatase inhibition by pervanadate reduces the phosphatase activity below normal levels, tipping the balance towards increased PTK activity, and leading to a destabilization of the system and consequently of AChR clusters.</p><p>The balance of SFKs and SHP-2 also plays <italic>in vivo</italic>: very similar to our present findings on SHP-2, it was recently shown, using the same electroporation technique, that a decrease or increase in SFK activity causes disassembly of postsynaptic pretzel-shaped AChR clusters and often displacement of subsynaptic myonuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus interfering with SFK activity produces the same effect as reducing SHP-2 function at NMJs <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Our results describe a "phosphostat", which is required to keep AChR clusters optimally stable, but what could be the effector machinery that translates this phosphostat into postsynaptic stability? Most likely it is not just a classic simple mechanism where PTKs phosphorylate targets whereas PTPs dephosphorylate them. Rather, it appears to be a combination of common phosphorylation substrates and mutual control of activity of PTKs and PTPs. Since SHP-2 positively controls the activity of Src kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], block of SHP-2 would result in less Src activity, leading to unstable AChR clusters. This may indeed be part of the situation in our C2C12 myotubes and at NMJs <italic>in vivo</italic>, where PTP block or SHP-2 knockdown destabilizes AChR clusters. On the other hand, AChR &#x003b2; subunit phosphorylation is a factor for efficient receptor clustering and cytoskeletal anchorage, and the AChR is dephosphorylated by PTPs, as shown by its overphosphorylation due to pervanadate treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], also in our cultures (data not shown). With this in mind, blocking PTPs would be expected to lead to more stable AChR phosphorylation and thus to more stable clusters. However, the fact that pervanadate treatment increases AChR phosphorylation but destabilizes AChR clusters shows that phosphorylation of the receptor itself is not sufficient to keep clusters stable.

From studies on non-muscle cells, cortactin, p190RhoGAP and WASp are known direct substrates of SFKs and involved, via direct or indirect action upon the Arp2/3 complex, in the dynamics of actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Actin reorganization, in turn, and the action of Rac and Cdc42 (which can regulate cortactin and WASp, respectively) are important in clustering of AChRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Dephosphorylation of such regulators in the absence of SFKs could be a further reason for postsynaptic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and blocking PTPs could restore the activity of the regulators to normal operating levels, thereby stabilizing clusters.</p><p>These considerations lead to a model in which, in the stabilization phase of postsynaptic AChR clusters, PTPs such as SHP-2 associate with MuSK. Besides fine-tuning MuSK dephosphorylation, PTPs keep, indirectly or directly, SFKs activated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, process A). This activity maintains AChR &#x003b2; phosphorylation, AChR-rapsyn interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and may maintain phosphorylation of critical downstream cytoskeletal regulators at operating levels. In parallel, PTPs such as SHP-2 dephosphorylate AChRs and the downstream regulators (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, process B). Under normal circumstances the balance of process A and B leads to a certain level of AChR and substrate phosphorylation, keeping clusters stable. Upon block of PTPs, SFK activity is compromised and clusters unstable. In the absence of SFKs, process B dominates, destabilizing clusters, but PTP block rescues stability.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Model for a balance between PTPs such as SHP-2 and kinases such as SFKs, which stabilizes postsynaptic AChR clusters</bold>.
