Despite a high-expressing genotype, normal fibroblasts do not exhibit higher IPC or enhanced MMP release. This suggests that more complex changes occur in tumor-derived fibroblasts, enabling full expression of the MMP SNP genotype and these possibly are epigenetic in nature. The results do suggest that, in women with breast cancer, a high-expressing <italic>MMP-3 </italic>genotype may promote tumor progression more effectively.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The microenvironment plays a central role in controlling both normal and transformed cell function as well as normal tissue integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Both <italic>in vitro </italic>studies and animal models have demonstrated the importance of interactions with the microenvironment in modulating tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Restoration of normal microenvironment signalling has been shown to revert features of the malignant phenotype, even when the tumor cells retain their mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Inflammatory cells, endothelial cells, and stromal fibroblasts all are implicated in this activity. However, a number of studies have indicated a dominant role for fibroblasts in modulating epithelial cell function, in promoting tumor cell progression, and even in initiating epithelial cell tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Differences in the pattern of gene and protein expression have been identified between peri-tumoral fibroblasts and their normal counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Such differences generally are regarded as a stromal response to tumor-derived signals, which then influence the tumor-promoting activity of the stroma. For example, tumor-derived transforming growth factor-beta induces stromal hepatocyte growth factor which then, in a paracrine fashion, promotes tumor cell invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Emerging evidence also suggests that stroma may undergo independent genetic and epigenetic modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although the functional implications of these alterations have not been established fully, such changes may be expected to contribute to altered stromal cell function and the generation of a permissive tumor microenvironment. In contrast to such acquired genetic alterations, the potential functional impact of intrinsic genetic differences in stromal populations has received less attention. A number of reports have indicated that non-tumor fibroblasts from women with breast cancer differ from those isolated from women without breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It has been suggested that this could be an important factor in defining the diversity of tumor behavior between individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>One way in which breast fibroblasts influence tumor behavior is through the release and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Several MMPs have been implicated as having a role in breast cancer, including MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Common functional promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been described in some of these genes in which they have the potential to influence levels of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In <italic>MMP-1</italic>, the polymorphism is characterized by an insertion (2G) or deletion (1G) of a single guanine residue at -1607 base pairs (bp). The insertion of a G residue in the 2G allele forms a binding site for the Ets-1 transcription factor which results in increased transcription and MMP-1 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. A single adenine insertion (6A) or deletion (5A) located at position -1171 bp in the <italic>MMP-3 </italic>promoter region influences MMP-3 expression by changing the affinity for repressor binding, with the 6A allele sequence having a stronger recognition for the repressor binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This also leads to enhanced transcriptional levels and local MMP-3 production in the presence of the 5A allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the <italic>MMP-9 </italic>gene, a C-to-T transition at -1306 bp results in an approximately 1.5-fold higher promoter activity compared with the C allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Many studies have examined the association between epithelial malignancy and MMP SNP status. Some have reported an increased risk for breast cancer in women carrying the <italic>MMP-3 </italic>5A allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], but this has not been confirmed in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In others, the <italic>MMP-1 </italic>2G/2G genotype has been associated with increased susceptibility to colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], though not to breast cancer. To date, as far as we are aware, <italic>MMP-9 </italic>SNP status has not been related to cancer susceptibility.</p><p>Although the evidence for a role of MMP SNPs in enhancing susceptibility to breast cancer is somewhat equivocal, MMPs have an established role in promoting tumor cell invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus, mechanisms leading to higher expression of MMP might be expected to enhance tumor progression. To date, no studies have investigated the influence of MMP SNP genotype on the ability of the stromal environment to modulate tumor behavior. This study has analyzed the ability of primary breast fibroblasts, from patients with or without breast cancer, to promote breast tumor cell invasion and has investigated the relationship between MMP SNP status, donor group, and fibroblast invasion-promoting capacity (IPC) by examining the contribution of MMP activity to the invasive process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Breast tissue and cell lines</title><p>Breast tissue was obtained from women undergoing surgery for breast carcinoma (<italic>n </italic>= 13; age range 37 to 85 years) or reduction mammoplasty (<italic>n </italic>= 19; age range 19 to 54 years) following informed consent and approval of the study by the North East London Ethics Committee and the Leicestershire and Rutland Ethics Committee. None of the patients had received pre-operative chemotherapy. The breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB 468, and the human fetal foreskin fibroblast cell line, hfff<sub>2</sub>, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of primary fibroblasts</title><p>Tissue, excess to histopathological diagnosis, was selected from the breast samples and fibroblasts were isolated as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Briefly, the tissue was digested for 12 hours in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-Glutamine, 100 IU penicillin and streptomycin, 400 IU collagenase IA, and 65 IU hyaluronidase (all reagents obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd., Poole, Dorset, UK). Following a sedimentation step at 1 g for 30 minutes, the supernatant was removed and centrifuged, washed twice in serum-free DMEM, and then filtered through a 20-&#x003bc;m cell strainer (BDFalcon, San Diego, CA, USA). The filtrate was spun down and the cell pellet resuspended in DMEM with 10% FBS, penicillin and streptomycin (100 U/mL), and fungizone (2.5 &#x003bc;g/mL) (Gibco-BRL, now part of Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The cells were cultured for 24 hours, then the medium was aspirated off, and the cells were washed with DMEM (to remove any non-viable cells or contaminating red blood cells) before re-feeding with complete DMEM. All experiments, including generation of conditioned media (CM), were performed using fibroblasts that had been passaged at 70% confluency a maximum of four times after initial isolation.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of fibroblasts</title><p>Cells plated onto poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips were stained with antibodies to vimentin (clone 384; Dako UK Ltd., Ely, Cambridgeshire, UK), cytokeratin 14 (clone LL01, gift from EB Lane, University of Dundee, UK), cytokeratin 18 (clone CY90; Serotec Ltd., Oxford, Oxfordshire, UK), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) (clone E29; Dako UK Ltd.), CD31 (clone JC70A; Dako UK Ltd.), CD45 (clone 2B11/PD7/26; Dako UK Ltd.), alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;-SMA) (clone 1A4; Dako UK Ltd.), and &#x003b1;1 integrin (clone SR84; BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse F(ab<sup>1</sup>)<sub>2 </sub>was used as a secondary antibody, and staining was recorded on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M confocal microscope using the LSM 510 Meta software (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Omission of the primary antibody was included as a negative control.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of fibroblast conditioned medium</title><p>Fibroblasts were plated into 25-cm<sup>2 </sup>tissue culture flasks and grown to 60% confluency, the media removed, cells washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (dPBS), and 5 mL of serum-free DMEM was added. Fibroblasts then were cultured for a further 48 hours, and media were removed and centrifuged to remove cell debris and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until use. For the reproducibility assay, hfff<sub>2 </sub>cells were cultured in 75-cm<sup>2 </sup>tissue culture flasks generating 15 mL of CM in order to allow assays to be performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Invasion assays</title><p>Two types of invasion assay were performed. In one, donor fibroblasts were incorporated into the lower well of the invasion assay (Fib co-culture assay), allowing crosstalk between the fibroblast and tumor cell populations. In the other, CM, generated from an equivalent number of fibroblasts, was placed in the lower well of the invasion assay. The invasion assays were carried out over the course of 48 hours as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Briefly, the lower surface of an 8-&#x003bc;m-pore polyethylene terephthalate track-etched membrane was coated with 10 &#x003bc;g/mL fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd.) and the upper surface was coated with Englebreth-Holm-Swarm basement membrane (Matrigel; Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at a final concentration of 5 &#x003bc;g per filter. The upper membrane was seeded with 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>MDA-MB-468 cells in serum-free DMEM, and either 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>fibroblasts or fibroblast CM (1 mL) was placed into the lower chamber. Invasion assays were set up in quadruplicate, cell counts were performed on hematoxylin and eosin-stained membranes, and an invasion index was calculated as a percentage of the number of cells on the lower membrane compared with the total number of cells (on the upper and lower membranes).</p><p>For invasion assays in which human recombinant MMP-3 was included (R&#x00026;D Systems Europe Ltd, Abingdon, Oxfordshire), a range of MMP-3 concentrations (12.5 to 100 ng/mL) was added at the start of the assay. For invasion assays incorporating inhibitors, 25 &#x003bc;M MMP-3 inhibitor (Ac-RCGVPD-NH<sub>2</sub>; code number: 444218; Calbiochem, now part of EMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) or vehicle control was added at the beginning of the assay and again at 24 hours. The assays then were processed as described above. At the end of the invasion assay, medium from the four wells of the assay was harvested (referred to as end-of-assay CM), centrifuged to remove cell debris, and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until use.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of MMP polymorphism status</title><p>Purification of genomic DNA from frozen fibroblast populations was carried out using the DNA Research Innovations Ltd Genomic DNA purification kit (DNA Research Innovations Ltd, Kent, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, approximately 250,000 cells in 100 &#x003bc;L of dPBS was lysed in lysis buffer containing proteinase K for 5 minutes and DNA was captured using magnetic beads with a DNA-binding positive charge. DNA was eluted from the beads using a low-salt (10 mM Tris-HCl; pH 8.5) buffer. DNA concentration and purity were assessed by means of a spectrophotometer. Fibroblast populations from 19 normal donors and 13 patients with breast cancer were analyzed. As an internal control for the MMP polymorphism polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nine paired dermal samples also were included in the study.</p><p>PCR was performed using 100 ng of DNA in each reaction with the following primers: <italic>MMP-1 </italic>forward: TCG TGA GAA TGT CTT CCC ATT, <italic>MMP-1 </italic>reverse: TCT TGG ATT GAT TTG AGA TAA GTG AAA TC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]; <italic>MMP-3 </italic>forward: GAT TAC AGA CAT GGG TCA CA, <italic>MMP-3 </italic>reverse: TTT CAA TCA GGA CAA GAC GAA GTT T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]; and <italic>MMP-9 </italic>forward: GCC TGG CAC ATA GTA GGC CC, <italic>MMP-9 </italic>reverse: CTT CCT AGC CAG CCG GCA TC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

The end-of-assay CM was concentrated using Centricon centrifugal filter devices (YM-10; Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) and 50 &#x003bc;g of protein mixed with 10&#x000d7; non-reducing sample buffer (0.3 M Tris-HCL [pH 6.8], 12.5% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 1% bromophenol blue). Samples were run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.01% SDS and a final concentration of 1 mg/mL gelatin. Recombinant pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 (Calbiochem) were included as standards on each gel. Electrophoresis was carried out for 3 hours at 120 V before renaturation of proteins by three 15-minute washes in 2.5% Triton X-100. Gels were incubated overnight at 37&#x000b0;C in developing buffer (0.5 M Tris, 2 M NaCl, 0.05 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.2% Triton X-100) and stained with 0.5% Coomassie Blue. Gelatinolytic activity was visualized, as clear bands on the uniformly blue-stained background, and quantitated by densitometry. A sandwich enzyme immunoassay kit (R&#x00026;D Systems Europe Ltd, Abingdon, Oxfordshire) was used to measure total MMP-3 present in end-of-assay CM and was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR analysis of MMP expression</title><p>To determine the cellular source of MMP, RNA was isolated from cell populations and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was carried out for <italic>MMP-1</italic>, <italic>MMP-3</italic>, and the housekeeping gene <italic>GAPDH</italic>.

MMPs could play a multifaceted role in such a phenomenon, modifying the tumor microenvironment through direct breakdown of matrix proteins and basement membrane barriers, promotion of angiogenesis, and/or the release and activation of growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Both MMP-1 and MMP-<italic>3 </italic>have been shown to affect the motility and invasion of tumor cells directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Therefore, differences in the capacity to express MMPs may be critical in regulating tumor behavior. One of the mechanisms by which MMP expression could be modified is through the existence of functional SNPs capable of influencing gene promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Several studies have examined the association between MMP SNP genotype and the prevalence of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], but directly relating such intrinsic characteristics to cellular behavior is difficult owing to the challenge of isolating primary cells for functional studies from a large enough group of donors. This is the first study to use purified cell populations from different donor groups in order to investigate the impact of MMP SNP genotype on tumor cell behavior. Since the major source of MMPs in breast cancer is the stromal fibroblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], we examined the relationship between MMP SNP genotype and the ability of donor fibroblasts to promote breast cancer cell invasion. The data show that, whereas fibroblasts from different donors vary in their capacity to promote tumor invasion, significantly higher levels of tumor invasion are generated by tumor fibroblasts compared with normal fibroblasts, results in keeping with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. This was seen both in CM and fibroblast co-culture assays, although the level of tumor invasion was higher in the presence of fibroblasts, indicating a role for tumor-fibroblast interactions in determining tumor behavior.</p><p>When fibroblast IPC was related to MMP SNP genotype, we identified a significant association between the high-expressing MMP-3 5A/5A genotype and high IPC of donor fibroblasts for the tumor-derived populations, though not in the normal fibroblast donors. Thus, whereas tumor-derived fibroblasts of MMP-3 5A/5A status exhibited significantly higher invasion than tumor fibroblasts of 5A/6A or 6A/6A status, the IPC of normal fibroblasts of MMP-3 5A/5A genotype did not differ from fibroblasts of 5A/6A or 6A/6A status. Furthermore, the <italic>MMP-3 </italic>5A/5A genotype and high IPC were reflected in higher levels of MMP-3 activity in tumor-derived fibroblasts, although the normal donor fibroblasts of <italic>MMP-3 </italic>5A/5A genotype did not exhibit enhanced MMP-3 activity. This suggests that tumor-derived fibroblasts have undergone additional changes that influence the phenotypic expression of the MMP SNP genotype and that the high IPC of tumor-derived fibroblasts is not simply a response to tumor-derived signals. It previously has been demonstrated that the tumor-promoting capacity of tumor fibroblasts is a stable feature of this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and there are several reports of distinct genetic and epigenetic changes in TAFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It is plausible that epigenetic alterations, such as demethylation (which is common in tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]), may unmask the high-expressing potential of the <italic>MMP-3 </italic>5A/5A genotype in tumor fibroblasts. Despite previous reports of the wide variation in expression detected in relation to SNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], in our study the <italic>MMP-3 </italic>5A/5A genotype was reflected in significantly higher levels of MMP-3 release in patients with breast cancer compared with the 5A/6A genotype, with the difference not quite reaching significance for the 6A/6A genotype group.</p><p>In apparent contradiction to the predicted enhancing role of MMPs, there was an inverse relationship between the high-expressing <italic>MMP-1 </italic>2G/2G genotype and invasion. This possibly reflects the nature of the invasion barrier used in these assays; thus, we measured invasion through basement membrane, which would be degraded by MMP-3, rather than invasion through interstitial collagen, which would be more dependent on MMP-1 activity. Alternatively, the inverse relationship between IPC and the high-expressing <italic>MMP-1 </italic>2G/2G genotype may reflect linkage disequilibrium between the <italic>MMP-1 </italic>2G and <italic>MMP-3 </italic>6A alleles as has been reported in colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The number of donors in this study, though large in comparison to other studies, was too small to perform linkage analysis, but the results do suggest a relationship between <italic>MMP-1 </italic>2G and <italic>MMP-3 </italic>6A, and formal analysis on a larger patient cohort currently is being undertaken.</p><p>Perhaps different MMPs are important at different stages of disease progression and the models used here are more representative of early-stage invasion. The importance of MMP-3 at this initial stage of invasion is reflected in animal models in which targeting overexpression of MMP-3 to normal mouse mammary glands has been shown to induce an altered stromal environment promoting the phenotypic conversion and malignant transformation of mammary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Moreover, MMP-3, in addition to other MMPs, has been implicated in Wnt1-induced mouse mammary tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Such results are consistent with the possibility that MMP-3 expression may be important in the initiation of breast cancer. The functional importance of MMP-3 activity was demonstrated by a significant reduction in tumor cell invasion in the presence of a selective MMP-3 inhibitor. Crucially, our results indicate a stronger relationship between fibroblast IPC and <italic>MMP-3 </italic>genotype than the fibroblast IPC and donor status since, in our system, tumor-derived fibroblasts of <italic>MMP-3 </italic>5A/6A or 6A/6A genotype did not differ in their IPC from normal fibroblasts. Thus, while tumor-derived fibroblasts are stimulatory of tumor invasion, whether or not they are of the <italic>MMP-3 </italic>5A/5A genotype is more important.</p><p>Evidence for a role for MMP-3 in breast cancer comes from tissue studies and animal models. <italic>MMP-3 </italic>expression is detected in the stroma around invasive breast tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and is an indicator of poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, our study showed that fibroblasts derived from patients with breast cancer were more frequently of the <italic>5A/5A </italic>genotype compared with normal fibroblasts and, together, this supports a previous study suggesting an association between the <italic>MMP-3 </italic>5A SNP and breast cancer susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], although two subsequent studies failed to find such an association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. All three studies, however, found an association with lymph node positivity in patients with breast cancer, which we interpret as being consistent with our findings of a direct involvement of MMP-3 in tumor invasion promotion.</p><p>As well as degrading a wide spectrum of matrix proteins, MMP-3 activates other MMPs, including MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].
