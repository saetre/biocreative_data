In Korea, polymorphisms have not been comprehensively studied, except codons 129 and 219 in <italic>PRNP </italic>among Korean CJD cases.

The 67-year-old patient with the D178N-129M mutation showed progressive gait disturbance and dysarthria was in progress. The 58-year-old patient with the E200K mutation coupled to the 129MV codon had gait disturbance, dysarthria, agitation, and ataxic gait, and progressed rapidly to death 3 months from the first onset of symptoms. The 65-year-old patient with the M232R mutation showed rapidly progressive memory decline and gait disturbance, and died within 16 months after onset of symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite differences in ethnicity, the clinical and pathological outcomes were similar to the respective mutations around the world, except absence of insomnia in D178N-129M subject.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Str&#x000e4;ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) fatal familial insomnia (FFI), and Kuru are transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) diseases in human. TSEs are typically fatal neurodegenerative diseases; 90% of CJD patients die within 1 year of diagnosis which occurs sporadically at an annual incidence of 1 per million populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Among all CJD cases, 10&#x02013;15% has been reported as autosomal dominant disorders, with mutations in the prion protein gene (<italic>PRNP</italic>) on chromosome 20, and is categorized as genetic TSE. These reports have suggested the importance of <italic>PRNP </italic>mutations in familial CJD (fCJD). <italic>PRNP </italic>mutations have been discovered from more than 30 sites, and lead to amino-acid substitutions, premature stop codons, or the insertion of additional octapeptide repeats at the N-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Some could be transmitted in an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, with nearly 100% penetrance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These findings emphasize the importance of investigating <italic>PRNP </italic>polymorphisms or mutations to predict disease occurrence.</p><p>As a rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disorder, the symptoms of CJD are characterized by progressive dementia, ataxia, and myoclonus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Familial CJD tends to have an earlier age of onset and longer duration than sporadic CJD (sCJD). The E200K mutation is the most common in fCJD (more than 70% worldwide) with the D178N mutation being the second most frequent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The effect of codon 129 on the phenotype associated with the E200K mutation seems to be less distinguishable than for the D178N mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Hence, the phenotypic effect of the D178N mutation depends on polymorphism at codon 129 of <italic>PRNP</italic>. Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) seems to be associated with a D178N mutation and methionine at codon 129 of <italic>PRNP</italic>, whereas the phenotype of sCJD was observed for the D178N mutation with valine at codon 129 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The D178N mutation almost never indicated the characteristic electroencephalogram (EEG) changes, but this was not the case when it was linked with the E200K mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The clinical, EEG and neuroimaging features in patients with E200K-129M mutation were similar to sCJD. A typical EEG, with periodic spike and wave (PSW) complexes, was observed in about 75% of all patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The levels of 14-3-3 protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) increased in almost all cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The phenotype of patients with E200K-129V mutations was similar to that of patients categorized as CJD VV2 type. The typical presenting symptom was ataxia followed by myoclonus and PSW complexes on EEG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The M232R mutation was reported in eight Japanese patients without any previous family history of neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The clinical feature of M232R mutation was similar to that of sCJD. Common symptoms were progressive memory impairment, gait disturbance, and myoclonus, and a typical EEG with PSW complexes was observed in all cases except in an 84-year-old subject [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>CJD is clinically diagnosed with specific finding with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), periodic sharp and wave complexes (PSWCs), and elevated 14-3-3 protein in the CSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The detection of 14-3-3 protein in CSF is an important marker supporting the diagnosis of CJD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although the positive detection of 14-3-3 protein has been reported in other neurological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the diagnostic criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) for CJD includes 14-3-3 detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the mutations of <italic>PRNP </italic>at codons 178, 200-129, and 232 reported in other countries were first discovered among probable CJD patients in Korea.

PCR products from the healthy control yielded bands of 75, 296, and 309 bp after Nsp I digestion, while mutation at codon 129 in Case 2 had an additional band of 384 bp. The bands of 296 and 309 bp were not differentiated due to limitation in the separation of fragments with similar size in the DNA gel. In addition, after incubating the PCR products with BsmA I, the digestion site disappeared for the mutation at codon 200 fragment in Case 2. BsmA I digestion of the wild type PCR products at codon 200 yielded two fragments (167 and 513 bp, respectively), while the codon 200 variant yielded fragments of 167, 513, and 680 bp (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In Case 3, Nla III digested the wild type PCR products into two fragments, of 129 and 83 bp, respectively. The AGG substitution at codon 232 abolished the Nla III digestion site in the PCR products, yielding a full-sized 212 bp fragment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The result of RFLP was tantamount to that of DNA sequencing and SNaPshot.</p></sec><sec><title>MRI and EEG</title><p>In Case 1, lacunar infarctions appeared in the pons, left thalamus, and both putamen and cerebral white matter. Diffuse cerebral atrophy was more prominent in the frontoparietal lobes. Some high signal intensities were observed along gyri of both parietal and occipital lobes in diffusion and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). For EEG analysis, 32 channel digital EEG monitoring was performed with the patient in an awake state. The posterior dominant rhythm was less well regulated with 8~9 Hz activity, which was reactive to eye opening. There was no definite interictal epileptiform discharge or focal slowing, and the patient was diagnosed as normal EEG (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>CJD profiles of MRI and EEG from probable CJD patients</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Brain MRIs of Cases 1, 2, and 3 with <italic>PRNP </italic>polymorphisms.

After 50 days, the second MRI revealed higher signal intensities in the right side of the cerebral cortex than the left, indicating damage to the right hemisphere of the brain. The follow-up FLAIR images indicated atrophy in the right frontal lobes and caudate nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Frequent generalized rhythmical (0.5~1.5 Hz) slow activities were observed, which consisted of sharp or spike and slow waves with very high amplitude, more from the left cerebral hemisphere (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><p>In Case 3, DWI showed high signal intensities mainly from the cortex of the parieto- occipital and temporal lobes, and FLAIR images showed high signal intensity lesion from the cortex of temporal lobe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The EEG results revealed slow waves ranging from diffuse theta to delta (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion and Conclusion</title><p>The genotype of the patients seemed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of CJD. The D178N mutation abolished the salt bridge between the conserved residues Asp-178-Arg-164, suggesting that the mutant protein had reduced thermodynamic stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Moreover, Asp-178 was in the vicinity of the disulfide bridge (S-S), and mutation in this region could potentially interfere with the formation of disulfide bridge, and potentially cause protein aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The E200K mutation indicated a significant reduction in glycosylation in comparison to the wild-type, which could affect to the conformational changes in prion protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. An analogous reduction in glycosylation was reported in fCJD patients with the E200K mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Codon 232 at the carboxy-terminal region in the PrP was implicated in post-translational modification by the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor during protein maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It seemed that arginine substitution for methionine at codon 232 prohibited the cleavage during the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthetic process, resulting in conformational changes in mutant PrP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The D178N mutation with 129MM was the genotype for FFI and sCJD with 129MV or 129VV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Japanese CJD patients with the D178N mutation with 129MM did not have clinical insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], whereas Chinese patients with same genotype were diagnosed with typical FFI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, D178N didn't show only FFI phenotype all the time in case of not only Asia but also Europe, but sometimes showed CJD phenotype which shows phenotypic variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The Korean patient with the D178N mutation with 129MM had a similar phenotype to the Japanese CJD patients, so we suggest that other potential factors may be related to the clinical features. The symptoms of the patient with the M232R mutation was similar to those of Japanese CJD patients with the M232R mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The patient is considered a slow type of patients with M232R, due to not showing akinetic mutism or PSWC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Despite differences in ethnicity, the clinical and pathological outcomes were similar to the respective mutations around the world. Autopsies were not performed in all cases, since the Korean tended to avoid in performing autopsies due to the traditional Confucianism culture. Therefore, we need a development substitute diagnostic method and we consider that a clinical view of DWI and FLAIR imaging may be useful in the early premortem diagnosis of CJD.</p><p>The D178N-129M, E200K-129MV, and M232R mutations, which were previously reported from other countries, were identified for the first time among probable CJD patients in Korea. Diverse <italic>PRNP </italic>polymorphisms in the Korean population will be investigated in the future. <italic>PRNP </italic>polymorphisms among Korean, Chinese, and Japanese populations will provide insights into the associations between polymorphisms, CJD susceptibilities, and their clinical phenotypic variations, especially when 129MM codon has been reported to be a dominant determinant in more than 90% of populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BY conducted the Western blotting, genetic analysis, RFLP and drafted the manuscript.
