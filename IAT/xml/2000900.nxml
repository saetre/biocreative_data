The number of deaths from liver cancer is very similar to that of new cancer cases (598,000 and 626,000 respectively) and the liver cancer mortality rate is the third highest in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In China, liver cancer kills 54.7 people out of one-hundred-thousand per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although many advances have been made as a result of HCC clinical studies during the past decades that include early detection, surgical resection and liver transplantation, the general prognosis of the patients with HCC still remains dismal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This outcome has been attributed to the high possibility of intra-hepatic metastases and recurrence after curative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Cancer metastasis is a highly complex multistep process that involves alterations in growth, dissemination, invasion and survival, which leads to subsequent attachment, angiogenesis, and growth of new cancer cell colonies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recently, the traditional metastasis paradigm has been challenged by the observations that most of the genetic and epigenetic changes necessary for metastasis appear to be the hallmarks of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In our previous studies, we found that chromosome 8p deletions might contribute to HCC metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This result was further confirmed by comparisons in nude mice models bearing human HCC with different metastatic potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These findings provide new locus for exploring a new candidate metastasis suppressor of HCC. In our recent study on two HCC cell lines with different metastatic potentials, a novel metastatic suppressor gene, <italic>HTPAP</italic>, was identified on chromosome 8p12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. On the basis of these findings, we aimed our current study to compare the difference in gene expression profiles between HCC tissues with and without metastasis, and to identify the candidate metastatic suppressor gene on chromosome 8p.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Human HCC specimens and cell lines</title><p>Human HCC tissues were obtained with informed consent from 60 patients who underwent liver resection for HCC at the Liver Cancer Institute and Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University (Shanghai, China). These included 30 patients with metastatic HCC whose primary HCC lesions were accompanied by intrahepatic spreading, which had been regarded as the most frequently metastatic site of HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], in portal vein (n = 26), hepatic vein (n = 2), or bile duct (n = 2), and 30 patients who had only solitary HCC without metastases. All patients had a history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with an average age of 48.8 years, and 54 (90 %) of them were male. The diagnosis and histopathological features were confirmed to be HCC by pathologists. The tumor sizes of primary HCCs ranged from 1 cm to 25 cm in diameter with a median diameter of 7.8 cm.</p><p>Non-neoplastic liver tissues as references for microarrays assays were obtained from 10 patients who also had the history of HBV infection and underwent liver resection for haemangioma of liver. All specimens were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after resection and were stored at -80&#x000b0;C until use.</p><p>HCC cell lines, MHCC97-L, MHCC97-H, HCCLM3 and HCCLM6 were established from the same parent human HCC cell line, MHCC97, in authors' institute. They have an identical genetic background and stepwise increasing metastatic potentials, i.e., MHCC97-L had the lowest and HCCLM6 had the highest ability of metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. They were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco BRL, NY, USA) supplemented with 10 % (v/v) fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Utah, USA) at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified incubator containing 5 % CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University (Shanghai, China) (No. 20050310), and was in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA preparation</title><p>Total RNAs were extracted from each tissue sample and cell line using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, USA) and was further purified with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of the total RNA samples was determined by electrophoresis through formaldehyde agarose gels, and the 18S and 28S RNA bands were visualized under ultraviolet light.</p></sec><sec><title>Microarrays experimental design</title><p>A reference design was used to compare the HCC with and without metastases indirectly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. RNA from 10 non-neoplastic liver tissues was pooled to generate the common reference sample. Twenty cases of HCCs with metastasis and 20 HCCs without metastasis were investigated against the common reference. Twenty metastatic HCCs used in microarray experiments were from patients with tumor spreading in portal vein (n = 18), hepatic vein (n = 1), or bile duct (n = 1) [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. Dye swap was performed in each comparison. Therefore, considering the two floret types, two kinds of HCCs and biological replications, a total of 80 chips were used for comparing the gene expression pattern between the HCCs with and without metastasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Description of 8p-specific microarrays</title><p>'8p-specific' microarrays were constructed using 322 genes on human chromosome 8p based on the UniGene clusters in GenBank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, 5 house-keeping genes and 8 intergenic sequences from the yeast were used as internal and external controls respectively. All of these 335 genes were spotted twice as duplicates on microarrays, and 6 blank spots were made as the negative controls. So, total 676 spots (26 &#x000d7; 26 matrix) were constructed on each '8p-specific' microarrays. Both the design of 70-mer oligonuclearotides for each gene and the construction of microarrays were made by CapitalBio Corporation (Beijing, China).</p></sec><sec><title>Microarrays assays and statistic analysis</title><p>Five microgram of DNase-treated total RNA was used to prepare fluorescent dye-labeled cDNA through Eberwine's linear RNA amplification method followed with subsequent reverse transcription and Klenow enzyme reaction according to the previously described methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Procedures of hybridization and washing were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], arrays were scanned at 10-&#x003bc;m resolution by using a confocal LuxScan&#x02122; scanner (CapitalBio, Beijing, China), and the intensities of spots on each image were extracted with SpotData software (CapitalBio, Beijing, China). The LOWESS normalization method was employed to normalize the logarithm transformed background corrected signal intensities within each slide, thereafter, normalized data were median-centered for each channel. The 4 values for each gene for each specimen (twice spotted) on microarrays and dye swap were averaged as a signal intensity for each gene. Thus the difference of M (HCCs with metastases) and N (HCCs without metastases) was estimated by the ln M/ref-ln N/ref and T test were performed in SAS to compare the mean difference between metastatic HCC and non-metastatic HCC transcripts. In total, 322 fold change and p values were obtained and subsequently converted to a set of q-values using the method of Storey and Tibshirani [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The largest q-value in a list of genes declared to be differentially expressed provides an estimate of the False Discovery Rate (FDR), which is used as adjustment for multiple T test.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR</title><p>The synthesis of the first-strand cDNA was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Target gene fragments were co-amplified with the internal control gene &#x003b2;-actin (991 bp) respectively. For the two co-amplified genes, amplification reaction was performed in the same tube comprising 10&#x000d7; PCR buffer, 25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 U Taq DNA polymerase and 10 pM of each of the flanking primers. The primer sequences were as follows: sense 5'- TGTACCAGCCAGAACACATG -3' and anti-sense 5'- CTGCTATCTTCACTCAGACC -3' for <italic>MSRA</italic>(621 bp); sense 5'- TGGGCATGGGTCAGAAGGA -3' and anti-sense 5'- AAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGG -3' for <italic>&#x003b2;-actin </italic>(991 bp).</p><p>The PCR profile was 7 min at 95&#x000b0;C followed by 26 cycles of 30 s at 94&#x000b0;C, 30 s at 57&#x000b0;C, 45 s at 72&#x000b0;C, and a final extension of 10 min at 72&#x000b0;C. The RT-PCR products were determined by electrophoresis on 1.5 % agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time PCR</title><p>All real-time PCR reactions were performed using a DNA Engine Opticon Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) and the SYBR Green PCR Core Reagents kit (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems).</p><p>Regular RT-PCR was performed before real-time PCR to determine the amplification condition to have a specific amplification. Then real-time PCR was done in a final volume of 20 &#x003bc;l with 2 &#x003bc;l template cDNA (with a concentration of 20 ng/&#x003bc;l) with 10 &#x003bc;l Quantitect SybrGreen Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 20 pM of each primer for target gene and housekeeping gene(<italic>GAPDH</italic>).

The Opticon Monitor Software package 1.02 was used for detection of fluorescent signals and Tm calculations. The transcripts of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>GAPDH</italic>) gene, a reference gene for high abundance gene transcripts, were quantitated as the endogenous control to normalize each test sample.</p><p>Results of real-time PCR were represented as Ct values, where Ct was a fractional value defined as the cycle number at which the sample fluorescent signal passes a fixed threshold above the baseline. &#x00394;Ct was the difference in the Ct values derived from the specific genes being assayed and <italic>GAPDH</italic>, the N-fold differential expression in a specific gene of a tumor sample was expressed as 2<sup>&#x00394;Ct </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>Protein was extracted by M-PER or T-PER (Pierce, USA), and protein concentrations were measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, USA).

After being blocked in TBST with 50 ml/L skim milk for 2 h at room temperature, membranes were incubated with the primary antibody anti-MSRA (Upstate, USA) for 2 h. Anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz, USA) was used as the endogenous control. The membranes were then washed thrice with TBST solution, followed by incubation for 1 h with HRP-linked secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz, USA) at room temperature.

Twenty-four hours after transient transfection by control (pIRES2-EGFP) and recombinant (pIRES2-EGFP- MSRA) plasmid vectors respectively, the transfected cells were treated with trypsin and harvested, washed, and resuspended in fresh complete medium. Identical numbers of empty or recombinant plasmid-transfected cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates to allow cells to form colonies. After 10 days incubation at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and stained with Giemsa stain. The cut-off point for colony size was &#x02265; 20 cells/colony. The number of colonies was counted within a field at 200&#x000d7; under a light microscope.

However, due to the great possibility of tumor recurrence, caused mainly by metastasis, only definitive subsets of patients have the chance of being cured. Much like other kinds of solid malignant tumors, HCC metastasis is a complex interacting process between the host and cancer cells, and is regulated by multiple genes. Understanding the genes responsible for either enhancing or suppressing this process would allow novel diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic applications in evolving and improving the clinical care of HCC patients. It has been demonstrated that more genetic aberrations exist during the process of cancer progression, invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These specific genomic aberrations could be used for mapping tumor suppressor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and provide clues for identifying metastasis-related genes. Many genes, such as <italic>nm23</italic>, <italic>KAI1</italic>, <italic>KISS1</italic>, <italic>MKK4</italic>, <italic>BrMS1 </italic>and so on, have been identified to have relations with the tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>In our previous studies, we found that HCC acquired a deletion on chromosome 8p as they progressed to metastatic stage, and that the chromosome 8p deletion may contribute to HCC metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This result was further confirmed by comparisons in nude mice models bearing human HCC with different metastatic potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Using genome-wide microsatellite analysis, the deletion on chromosome 8p was further proven to be related to progression and metastasis of HCC, and that 8p23.3 and 8p11.2 were two regions harboring metastasis-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Similar results were obtained in other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A deletion of chromosome 8p has also been shown to play an important role in the tumor progression and metastasis of many other kinds of human malignancies besides HCC including colorectal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], larynx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], renal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and lung cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Perhaps, 8p might harbor one or more tumor suppressor genes that are important in tumor progression and especially in the tumor metastasis of cancer including HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Several candidate tumor suppressor genes have been identified from 8p including <italic>DLC-1 </italic>(8p21.3-22) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], <italic>FEZ1 </italic>(8p22) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], liver-related putative tumor suppressor (<italic>LTPS</italic>) gene (8p23) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], <italic>PCM1</italic>(encoding a centrosomal protein) and <italic>DUSP4</italic>/<italic>MKP-2 </italic>(encoding a MAP kinase phosphatase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Alterations of these genes may occur as an early event in the development of cancer, and their association with metastasis is not confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] even though one very recent study indicated that <italic>FEZ1 </italic>may serve as a novel prognostic indicator for lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. It has been found that putative tumor suppressor genes that are mapped on chromosomes 8p21-22 may be involved in the metastasis of colorectal cancer. Allelic losses in these regions are possible risk factors for early lymph node metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Using a functional positional cloning strategy, Nihei et al. defined the region harboring the metastasis suppressor gene in 8p21-12, and localized it to a 60-kb cloned region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>To explore the new candidate metastatic suppressor of HCC, in our recent study on two HCC cell lines with different metastatic potentials, a novel metastatic suppressor gene, <italic>HTPAP</italic>, was identified on chromosome 8p12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, regarding the limitation of study on cell lines and the development of human genome sequencing, in this study, we constructed '8p specific microarrays', which contain all of the genes and ESTs on human chromosome 8p, and used a number of clinical specimens to identify the genes relating to the metastasis of HCC. A total of 322 genes or ESTs were found from the UniGene clusters in GenBank and used for the construction of 8p-specific microarrays, a different number from the previous work, in which 100 ESTs were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Most of the functional genes have not been completely annotated yet. Sixteen genes were found differentially expressed between metastatic HCC and non-metastatic HCC. Among these sixteen genes, ten genes were down-regulated including four well- annotated genes, <italic>MSRA, WHSC1L1, ARHGEF10 </italic>and <italic>NAT1</italic>. Although <italic>HTPAP </italic>gene was significantly down-regulated in HCC cell line with high metastatic potentials (data not shown), and was also down-regulated in the metastatic HCCs, the difference did not reach the statistical criteria in this study. This suggested that there may be differences between cell lines and clinical samples, particularly for the high-throughputs assays.</p><p><italic>MSRA </italic>was one of the four well- annotated genes that were significantly down-regulated in HCC with metastasis compared with those without metastasis; therefore, it was selected for the further confirmation and functional analysis.</p><p>The <italic>MSRA </italic>gene is located at chromosome 8p23.1. It has been found to express ubiquitously, with highest mRNA levels in adult kidney and cerebellum, followed by liver, heart ventricles, bone marrow and hippocampus. However, among the fetal tissues, the highest expression level was found in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In this study, both the mRNA and protein expression levels were decreased significantly in HCCs with metastasis. These results suggest that down-regulation of <italic>MSRA </italic>might play a role in the progression of HCC.</p><p>Furthermore, we investigated the effect of <italic>MSRA </italic>on the proliferation, colony formation and invasion ability of HCC cells in vitro. On the basis of high transfection efficiency, our studies showed that <italic>MSRA </italic>overexpression could slightly inhibit the proliferation ability of HCCLM6 cells, and more importantly, significantly inhibit the invasion ability. Although the <italic>in vivo </italic>experiments need to be done in order to further confirm the <italic>MSRA </italic>genes functions on HCC metastasis, these <italic>in vitro </italic>studies suggest that the <italic>MSRA </italic>gene might possess metastasis suppressor activity in HCC. Also, anti-tumor activity of MSRA was seen in a study about sulindac also[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>Reactive oxygen can cause damage to many cellular components via DNA base alterations, strand breaks, damaging tumor suppressor genes. Secondly, oxidation also enhances the expression of proto-oncogenes, and plays a key role in the development of human cancer. MSRA has been implicated in protecting cells against oxidative damage, which can reduce methionine sulfoxide in proteins from oxidative damage to methionine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. MSRA has a broad specificity for oxidated compounds that contain a methyl sulfoxide group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Oxidized methionine residues in different compartments are repaired by methionine sulfoxide reductases of different subcellular distribution regulated by alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>The possible roles of MSRA in the development and progression of cancer are not yet fully understood. Hanbauer et al found that calcium phospholipid-binding protein (CPBP, synonyms: KLF6, ZF9, COPEB) can bind to the <italic>MSRA </italic>promoter at a 39-bp sequence of its 3' end. CPBP is a homologue of elongation factor-1 gamma, it can enhance <italic>MSRA </italic>gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], while wild-type p53 can enhance the activity of KLF6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Abnormalities of the p53 gene caused, by a wide range of cellular stresses including hypoxia are the most common molecular abnormality in human cancer, which were found in more than 50% of malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. MSRA may be a point among the cyclic interconversion of MSRA, oxidation, p53 and CPBP. When oxidative damage occurs, p53, CPBP and MSRA are down-regulated in succession. Reactive oxygen can't be scavenged and promote the developing of malignant tumor. However, the real association of MSRA with oxidation, p53 and CPBP, the real mechanism of its effect on invasion and metastasis of HCC, are not clear yet, which deserves further study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, <italic>MSRA </italic>gene, located on chromosome 8p23.1, was identified as a candidate of metastasis suppressor for HCC through chromosome 8p-specific microarrays analysis in HCC clinical samples.
