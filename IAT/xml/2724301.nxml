Recent studies suggest AR is a master regulator of G1-S progression and possibly a licensing factor for DNA replication yet the mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here we report that AR targets the human <italic>Cdc6</italic> gene for transcriptional regulation. Cdc6 is an essential regulator of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells and its mRNA expression is inversely modulated by androgen or antiandrogen treatment in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells. AR binds at a distinct androgen-response element (ARE) in the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter that is functionally required for androgen-dependent <italic>Cdc6</italic> transcription. We found that peak AR occupancy at the novel ARE occurs during the G1/S phase concomitant with peak Cdc6 mRNA expression. We also identified several of the coactivators and corepressors involved in AR-dependent <italic>Cdc6</italic> transcriptional regulation <italic>in vivo</italic> and further characterized ligand-induced alterations in histone acetylation and methylation at the <italic>Cdc</italic>6 promoter. Significantly, AR silencing in prostate cancer cells markedly decreases <italic>Cdc6</italic> expression and androgen-dependent cellular proliferation. Collectively, our results suggest that <italic>Cdc6</italic> is a key regulatory target for AR and provide new insights into the mechanisms of prostate cancer cell proliferation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Androgens are steroid hormones responsible for the development and functional maintenance of male reproductive and accessory sex tissues. They exert their physiologic actions by binding to the androgen receptor (AR), a 110-kDa member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). AR mediates androgen action by binding to specific DNA sequences termed androgen response elements (ARE) found within promoter or enhancer regions of AR-target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4 B5">2&#x02013;5</xref>). When bound with androgen, AR can activate target gene transcription by recruiting distinct coregulatory factors including enzymes that covalently modify histones and remodel chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), as well as the Mediator complex that directly interfaces with the RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) basal machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). When bound with antiandrogenic compounds, AR can repress target gene transcription by recruiting negative coregulatory factors termed corepressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Although numerous AR coactivators and corepressors have been reported and characterized, many of the genes directly bound and regulated by AR <italic>in vivo</italic> remain poorly defined.</p><p>Significantly, AR plays a pivotal role in the onset and progression of prostate cancer by promoting the growth and proliferation of prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Mechanistic investigations have revealed that AR acts as a master regulator of G1-S phase progression in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and that AR protein is degraded at mitosis during each cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). These findings suggest that AR may be acting as a licensing factor for DNA replication in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells, and that mitotic AR degradation is required to license a new round of DNA replication. Treatment options for prostate cancer include androgen-ablation therapy that initially triggers apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest of prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>). Paradoxically, nearly all invasive or metastatic prostate cancers eventually progress into a fatal androgen-independent disease, yet most of these cancers continue to express AR and remain dependent on AR for growth and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Therefore, identifying the specific genes regulated by AR will be critical for understanding the mechanisms of androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cell growth and proliferation.</p><p>Cdc6 is an essential regulator of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Along with a subset of other key replication factors, Cdc6 helps form a pre-replication complex at the origins of DNA replication early in G1 phase thereby &#x02018;licensing&#x02019; these sites to bind DNA polymerase and initiate DNA replication during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The expression and functional activity of Cdc6 is tightly regulated in a cell-cycle-dependent manner thus ensuring that the entire genome is replicated only once in each cell division. Indeed, <italic>Cdc6</italic> is considered an oncogene and its deregulated expression can lead to under- or over-replication, DNA damage and genetic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In mammalian cells, <italic>Cdc6</italic> expression peaks during the G1/S transition and is transcriptionally regulated in a cell-cycle- and E2F-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>). Given AR's presumptive role as a licensing factor for DNA replication, it has been proposed that Cdc6 and possibly other replication factors might be regulatory targets for AR-signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Interestingly, when synchronized prostate cancer LNCaP cells are treated with the antiandrogenic compound bicalutamide (Casodex), the cells fail to enter S phase and concomitantly downregulate Cdc6 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Furthermore, AR binds at the human <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> and androgens were found to regulate <italic>Cdc6</italic> gene expression in AR-positive prostate cancer cells and xenografts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated whether AR targets the human <italic>Cdc6</italic> gene for transcriptional regulation in prostate cancer cells in a cell-cycle-dependent manner. Using androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells, we found that Cdc6 mRNA and protein expression is activated or repressed in the presence of androgen or antiandrogen, respectively. We identified a 15 bp palindromic ARE in the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter (&#x02212;734 bp upstream of the transcription start site) and show that AR occupies this site <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mutagenesis of the ARE abolishes AR binding as well as androgen-dependent <italic>Cdc6</italic> transcription. Intriguingly, and consistent with its presumptive role as a DNA replication licensing factor, we show that peak occupancy of AR at the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter occurs during the G1/S phase of the cell cycle, concomitant with peak Cdc6 mRNA expression. Silencing AR expression markedly decreases both Cdc6 expression and androgen-dependent cellular proliferation. Significantly, we also identified several specific coactivators and corepressors involved in AR-dependent <italic>Cdc6</italic> transcriptional regulation and further characterized androgen- and antiandrogen-induced alterations in histone H3 acetylation and methylation patterns at the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter. Collectively, our results suggest that <italic>Cdc6</italic> is a key regulatory target gene in androgen-responsive prostate cells and may have important implications for prostate cancer cell growth and proliferation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). 1532T-f:AR cells were generated and cultured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).

The complex binds to DNA-bound NRs and promotes the assembly and activation of RNA pol II and its associated factors at core promoters and may also play a role in facilitating the recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes. A single subunit of the complex termed MED1 targets Mediator to AR and other NRs in the presence of their cognate ligand. A recent study found that MED1 was indispensable for androgen-dependent transcription of the <italic>prostate specific antigen</italic> (<italic>PSA</italic>) gene in LNCaP cells and that RNAi silencing of MED1 was accompanied by a significant reduction in RNA pol II recruitment at the <italic>PSA</italic> gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).

Moreover, the androgen-dependent binding of other Mediator subunits (MED6, MED14 and MED17) support the notion that AR recruits the entire Mediator complex to the <italic>Cdc6</italic> gene promoter. Significantly, and consistent with Mediator's role in facilitating the recruitment of RNA pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), we also detected DHT-induced binding of RNA pol II at the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and E).</p><p>Histone acetylation, a process dynamically controlled by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), has a profound impact on chromatin structure and consequently gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In general, acetylation of lysine residues on histones H3 and H4 facilitates transcriptional activation whereas deacetylation reverses this effect. The p160/SRC family of coactivators interact with NRs in a ligand-dependent manner and enhance their transcriptional transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Two members of this family, p160/SRC-1 and p160/SRC-3, possess intrinsic HAT activity and bind and work together with other more potent HATs (CBP, p300 and PCAF) to acetylate histones. Interestingly, we detected strong DHT-dependent recruitment of both p160/SRC-1 and p160/SRC-3 at the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter that was concomitantly associated with an increase in histone H3 acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, D and E). By contrast, treatment of LNCaP cells with the antiandrogen Casodex triggered a pronounced decrease in histone H3 acetylation and was accompanied by the recruitment of HDACs-1, -2 and -3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). The NR corepressors NCoR and SMRT, which directly bind to AR in the presence of antiandrogens, are thought to recruit HDACs to AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Notably in this regard, we observed strong Casodex-dependent recruitment of SMRT, but not NCoR, to the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Although the recruitment of SMRT is consistent with transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), the data contrasts earlier studies showing strong Casodex-dependent recruitment of both NCoR and SMRT at the <italic>PSA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41 B42 B43">41&#x02013;43</xref>) and suggest that structural differences between the <italic>PSA</italic> and <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter/enhancer regions differentially influence AR&#x02013;corepressor complex recruitment and binding.</p><p>Histone methylation has emerged as an equally important modification linked to both transcriptional activation and repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In particular, methylation of histone H3-lysine 4 (H3K4) is associated with active transcription, while methylation of histone H3-lysine 9 (H3K9) is associated with gene silencing and heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Furthermore, methylation of histone H3 arginine residues (R2, R17 and R26) are covalent modifications associated with ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by NRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Strikingly, we observed a marked DHT-dependent decrease in H3K9 tri-methylation at the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter as well as a modest increase in H3R17 di-methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D and E), both marks consistent with <italic>Cdc6</italic> transcriptional activation. By contrast, we failed to observe any significant increase in H3K4 methylation following addition of DHT. Collectively, these findings suggest that in addition to Mediator and HAT-containing coactivators, androgen-bound AR may also recruit H3K9-demethylase and H3-arginine-methyltransferase activities to the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter (see &#x02018;Discussion&#x02019; section). Conversely, antiandrogen-bound AR recruits SMRT&#x02013;HDAC complexes that deacetylate histones at the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter and facilitate gene silencing.</p></sec><sec><title>AR promotes cell-cycle-dependent Cdc6 mRNA expression in prostate cancer cells</title><p>AR is thought to act as a master regulator of G1-S phase progression in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).

Given the functional importance of Cdc6 in DNA replication, our results implicate the <italic>Cdc6</italic> gene as a key regulatory target in AR-signaling pathways and provide new insights into AR's presumptive role as a master regulator of G1-S phase progression. Indeed, given that AR-signaling pathways become aberrantly hyperactivated in neoplastic prostate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), it is conceivable that deregulated <italic>Cdc6</italic> gene expression may promote prostate cancer cell growth and progression. Secondly, we have identified several specific coactivators and corepressors involved in AR-dependent <italic>Cdc6</italic> transcriptional regulation and have further characterized androgen- and antiandrogen-induced alterations in histone H3 acetylation and methylation patterns at the <italic>Cdc</italic>6 promoter. Thus, the findings here have important implications for the fundamental molecular mechanisms used by AR to regulate transcription.</p><p>Considering the fact that other steroid NRs (e.g. the progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors) are potent regulators of cellular proliferation and G1-S phase progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), it is interesting to note that the ARE found in the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter (AGAACAnnnTATTCT) constitutes a near perfect class I steroid hormone response element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Thus, other NRs in unrelated steroid hormone-responsive tissues might also target <italic>Cdc6</italic> for transcriptional regulation. Consistent with this notion, we observed a modest yet reproducible ligand-dependent activation of a <italic>Cdc6</italic>-ARE reporter gene via the glucocorticoid receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F). Binding sites for the GATA and ETS families of transcription factors have been identified proximal to AREs in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and both types of factors have been proposed to facilitate AR binding to the ARE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Interestingly, both GATA and ETS-binding sites were detected in the <italic>Cdc6</italic> gene promoter just downstream of the ARE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Although we were unable to discern a functional requirement for either factor in the studies here, it remains plausible that GATA and/or ETS factors cooperate with AR in mediating the <italic>Cdc6</italic> androgen response <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Significantly, we identified several of the transcriptional coregulatory factors involved in AR-dependent transcriptional regulation of the <italic>Cdc6</italic> gene and further characterized androgen- and antiandrogen-induced alterations in histone H3 acetylation and methylation patterns at the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter. Our findings show that in the presence of androgens, AR recruits Mediator and p160/SRC-HAT complexes to the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter, which in turn facilitate histone acetylation at the promoter region and the recruitment of RNA pol II. Contrarily, in the presence of antiandrogens, AR recruits SMRT&#x02013;HDAC complexes to the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter that in turn facilitate histone deacetylation. We also observed a pronounced androgen-dependent decrease in H3K9 tri-methylation at the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter as well as a modest increase in H3R17 di-methylation, both marks consistent with transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). These findings suggest that in addition to the aforementioned coactivators, androgen-bound AR also recruits the histone H3-arginine methyltransferase CARM1 (which specifically facilitates H3R17 methylation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) and the histone H3-lysine demethylase JMJD2C (which specifically demethylates H3K9-3me) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Importantly, both CARM1 and JMJD2C have been previously shown to associate with AR and enhance AR-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with our findings showing that AR silencing in LNCaP cells decreases Cdc6 expression, inhibits androgen-induced cell growth and triggers G0 and G1 cell-cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), we have likewise found that MED1 silencing in LNCaP cells also inhibits Cdc6 expression and decreases androgen-dependent progression into G2/M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). These data, together with the ChIP findings discussed above, suggest that MED1-Mediator plays a particularly important coactivator role in AR-dependent transcriptional activation of <italic>Cdc6</italic>. Indeed, MED1 is indispensable for AR-dependent transcription of the <italic>PSA</italic> gene in LNCaP cells and MED1 silencing was accompanied by a significant reduction in RNA pol II recruitment at the <italic>PSA</italic> gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Thus in addition to the covalent histone modifications and chromatin remodeling events fulfilled by other types of AR coactivators, MED1-Mediator likely plays a rate-limiting role in facilitating the assembly and activation of RNA pol II and its associated factors at <italic>Cdc6</italic> and other AR target genes.</p><p>A flow cytometry approach was recently utilized to show that AR is degraded at the M phase of each cell cycle in different prostate cancer cell lines thus suggesting that mitotic AR degradation may be a requirement to license a new round of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Consistent with a presumptive role as a DNA replication-licensing factor, we found that AR levels in LNCaP cells were significantly higher at G1/S than at G2/M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, we found that peak occupancy of AR at the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter occurs during the G1/S phase of the cell cycle, concomitant with peak Cdc6 mRNA expression, and when LNCaP cells were transfected with AR siRNA, there was notable decrease in Cdc6 mRNA levels at G1/S. These findings suggest that AR cooperates with E2F to promote cell-cycle-dependent <italic>Cdc6</italic> gene expression. Interestingly, it has been reported that AR can directly interact with Rb proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Thus, in addition to the transactivation mechanisms outlined above, AR might also form complexes with Rb at the <italic>Cdc6</italic> promoter that alleviate inhibitory constraints on promoter-bound E2F factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In sum, our results suggest that <italic>Cdc6</italic> is a key-regulatory target gene in androgen-sensitive prostate cells and help clarify the molecular role of AR during G1-S phase progression of the mammalian cell cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp510/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp510_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkp510_nar-00360-x-2009-File003.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> grant (<award-id>DK054030</award-id> to J.D.F.).
