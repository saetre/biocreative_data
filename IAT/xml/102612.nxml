The polyadenylation reaction is performed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> mainly by the enzyme poly(A) polymerase I (PAP I). In order to understand the molecular mechanism of RNA polyadenylation in bacteria, we characterized the biochemical properties of this reaction <italic>in vitro</italic> using the purified enzyme. Unlike the PAP from yeast nucleus, which is specific for ATP, <italic>E.coli</italic> PAP I can use all four nucleotide triphosphates as substrates for addition of long ribohomopolymers to RNA. PAP I displays a high binding activity to poly(U), poly(C) and poly(A) ribohomopolymers, but not to poly(G). The 3&#x02032;-ends of most of the mRNA molecules in bacteria are characterized by a stem&#x02013;loop structure. We show here that <italic>in vitro</italic> PAP I activity is inhibited by a stem&#x02013;loop structure. A tail of two to six nucleotides located 3&#x02032; to the stem&#x02013;loop structure is sufficient to overcome this inhibition. These results suggest that the stem&#x02013;loop structure located in most of the mRNA 3&#x02032;-ends may function as an inhibitor of polyadenylation and degradation of the corresponding RNA molecule. However, RNA 3&#x02032;-ends produced by endonucleolytic cleavage by RNase E in single-strand regions of mRNA molecules may serve as efficient substrates for polyadenylation that direct these molecules for rapid exonucleolytic degradation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Polyadenylation has been believed for a long time to be exclusively associated with eukaryotic mRNAs. Other RNAs, such as rRNAs and tRNAs, as well as RNAs in prokaryotes, were not considered to be polyadenylated. Indeed, most of these RNA molecules do not harbor a poly(A) tail at their 3&#x02032;-end. Nevertheless, poly(A) tails have recently been detected in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c8">8</xref>). The polyadenylated RNA accounts for only a very small fraction of the RNA population in the cell. This fraction increased several-fold in mutant bacterial cells that lack exoribonuclease(s) activity. On the other hand, in mutants in which RNA polyadenylation was inhibited due to the lack of poly(A) polymerase, the half-life of RNA molecules increased dramatically (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c11">11</xref>). These results suggested that in contrast to the nucleus and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, where the poly(A) tail is important for stability, maturation and translation of mRNA, the addition of poly(A) tails in bacterial mRNAs promotes their degradation. Taken together, polyadenylation of RNA molecules is part of the molecular mechanism of RNA degradation in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c11">11</xref>). Similarly to bacterial cells, polyadenylation of RNA molecules during the degradation process has been described in chloroplasts and in mitochondria, cellular organelles that are believed to have arisen in an evolutionary manner from a prokaryotic ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c15">15</xref>).</p><p>The enzyme poly(A) polymerase I (PAP I) adds adenylate residues to the 3&#x02032;-ends of RNAs using ATP as donor. It was purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells in the early 1960s, well before the discovery of poly(A) in eukaryotic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c16">16</xref>). In <italic>E.coli</italic>, PAP I is a monomer of ~55 kDa, requiring Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c17">17</xref>) and displaying some sequence homology to other poly(A) polymerases from yeast and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c19">19</xref>). In addition, it shows significant amino acid sequence homology to tRNA nucleotidyl transferase, a CCA-adding enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c22">22</xref>). Another poly(A) polymerase enzyme, PAP II, has been identified in <italic>E.coli</italic>, but its role in RNA metabolism remains to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c23">23</xref>). In contrast to the mechanism in eukaryotes, <italic>E.coli</italic> polyadenylation apparently does not depend on recognition sequences and does not require a multiprotein complex for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c2">2</xref>). The polyadenylation of RNA molecules in <italic>E.coli</italic> and chloroplasts occurs at a variety of sites, including the mature 3&#x02032;-end, but is most certainly an intermediate in processing and decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c24">24</xref>). PAP I does not purify with RNase E, PNPase, DEAE helicase and enolase in the degradosome, a high molecular weight protein complex that is believed to be important in RNA processing and degradation. Nevertheless, a recent publication suggested a transient interaction between the components of the degradosome, RNase E and DEAD RNA helicases, and PAP I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c22">22</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we describe the biochemical characterization of the activity of <italic>E.coli</italic> PAP I. We found that the enzyme activity <italic>in vitro</italic> is not specific for ATP and that the protein binds poly(A), poly(U) and poly(C), but not poly(G), with high affinity. In addition, we show that a stem&#x02013;loop structure inhibits the polyadenylation reaction and that the addition of 2&#x02013;4 nt 3&#x02032; to the stem&#x02013;loop overcomes this inhibitory effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> transcription of RNA</title><p>The plasmids used for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of parts of the mRNAs of the spinach chloroplast genes <italic>psbA</italic> (encoding the D1 protein of photosystem II) and <italic>petD</italic> (encoding subunit IV of the <italic>b</italic><italic><sub>6</sub></italic><italic>f</italic> complex) have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c25">25</xref>).

To generate RNA molecules corresponding to the spinach chloroplast <italic>petD</italic> and the <italic>E.coli thrA</italic> mature 3&#x02032;-ends (used in the experiment described in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f4">4</xref>), the synthetic molecules described above were incubated with chloroplast soluble protein extract in an <italic>in vitro</italic> 3&#x02032;-end processing reaction, as previously described, and the <italic>in vitro</italic> processed product was re-isolated by elution from a denaturing gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c25">25</xref>). In these RNA molecules, the 3&#x02032;-end was localized to the end of the stem&#x02013;loop structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c27">27</xref>). The stem&#x02013;loop structure of the <italic>malE</italic>&#x02013;<italic>malF</italic> intergenic region was PCR amplified using two oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotides 1&#x02013;17 and 106&#x02013;94 of the intergenic region (GenBank accession no.

A single mutation A&#x02192;C was introduced at the fifth nucleotide of the stem in order to strengthen the stem structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c28">28</xref>). The T7 promoter sequence was included in the first oligonucleotide in order to drive <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. Two, four or six cytosine residues were added to the second oligonucleotide to generate RNA molecules with the addition of two, four or six residues 3&#x02032; to the stem&#x02013;loop structure, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f5">5</xref>.

Following incubation, the RNA was isolated and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c25">25</xref>). For the experiment described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f3">3</xref>, trace labeled RNA was incubated with PAP I in&#x000a0;the&#x000a0;presence of 0.5 mM ATP or 0.5 mM of all nucleotides and 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> c.p.m. &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP.

Briefly, 3 fmol of RNA (240 000 c.p.m.) were incubated with 16.5 ng of PAP I in 15 &#x000b5;l of buffer E.

Following 1.8 J UV irradiation in a UV crosslinking apparatus (Hoefer Inc.), the RNA was digested by 10 &#x000b5;g RNase A at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h and the proteins were fractionated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE.

This preparation apparently consisted of one polypeptide requiring no additional purification (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f1">1</xref>). Purified PAP from yeast was obtained from US Biochemicals. SDS&#x02013;PAGE fractionation and detection of PAP I by immunoblotting with specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c20">20</xref>) were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c30">30</xref>). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>PAP I activity <italic>in vitro</italic> is not specific for ATP</title><p>In order to analyze whether or not PAP I activity is specific for ATP, we analyzed the <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of purified PAP I using different nucleotides as substrates. The purified PAP I consisted of one 55 kDa polypeptide that reacted with specific antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f1">1</xref>A and B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c20">20</xref>). When the purified protein was incubated with <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA in the presence of ATP, the RNA was rapidly polyadenylated, similar to the reaction of PAP isolated from yeast (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f1">1</xref>C). When purified PAP I was incubated with synthetic RNA as a substrate and each of the nucleotides was added, elongation activity was detected not only with ATP but also with GTP, UTP and CTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f2">2</xref>A). Under the experimental conditions used, in the case of ATP and CTP elongation of RNA by ~500 nt was achieved within the first 5 min of incubation. This may suggest a processive activity of PAP I with these nucleotides, i.e. the enzyme, when bound to an RNA molecule, adds nucleotides without disconnecting from the elongated RNA between addition of each nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c2">2</xref>). When using GTP or UTP, the length and quantity of the elongated RNA molecules increased during incubation, suggesting that either the PAP I activity using these nucleotides is not processive, or that the affinity for ATP and CTP is much lower (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f2">2</xref>A). Indeed, when PAP I was incubated with increasing concentrations of ATP, saturation of the activity was observed using 0.5&#x02013;1.0 mM ATP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f2">2</xref>B). However, when using GTP as substrate, no saturation was obtained even at a concentration of 2 mM and most of the RNA was not polymerized (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f2">2</xref>B). The activity of yeast PAP under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions has been previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c31">31</xref>). This enzyme can add about 15 G residues and only a few U or C residues, but about 600 A nucleotides. Similar results were obtained in this work under the same experimental conditions for <italic>E.coli</italic> PAP I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f2">2</xref>C). Taken together, these results show that under the experimental conditions used here, whereby yeast PAP disclosed specific activity for ATP, the <italic>E.coli</italic> enzyme can use all four nucleotides. Next, we asked whether the enzyme, when incubated together with all four nucleotides, incorporates only adenosines or the other nucleotides as well. To this end, non-radioactive RNA was incubated with PAP I with the addition of either radioactive ATP or the four nucleotides including radioactive ATP. Following the polymerization reaction, the RNA molecules were digested with RNase A and RNase T1, which degrade the RNA molecule following G, U and C. Only elongated radioactive RNA was observed when ATP alone was used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f3">3</xref>, lane 2). However, short RNA molecules were observed when all four nucleotides were used, indicating that other nucleotides, in addition to adenosines, were incorporated into the polymerized molecules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f3">3</xref>, lane 3). Taking into account that mostly homologous poly(A) tails were obtained using RT&#x02013;PCR of polyadenylated RNA molecules, why this enzyme activity is specific for ATP in bacterial cells remains to be elucidated (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>Binding affinities of PAP I to ribohomopolymers</title><p>One possibility for the differences in PAP I specificity in the cell compared to <italic>in vitro</italic> may be attributed to the binding affinity of the protein for different RNA molecules. In order to determine the binding affinity of PAP I for different ribohomopolymer RNA molecules, we carried out UV crosslinking competition experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c32">32</xref>). Isolated PAP I was incubated with &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;UTP-labeled RNA corresponding to the spinach chloroplast gene <italic>psbA</italic>. The RNA&#x0002f;protein mixture was UV crosslinked, followed by digestion of the unbound RNA with RNase. The label transferred from the RNA to protein was then analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and autoradiography. Increased amounts of a competitor, a ribohomopolymer in this experiment, were used to define the <italic>I</italic><sub>50</sub> as the competitor concentration required to reduce the UV crosslinking signal to 50&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c32">32</xref>). The results revealed a similar affinity of PAP I for poly(A), poly(U) and poly(C) and a reduced binding affinity for poly(G) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f4">4</xref>). With poly(U), poly(A) and poly(C), about 50 times competitor excess reduced binding by 50&#x00025;, whereas with poly(G) the <italic>I</italic><sub>50</sub> was more than 250 times competitor excess (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f4">4</xref>). On the one hand, these results are in agreement with those presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f2">2</xref>, showing that PAP I was able to polymerase the four nucleotides and not just adenosine. On the other hand, as previously described, only polyadenylated RNA molecules were found in bacteria by RT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c10">10</xref>). Therefore, the specificity of the polyadenylation reaction in bacterial cells is not due to the intrinsic specificity of PAP I or a high binding affinity for poly(A).</p></sec><sec><title>RNAs terminating with a stem&#x02013;loop structure are poorly polyadenylated by <italic>E.coli</italic> PAP I</title><p>In <italic>E.coli</italic>, polyadenylation of mRNA was detected both at the 3&#x02032;-end and for the internal degradation products of endo- and exoribonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c24">24</xref>). In the chloroplast, where the RNA polyadenylation and degradation mechanisms are very similar to those of bacteria, a considerably greater number of polyadenylation sites were found inside the mRNA sequence and not at the mature 3&#x02032;-end, which is characterized by a stem&#x02013;loop structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c25">25</xref>). These polyadenylation sites were found to be the proximal products of endonucleolytic cleavage of mature full-length mRNA. Based on these results, it has been suggested that one of the functions of the stem&#x02013;loop structure located at the 3&#x02032;-end of most chloroplast genes is to prevent polyadenylation, which is followed by degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c12">12</xref>). Most of the <italic>E.coli</italic> mRNAs are also characterized by a stem&#x02013;loop structure at the 3&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c9">9</xref>). In order to determine whether PAP I activity is modulated by the structure of the RNA, RNA molecules in which the stem&#x02013;loop structure was located either at the 3&#x02032;-end or in the middle of the molecule were tested in an <italic>in vitro</italic> polyadenylation assay. When these molecules, corresponding to the mature 3&#x02032;-end of the spinach chloroplast gene <italic>petD</italic> or the <italic>E.coli</italic> gene <italic>thrA</italic>, were tested as substrates for PAP I, no polyadenylation was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f5">5</xref>). However, the same RNA molecules in which the stem&#x02013;loop was not located at the 3&#x02032;-end were efficiently polyadenylated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f5">5</xref>). These results suggest that, similarly to the situation in the chloroplast, <italic>E.coli</italic> PAP I is inhibited by a stem&#x02013;loop structure located at the 3&#x02032;-end.</p><p>We then wanted to determine what is the minimal number of nucleotides located 3&#x02032; to the stem&#x02013;loop structure that is necessary to make the RNA a good substrate for PAP I. To do so, we constructed several RNA molecules differing in the number of nucleotides extending 3&#x02032; of the stem&#x02013;loop that could serve as a &#x02018;platform&#x02019; for PAP I. We used the long and stable <italic>malE</italic>&#x02013;<italic>malF</italic> stem&#x02013;loop structure, in which the nucleotide at position 5 from the base of the stem was modified from A to C in order to ensure stabilization of the stem structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c28">28</xref>). To this long and stable stem&#x02013;loop structured RNA molecule, we added 2, 4 or 6 cytosine residues at the 3&#x02032;-end. Cytosine was chosen over other nucleotides since visual inspection revealed that other nucleotides can potentially hybridize to the RNA molecule and thus not act as the &#x02018;toe hold&#x02019; supposedly required for PAP I activity. Each of the radioactively labeled RNA molecules described above was incubated with <italic>E.coli</italic> PAP I and ATP following an analysis by denatured PAGE. The results showed that, similarly to other RNA molecules terminating with a stem&#x02013;loop structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f5">5</xref>), the <italic>malE</italic>&#x02013;<italic>malF</italic> 3&#x02032;-end was hardly adenylated by PAP I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f6">6</xref>, left). However, the addition of a &#x02018;platform&#x02019; of two C residues to the stem increased the efficiency of the polyadenylation reaction several-fold and the addition of four and six cytosines resulted in an activity similar to that obtained with non-structured RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f6">6</xref>). These results demonstrated that a very short single-stranded &#x02018;toe hold&#x02019;, comprised of two or more nucleotides, is required for PAP I to efficiently polyadenylate an RNA molecule.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our work has demonstrated that <italic>E.coli</italic> PAP I, as a purified single protein, does not use adenosine preferentially as a substrate. In addition, it does not display a higher binding affinity for poly(A). These results were somewhat unexpected for two reasons. First, yeast PAP under the same experimental conditions displays specificity for adenosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c31">31</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd227f2">2</xref>). Second, when polyadenylated RNAs from bacterial cells were cloned and sequenced using RT&#x02013;PCR, poly(A) tails were mainly obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c2">2</xref> and reference therein), although poly(A) tails containing several nucleotides other than adenosine were obtained from cells during the stationary growth stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c33">33</xref>). Therefore, it seems that PAP I activity in bacterial cells mostly favors adenosines. On the other hand, polyadenylated RNAs that include, in addition to adenosines, ~25&#x00025; guanosines as well as other nucleotides were isolated from the chloroplasts of higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c25">25</xref>). However, a purified fraction of PAP I from chloroplasts has not yet been analyzed for specificity for different nucleotides. What makes PAP I specific for adenosines inside the bacterial cell? Although the concentration of adenosine is higher than other nucleotides, this does not seem to account for the specificity of PAP I since RNA polymerase, for example, successfully uses all four nucleotides, and nucleotidyltransferase uses CTP in addition to ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c19">19</xref>). It is possible that interaction with other proteins imposes the specificity of PAP I for adenosines. Recently, a possible weak and temporary interaction of PAP I with RNase E and the degradosome complex was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c22">22</xref>). Eukaryotic PAP is involved in a multiprotein complex with other protein factors that, in several cases, are required for specific and proper activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c34">34</xref>). Clearly, more work is required to reveal the answer to the question why PAP I activity is specific for adenosine in the bacterial cell.</p><p>In addition to the PAP I used in this work, at least one more PAP, the product of the <italic>f310</italic> gene, has been identified in <italic>E.coli</italic> cells, and named PAP II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c23">23</xref>). These two enzymes seem to be dispensable, since even when one of the genes is inactivated the cells are still viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c23">23</xref>). Inactivation of both genes is lethal. The question as to what the biological functions of each enzyme are and whether or not these functions are complementary, different or the same, as well as the nature of the specificity of PAP&#x000a0;II, are still under investigation.</p><p>Another bacterial enzyme exhibiting polyadenylation of RNA when assayed <italic>in vitro</italic> is polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c35">35</xref>). PNPase and RNase II are the two major exoribonucleases involved in the process of RNA degradation in bacterial cells. PNPase is included in the degradosome together with the endoribonuclease RNase E, a RNA helicase and enolase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c11">11</xref>). When incubated <italic>in vitro</italic>, isolated PNPase displaces polymerase activity for all four nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c35">35</xref>). However, it is believed that PNPase activity in the bacterial cell exclusively degrades RNA and polyadenylation is performed only (or almost exclusively) by the PAP enzymes and mostly by PAP I. This assumption is based on the fact that inactivation of the <italic>pnp</italic> gene, encoding PNPase, leads to an increase in RNA half-life and in accumulation of polyadenylated RNA in the bacterial cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c9">9</xref>). Inactivation of PAP I resulted in a 50&#x00025; reduction in RNA polyadenylation and inactivation of both PAP I and PAP II was lethal, indicating that PNPase cannot replace the function of PAP in the cell (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c2">2</xref>). It is possible that the strict activity of PNPase as an exoribonuclease and not as a polymerase in the bacterial cell, in contrast to the situation under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions, is due to the relatively high concentration of phosphate in the bacterial cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c35">35</xref>). However, other possibilities, such as modulation of the activity by interaction with other proteins, cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Another observation reported here is that a RNA molecule terminating with a stem&#x02013;loop structure is a poor substrate for PAP I. Nevertheless, the addition of two or more nucleotides 3&#x02032; to the stem&#x02013;loop structure allows efficient polyadenylation. Most of the mRNA molecules in bacterial cells are characterized by a stem&#x02013;loop structure at their 3&#x02032;-end and many also contain a tail of several nucleotides located 3&#x02032; of the stem&#x02013;loop structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c10">10</xref>). For example, tRNAs that have a CCA &#x02018;toe hold&#x02019; are known to be good substrates for PAP I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c22">22</xref>). An RNA terminating with a stem&#x02013;loop structure that is protected both from exonucleolytic degradation and polyadenylation can be produced as a result of exonucleolytic processing of a longer precursor by PNPase or RNase II. In this case, endonucleolytic cleavage by RNase E or another endoribonuclease will be necessary to continue degradation of the RNA. Polyadenylated tails were obtained at the 3&#x02032;-end of several RNAs, such as RNA I, <italic>Sok</italic> antisense RNA, <italic>rpsO</italic> and <italic>lpp</italic> RNAs. All terminate with a stem&#x02013;loop structure but have an additional 1&#x02013;3 nt 3&#x02032; of the stem&#x02013;loop. A detailed analysis of the polyadenylation sites located at both the 3&#x02032;-end and internal RNase E cleavage sites was performed on the <italic>rpsO</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c24">24</xref>). The 3&#x02032;-end of this gene is characterized by a stem&#x02013;loop structure and an additional 3 nt. In bacterial cells expressing RNase E, polyadenylation was observed more at internal cleavage sites than at the mature 3&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c24">24</xref>). This is also the case with <italic>psbA</italic> RNA in the chloroplast, in which RNA polyadenylation and degradation seem to be similar to those in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c25">25</xref>). These results suggest the possibility that one of the functions of the stem&#x02013;loop structures located at the 3&#x02032;-end of bacterial genes is stabilization of the corresponding RNA by serving as poor substrates for PAP I. Endonucleolytic cleavage of the transcript by RNase E generates a better substrate for PAP I, leading to the cascade of events of polyadenylation and exonucleolytic degradation.</p><p>One question that remains open regarding the mechanism of RNA degradation in bacteria is why PAP I is not a stable component of the degradosome. If degradation of an RNA molecule starts with endonucleolytic cleavage by RNase E, followed by polyadenylation, which attracts the exonuclease to the poly(A) tail, then why are the exo- and endoribonucleases associated with each other and not with PAP I? Several models have been suggested to answer this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c10">10</xref>). The RNA helicase is believed to be located in the degradosome in order to release the stem of stem&#x02013;loop structures paving the way for PNPase. It is also possible that while unwinding the stem, a single-stranded RNA is formed, enabling PAP I to polyadenylate it, thus tagging it for exonucleolytic degradation. This hypothesis is strengthened by the recent observation of a possible interaction between PAP I and the degradosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd227c22">22</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd227f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Characterization of <italic>E.coli</italic> PAP I.
