We found that the ankyrin-binding motif of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 that determines channel concentration at the AIS depends on a glutamate residue (E1111), but also on several serine residues (S1112, S1124, and S1126). We showed that phosphorylation of these residues by protein kinase CK2 (CK2) regulates Na<sub>v</sub> channel interaction with ankyrins. Furthermore, we observed that CK2 is highly enriched at the AIS and the nodes of Ranvier in vivo. An ion channel chimera containing the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 ankyrin-binding motif perturbed endogenous sodium channel accumulation at the AIS, whereas phosphorylation-deficient chimeras did not. Finally, inhibition of CK2 activity reduced sodium channel accumulation at the AIS of neurons. In conclusion, CK2 contributes to sodium channel organization by regulating their interaction with ankyrin G.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Sandrine Pereira's present address is Institut National de la Sant&#x000e9; et de la Recherche M&#x000e9;dicale, Unit&#x000e9; Mixte de Recherche 910, Universit&#x000e9; de la M&#x000e9;diterran&#x000e9;e, Facult&#x000e9; de M&#x000e9;decine secteur-Timone, Marseille 13385, France.</p></fn><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: AIS, axonal initial segment; CK2, protein kinase CK2; CNS, central nervous system; DIV, days in vitro; DMAT, 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo1<italic>H</italic>-benzimidazole; MAP2, microtubule-associated protein 2; MBD, membrane-binding domain; MBD-ank, MBD-ankyrin; PNS, peripheral nervous system; SPR, surface plasmon resonance.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>In neurons, action potentials are generated at the axonal initial segment (AIS), and in myelinated axons, their saltatory conduction occurs via the nodes of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stuart et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kole et al., 2008</xref>). These processes require a precise distribution of voltage-gated sodium channels that accumulate at high density in these two highly specialized axonal subdomains, defined by the segregation of the cytoskeletal adaptor complex ankyrin G/&#x003b2;IV spectrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 1998</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salzer, 2003</xref>).

Recently, several additional new components have been shown to accumulate at the AIS and nodes, such as members of the nuclear factor &#x003ba;B signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schultz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Politi et al., 2007</xref>), growth factors FHF2 and FHF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wittmack et al., 2004</xref>), and extracellular matrix components aggrecan and brevican (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruckner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">John et al., 2006</xref>). The implications of these newly characterized components in AIS and node assembly, maintenance, or function are still unknown.</p><p>Although they share a common subset of proteins, the assembly of AIS and nodes of Ranvier has been shown to differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dzhashiashvili et al., 2007</xref>). The formation of the AIS depends on intrinsic properties of the neuron and occurs during the early steps in establishment of neuronal polarity in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alessandri-Haber et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boiko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). Genetic, biochemical, and cell biology studies converge on the crucial role of ankyrin G as the key player in organizing the AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jenkins and Bennett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dzhashiashvili et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hedstrom et al., 2007</xref>). Unlike the AIS, the formation of the nodes of Ranvier requires exquisite communication with myelinating cells. In the nodes of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), the aggregation of axonal components is dependent on ankyrin G, but the priming event is initiated by gliomedin, a membrane protein positioned in the microvilli of the Schwann cell facing the node of Ranvier, via a direct interaction with the extracellular domain of neurofascin-186 and neuronal cell adhesion molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eshed et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dzhashiashvili et al., 2007</xref>). The nucleation of cell adhesion molecules in turn induces ankyrin G, &#x003b2;IV spectrin, and sodium channel recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eshed et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dzhashiashvili et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Among the interactions responsible for AIS formation and maintenance, the Na<sub>v</sub> sodium channel interaction with ankyrin G is of particular importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lambert et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrido et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lemaillet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fache et al., 2004</xref>). To circumvent difficulties in expressing full-length Na<sub>v</sub> in hippocampal neurons, we previously developed an approach based on CD4 chimera expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garrido et al., 2001</xref>). This approach allowed us to identify a sequence of 27 residues, called the AIS motif, that determines sodium channel targeting and clustering at the AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrido et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fache et al., 2004</xref>). This conserved determinant, located in the cytoplasmic linker between domains II and III of the Na<sub>v</sub>1 pore-forming &#x003b1; subunit (Na<sub>v</sub>1 II-III), constitutes the ankyrin-binding motif of Na<sub>v</sub> sodium channels. We also showed that the mutation of the glutamate residue Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 E1111 was sufficient to impair the compartmentalization at the AIS of CD4&#x02013;Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 II-III, a chimera in which the cytoplasmic region of CD4 was replaced by Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 II-III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fache et al., 2004</xref>). In the meantime, an independent study demonstrated that the PIALGESD sequence located within the AIS motif directly interacts with the membrane-binding domain (MBD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lemaillet et al., 2003</xref>), a domain highly conserved in ankyrin G and ankyrin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kordeli et al., 1995</xref>). Ankyrin G and B display a complementary subcellular distribution in the axons of cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boiko et al., 2007</xref>) and in myelinated fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kordeli et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett and Lambert, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ogawa et al., 2006</xref>). Strikingly, sodium channel accumulation is restricted to ankyrin G&#x02013;positive subdomains both in vivo and in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boiko et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2003</xref>). Because the ankyrin-binding motif is highly conserved in all neuronal sodium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrido et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lemaillet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pan et al., 2006</xref>) and binds to a domain highly conserved in ankyrin B and ankyrin G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kordeli et al., 1995</xref>), it is difficult to understand how sodium channels are specifically restricted to ankyrin G&#x02013;positive subdomains in the axon. We thus addressed the question as to whether an additional mechanism specifies sodium channel accumulation at the AIS and in the nodes of Ranvier.</p><p>To further analyze the molecular mechanisms involved in the discrete localization of sodium channels in the axonal membrane, we chose to use K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2, an ion channel chimera in which the C terminus of the K<sub>v</sub>2.1 potassium channel was replaced by the AIS motif of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 instead of CD4&#x02013;Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 II-III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrido et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fache et al., 2004</xref>). We have previously shown that endocytosis and domain-selective tethering confers CD4-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 II-III segregation at the AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fache et al., 2004</xref>). However, the endocytotic signal identified in the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 II-III linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fache et al., 2004</xref>) is not present in K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1, which suggests that it could follow a different trafficking pathway and be directly sorted to the AIS. Therefore, we first determined the critical residues of the ankyrin-binding motif responsible for K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 accumulation at the AIS. We observed that segregation was driven by the joint action of two types of residue: a glutamate residue (Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 E1111) and several serine residues (Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 S1112, S1123, S1124, and S1126). Sequence analysis reveals that these serine residues are part of potential protein kinase CK2 (CK2) phosphorylation sites. Using the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rich and Myszka, 2007</xref>), we directly demonstrated that CK2-mediated phosphorylation regulates the interaction between the Na<sub>v</sub>1 ankyrin-binding motif and the MBD of axonal ankyrins. Furthermore, a high concentration of CK2 in the AIS and the nodes of Ranvier was detected in vivo and in hippocampal cultures, which is consistent with a possible role of CK2 in regulating the interaction between Na<sub>v</sub> and ankyrin. Moreover, a peculiar property of the K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 chimera allowed us to unravel the functional significance of this regulation: expression of the K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 chimera containing the ankyrin-binding motif of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2-depleted endogenous sodium channels in the AIS of cultured hippocampal neurons. In contrast, chimeras containing a phosphorylation-deficient ankyrin-binding motif failed to perturb sodium channel accumulation at the AIS. Finally, inhibition of CK2 reduced sodium channel concentration at the AIS of cultured neurons. Altogether, our findings are consistent with the conclusion that CK2 contributes to the accumulation of sodium channels at the AIS and in the nodes of Ranvier by regulating their interaction with ankyrin G.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Abrogation of the glutamate residue of the Na<sub>v</sub>1 ankyrin-binding motif is not sufficient to impair ion channel segregation at the AIS</title><p>When expressed by transfection in cultured hippocampal neurons, the potassium channel K<sub>v</sub>2.1 was clustered at the cell surface on soma and on proximal dendrites identified by microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lim et al., 2000</xref>). The deletion of the C terminus of K<sub>v</sub>2.1 (K<sub>v</sub>2.1-&#x00394;Cter) induced a loss of compartmentalization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The addition of a segment encompassing the AIS motif of sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 (amino acids 1,080&#x02013;1,203) to the C terminus of K<sub>v</sub>2.1 (K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2) was sufficient to redirect K<sub>v</sub>2.1 to the AIS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). This was observed at the cell surface of 70.9 &#x000b1; 10.9% (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 609) of cells expressing K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2, in line with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrido et al., 2003</xref>). To determine the critical residues involved in K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 segregation, we first converted Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 E1111 into alanine, a point mutation that was sufficient to impair CD4-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 II-III compartmentalization at the AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fache et al., 2004</xref>). Because a mutation of the corresponding E residue (Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 E1053K) altered the trafficking of sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mohler et al., 2004</xref>), we differentially stained the surface and total channel populations. Surface staining was observed in 58.3% (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 230) of the cells expressing the K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 E1111A mutant and in 90.4% (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 240) of the cells expressing K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2. Strikingly, K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 E1111A was correctly localized at the AIS in 52.7 &#x000b1; 13.9% (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 178) of the cells displaying surface staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D&#x02013;F</xref>, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). After cell permeabilization, this mutant was visualized not only in the soma and throughout the dendrites but also in the ER identified by calreticulin costaining (unpublished data). In contrast, K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 was only occasionally detected in the ER (unpublished data). These findings indicate that the abrogation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 E1111 altered K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 trafficking, presumably by favoring retention in the ER, but did not impair its ability to be targeted to the AIS. In view of these observations, we surmised that, in addition to E1111, other residues of the ankyrin-binding motif contribute to K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 segregation at the AIS.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Abrogation of E1111 of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 ankyrin-binding motif did not impair ion channel segregation at the AIS of hippocampal neurons.</bold> Cell surface distribution of K<sub>v</sub>2.1 (A), K<sub>v</sub>2.1-&#x00394;Cter (B), K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 (C), and K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 E1111A mutant (D&#x02013;F) in cultured hippocampal neurons.

These results indicated that K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 segregation is dependent on the concerted action of E1111 with serine residues (S1112, S1123-24, or S1126).</p></sec><sec><title>The interaction between neuronal sodium channels and axonal ankyrins is regulated by CK2 phosphorylation</title><p>The ankyrin-binding motif of sodium channels directly interacts with a highly conserved domain in ankyrin G and B called the MBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Srinivasan et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lemaillet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mohler et al., 2004</xref>). We next examined the possibility that CK2-mediated phosphorylation regulates this interaction. We first determined whether the ankyrin-binding motif of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 is phosphorylated by CK2 by conducting in vitro phosphorylation assays with GST proteins fused either to the linker II-III of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 (Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 II-III) or truncated mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In the presence of CK2, Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 II-III was phosphorylated in vitro, as visualized by autoradiography (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). A similar result was obtained when the C terminus of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 II-III construct was truncated at residue 1133, whereas the deletion of the AIS motif (GST-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 989&#x02013;1,079) resulted in a loss of signal. A positive signal was observed with a GST protein bearing the segment encompassing the AIS motif (GST-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 1,080&#x02013;1,203). Several site-directed mutations of GST-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 1,080&#x02013;1,203 were generated. The respective abrogation of S1112, S1123, or S1124 did not affect in vitro phosphorylation of GST-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 1,080&#x02013;1,203 by CK2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). In contrast, S1126A mutation and the double mutation S1123-24A resulted in a decrease in signal. The double mutation (S1124-26A) and the triple mutation (S1112-24-26A) impaired GST-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 1,080&#x02013;1,203 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). All together, these results indicated that the ankyrin-binding motif of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 is phosphorylated in vitro by CK2. We next examined whether CK2 phosphorylation regulates the association of the ankyrin-binding motif and MBD-ankyrin (MBD-ank). With this aim, we used SPR technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rich and Myszka, 2007</xref>). Purified GST-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 1,080&#x02013;1,203 was immobilized on the sensor surface by immunoaffinity. GST&#x02013;MBD-ank were purified, and the GST-tag was removed using PreScission Protease (see Materials and methods). When an increasing concentration of MBD-ankB was injected over flow cells, a weak surface reactivity was observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Binding analysis (see Materials and methods) indicated that these two domains associate with an apparent affinity constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 1.2 &#x000b1; 0.4 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). When MBD-ankG was substituted for MBD-ankB, a similar affinity constant was obtained (a K<sub>D</sub> of 1.7&#x000b1; 0.5 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). To evaluate the impact of phosphorylation on the interaction, CK2 phosphorylation was performed on immobilized GST-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 1080&#x02013;1203, before either MBD-ankG or MBD-ankB injections (see Materials and methods). Under these conditions, increasing concentrations of MBD-ank injections produced a strongly increased binding signal. Kinetic analysis (see Materials and methods) of the interaction between MBD-ankG and the CK2-phosphorylated GST-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 1,080&#x02013;1,203 gave an association rate (k<sub>on</sub>) of 42.4 &#x000b1; 41.6 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and a dissociation rate (k<sub>off</sub>) of 2.1 &#x000b1; 0.8 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, resulting in a K<sub>D</sub> of 0.9 &#x000b1; 0.7 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> M. Similar binding affinities were obtained with MBD-ankB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). When GST-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 989&#x02013;1,133 was immobilized on the sensor surface, interaction with MBD-ankB was also strongly modulated by CK2 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). These affinity constants were similar to those obtained with GST-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 1,080&#x02013;1,203 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), which indicates that they are independent of the type of immobilized GST-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 II-III constructs. We further examined the impact of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 E1111 on the association between sodium channels and ankyrins by SPR. In the absence of phosphorylation, immobilized GST-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 1,080&#x02013;1,203 E1111A failed to recruit MBD-ank (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>). After on-chip CK2 phosphorylation, GST Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 1,080&#x02013;1,203 E1111A associated with MBD-ank with an affinity constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 2.4 &#x000b1; 0.8 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> M (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Finally, we evaluated the contribution of each of the serine residues of the ankyrin-binding motif on the phospho-dependent association between GST-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 1,080&#x02013;1,203 and MBD-ank. The single serines to alanine mutation and double mutation S1123-24A did not modify the phospho-dependent association (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). The double mutation (S1124-26A) led to a decrease in affinity (K<sub>D</sub> &#x0003d; 1.6 &#x000b1; 1.3 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). The triple mutation robustly altered association, resulting in a 1,000-fold decrease in affinity (K<sub>D</sub> &#x0003d; 2.6 &#x000b1; 1.1 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). All together, these in vitro observations revealed that the association between the ankyrin-binding motif of neuronal sodium channels and the MBD of axonal ankyrins (MBD-ankG and MBD-ankB) is regulated by CK2 phosphorylation. These findings strongly suggest that CK2 is able to strengthen the interaction between ankyrin and sodium channels.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>CK2 phosphorylates the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 ankyrin-binding motif and regulates its interaction with MBD-ank.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) The Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 ankyrin-binding motif is phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro<italic>.</italic> (A) Schematic representation of GST-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 linker II-III constructs.

To test this possibility, we looked at the subcellular localization of CK2 in neurons using a polyclonal antibody directed against the catalytic &#x003b1; subunit. In cultured hippocampal neurons, CK2 immunostaining was concentrated in the AIS but not in the distal part of the axon (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A1&#x02013;A3</xref>). CK2 was also visualized in nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Filhol et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Theis-Febvre et al., 2005</xref>), in soma, and in proximal dendrites. When hippocampal neurons were subjected to detergent extraction before cell fixation, CK2 immunostaining at the AIS was still observed (unpublished data), which suggests tethering to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrido et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fache et al., 2004</xref>).

Initial segments were intensely immunoreactive for CK2 in all observed structures, as revealed by colabeling with ankyrin G (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> and S1) and sodium channels (not depicted). Initial segments emanating from cell bodies of principal cells were observed in CA1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>), CA3, and dentate gyrus (Fig. S1, A and B). Initial segments positive for CK2 were also found in strati radiatum and oriens of CA1 and CA3, the molecular layer in the dentate gyrus, and in the hilus. Intense CK2 labeling appeared to underline the internal face of the plasma membrane of the initial segment, whereas the axoplasm displayed weak immunoreactivity, similar to ankyrin G localization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). In the hippocampus, 80% of ankyrin G&#x02013;positive structures displayed a positive labeling for CK2 in the white matter (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 637) and 88% in the gray matter (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 784). CK2 was also detected in nuclei of neurons and putative glial cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).

Immunostaining, both in cultured neurons and in vivo, revealed that CK2 is highly enriched at the AIS and in the nodes of Ranvier. These observations led us to examine the possibility that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of sodium channels occurs locally, at the AIS, contributing to channel clustering. We thus examined whether the perturbation of endogenous sodium channel accumulation induced by K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 was dependent on CK2 phosphorylation sites. Upon mutation of a single serine into alanine (S1112A and S1126A, respectively), mutated K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 induced a decrease in sodium channel staining intensity, like K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 (unpublished data). When the three serine residues located in the C-terminal end of the AIS motif were all mutated into alanines, the effect of the corresponding mutant (3SA) was less pronounced than with K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>).

The immunostaining of ankyrin G and Na<sub>v</sub>.1 channels was quantified in neurons treated with either DMAT or DMSO (control cells) at two stages of maturation.

(2003)</xref>. In close agreement with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrido et al., 2003</xref>), we show here that the determinant required for high-affinity ankyrin binding is not restricted to the PIALGESD sequence but extends further toward the C-terminal sequence, including two CK2 phosphorylation sites (Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 S1124 and S1126). In addition, we provide here the first evidence that the interaction between the ankyrin-binding motif and the MBD of ankyrins is regulated by CK2. This conclusion is based on the following findings. First, we observed that the AIS motif of CNS sodium channels is phosphorylated in vitro by CK2. This was supported by the abrogation of S1124-26 located in the C-terminal region of the AIS motif, which inhibited phosphorylation. Second, a quantitative binding assay based on SPR revealed that CK2 phosphorylation of the AIS motif resulted in a 1,000-fold increase (from 1.2 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M to 1.2 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> M) of the binding affinity for MBD-ank. This effect was observed using two distinct constructs in which the ankyrin-binding motif was localized distally or proximally with respect to GST. Besides, CK2 phosphorylation was equally effective for interactions with the MBD of ankyrin B and G. In addition, it was profoundly altered upon mutation of two to three serine residues. Co-mutation of S1124 with S1126 induced a robust decrease in binding affinity from 1.2 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> M to 1.6 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M. Third, we observed that K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 segregation at the AIS required the cooperation of two motifs: Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 E1111 and the serine residues S1112, S1124, and S1126. Co-mutation of E1111 with either S1124 or S1126 was found to be more effective than E1111-S1112 mutations. Fourth, we observed that expression of phosphorylation-deficient AIS motif constructs failed to perturb sodium channel accumulation in cultured neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). At the steady-state surface distribution, all the K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 serine mutants were predominantly compartmentalized at the AIS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>), which indicates that the loss of the dominant-negative effect of K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 induced by serine mutations did not result from deficient AIS localization but rather from the conversion of serines into alanines. Finally, we observed that inhibition of CK2 activity perturbed sodium channel accumulation at two distinct stages of AIS formation. Considered together, our findings show that several CK2 phosphorylation sites regulate the interaction between CNS sodium channels and ankyrins.</p><p>What is the contribution of the glutamate residue (Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 E1111)? SPR analysis revealed that the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 E1111A mutation totally abolished basal MBD-ank binding in the micromolar range measured in the absence of CK2 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). After CK2 phosphorylation, the binding affinity of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 E1111A mutant was affected (K<sub>D</sub> &#x0003d; 2.4 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> M) when compared with the control (K<sub>D</sub> &#x0003d; 1.2 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> M), but it remained high. This strongly suggests that different CK2 phosphorylation sites of the ankyrin-binding motif can overcome the E1111A mutation. However, we cannot totally exclude the possibility that our experimental conditions favored a high degree of phosphorylation of the ankyrin-binding motif. This may highlight the structural requirement for multiple serine phosphorylation and underestimate the contribution of residue E1111. Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 E1111 mutation was found to alter the level of cell surface expression of K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 in cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), which is in close agreement with a previous study on Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mohler et al., 2004</xref>). However, this mutation did not impair K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 segregation at the AIS because of the contribution of the phosphoserine residues. The fact that the association of E1111A with either S1124 or S1126 mutations was mandatory for the loss of K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 segregation at the AIS was consistent with this conclusion. Our findings strongly suggest that phosphorylation of three serine residues of the ankyrin-binding motif tunes the trafficking of sodium channels and their accumulation at discrete sites in neurons. It is noteworthy that variable phosphorylation of sites on the K<sub>v</sub>2.1 potassium channel allows graded activity-dependent regulation of channel gating and neuronal firing properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Misonou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Park et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, multiple phosphorylation is likely to constitute an important regulatory mechanism for both the activity and the trafficking of voltage-gated ion channels in neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>CK2 is a novel component of the AIS and of the nodes of Ranvier</title><p>CK2 is constitutively active and involved in a large spectrum of biological processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meggio and Pinna, 2003</xref>). Our data provide the first evidence that CK2 is a component of the AIS and the node of Ranvier in neurons. CK2 is a tetramer composed of two catalytic &#x003b1; subunits and two &#x003b2; subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Filhol et al., 2004</xref>). Immunostaining of the catalytic &#x003b1; subunit of CK2 at the AIS was observed in all the CNS regions examined (hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum). It was also found in CNS and PNS nodes of Ranvier. The question remains open as to whether the CK2&#x003b2; subunit is also concentrated within these two subdomains. CK2 localization revealed submembrane recruitment with ankyrin G within the AIS, which presumably regulates not only interaction between sodium channels and ankyrin G but also the complex interplay with other axonal components. Consistently, we observed that inhibition of CK2 activity perturbed ankyrin G concentration during the formation and the maintenance of the AIS. It is possible that CK2 regulates ankyrin G binding to &#x003b2; IV spectrin, as described in chicken erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghosh et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, the involvement of the potential CK2 phosphorylation sites located in the C terminus of potassium channels KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 in accumulation at the AIS and in the nodes of Ranvier deserves close examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pan et al., 2006</xref>).

Hence, an important issue in the future will be to obtain more information on the regulatory role of CK2 in the specification and the maintenance of the AIS and the nodes of Ranvier.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of CK2 in positioning sodium channels in ankyrin G&#x02013;positive domains</title><p>In neurons, biochemical and genetic studies have shown that sodium channel accumulation is an ankyrin-based mechanism occurring via a direct interaction with MBD, a domain highly conserved in ankyrin G and B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lemaillet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mohler et al., 2004</xref>).

However, a high density of sodium channels occurs only in ankyrin G subdomains both in vivo and in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boiko et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrido et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fache et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dzhashiashvili et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, distinct chimeras bearing the ankyrin-binding motif of sodium channels, including K<sub>v</sub>2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), were found to be concentrated at AIS (positive for ankyrin G) but not distal axons (positive for ankyrin B) of cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrido et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lemaillet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fache et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pan et al., 2006</xref>). How can we explain the discrepancy between in vivo localization of sodium channels and in vitro assays? The intramolecular interaction between the N and the C termini of ankyrin B could impede sodium channel recognition of the MBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdi et al., 2006</xref>). In the view of our findings, it is tempting to propose that CK2 regulates sodium channel interaction with ankyrin G and thus contributes to their specific accumulation at the AIS and the nodes of Ranvier. The local concentration of CK2 at the AIS and in the nodes of Ranvier could lead to phosphorylation of Na<sub>v</sub> sodium channels at their ankyrin-binding domain. It also possible that a m&#x000e9;nage &#x000e0; trois between ankyrin G, Na<sub>v</sub> channels, and CK2 is involved in the sorting of these components to the AIS and nodes of Ranvier. This phosphorylation-based process could represent a striking example of how posttranslational modifications can fine tune interactions between key protein partners. Neuronal cells are likely to rely on such a dynamic network of modulated interactions to attain an exquisite level of subcellular compartmentalization. Moreover, these regulated interactions likely contribute to the inherent plasticity of neurons, allowing them to dynamically adjust protein localization as a response to their various inputs. Precisely, the possibility of a dynamic modulation of ankyrin&#x02013;Na<sub>v</sub> interaction by synaptic activity is a fascinating question that should be addressed in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>DNA constructs</title><p>Rat K<sub>v</sub>2.1 cDNA was a donation from O.

Endogenous proteins (ankyrin G, MAP2, CK2&#x003b1;, and sodium channel) were immunodetected after a permeabilization step (0.066% saponin and 0.22% gelatin in PB), preceded by a brief incubation with 20% of Triton X-100 for pan sodium channel antibodies. Corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor or Cy5 were incubated for 1 h. Coverslips were mounted in Fluor Save reagent (EMD).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>All procedures were in agreement with the European Communities Council directive (86/609/EEC). Cerebella and forebrain from Wistar adult rats were removed and immediately frozen in cold isopentane (&#x02212;50&#x000b0;C). Brain sections were obtained on a cryostat and fixed by immersion in phosphate buffer containing 4% PFA for 15 min. Sciatic nerves were dissected and placed for 1 h in fixative. After teasing, fibers were transferred to slides and allowed to air dry. After 1 h incubation in 10% normal donkey serum in PBS, tissues were incubated overnight in primary antibodies (mouse antibody to pan Na<sub>v</sub>, goat antibody to CK2&#x003b1;, and rabbit antibody to ankyrin G). After washes, secondary antibodies diluted in PBS 0.1 M, pH 7.4, containing 0.3% Triton X-100 were applied for 2 h.</p></sec><sec><title>Confocal microscopy and quantification</title><p>Immunofluorescence slides were imaged using a confocal microscope (TCS-SPE or TSC-SP2; LCS or LAS-AF software; Leica). Confocal images were acquired with 40&#x000d7;/1.25 NA, 63&#x000d7;/1.32 NA, or 63&#x000d7;/1.40 NA oil objectives (Leica) at ambient temperatures. Fluorescence was collected as z stacks with sequential wavelength acquisition. Quantification was performed using ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). Regions of interest corresponding to AIS were manually selected on ankyrin G and/or Na<sub>v</sub>1 images and reported on other channels for intensity measurements. All intensities were corrected for background labeling. Image editing was performed using ImageJ or Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe) and was limited to rolling-ball background subtraction, linear contrast enhancement, and gamma adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows the colocalization of endogenous CK2&#x003b1; and ankyrin G in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and cortex.
