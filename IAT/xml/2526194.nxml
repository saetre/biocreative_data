The absence of T reg cells in mice and humans because of a deficiency in the forkhead transcription factor FoxP3 leads to multiorgan autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). The vital function of FoxP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in maintaining normal immune homeostasis is demonstrated by the fatal consequence of depletion of these cells in normal adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Peripheral function, stability, and survival of T reg cells are essential to maintain immune homeostasis. Defects in IL-2 production or IL-2 receptor expression interfere with the peripheral survival of T reg cells and lead to the loss of self-tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Similarly, blockade of the CD28&#x02013;B7 pathway in autoimmune-prone, nonobese diabetic mice leads to exacerbated autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). This autoimmunity affects multiple organs, including pancreatic islets, exocrine pancreas, salivary glands, thyroid, and peripheral nervous tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Thus, T reg cells are essential to the maintenance of self-tolerance and the prevention of both organ-specific and systemic autoimmune diseases.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, single-stranded RNA molecules (21&#x02013;22 nucleotides in length) with the potential to regulate endogenous gene expression in immune homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). miRNAs are transcribed as long transcripts (pri-miRNAs), cropped into hairpin-shaped pre-miRNAs, and processed by Dicer into the short RNAs that are responsible for the posttranscriptional regulation of expression of multiple mRNAs and, hence, protein. Thus, the elimination of Dicer abolishes miRNA production and subsequent function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) have demonstrated that miRNAs play an important role in the thymic development of T reg cells. However, the involvement of miRNAs after T reg lineage commitment was less clear because effector T (Teff) cells with dysregulated miRNAs are functionally impaired or even prone to autoimmunity through a mechanism involving miRNA-mediated mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we test the role of miRNAs in mature T reg cell function by crossing a FoxP3-GFP-hCre transgenic (Tg) mouse to a conditional Dicer knockout mouse (<italic>Dicer<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic>) to inactivate miRNA generation selectively in T reg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Disruption of Dicer in T reg cells at the time of first FoxP3 expression did not affect thymic T reg cell development. However, the peripheral miRNA-deficient T reg cells rapidly adopt an effector-like phenotype with overlapping features of Th1, Th2, and T reg cells, and altered cytokine profiles and cell-surface expression of T reg cell markers, and they failed to stably express FoxP3. The T reg cell&#x02013;specific FoxP3-GFP-hCre <italic>Dicer<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> KO mice rapidly develop spontaneous systemic autoimmune disease similar to the disease observed in T reg cell&#x02013;deficient FoxP3 KO mice.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Generation of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) Tg mice that enable GFP and Cre recombinase expression in FoxP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells</title><p>We developed a Foxp3 promoter&#x02013;driven BAC Tg mouse strain that carries a fusion protein containing GFP fused to the N-terminus of a codon-optimized hCre (see Materials and methods; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).

Functional activity of Cre was tested by breeding the Cre Tg mouse line to a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) reporter mouse, termed ROSA26R-YFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). The majority of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from the LNs of FoxP3-GFP-hCre &#x000d7; ROSA26R-YFP mice were YFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, as noted by the fact that the overall fluorescence intensity of YFP was a log greater than the GFP signal (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080707/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080707/DC1</ext-link>). Two-color analyses of GFP and YFP further showed that &#x0003e;95% of the GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the LN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>) and spleen were YFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, demonstrating the high specificity and efficiency of the FoxP3-GFP-hCre mice. However, a subset of &#x0223c;10% T reg cells spontaneously lost FoxP3 expression in vivo in healthy wild-type animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). We were unable to distinguish whether the YFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells have transiently expressed FoxP3 (as has been found in human T cells) or were a consequence of unstable T reg cells (bona fide T reg cells that have lost Foxp3). However, similar observations have been made by using a FoxP3-cre knock-in system; thus, we are confident that this is not an artifact of our BAC Tg system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of FoxP3-GFP-hCre BAC Tg mice.</bold> (A) The final BAC Tg construct used for generating mice.

It was unlikely that the differential gene expression was coming from the FoxP3 protein&#x02013;negative population, because the microarray experiment was done using Dicer KO mice in which &#x0223c;80% YFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. Indeed, the expression of multiple genes (including Neuropilin-1, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-10, GADD45, CCR5, Satb1, and Gzmb) was altered in the miRNA-deficient GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells isolated from either Dicer Het or Dicer KO mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Expression of Neuropilin-1 and GPR83 (unpublished data), both quintessential FoxP3-dependent T reg cell markers, were down-regulated in conditional Dicer KO T reg cells. In contrast, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-10, and granzyme B (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>), as well as IL-4, GADD45, CCR5, and Satb1 (not depicted), were highly expressed in the Dicer KO FoxP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells. IFN-&#x003b3; expression was further confirmed by intracellular staining. Almost 5% of Dicer KO CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, treated with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of monensin, expressed IFN-&#x003b3; as compared with &#x0003c;0.6% in Dicer Het T reg cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Interestingly, we observed dysregulation of another FoxP3-regulated protein, CD127, on the FoxP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Dicer KO T reg cell population (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>). The dysregulation of IFN-&#x003b3;, Neuropilin-1, and CD127 in cells expressing FoxP3 indicated that independent or downstream targets of Foxp3 are functionally defective in the absence of miRNAs.</p><p>Up-regulation of genes in the Dicer KO cells could be a direct result of the loss of relevant mature miRNAs, which control gene expression through binding to the 3&#x02032; untranslated region sequence. T reg cells and conventional CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells have different miRNA profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Therefore, we mined relevant T reg cell&#x02013;specific mRNA expression data to determine if their up-regulation correlated with the presence of predicted miRNA binding sites to a selected set of miRNAs preferentially expressed in T reg cells (miR-15b, miR-16, miR-21, miR-22, miR-23a, miR-23b, miR-24, miR-27b, miR-29c, miR-30a, miR-103, miR-125a-3p, miR-146a, miR-149, miR-155, miR-191, miR-207, miR-214, miR-223, and miR-297a). We used miRDB, an miRNA target prediction and functional annotation database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Of 393 genes that were observed to be up-regulated in Dicer KO T reg cells, 114 genes (29%) have potential target sites for the regulated miRNAs. These include several key genes such as CD127, IFN-&#x003b3;, Eomes, Socs3, Runx2, FasL, and Smurf2 (Table S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.20080707/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.20080707/DC1</ext-link>). Down-regulation of CD127 and IFN-&#x003b3; in T reg cells is Foxp3 dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), yet Dicer KO T reg cells express high levels of IFN-&#x003b3; and CD127 even in cells expressing FoxP3. It is interesting to note that these genes have binding sites for the miRNAs found by Cobb et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) to be overexpressed in T reg cells (miR-214 and miR-27b for CD127, and miR-27b for IFN-&#x003b3;). These results strongly suggest that additional regulation might occur through miRNAs that act downstream of Foxp3 in the regulation of this gene product.</p></sec><sec><title>T reg cell&#x02013;specific Dicer ablation results in the loss of suppressor function in vivo</title><p>Aging FoxP3-GFP-hCre Dicer KO mice began to resemble FoxP3 KO mice. The majority of LN and splenic CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>YFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> or FoxP3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells from Dicer KO mice down-regulated CD62L expression and increased expression of CD44, CD69, and CTLA4, consistent with an activated phenotype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). The number of CTLA4-expressing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>FoxP3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> effectors increased from &#x0003c;10% of splenic and LN CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in Dicer Het and <italic>Dicer<sup>wt/wt</sup></italic> (Wt) littermates to &#x0003e;50 and &#x0003e;70% in Dicer KO LNs and spleens, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Intracellular cytokine production was assessed in the PMA plus ionomycin&#x02013;activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>YFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells from FoxP3-GFP-hCre &#x000d7; ROSA26R-YFP Dicer wild-type or Dicer KO mice. Less than 1% of the LN or splenic T cells from control mice expressed IL-10, IL-4, IFN-&#x003b3;, or IL-17. In sharp contrast, a significant percentage of Teff cells (YFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) from T reg cell&#x02013;specific Dicer KO mice expressed high levels of IL-4, IL-10, and, especially, IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Thus, the increased effector function was secondary to the miRNA defect, which was limited to only the T cells that expressed or had once expressed FoxP3.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>T reg cell&#x02013;specific Dicer ablation results in the loss of suppressor function in vivo.</bold> (A) Flow cytometric analysis of activation markers on Teff cells reveals strong activation of nonregulatory (GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>YFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) cells.

Clinical signs of disease included weight loss, reduced mobility, and a hunched back. Both lung and liver tissues were extensively infiltrated with mononuclear cells similar to the infiltrates observed in the FoxP3 KO mouse (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Lungs of both Scurfy and Dicer KO tissue exhibited dense, predominantly peribronchovascular mononuclear infiltrates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>), consistent with an autoimmune disease. The infiltrate was composed of both CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, not unlike what has been observed in other T reg cell&#x02013;dependent lymphoproliferative diseases and FoxP3-deficient mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>).</p><p>In summary, these results demonstrate that miRNAs are essential in maintaining FoxP3 expression and controlling lineage specificity within the T reg cell subset. The newly generated FoxP3-GFP-hCre mouse strain allowed us to focus on the peripheral effects of miRNA disruption, because Dicer deletion occurred only after the T cells had fully committed to the T reg lineage. The specific loss of miRNA processing led to a severe T reg cell dysfunction in the periphery, leading to a high morbidity and mortality at 4&#x02013;8 wk of age, which reveals the central role of miRNAs in controlling T reg cell function in vivo. T reg cell&#x02013;specific miRNA ablation resulted in a much more aggressive lymphoproliferative disease than miRNA ablation in all CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and closely resembled the Scurfy phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). The relatively mild disease found in the CD4-Cre &#x000d7; <italic>Dicer<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mouse strain suggests a role of miRNAs in regulating the activation, migration, and/or function of conventional T cells, thus masking the severity of the T reg cell defect caused by impaired conventional T cell function. Dicer-deficient T reg cells failed to keep the T reg lineage stable and also developed a Teff cell&#x02013;like phenotype. Strikingly, the YFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells isolated from T reg cell&#x02013;specific FoxP3-GFP-hCre <italic>Dicer<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> KO mice produced IFN-&#x003b3; and expressed a memory cell marker, which indicated that some of the FoxP3 functions might be defective in the absence of miRNAs. The detailed study of which miRNAs are directly involved in T reg cell stability remains to be defined. However, there have been a large number of miRNAs that have been identified in T reg cells, including some that are differentially expressed in this subset and regulated by Foxp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Many potential gene targets of the T reg cell&#x02013;enriched miRNAs increased after Dicer ablation, including CD127 (a predicted target of miR-214 and miR-27b) and IFN-&#x003b3; (miR-27b), even in Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. These results support the notion that at least some miRNAs act downstream of Foxp3 in T reg cells to control autoimmunity.</p><p>The detailed mechanism of how miRNAs regulate T reg cell function remains a key question for future studies. We have performed multiple in vitro suppression assays with the isolated T reg cells from Dicer KO mice and have observed variable results. The function appeared defective in only 50% of the assays performed. It is possible that the overexpression of IL-10 and Gzms in the Dicer KO T reg cells might mask the functional defect in this in vitro assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). The decreased Neuropilin-1 expression in the Dicer KO Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>) might provide an alternative explanation, because Neuropilin-1 contributes to the prolonged interaction of T reg cells with dendritic cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Indeed we found much higher CD40 expression on the dendritic cells from Dicer KO mouse (unpublished data), similar to the DC activation observed after T reg cell ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). It is unlikely that the lymphoproliferative disease is the result of generated YFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells in the Foxp3-Cre Dicer KO mouse. First, the majority of the T cells expressing the activated phenotype were both YFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Second, it seems unlikely that the limited decrease in the percentage of Foxp3 cells in Dicer KO mice is sufficient to lead to pathology. Third, the much milder disease found in the CD4-Cre &#x000d7; <italic>Dicer<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mouse strain suggests that Teff cells are functionally impaired in absence of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Generation of T reg cell&#x02013;specific Dicer conditional KO mice.</title><p>The GFP-hCre cDNA fragment was inserted immediately downstream of the FoxP3 ATG translational start site by homologous recombination into a 188-kb mouse BAC (from the C57BL/6 genome; clone RP23-143D8) carrying the intact FoxP3 gene, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>).
