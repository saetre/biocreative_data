Although the precise mechanism by which prostaglandins improve uveoscleral outflow is not fully understood, two possible mechanisms that have been studied are relaxation of the ciliary muscle and remodeling the extracellular matrix of the ciliary muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Researchers have attributed the increase in uveoscleral outflow to a group of enzymes named matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>].</p><p>MMPs are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that play a key role in regulating the modulations of the extracellular matrix (ECM). These molecules are secreted much like proenzymes and become activated by proteolytic cleavage truncation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. MMP-2, a member of the family of MMPs, has been shown to have proteinase activity in the degradation of multiple ECM proteins such as type I collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and several proteoglycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. MMP-2 is secreted as an inactive proenzyme, pro-MMP-2. The activation of pro-MMP-2 requires its cell surface localization and cleavage by cell membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), which controls a variety of physiologic and pathological processes through the proteolytic degradation of extracellular or transmembrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), the specific inhibitor of MMP-2, is also involved in this process by forming a receptor for pro-MMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. It has been confirmed that the extracellular spaces separating ciliary muscle fibers of the uveoscleral outflow pathway contain abundant ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Thus, increased degradation of ciliary muscle ECM by MMP-2 could remodel the ECM among the ciliary muscle bundles and decrease the hydraulic resistance to uveoscleral flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>].</p><p>Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) is one of the major transcription factors that plays a critical role in the gene regulation of multiple cellular processes such as inflammation, immune responses, cell proliferation, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Five members were identified among the NF-&#x003ba;B family of transcription factors: v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog (Rel)A (p65), RelB, NF-&#x003ba;B1 (p50/p105), NF-&#x003ba;B2(p52/p100), and c-Rel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. In most cells, NF-&#x003ba;B forms various homodimers as well as heterodimers, mainly between the p65 and p50 proteins. The NF-&#x003ba;B dimers can form complexes in the cytoplasm with the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B alpha (I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;), which masks the NF-&#x003ba;B nuclear localization sequence and results in latent inactivity. However, upon activation by extracellular stimuli or other transcriptional factors, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; is phosphorylated and degraded while NF-&#x003ba;B rapidly translocates to the nucleus where it activates the transcription expression of several important genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have documented that the suppression of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; could induce NF-&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation and consequently promote the increase of MMP-2 in several types of human cells including Ewing sarcoma EW7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>], human skin cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>], murine melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>], and HT1080 (fibrosarcoma) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanism of inducing the secretion and activation of MMP-2 in human ciliary muscle (HCM) cells still remains unclear. This question has led us to investigate whether the I&#x003ba;B/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway influences MMP-2 expression in HCM cells in vitro.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Primary HCM cells</title><p>Normal primary HCM cells were established and cultured as described previously by the Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>].

The total protein extracts (30 &#x003bc;g each) were separated from each sample by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS&#x02013;PAGE) and transferred onto poly vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% blocking reagent at room temperature for 1.5 h and probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), polyclonal rabbit anti-MT1-MMP (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and polyclonal rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:5,000; BD) overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The membranes were washed three times with the blocking buffer and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP; BD). The bands were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL kit; Cell Signaling Technology). The protein level of NF-&#x003ba;Bp65 in both the total (30 &#x003bc;g) and nuclear (30 &#x003bc;g) extracts was detected by western blot analysis using polyclonal rabbit anti-NF-&#x003ba;Bp65 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology). MMP-2 and TIMP-2 expression was examined as follows: the medium was replaced with serum-free growth medium after transfection for 6 h.

Downregulation of <italic>I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;</italic> by siRNA resulted in significant translocation of NF-&#x003ba;Bp65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after 24 h to 72 h. The secretion of MMP-2 increased as well as the activation from pro-MMP-2 to active-MMP-2. In addition, the expression of MT1-MMP increased while the expression of TIMP-2 reduced both in mRNA and protein levels. It is implied from these results that NF-&#x003ba;B is an important transcriptional factor involved in the control of uveoscleral outflow through the promotion of MMP-2 expression.</p><p>It has been reported that NF-&#x003ba;B is involved in various activities and plays a key role in multiple biological processes including chemical stress, physical stress, physiologic stress, receptor ligands, proinflammatory cytokines, and apoptosis. At the same time, there are also multiple and complex signal transduction pathways leading to NF-&#x003ba;B activation. However, many of these activations are primarily performed by the so-called classical pathway, which involves the degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, leading to the release of the NF-&#x003ba;B complex, which in turn allows it to relocate to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. Meanwhile, mounting evidence shows that the I&#x003ba;B/NF-&#x003ba;B classical pathway is involved in the expression of MMP-2. Han et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>] reported that TNF-&#x003b1; induced the breakdown of I&#x003ba;B in fibroblasts within the collagen lattice, which is a critical step leading to the activation of pro-MMP-2 by NF-&#x003ba;B. Philip and Kundu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>] showed that osteopontin could induce NF-&#x003ba;B activity through phosphorylation and degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; by activating I-Kappa B Kinase (IKK), which ultimately triggers the activation of pro-MMP-2 in B16F10 cells. Park and his colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>] indicated that propylene glycol monomethyl acetic ether (PMA) treatment resulted in I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; phosphorylation in fibrosarcoma cells, which enhances MMP-2 production through the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factors.</p><p>To further investigate the potential role of NF-&#x003ba;B in uveoscleral outflow, the expression of <italic>I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;</italic> was downregulated by specific siRNA. We found not only the translocation of NF-&#x003ba;Bp65 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus but also the enhanced secretion and activity of MMP-2 after I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; knockdown. Most MMPs are secreted in their inactive pro-form from cells and in the active-form outside the cells. Many studies have indicated that the secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>] and activation of MMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>] are associated with NF-&#x003ba;B . On the other hand, NF-&#x003ba;B signaling has also been demonstrated to participate in the regulation of MMP-2 at a transcriptional level as shown in our study, indicating that <italic>MMP-2</italic> mRNA increases after NF-&#x003ba;B has been activated. It has been reported that PGF2&#x003b1; induces c-Fos in human ciliary smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>] and that c-Fos is capable of physically interacting with NF-&#x003ba;Bp65 through the Rel homology domain, enhancing its DNA binding and biological function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Moreover, although there is no NF-&#x003ba;B-binding site on the <italic>MMP-2</italic> promoter, it has been suggested that MMP-2 activation occurs in endothelial cells through an NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. Apparently, the molecular mechanism driving the effect of NF-&#x003ba;B on MMP-2 needs to be further investigated.</p><p>In this study, downregulation of <italic>I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;</italic> resulted in the decrease of TIMP-2 and the increase of MT1-MMP. TIMP-2 has been found to exhibit several biochemical and physiologic/biological functions including inhibition of active MMPs, pro-MMP activation, and so on. The balance between TIMP-2 and MMP-2 levels is critical in determining the activation status of MMP-2. Along with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>, we found that TIMP-2 expression was reduced while MMP-2 activation was enhanced after <italic>I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;</italic> siRNA transfection in HCM cells. In addition, activation of MMP-2 also requires its cell surface localization and cleavage by cell membrane-bound MT1-MMP, the increased expression of MT1-MMP promoted the MMP-2 expression. The results showed that increased pro-MMP-2 activation reflected upregulation of MT1-MMP expression in the <italic>I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;</italic> siRNA treated cells. In a word, the number of function attributed to being regulated by the transcription factor, NF-&#x003ba;Bp65, is rapidly increasing. We observed that translocation of NF-&#x003ba;Bp65 into the nucleus correlates with the decrease of TIMP-2 and the increase of MT1-MMP. Moreover, the activated NF-&#x003ba;B induced the secretion and activation of MMP-2. This evidence indicated that the expression of MMP-2 is mediated by the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and that the I&#x003ba;B/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway plays a significant role in this process.</p><p>As generally recognized, Rel/NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factors appear to mediate survival signals that protect cells from apoptosis, which may result in the development of several tumors. It has also become clear that MMPs not only play a role in ECM modification but they also have effects on tumor cell adhesion and motility. In our study, the activated NF-&#x003ba;B and consequently, enhanced MMP-2 most likely exert an anti-apoptotic action, promoting the survival of defective cells, thereby causing tumor growth in HCM cells. However, not all reports support a survival role for Rel/NF-&#x003ba;B factors. Experiments by Grimm et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>] indicated that a dominant-negative RelA mutant prevented the cell death that was induced upon serum starvation of 293 cells. Jung et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>] reported that radiation-induced apoptosis of ataxia telangiectasia (AT) fibroblasts was found to be reduced by a transdominant-negative I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; protein. Kasibhatla et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>] found that inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activity in a T cell hybridoma leads to decreased apoptosis in T cells. We have also discovered a few studies reporting the detrimental effects of MMP-2 on HCM cells. Therefore, we intend to shift our experimentation from a predominantly in vitro system to an animal model to further explore the role of the I&#x003ba;B/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that the I&#x003ba;B/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway plays an important role in the expression of MMP-2 in HCM cells. It is possible that the mechanism underlying the uveoscleral outflow pathway involves the inhibition of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, leading to the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B p65, which in turn, results in the increase of secretion and activity of MMP-2. This molecular mechanism may provide a novel insight in the development of a new strategy for the treatment of glaucoma.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the Natural Scientific Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (No.04300243).
