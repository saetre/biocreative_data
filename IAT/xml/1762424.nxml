The primary biological leg function, locomotion, requires the formation of a specialised appendicular musculature. Here we report evidence that <italic>ladybird</italic>, an orthologue of the <italic>Lbx1</italic> gene recognised as a hallmark of appendicular myogenesis in vertebrates, is expressed in leg myoblasts, and regulates the shape, ultrastructure and functional properties of leg muscles in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. <italic>ladybird</italic> expression is progressively activated in myoblasts associated with the imaginal leg disc and precedes that of the founder cell marker <italic>dumbfounded</italic>. The RNAi-mediated attenuation of <italic>ladybird</italic> expression alters properties of developing myotubes, impairing their ability to grow and interact with the internal tendons and epithelial attachment sites. It also affects sarcomeric ultrastructure, resulting in reduced leg muscle performance and impaired mobility in surviving flies. The over-expression of <italic>ladybird</italic> also results in an abnormal pattern of dorsally located leg muscles, indicating different requirements for <italic>ladybird</italic> in dorsal versus ventral muscles. This differential effect is consistent with the higher level of Ladybird in ventrally located myoblasts and with positive <italic>ladybird</italic> regulation by extrinsic Wingless signalling from the ventral epithelium. In addition, <italic>ladybird</italic> expression correlates with that of FGF receptor Heartless and the read-out of FGF signalling downstream of FGF. FGF signals regulate the number of leg disc associated myoblasts and are able to accelerate myogenic differentiation by activating <italic>ladybird</italic>, leading to ectopic muscle fibre formation. A key role for <italic>ladybird</italic> in leg myogenesis is further supported by its capacity to repress <italic>vestigial</italic> and to down-regulate the <italic>vestigial</italic>-governed flight muscle developmental programme. Thus in <italic>Drosophila</italic> like in vertebrates, appendicular muscles develop from a specialised pool of myoblasts expressing <italic>ladybird/Lbx1</italic>. The <italic>ladybird/Lbx1</italic> gene family appears as a part of an ancient genetic circuitry determining leg-specific properties of myoblasts and making an appendage adapted for locomotion.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal leg musculature is required for walking in all animals, but the genetic mechanisms that control its development have been analysed mainly in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Neyt1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Hollway1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, the conserved family of <italic>Distal-less/Dlx</italic> homeobox genes was found to be involved in outgrowth of appendages over a broad spectrum of proteostome and deuterostome phyla, suggesting the existence of ancient genetic circuitry controlling leg development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Panganiban1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Kraus1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. This prompted us to find out whether the genetic programme governing leg muscle formation, required for the main biological leg function, which is locomotion, was under the control of conserved genes. With this aim we investigated myogenic functions of genes known to control vertebrate appendicular myogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> leg muscles derive from myoblasts associated with the leg imaginal disc. The leg disc is a flat epithelial sheet of cells during the first and second larval instar stages. With the onset of third instar, though still monolayered, it begins to develop concentric folds, undergoes cell shape changes, and divides into the leg disc proper and a proximal region that corresponds to the ventral thorax/adult body wall. It has been shown that these two regions have different genetic requirements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Casares1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-GonzalezCrespo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. During the pupal stage, the disc epithelium telescopes out from its centre and elongates along the proximal-distal axis to make the slender adult leg epidermis by cell rearrangement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Condic1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Fristrom1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The signalling pathways and factors that control patterning of leg disc epithelium have been extensively studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Brook1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Weigmann1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the mechanisms governing the myogenic programme in the developing leg disc remain largely unknown.</p><p>Previous studies indicate that two different developmental strategies are used during the development of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscles, namely muscle template-based myogenesis and <italic>de novo</italic> muscle formation. A subset of indirect flight muscles IFMs, the dorsal longitudinal muscles DLMs, uses larval templates for formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Costello1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Fernandes1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas the other set of IFMs, the dorsoventral muscles DVMs, the direct flight muscles DFMs and leg muscles develop <italic>de novo</italic> from a pool of <italic>twist</italic>-positive precursors of adult muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Bate1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Soler1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. These pathways imply distinct regulatory mechanisms that control the development of sets of flight muscles and the muscles of the leg. It has been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Ghazi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Sudarsan1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> that the homeobox genes <italic>cut</italic> and <italic>apterous</italic><italic>ap</italic> are autonomously required for the formation of DFMs, whereas <italic>vestigial vg</italic> controls the formation of IFMs. Besides these intrinsic factors, Wingless Wg signalling from the imaginal disc epithelium contributes to the functional diversification of myoblasts forming DLMs and DFMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Sudarsan1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

As demonstrated recently by Dutta et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Dutta2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> in adult thoracic and abdominal myogenesis, Duf is initially activated in all myoblasts and subsequently founder myoblasts are chosen by Htl-transduced FGF signals by the up-regulation of <italic>Duf</italic> in a subset of myoblasts corresponding to differentiating founders. <italic>Duf</italic> is down-regulated in other myoblasts that will become fusion competent cells. Thus adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> myogenesis also involves founder myoblast selection through FGF-dependent signalling. In chick embryos, the FGF8 and its receptor FREK/FGFR4 were found to promote muscle differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Marics1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating potentially convergent roles for FGF in invertebrate and vertebrate myogenic programs.

This was most probably due to abnormal growth of myotubes and/or their impaired ability to recognise epithelial attachment sites. The reduced number of muscle fibres observed in legs displaying strong RNAi phenotypes can result from the degeneration of some of the misshapen myotubes. The loss of leg muscle mass in <italic>lb</italic>-deficient flies was the cause of morphological leg deformations most frequently seen within the femur segment arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000122-g002">Fig. 2E, F</xref>. To test whether the reduced muscle mass could result from a smaller number of leg myoblasts, we examined Twi expression in discs from the third instar 1151&#x0003e;lbRNAi larvae.

We did not find any effects on tendon specification in Stripe&#x0003e;lbRNAi leg discs data not shown.

Thus when over-expressed <italic>lbe</italic> was able to influence properties of dorsal rather than ventral muscle fibres, suggesting that ventral and dorsal myoblasts may have different requirements for the levels of Lbe protein.

In the first one see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for technical details we evaluated the capacity of male flies to catch, maintain and rotate a small polystyrene ball <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000122-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000122.s012">Video S10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000122.s014">Video S12</xref>.

Interestingly, the over-expression of Lbe also leads to dramatic defects in muscle performance.

Adult flies walking on a carbon-coated slide leave tracks that can be used as a read-out of their gait. Wild type flies use an &#x02018;alternating-tripod&#x02019; gait, characteristic of insects walking briskly. This gait leaves a pattern on the carbon-coated slide that is stereotypic and, easily recognised, and is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000122-g004">Fig 4B<sup>i</sup></xref>. When <italic>lb</italic> levels are down- regulated using the UAS-lbRNAi under the control of the 1151-GAL4 driver, a very strong and noticeable difference is seen in the leg-prints <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000122-g004">Fig 4B<sup>ii</sup></xref>. The legs can be deduced to be positioned closer to the body axis than in the wild type, and a shuffling-gait also results in a reduced stride-length. In contrast, the GOF phenotype that results from the use of the UAS-lbe under 1151-GAL4 control results in a pattern of leg prints, which reflect poor co-ordination and a spread-out positioning of the legs with respect to the body axis.</p><p>In some contexts, affects of muscle or tendon anatomy do not result in any obvious behavioural changes. In other situations, strong behavioural consequences are seen when sensitive components of the motor network are disrupted. Hence sensitive but readily performed behavioural assays are valuable in determining the contribution of specific components to normal motor function. In this case, given the expression of <italic>lb</italic> both in myoblasts and during morphogenesis, behavioural assays additionally allow the use of genetics to isolate interacting genes as well as alleles that may allow the dissection of the roles of <italic>lb</italic> between muscle specification and morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Extrinsic Wingless signalling is required for <italic>lbe</italic> expression in leg myoblasts</title><p>Wingless signalling plays a pivotal role in specification of the proximal-distal and dorsal-ventral axes of the leg disc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Lecuit1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Struhl1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-DiazBenjumea1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, and has also been reported to control muscle development in the thoracic portion of the wing disc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Sudarsan1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Within the wing disc myoblasts underlay only the body wall epithelium, whereas the leg disc associated myoblasts are located on both territories. Our data demonstrate that Lbe is expressed exclusively in myoblasts that populate the leg disc proper and is excluded from the myoblasts underlaying proximal portion of the leg disc epithelium that contribute to the ventral thorax. This restriction depends on Wg signalling from the ventral epithelium that makes the most proximal myoblasts located far from Wg source incompetent to express Lbe. The key role of Wg in Lbe activation is confirmed by the extension of Lbe expression to proximal myoblasts in leg discs expressing a constitutively active form of Arm and by loss of Lbe in disc with attenuated Wg signalling. Interestingly, the Lbe-negative proximal leg disc myoblasts express <italic>vg</italic>, previously found to control IFM development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Sudarsan1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

This possibility is supported by the dorsally restricted muscle defects observed in <italic>lb</italic> gain of function mutants and by preferential loss of ventral muscles in the legs from flies over-expressing dnTCF.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Heartless transduced FGF signals are required to set the number of leg myoblasts and promote their differentiation</title><p>It has been recently shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Dutta1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Dutta2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> that the formation of the body wall muscles of the adult fly involves the Htl-directed differentiation of Duf-expressing cells. Here we present evidence that the FGF pathway plays an important role in setting the number and promoting the differentiation of myoblasts associated with the leg discs. We show that all the Lbe-positive myoblasts express FGF receptor Heartless and downstream intracellular protein Dof, known to be a specific read-out of FGF signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Vincent1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. We also demonstrate that forced expression of an activated form of FGF receptor Htl leads to an increased number of leg myoblasts and to their premature differentiation into Lbe-positive muscle precursors. Importantly, FGF signalling is also able to induce ectopic Duf expression in the dorsal region of all leg segments. As a consequence, we observe that a higher number of fibres contribute to the leg muscles. This indicates that regulated by FGF signals, the number of Duf-expressing myoblasts is directly related to the number of fibres composing adult leg muscles, consistent with a role of the FGF pathway in the differentiation of the adult abdominal muscle founders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000122-Dutta2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The instructive myogenic potential of the FGF pathway is also illustrated by the capacity of Htlca to induce myogenesis in tarsal segments otherwise devoid of muscle. The FGF-induced formation of tarsal muscles involves maintenance of Twist expression in tarsal adepithelial cells followed by differentiation of Lbe/Duf-positive myoblasts, thus indicating that activation of Lbe and Duf are obligatory steps in leg muscle development. Moreover, the observation that forced Htlca expression leads to the differentiation of supernumerary Duf-positive cells only in the dorsal portion of the leg disc suggests cooperation of FGF with a secreted signal from the dorsal epithelium. The observed inability of ectopic Htl to promote differentiation of the ventral population of myoblasts in the third instar larvae seems not to be maintained in later stages, since the number of fibres composing ventrally-located depressor muscles was also increased in legs from the 1151&#x0003e;Htlca flies. Thus we conclude that the FGF pathway promotes the differentiation of both dorsal and ventral myoblasts into Lbe/Duf-expressing cells, but that this process is delayed in the ventral region. The timely distinct differentiation of ventrally located myoblasts probably underlies a specific developmental programme enabling the formation of functionally distinct depressor muscles.</p><p>Taken together, our data provide evidence that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> like in vertebrates, multi-fibre appendicular muscles develop from a specialised pool of myoblasts expressing <italic>ladybird/Lbx1</italic> homeobox genes. <italic>ladybird</italic> genes determine leg-specific properties of myoblasts and muscle fibres, thus ensuring adaptation of the muscle system to walking behaviour.

General muscle mass appears reduced in tibia C and femur asterisks in E and F. Loss of muscle mass and the abnormal attachment of muscle fibres to the leg epithelium lead to morphological defects most frequently manifested by bending of the femur segment arrows in E and F.

The abilities of flies to catch, maintain and rotate a polystyrene ball were tested. The number of individuals tested males only is indicated in upper case after the genotype. Each male performed each of the tests three times. The number of asterisks max. 5 illustrates the average performance. Notice that the RNAi-based attenuation of <italic>lb</italic> leads to a reduced ability to catch about 20&#x00025; of failures and especially to maintain the ball about 60&#x00025; of failures with slower and irregular rotations. Defects in catching, maintaining and rotating the ball were comparatively stronger in flies overexpressing <italic>lb</italic>. About 60&#x00025; of flies were unable to catch the ball and more than 80&#x00025; lost it in less than 30 s. B The &#x02018;leg-print&#x02019; test for walking pattern. Two-day old flies were allowed to walk on a carbon-soot coated glass slide and their tracks were examined. The direction of movement is towards the top of each panel. The imprints made by the first 1 second 2 and third leg 3 of the left hemisegment are marked in each panel. Wild type flies B&#x02032; show a stereotypic pattern of prints, a consequence of a &#x02018;tripod&#x02019; gait. In male flies where UAS-lbRNAi expression is under the control of the 1151GAL4 driver B&#x02033; the legs are held closer to the body and the leg-print is the consequence of a shuffling gait. In male flies where UAS-lbe expression is under the control of the 1151GAL4 driver the pattern of prints B&#x02032;&#x02033; illustrates a bias towards one side, a consequence of the legs being abnormally positioned with respect to the body.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0000122.g004"/></fig><fig id="pone-0000122-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000122.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Wg signals are required for Lbe expression and play a key role in leg myogenesis</title><p>A&#x02013;I Confocal images of third instar leg imaginal discs.

Attenuation of Htl expression leads to reduced number of myoblasts associated with the leg disc compare A and E. This is particularly obvious when comparing the number of Twi/Lbe/Duf expressing cells within the outlined area in the dorsal femur. In contrast, forced Htl expression leads to significantly increased number of leg myoblasts outlined area 1 in I&#x02013;L. Moreover, Htl, when overexpressed, induces Lbe prematurely in all myoblasts in the leg disc proper and promotes differentiation of dorsally located myoblasts into Duf-positive cells K,L, outlined areas 2,3,4.
