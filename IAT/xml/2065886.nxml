One of these kinases is the conserved Polo, which is the target of anticancer drugs. Using genetics in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (the fruit fly), we have identified Greatwall, another conserved protein kinase, as an antagonist of Polo. Studies of <italic>Scant</italic>, a dominant mutation of the <italic>greatwall</italic> gene, lead us to examine the effects of overexpressing wild-type Greatwall. Too much Greatwall activity relative to Polo leads to developmental defects in early syncytial embryos, which are initiated by the detachment of a single centrosome from the nuclear envelope in prophase. Loss-of-function mutants of <italic>greatwall</italic> reveal that the kinase is required for proper chromosome structure and segregation in mitosis and meiosis. One of these mutations results in the loss of Greatwall specifically during vitellogenesis (building up the egg's contents) and leads to a failure of meiosis I characterized by the premature loss of sister chromatid cohesion. This study shows that the Greatwall kinase fulfils multiple crucial functions in the different cell cycles of a developing animal and will be the foundation for further investigations.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Archambault V, Zhao X, White-Cooper H, Carpenter ATC, Glover DM (2007) Mutations in <italic>Drosophila Greatwall/Scant</italic> reveal its roles in mitosis and meiosis and interdependence with Polo kinase.

The major protein kinase that directs cell division is cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), the active component of Maturation Promoting Factor, first found to promote meiotic entry in amphibian oocytes. The cyclical inactivation of Cdk1 prior to mitotic exit is brought about in part through destruction of its cyclin partner (reviewed by &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;). Two other protein kinase families, the Polo and Aurora families, are known to have critical functions in progression into and through M phase (mitosis and cytokinesis) and functionally interact with each other and also with Cdk1 to mediate their functions.</p><p>Polo, originally discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;, exemplifies an evolutionarily conserved mitotic protein kinase. Polo, as well as its close orthologs, has been shown to function in multiple events essential for cell division. Polo was initially found to be essential for centrosome maturation and separation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. It promotes recruitment of the &#x003b3;-tubulin ring complex and phosphorylates Asp to facilitate nucleation of an increased number of dynamic microtubules on mitotic entry (reviewed by &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;). At the G2/M transition, Polo (Polo-like kinase 1 in vertebrates) phosphorylates and activates the Cdc25 phosphatase responsible for removing inhibitory phosphates on Cdk1; this promotes mitotic entry &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. It also functions at the kinetochore-microtubule interface to monitor tension; the 3F3/2 phospho-epitope seen on kinetochores in the absence of tension is a consequence of Plk1/Plx1 kinase activity in vertebrates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Removal of cohesins from chromosomal arms in mitosis and meiosis also requires phosphorylation of cohesin subunits by Polo kinases (reviewed by &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> meiosis II, Polo phosphorylates and inactivates the centromeric cohesion protector protein Mei-S332 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, Polo is required for cytokinesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The growing list of Polo kinase substrates is evidence of its role in multiple mitotic events.</p><p>It is clear that protein kinases such as Cdk1 and Polo are only part of a large network of protein kinases that regulate cell cycle progression, many of which are as yet poorly characterized. A genome-wide survey found that up to one-third of the protein kinome of <italic>Drosophila</italic> has some cell cycle role &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Depletion of the Gwl kinase from S2 cells by RNA interference (RNAi) led to a mitotic delay characterized by formation of long spindles and scattered chromosomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Yu and colleagues (2004) also found a mitotic role for Gwl kinase by characterizing missense hypomorphic mutants. Reduced <italic>gwl</italic> function results in mitotic defects in larval neuroblasts and tissue culture cells, including delay between late G2 and anaphase onset and chromosome condensation defects. Gwl has close homologs across eukaryotes and more distant homologs in budding and fission yeasts. Indeed, Yu and colleagues recently reported a function for <italic>Xenopus</italic> Gwl in mitotic entry, as part of the Cdc2/Cdk1 activation loop in oocyte extracts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. In that system, <italic>Xenopus</italic> Gwl is directly activated by cyclin B-Cdc2 and is in turn needed to promote full activation of cyclin B-Cdc2, although the direct target(s) mediating this action is (are) still unknown and indeed no substrates of Gwl are yet known. The primary sequence of Gwl shows that the regions most homologous to other kinases are split by a long intervening sequence of unknown function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Despite this recent progress, nothing is known about how activity of this crucial kinase is coordinated with the multiple events of cell cycle progression. Moreover, it is not known how Gwl contributes to the different types of mitotic and meiotic cell cycles of a metazoan.</p><p>Elucidation of protein function may be aided through the generation of multiple mutant alleles that can reveal separate functions of individual proteins in multiple cellular processes. <italic>Drosophila</italic> offers the possibility of such studies and, moreover, allows the study of protein function in different types of cell cycle during its development. We applied this principle to study the gene defined by <italic>Scant</italic> (<italic>Scott of the Antarctic</italic>), a gain-of-function, dominant enhancer of maternal-effect embryonic defects of <italic>polo</italic> mutants. Syncytial embryos derived from females heterozygous for both <italic>Scant</italic> and <italic>polo</italic> develop mitotic defects in which a centrosome disassociates from one pole &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Here we report that the <italic>Scant</italic> mutation is an allele of <italic>gwl</italic> that introduces a K97M amino-acid substitution into the Gwl protein; this results in a hyperactive kinase with altered specificity in vitro. Our results indicate an antagonistic relationship between Gwl and Polo and suggest that their activity has to be coordinated for proper embryonic mitotic function. An allelic series of new <italic>gwl</italic> mutations reveals multiple functions for the Gwl kinase in both mitosis and female meiosis. These display somatic developmental defects accompanied by chromosome condensation and segregation defects in larval neuroblasts. <italic>gwl<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> encodes two isoforms, only one of which is expressed during vitellogenesis. An allele that specifically prevents the expression of this isoform reveals requirements for Gwl in meiosis and in the maternal contribution to the egg.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>Scant</italic>, a Dominant Enhancer of <italic>polo</italic> Maternal Effect Lethality, Is an Allele of <italic>greatwall</italic></title><p><italic>Scant</italic> is an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutation on the right arm of Chromosome III that causes greatly reduced female fertility when heterozygous with <italic>polo<sup>1</sup></italic> (on 3L).

One recombinant that retained the dominant <italic>Scant</italic> interaction but was recessive female fertile was recovered; this and its derivatives were used in all the experiments reported here.</p><p><italic>Scant</italic> is a dominant enhancer of <italic>polo</italic> female sterility for all <italic>polo</italic> alleles, though the strength of the interaction varies with the defectiveness of the <italic>polo</italic> allele. <italic>Scant</italic> was originally described in combination with <italic>polo<sup>1</sup></italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, a hypomorphic allele; <italic>polo<sup>1</sup></italic> homozygotes are viable though females are completely sterile. Typically, <italic>polo<sup>1</sup> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; Scant</italic> females produce 4&#x00025; as many progeny as controls, but <italic>polo<sup>11</sup> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; Scant</italic> and <italic>Df(3L)rdgC-co2, polo<sup>&#x02212;</sup> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; Scant</italic> females are completely sterile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). <italic>polo<sup>11</sup></italic> is a breakpoint allele, <italic>In(3L)polo<sup>11</sup></italic>, 77E1&#x02013;3;77E1&#x02013;2 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030200-se001">Text S1</xref>), and therefore probably amorphic; homozygotes are prepupal lethal. This suggests that the interaction depends on how much functional maternal Polo protein is available in the egg. However, the reciprocal question&#x02014;whether the interaction depends on how much functional Scant protein is in the egg&#x02014;cannot be asked; <italic>Scant</italic> is not only homozygous viable and fertile, it is viable and fertile over all deficiencies of its region, and none of these deficiencies affect fertility of heterozygous <italic>polo</italic> mutations. This suggests that the <italic>Scant</italic> mutation is hypermorphic or neomorphic. If it is, then the dominant interaction with <italic>polo</italic> mutations should be alleviated by mutations that inactivate its gene, and those mutations may have recessive phenotypes that can be deficiency mapped. We therefore recovered <italic>Scant</italic> revertants by mutagenizing homozygous males with X rays, mating them to <italic>polo<sup>11</sup>/Balancer</italic> females, and testing the <italic>&#x0002b; Scant&#x0002a;/polo<sup>11</sup> &#x0002b;</italic> daughters for fertility.

The chromosome carrying the second-site suppressor complements the recessive phenotypes of the third class.</p><p><italic>Sr3</italic> is homozygous viable with eclosion delay; the adults have variably rough eyes, eroded wing margins, and missing bristles, all symptoms of mitotic defects, and both sexes are sterile with strongly reduced gonads. There are few germ cells even in newly eclosed adults; none remain a few days later. <italic>Sr6</italic> homozygotes die as pupae but this reflects a second lethal on its chromosome; <italic>Sr3/Sr6</italic> adults eclose, with the above constellation of phenotypes, though viability is reduced. Viability of <italic>Sr3</italic> and <italic>Sr6</italic> is further reduced over noncomplementing deficiencies, so the allelic series is <italic>Sr3</italic> (hypomorph), <italic>Sr6</italic> (more defective hypomorph), deficiency (see below). We sequentially uncovered the two recessive <italic>Sr</italic> alleles by three deficiencies: the first extends from 91A8 to 91F5; the second from 91B4 to 91D3; and finally between genome sites 14566000 and 14750000 (<italic>Df(3R)Exel6181, </italic>91C5;91D5). This restricts <italic>Scant</italic> to one of 16 potential genes in an interval of 185 kb.</p><p>To further refine the <italic>Sr</italic> mapping, we mobilized four different viable <italic>P</italic>-element insertions in or near this 185-kb region to generate imprecise excisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g001">Figure 1</xref>C; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030200-se001">Text S1</xref>) with delta 2&#x02013;3 transposase. All progeny receiving the hopping <italic>P</italic>-element chromosome were crossed either to <italic>Df(3R)Exel6181</italic> or <italic>Sr3</italic>. This allowed us to determine whether a lethal excision had occurred or whether an excision or hop failed to complement the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Scant revertant</named-content>. One particular line, <italic>gwl <sup>EP515</sup></italic>, whose <italic>P</italic> element is inserted 217 bp 5&#x02032; of <italic>gwl</italic> and 12 bp 5&#x02032; of <italic>CG7718</italic>, yielded several hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Complementation tests define three groups of mutations: (1) three independent events <italic>(gwl<sup>2</sup></italic>, <italic>gwl<sup>3a</sup></italic>, and <italic>gwl<sup>6a</sup>)</italic> that fail to complement <italic>Sr3</italic>; (2) three independent events <italic>(CG7718<sup>1</sup></italic>, <italic>CG7718<sup>6b</sup></italic>, and <italic>CG7718<sup>7</sup>)</italic> that complement <italic>Sr3</italic> but fail to complement each other; and (3), one event <italic>(gwl<sup>3b</sup>)</italic> that fails to complement mutations of both groups. PCR revealed that the <italic>gwl</italic> gene is disrupted in mutations of the first group from imprecise excision extending in one direction. <italic>CG7718</italic> is disrupted in the second group from imprecise excision extending in the other direction. Finally, both <italic>gwl</italic> and <italic>CG7718</italic> are disrupted in the third event; the imprecise excision extends in both directions. The failure of <italic>gwl<sup>2</sup></italic>, <italic>gwl<sup>3a</sup></italic>, and <italic>gwl<sup>6a</sup></italic> to complement <named-content content-type="genus-species">Scant revertant</named-content> alleles suggests that the <italic>Scant</italic> mutation affects the <italic>gwl</italic> gene; this was confirmed by sequencing <italic>gwl</italic> in them (see &#x0201c;<italic>Scant</italic> Encodes a Hyperactive Gwl Kinase with Altered Specificity&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;The Allelic Series of Recessive <italic>gwl</italic> Alleles Reveals Multiple Mitotic Functions&#x0201d; below). <italic>gwl<sup>2</sup></italic> and <italic>gwl<sup>3a</sup></italic> are probably deletions into <italic>gwl</italic>, and <italic>gwl<sup>6a</sup></italic> clearly is; both 5&#x02032; upstream sequence and N-terminal coding sequence have been deleted. All three of these small deletions give escapers homozygous and over deficiencies on nutritious food, with the <italic>Sr</italic> constellation of phenotypes. Thus, the <italic>gwl</italic> gene is not absolutely vital.</p><p>Finally, we carried out a second X-ray mutagenesis, now of a <italic>polo<sup>11</sup> Scant</italic> recombinant chromosome made from the fertile <italic>polo<sup>11</sup>/Dp(polo<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) Scant</italic> females and tested over a third-chromosome balancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030200-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). This gave ten positives, all of class three; four are cytologically visible deficiencies each of which removes all or part of 91C5&#x02013;6 (plus more), one is a translocation with one breakpoint in 91C, and the remaining five have no obvious relevant cytological defect. For two of these, all or part of the <italic>gwl</italic> gene fail to PCR up, so they are probably additional deletions. All seven of these fail to complement <italic>Sr3</italic> for both phenotype and viability. The final three, <italic>Sr17</italic>, <italic>Sr19</italic>, and <italic>Sr18</italic>, complement <italic>Sr3</italic> and deficiencies for phenotype but females have reduced fertility or are sterile. <italic>Sr17</italic> and <italic>Sr19</italic> also have reduced viability over <italic>Sr3</italic> in the presence of <italic>polo<sup>11</sup></italic> and some DNA defect 5&#x02032; of the <italic>gwl</italic> coding region (probably an insertion based on PCR, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030200-se001">Text S1</xref>).

In contrast, <italic>polo<sup>11</sup> Scant/&#x0002b; &#x0002b;</italic>-derived embryos show an initial detachment of one centrosome early in mitosis, before nuclear envelope breakdown. All 33 cases where the filming was continuous from before the centrosome detached show that the detachment occurs prior to nuclear envelope breakdown and involves only one centrosome. The free centrosome drifts away from the nucleus, and astral microtubule formation usually appears normal, though there is no asymmetric microtubule enhancement. A half-spindle is established by microtubules forming connections between the chromosomes and the centrosome still associated with the nuclear envelope. However, spindle bipolarity is often attained by microtubules growing from the chromosomes outwards. If a free centrosome is sufficiently close to this second half-spindle, it can reattach to it to form a normal bipolar spindle containing two centrosomes and nuclear division completes normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g003">Figure 3</xref>A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030200-sv002">Video S2</xref>). However, if the free centrosome drifts too far away from its spindle, it cannot be recaptured, and the monoastral spindle that forms initially is unfocussed at the pole lacking a centrosome. In some cases, monoastral bipolar spindles fuse with neighboring spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g003">Figure 3</xref>B; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030200-sv002">Video S2</xref>) and degenerate to give interconnecting arrays of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).

We therefore made transgenic flies expressing either the longer isoform of Gwl-Wt or Gwl-K97M (otherwise identical to wild type) under the control of the <italic>UASp</italic> promotor, driven by Gal4 expressed from the <italic>maternal</italic> &#x003b1;<italic>-tubulin</italic> promotor (<italic>Mat</italic> &#x003b1;<italic>-Tub Gal4</italic>).

Female germline expression of Gwl-K97M in <italic>polo<sup>11</sup>/polo<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> heterozygotes causes complete sterility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g004">Figure 4</xref>A).

Overexpression of Gwl-wt in heterozygous <italic>polo<sup>11</sup>/polo<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> females allows partial egg hatch (around 4&#x00025;), and these embryos also show loss of centrosomes from spindles in early syncytial divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g004">Figure 4</xref>BIII).

Myc-Gwl phosphorylates myelin basic protein and casein more efficiently than histones H1 or H3, although the signals are only marginally increased above the K87R, presumably kinase-dead, control (the K87R mutation may not effectively abolish the kinase activity or phosphorylation could result from traces of copurifying kinases). Myc-Gwl-K97M specifically phosphorylates myelin basic protein with dramatically increased efficiency, while showing only slight increases for casein and H1 and no increase for H3. This high activity on myelin basic protein was repeatedly observed despite the lower amount of kinase present in the reaction for Myc-Gwl-K97M compared with Myc-Gwl or Myc-Gwl-KD. Indeed we found that Gwl-K97M was reproducibly expressed at a lower level than its WT equivalent in several independent stable cell lines. This suggests that the hyperactive K97M mutation is toxic to the cell line used, so the only stable transformants that survive are those that can keep it downregulated. Both our genetic and biochemical results show that the <italic>Scant</italic> mutation (Gwl-K97M) results in a hyperactive enzyme with altered specificity.</p><p>Taken together, several pieces of evidence indicate that Gwl and Polo have antagonistic activities in the early embryo. The <italic>Scant</italic> phenotype is not seen in the presence of wild-type levels of <italic>polo</italic>, and its strength is dependent upon the strength of the mutant <italic>polo</italic> allele. The failure of embryos to develop upon overexpression of overactive Gwl-K97M and, to a lesser extent, of Gwl-wt, is strongly dependent on reduced Polo dosage.

This short deletion maps to the predicted kinase fold in the N-terminal portion (not shown). The <italic>gwl<sup>Sr3</sup></italic> allele is a hypomorph since <italic>gwl<sup>Sr3</sup>/gwl<sup>Sr3</sup></italic> is more viable than <italic>gwl<sup>Sr3</sup>/Df;</italic> and <italic>gwl<sup>Sr3</sup>/Df</italic> is in turn more viable than <italic>gwl<sup>null</sup>/Df</italic>. This predicts that the kinase encoded by the <italic>gwl<sup>Sr3</sup></italic> allele retains some activity. However, western blots of extracts of <italic>gwl<sup>Sr3</sup>/Df</italic> larval brains reveal little or no protein, suggesting that the protein encoded by <italic>gwl<sup>Sr3</sup></italic> is unstable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). <italic>gwl<sup>Sr6</sup></italic> has an A to T substitution that changes lysine 689 into the ochre termination codon (STOP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). <italic>gwl<sup>Sr6</sup></italic> also behaves as a hypomorphic allele suggesting either that this STOP codon can be suppressed to some extent or that the truncated protein retains partial function.

Finally, the female-sterile-only allele<italic>, gwl<sup>Sr18</sup></italic>, has one base deleted in the splice acceptor sequence of exon 4. This change in sequence from AAAGGGCT to AAAGGCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) leaves the same splice-acceptor sequence but changes the reading frame after it to encode a string of 61 different amino acids followed by a series of STOP codons.

Therefore, the short form is sufficient for mitosis in general, and it is both necessary and sufficient for the mitotic divisions of germline cells in ovaries and testes. <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup>/Df</italic> females lay lots of eggs but they remain white; males are fertile. Since <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup></italic> produces eggs, the Gwl-long isoform has a specific role late, rather than early, in germline function.

In contrast, <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup>/Df</italic> females show a great reduction in Gwl signal in these tissues.

However, preliminary observations reveal that late (stages 13&#x02013;14) eggs often have irregularly distributed yolk, in no fixed pattern. Earlier stages have uniform yolk distribution but appear to have less of it than same-stage controls (our unpublished observations). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary comprises 15 or so ovarioles each containing multiple egg chambers at successive stages of development. Cystoblasts in the germaria of the ovarioles divide four times to form cysts of 16 cells that remain interconnected by ring canals derived from the cleavage furrows of incomplete cytokinesis. Of the two cells interconnected by four ring canals, one will become the oocyte although formation of synaptonemal complex is complete in both of them. Once the oocyte is determined, the other 15 cells undergo endoreduplication cycles and associated cell growth to become the nurse cells. The morphology of egg chambers of <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup></italic>/<italic>Df</italic> females appears normal; they have 15 nurse cells and one oocyte indicating that the preceding mitoses had progressed normally. We detect strong staining for Gwl (the antibody recognizes both isoforms) in wild-type egg chambers from stage 8 of oogenesis onwards but not in <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup></italic>/<italic>Df</italic> females (the faint signal in <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup></italic>/<italic>Df</italic> ovaries is probably Gwl-short present in the follicle cells surrounding the egg chamber but some may be background). In wild-type egg chambers, Gwl protein is present in the oocyte and four neighboring nurse cells; actin staining shows that all four nurse cells connect directly to the oocyte by ring canals and that they have the expected numbers of ring canals to be the oocyte's sister and daughters (four, three, two, and one; unpublished data). In each of these cells Gwl accumulates in the nucleus, although there is some cytoplasmic staining. The long isoform of Gwl is contributed maternally to the embryo where it also concentrates in interphase syncytial nuclei. During mitosis Gwl is depleted in the nucleus and enriched around the outside of the spindle envelope before accumulating in the nucleus once again during the next interphase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030200-sg007">Figure S7</xref>). Thus Gwl-long accumulates in a subset of polyploid nuclei of nurse cells, the prophase I nucleus of the oocyte and interphase nuclei of the embryo.</p><p>Gwl accumulation in the oocyte led us to ask whether <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup></italic>/<italic>Df</italic> oocytes encounter problems during meiosis per se. To examine female meiosis I, we performed immunostaining (for &#x003b1;-tubulin and DNA) in inactivated vitellarial eggs at stages 13 and 14. Wild-type oocytes normally arrest in metaphase I with the larger chromosomes with chiasmata compacted into a single mass at the metaphase plate, while the small fourth chromosomes have moved halfway to the poles as the result of distributive segregation (see <italic>WT</italic> control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g008">Figure 8</xref>Aa and &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;). We scored the number of DNA masses (ignoring the tiny fourth chromosome) in <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup></italic>/<italic>Df</italic> oocytes. In contrast to the <italic>WT</italic> oocytes, which mostly have only one DNA mass at the metaphase plate, 78&#x00025; of <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup></italic>/<italic>Df</italic> oocytes have widely scattered chromosomes, and the number of chromosome masses varies from two to 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). Complete homologue separation would give six large chromatin masses; about a quarter of the mutant meioses have more masses than that. Multiple chromatin masses might be caused by reduced meiotic exchange, or precocious loss of sister-chromatid cohesion, or broken chromosomes resulting possibly from faulty meiotic exchange. If meiosis I lacks chiasmata then metaphase I arrest does not occur &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, although in wild type anaphase I and II proceed precociously but normally; although some anaphase movements probably occur precociously in <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup>/Df</italic>, they are certainly not normal, so simple reduced exchange does not explain this phenotype though it could be compounded with other problems. A few of the meiotic spindles are aberrantly shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g008">Figure 8</xref>C; 8&#x00025; of the total oocytes), but all of the multipolar spindles contain multiple DNA masses. Since the wild-type spindle is nucleated from the central mass of chromatin in meiosis I, these abnormal spindles probably reflect nucleation of individual &#x0201c;mini-spindles&#x0201d; from the multiple chromosome masses.</p><fig id="pgen-0030200-g008" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Gwl Is Required for Female Meiosis</title><p>(A) Examples of meiotic defects observed in <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup>/Df</italic> oocytes.

Indeed it is these different modes of cell cycle regulation as development proceeds that allow us to tackle Gwl's multiple functions in cell division.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Gwl Antagonizes Polo</title><p>Our starting point was the strong genetic interaction between the <italic>Scant</italic> mutation and <italic>polo</italic> mutations; heterozygous females lay embryos that die, presumably as a consequence of mitotic failure whose first observed defect is that a single centrosome moves away from the nucleus before nuclear envelope breakdown in all cases examined. This centrosome misbehavior is probably the primary defect; developmental failure probably results from secondary defects of abnormal spindles. It will be interesting to reexamine the phenotype of other maternal-effect mutants showing free centrosomes to see if they disassociate from the nuclear envelope in the same manner. It will also be interesting to find out whether the detaching centrosome always contains either the older or the younger centriole, since they may harbor different amounts of biochemical factors in their pericentriolar material. If so, the history of the centrosome determines its vulnerability to detachment when the Gwl/Polo balance is compromised. The <italic>Scant-polo</italic> genetic interaction is moderately specific since a screen for mutants reverting the maternal-effect embryonic lethality generated only one third-site interactor among two independent <italic>polo</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> duplication events plus two revertants of the <italic>Scant</italic> allele itself. <italic>Scant</italic> encodes a Gwl kinase with a K97M substitution that results in hyperactivity in vitro (albeit with altered specificity on the artificial substrates tested); a wild-type transgene with just this amino acid mutated interacts dominantly with <italic>polo</italic> mutants, so this amino acid substitution is <italic>Scant</italic>. Moreover, mothers overexpressing wild-type Gwl kinase in the presence of reduced Polo kinase function produce embryos with the same kinds of defects as <italic>Scant</italic>. Therefore, the increased activity of Gwl-K97M and not its altered substrate specificity is responsible for the functional interaction between <italic>Scant</italic> and <italic>polo</italic>. It follows that a balance between Gwl and Polo activities in embryos is crucial, but because there does not seem to be any such interaction in cell cycles at later stages (in proliferating larval, pupal, or adult tissues), since <italic>polo<sup>11</sup> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; Scant</italic> itself has normal viability, the balance appears particularly important for these early embryonic cell cycles. The syncytial nuclear division cycles are unusual in that they comprise rapidly alternating cycles of S phase and M phase without intervening gap (either G1 or G2) phases. A G2 phase is only introduced following cellularization when String (the Cdc25 dual-specificity phosphatase that activates Cdk1) is degraded; its expression then comes under transcriptional regulation in a spatio-temporally defined pattern. The critical balance of Polo and Gwl kinase activities in the syncytium may reflect the absence of a G2 state; mitotic proteins are held on continual standby, awaiting their use in the next cycle, rather than being degraded and resynthesized each cell cycle as is the case for cycles with a G2. Alternatively, centrosome detachment may be frequent in other tissues of <italic>polo-Scant</italic> flies where it may be better tolerated. However, we consider this unlikely because we observe only normal centrosome positioning in <italic>polo-Scant</italic> testes (unpublished data).</p><p>This antagonism between Polo and Gwl was not predicted from studies of these enzymes in <italic>Xenopus</italic> cell-free systems, which have been used to model the entry into mitosis from G2 through the activation of the Cdc25 phosphatase.

This apparent cooperation of the two kinases in this process suggests that the <italic>Xenopus</italic> cell-free system may be assessing a different aspect of cell cycle progression than our in vivo studies on the syncytial cycles of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. The apparent differences in results may also reflect the different aspects of mitosis under study; activation of Cdk1 in one system and the integrity of the mitotic apparatus in the other. We have few clues about the directionality of the antagonism we observe for Polo and Gwl function in fly embryos or whether it involves direct interactions between the two protein kinases. Yu et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d; observed that xPlk1 is capable of phosphorylating xGwl, but they did not observe changes in xGwl activity or a synergistic effect in combination with cyclin B-Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation. However, any inhibitory effect of Polo kinase on Gwl need not be mediated through regulation of kinase activity but could also occur by regulating Gwl's localization or stability. In this case, reduced dosage of Polo in the fly embryo might provide only a subthreshold activity, insufficient for the efficient downregulation of the hyperactive Gwl kinase encoded by <italic>gwl<sup>Scant</sup></italic>. That Gwl needs to be downregulated is suggested by its subcellular localization in mitosis. Gwl is enriched in the nucleus in interphase, but it is excluded from the nucleus during prophase, before nuclear envelope breakdown. This could occur through active nuclear export or through degradation. In favor of the latter, we observe that Gwl is ubiquitinated (our unpublished observations).</p><p>Gwl could also inhibit the function of Polo. Our in vitro experiments suggest that Gwl does not readily phosphorylate Polo (unpublished observations), but it is also possible that phosphorylation of an intermediate substrate by Gwl mediates the hypothetical inhibitory effect. Since <italic>Scant</italic> causes a decrease in female fertility that is stronger in stronger <italic>polo</italic> mutant alleles, and the meiotic divisions occur in the embryonic cytoplasm, it is possible that <italic>Scant</italic> lowers Polo's activity during meiosis. Scott Hawley and colleagues have recently observed a functional interaction between <italic>polo</italic> and <italic>matrimony</italic> (<italic>mtrm</italic>); heterozygous <italic>mtrm/&#x0002b;</italic> females have an elevated frequency of chromosome nondisjunction in meiosis, and this is suppressed by lowering the <italic>polo</italic> dosage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, if <italic>Scant</italic> acts to lower Polo's activity in female meiosis, then <italic>Scant</italic> might suppress the increased level of nondisjunction in <italic>mtrm</italic> heterozygotes. Indeed it does (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030200-st001">Tables S1</xref>-4), though <italic>Scant</italic> needs to be homozygous for the suppression to be detectable, so the possibility that this suppression reflects homozygosity of some closely linked third player rather than <italic>Scant</italic> itself cannot be eliminated (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030200-se002">Text S2</xref>). Furthermore, even in <italic>Scant/Scant</italic>, the suppression of <italic>mtrm/&#x0002b;</italic> is much weaker than halving the dosage of <italic>polo<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> directly. This is consistent with the effects of <italic>Scant</italic> on fertility; homozygous <italic>Scant</italic> in a homozygous <italic>polo<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> background is much more fertile than <italic>polo<sup>11</sup> Scant/&#x0002b; &#x0002b;</italic>, so regardless of how <italic>Scant</italic> acts to reduce the functional level of <italic>polo<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>, one copy of <italic>Scant</italic> does not reduce the activity of one copy of <italic>polo<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> completely. Nevertheless, the <italic>Scant-mtrm</italic> interaction result strongly suggests that the <italic>polo-Scant</italic> (and probably <italic>polo-gwl</italic>) interaction occurs during female meiosis as well as embryonic mitosis, and the unexpected <italic>Scant-mtrm</italic> interaction lowering female fertility implies a role for <italic>mtrm</italic> in embryogenesis.</p><p>That Gwl downregulates Polo's function in the embryo is also suggested by the cellular phenotype, which is in line with the known functions of Polo at the centrosome. Moreover, the <italic>Scant</italic> phenotype is increased by the severity of the <italic>polo</italic> mutant. Occasional displacement of centrosomes early in mitosis is seen in syncytial embryos derived from heterozygous <italic>polo</italic> mutant females themselves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030200-sg002">Figure S2</xref>), and Polo promotes centrosome separation, maturation, and integrity. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Polo phosphorylates Asp and together they promote the recruitment of &#x003b3;-tubulin to the centrosome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. In mammalian cells, Plk1 phosphorylates Nlp, triggering its dissociation from the centrosome and recruitment of several factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b022">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Plk1 also phosphorylates Kizuna, which is required to preserve centrosome cohesion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. The detached centrosomes observed in the <italic>polo-Scant</italic>-derived embryos do not show a reduction in &#x003b3;-tubulin staining, and astral microtubules nucleate normally. Similar centrosome detachment was observed in <italic>Scant/&#x0002b;</italic> and <italic>Scant/Scant</italic>-derived embryos, albeit with much lower frequencies. Therefore, it seems likely that the partial loss of Polo activity and the gain of Gwl activity both weaken centrosome function in a similar fashion; this is consistent with the mutually antagonistic interaction between <italic>polo</italic> and <italic>Scant</italic> mutations. Furthermore, we note that centrosome detachment occurs before nuclear envelope breakdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g003">Figure 3</xref>), a time when both Polo and Gwl are enriched around the nuclear envelope in syncytial embryos (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d; and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030200-sg007">Figure S7</xref>). This suggests that coordination between the centrosome, microtubules, and the nuclear envelope before nuclear envelope breakdown is sensitive to the balance between Polo and Gwl. Gwl (or cyclin B-Cdk1, which it activates in frog extracts) may share substrates with Polo and regulate them antagonistically in early mitosis.</p><p>Centrosome loss can also occur in response to DNA damage, allowing damaged nuclei to fall into the interior of the syncytial embryo and be discarded from the developing fly &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. This response depends on Mnk/Chk2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. The centrosome detachment observed in <italic>polo-Scant</italic>-derived embryos does not depend on Chk2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030200-sg003">Figure S3</xref>) and thus seems to arise from a more direct effect on the centrosome&#x02013;nuclear envelope association.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Gwl Controls Chromosome Dynamics in Mitosis</title><p>Our hypomorphic <italic>gwl</italic> mutants do not appear to impact directly upon centrosome behavior in the more conventional cell cycles of the larval central nervous system. Previously, Yu and colleagues reported a long delay in late G2 to anaphase in <italic>gwl</italic> mutant neuroblasts in addition to chromatin condensation defects &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; and have suggested that these defects, particularly undercondensation of chromatin, could all be attributed to the function of Gwl in activating cyclin B-Cdk1, although no direct substrate of Gwl is known &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the prevalence of condensation defects and anaphase bridges that we observed in <italic>gwl</italic> mutant neuroblasts, together with the nuclear localization of Gwl in interphase, suggests to us that Gwl may act directly at the chromosome level. The anaphase bridges observed could be a consequence of tangled chromatids or dicentric chromosomes resulting from telomere fusion or other aberrant DNA damage repair events. When Gwl is depleted from cultured cells, they delay at the spindle assembly checkpoint with high levels of cyclin B and checkpoint proteins at kinetochores. The chromosomes of these cells are scattered upon an elongated spindle as though they have defects in kinetochore function. Since metaphase cells with highly condensed chromosomes accumulate in the larval CNS of <italic>gwl</italic> mutants, prolonged checkpoint arrest probably also occurs here. However, the polyploid cells seen in the null mutant indicate that cells can slip past the checkpoint without segregating their chromosomes; since this also happens in wild-type neuroblasts in the presence of colchicine, polyploidy is probably not a direct consequence of Gwl failure.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Gwl Is Needed for Sister Chromatid Cohesion in Meiosis</title><p>A major role for Gwl kinase in regulating aspects of chromosome behavior is also suggested by the meiotic phenotype seen in <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup>/Df</italic> females. <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup></italic> disrupts the only form of Gwl expressed during vitellogenesis without disrupting the second mitotic isoform of Gwl. Therefore <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup></italic> provides a unique opportunity to study how loss of Gwl kinase affects vitellogenesis and meiosis. Although <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup>/Df</italic> ovaries develop normally, yolk distribution is abnormal in stages 13&#x02013;14, females are sterile, and the severe meiotic defects include scattered chromosomes with separated chromatids and elongated spindles.</p><p>Scattered chromosomes could result from a number of problems. One possibility is that Gwl is required for proper meiotic recombination; if so, the multiple DNA masses observed could correspond to chromosome fragments resulting from failure to complete chromatid exchange and to repair double-strand breaks. This would also lead to failure to arrest at metaphase I because bivalents would not be held together by chiasmata &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. This is unlikely for several reasons. First, if the masses were fragmented chromosomes, they should vary widely in size; they do not. Second, Gwl accumulates in the oocyte nucleus and the nuclei of the nurse cells directly connected to the oocyte at (but not before) stage 8, which is much later than the time of meiotic recombination. However, we note that if Gwl is involved in meiotic recombination, the tiny amounts of it present in pachytene (germarial) nuclei could be below the detection limit of our antibody. Third, two of the five nuclei that accumulate Gwl never entered pachytene. Finally, our FISH data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g009">Figure 9</xref>) prove that chromatid cohesion fails in <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup></italic> oocytes, and this is sufficient to account for the scattering of DNA masses observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030200-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The number of DNA masses was often higher than six, the maximum expected number for disassociated bivalent chromosomes, disregarding the tiny fourth chromosomes. Therefore, Gwl is required for sister chromatid cohesion in meiosis I. In the absence of Gwl-long, the premature loss of (or failure to establish) arm cohesion would lead to the release of chiasmata if indeed any are formed.</p><p>However, neither of these defects alone is expected to lead to complete female sterility. For example, mutants in <italic>c(3)G</italic> prevent all meiotic recombination but are still partially fertile &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;.

While the dissolution of sister chromatid cohesion in <italic>ord</italic> leads to progression through metaphase I into meiosis II, we have seen no normal meiosis II figures in <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup></italic> oocytes, though it is possible that the elongated bipolar spindles represent attempts to do meiosis II after a failed anaphase I. Thus, the absence of Gwl-long in meiosis does not lead to a simple lack of meiotic recombination nor does it lead only to a premature dissolution of cohesion. The lack of Gwl could lead to a combination of both defects or to yet some other kind of defect that leads to full female sterility. Even if the occasional meiosis succeeds, it is very likely that these embryos would fail to develop because maternal Gwl-long is expected to be required for early embryonic mitoses; indeed, these embryos fail to reach cellular blastoderm<bold>.</bold></p><p>Most female meioses in <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup></italic> have scattered chromosomes on a single elongated spindle; we think that the minority (8&#x00025;) that have multiple bundles of spindle are just the extreme of this scattering, since microtubules are nucleated by the chromatin in the acentriolar oocyte &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Failure of karyosome formation might cause this scattering; however, oocytes of earlier stages do at least often form a single karyosome (unpublished data).

A mutant disrupting the female germline-specific Cdk1-adaptor Cks30A disrupts the integrity of meiotic spindles in addition to showing chromosome alignment defects, but in this case the chromosome scattering observed is much more modest than that in the <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup></italic> mutant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>How does Gwl regulate sister chromatid cohesion? Our results suggest that Gwl antagonizes Polo, which is known to negatively regulate sister chromatid cohesion. It is therefore possible that the absence of Gwl during meiosis results in excessive and/or premature Polo activity, leading to premature loss of sister chromatid cohesion. In budding yeast, Polo (Cdc5) promotes the cleavage of the cohesin Scc1 by direct phosphorylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. In meiosis, sister chromatid cohesion is protected at centromeres until anaphase II by Mei-S332 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Shugoshin in other organisms; reviewed by &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;).

In budding yeast, Shugoshin prevents cleavage of the cohesin Rec8, which replaces Scc1 in meiosis (reviewed by &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;), and Cdc5 is required in meiosis for cleavage of Rec8 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.

Thus, the lack of Gwl in meiosis could lead to premature activity of Polo, which could negatively regulate Mei-S332 and lead to precocious sister separation in meiosis I. We have examined Mei-S332&#x02032;s localization in <italic>gwl<sup>Sr18</sup></italic> hemizygous oocytes and found that Mei-S332 was largely properly localized to centromeres (unpublished data). However, Mei-S332 can be inactivated even when it remains localized at centromeres &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030200-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that Mei-S332 is being negatively regulated in the absence of Gwl. Alternatively, Gwl could promote sister chromatid cohesion by directly phosphorylating effectors of cohesion. Gwl-long is better than Gwl-short at performing a maternal function and we suspect that Gwl-long will be a better kinase for a yet unknown maternal substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Gwl Has Multiple Roles in Cell Division</title><p>In conclusion, it appears that Gwl, in common with the other major mitotic protein kinases, has multiple roles in mitotic and meiotic progression.

A gain-of-function allele of <italic>gwl</italic> reveals a requirement for coordinate activity of the Gwl and Polo kinases in the rapidly oscillating M and S phase cycles of early embryos.

Finally, loss of Gwl function in the female germline leads to severe meiotic abnormalities including loss of sister chromatid cohesion. It will be of interest to identify potential binding partners of the Gwl protein kinase both in interphase, when it is present predominantly in the nucleus, and in mitosis, when it moves out to the cytoplasm. This may in turn facilitate the identification of its substrates; this is crucial for understanding exactly how it regulates these various aspects of cell division.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Genetics.</title><p>The isolation of the <italic>Scant</italic> mutation, the generation of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Scant revertant</named-content> alleles by X-ray mutagenesis, and the mapping of <italic>Scant</italic> revertants and of <italic>Scant</italic> using complementation tests, imprecise excision of <italic>P</italic>-elements, and sequencing are all described in detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030200-se001">Text S1</xref>.

We used time-lapse to examine the cell cycle localization of Gwl-EGFP in embryos, using <italic>Mat</italic> &#x003b1;<italic>-Tub Gal4</italic> to drive expression in the germline. In syncytial embryos (left), Gwl-EGFP is concentrated in the nucleus in interphase and concentrated around the nucleus in early mitosis, presumably before nuclear envelope breakdown (the arrow indicates the direction of the mitotic wave). In cellularized blastoderm, Gwl-EGFP is also concentrated in the nucleus in interphase (T<sub>0</sub>), but then becomes concentrated around the nuclear envelope and largely disappears from the nucleus (below cytoplasmic levels) shortly before nuclear division (9&#x02013;12 min). It then becomes more evenly distributed throughout the cell, presumably after the nuclear envelope has become broken or fenestrated (12&#x02013;18 min). Gwl-EGFP becomes clearly nuclear again at the end of nuclear division (21&#x02013;23 min). Gwl-K97M-EGFP behaves identically to Gwl-EGFP (unpublished data), ruling out the possibility that the genetic effect of <italic>Scant</italic> (on <italic>polo</italic> mutants) could be due to abnormal subcellular localization of Gwl caused by the K97M substitution. This localization pattern suggests that Gwl is being actively imported into the nucleus in interphase and either degraded in the nucleus or exported to the cytoplasm in early mitosis.</p><p>(2.6 MB PPT)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0030200.sg007.ppt" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0030200-st001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Progeny from Females with Normal X Chromosomes and the Indicated Third-Chromosome Genotype Crossed to <italic>Y<sup>S</sup>X.Y<sup>L</sup>, v f B/0; C(4)RM, ci ey<sup>R</sup>/0</italic> Males</title><p>Parental crosses were <italic>FM7/&#x0002b;; sr Scant</italic> females x <italic>y w/Y; mtrm<sup>13</sup>/TM3<sub>13</sub></italic> or <italic>y w/y<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Y; mtrm<sup>126</sup>/TM3<sub>126</sub></italic> males and <italic>FM7/Df(1)p116D, w</italic> females by both genotypes of <italic>mtrm</italic> males. <italic>y w/w Df</italic> females from the latter cross produce only half the expected number of regular males, since the deficiency is recessive lethal; for these progeny, the number of regular males has been doubled (parentheses) before calculating gametic frequencies.
