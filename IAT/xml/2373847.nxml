Intriguingly, semaphorins have recently been implicated in cancer progression (Neufeld, G., T. Lange, A. Varshavsky, and O. Kessler. 2007. <italic>Adv. Exp. Med. Biol.</italic> 600:118&#x02013;131). In particular, semaphorin 3B (SEMA3B) is considered a putative tumor suppressor, and yet we found that it is expressed at high levels in many invasive and metastatic human cancers. By investigating experimental tumor models, we confirmed that SEMA3B expression inhibited tumor growth, whereas metastatic dissemination was surprisingly increased. We found that SEMA3B induced the production of interleukin (IL) 8 by tumor cells by activating the p38&#x02013;mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in a neuropilin 1&#x02013;dependent manner. Silencing the expression of endogenous SEMA3B in tumor cells impaired IL-8 transcription. The release of IL-8, in turn, induced the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages and metastatic dissemination to the lung, which could be rescued by blocking IL-8 with neutralizing antibodies. In conclusion, we report that SEMA3B exerts unexpected functions in cancer progression by fostering a prometastatic environment through elevated IL-8 secretion and recruitment of macrophages coupled to the suppression of tumor growth.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: ATF-2, activating transcription factor 2; CDKI, cytokine-dependent kinase inhibitor; CM, conditioned medium; EV, empty vector; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MCP-1, monocyte chemotactic protein 1; NP, neuropilin; RNAi, RNA interference; SEMA3B, semaphorin 3B; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; TAM, tumor-associated macrophage; TUNEL, Tdt-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.</p></fn><fn><p>L.

Moreover, several semaphorins have been implicated in angiogenesis, immune function, and cancer (for reviews see references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>).</p><p>The functional role of semaphorins in tumor progression is still controversial. For example, semaphorin 3B (<italic>SEMA3B</italic>) and the homologous gene <italic>SEMA3F</italic> have been indicated as putative tumor suppressors because they are both located in the chromosomal region 3p21.3, a locus frequently deleted or hypermethylated in lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). SEMA3B and SEMA3F can furthermore inhibit tumor proliferation in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) Moreover, SEMA3F has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and metastatic dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>).</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that semaphorin function is mediated by a family of plasma membrane receptors, the plexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). However, most secreted semaphorins (including SEMA3B) do not bind directly to plexins but instead interact with plexin-associated coreceptors, denoted neuropilin (NP) 1 and 2. Moreover, NPs directly bind vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members and associate in complex with VEGF receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), playing a crucial role in angiogenesis beyond axon guidance (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). SEMA3B interacts with both NP1 and NP2, whereas little is known about the requirement of specific plexins in the receptor complex. In general, different plexins of the A subfamily seem to be functionally redundant in mediating semaphorin signaling in association with the NPs.</p><p>Interestingly, SEMA3B has been shown to exert dual functions in the guidance of cortical axons, acting either as an attractant or a repellant on diverse neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). This finding is consistent with that reported for other family members and suggests that semaphorins may have antagonistic functions, depending on the target cells. This is particularly important in cancer biology, because tumors are known to be multifaceted tissues comprising several regulatory cells, in addition to tumor cells. Intriguingly, although previous experiments have analyzed SEMA3B activity on tumor cell proliferations, its potential effects on metastatic dissemination have not been addressed. We report that although expression of SEMA3B in tumor cells may delay tumor growth, it also promotes metastatic dissemination. Our data indicate that this activity of SEMA3B is mediated by NP1-dependent activation of p38&#x02013;mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), leading to the induction of p21 growth-inhibitory protein, as well as of the prometastatic cytokine IL-8. Moreover, we found that IL-8 activity is required to mediate the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and metastatic dissemination in SEMA3B-expressing tumors.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>SEMA3B is commonly expressed in human cancer cells</title><p>Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) have indicated SEMA3B as a putative tumor suppressor whose expression may be lost in cancer cells. Surprisingly, in a screen of &#x0003e;25 human tumor-derived cell lines, we found significantly high levels of SEMA3B mRNA in cells derived from different kinds of tumors, including some of metastatic origin such as colon carcinoma (LoVo), mammary carcinoma (SKBR-3), and melanomas (Sk-Mel-2 and MALME-3M; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). We confirmed the expression of SEMA3B receptors NP1 and 2, as well as multiple plexins, in these cells (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072509/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072509/DC1</ext-link>; and not depicted); however, we did not observe any significant (direct or inverse) correlation between SEMA3B expression and that of potential receptors in tumor cells. To investigate further a putative correlation between SEMA3B expression and tumor progression, we analyzed three distinct datasets derived from microarray gene expression profiling in breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), and malignant melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Surprisingly, we could not observe any direct correlation between low SEMA3B expression and poor patient survival; instead, high levels of SEMA3B seemed to associate with metastatic progression in a subset of lung carcinomas (P &#x0003d; 0.0062; Fig. S2 C). Importantly, malignant melanomas were found to express strikingly high levels of SEMA3B compared with benign nevi (P &#x0003d; 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). This is consistent with our finding that established melanoma cell lines express high SEMA3B levels (e.g., Sk-Mel-2, MALME-3M, and UACC-257 in Fig. S1 A). Moreover, Hoek et al. reported a sixfold induction of SEMA3B gene expression in primary malignant melanoma cells compared with normal melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>SEMA3B is significantly expressed in human cancers.</bold> (A) SEMA3B expression levels were measured by real-time PCR in 26 different human tumor cell lines, including colorectal carcinomas (HT-29, LoVo, SV80, HCT 116, and Difi), breast adenocarcinomas (SK-BR3, MDA-MB231, and T47D), osteosarcoma cells (U2OS, KHOS-NP, Saos-2, and MG-63), prostate adenocarcinomas (PC-3 and DU145), and melanomas (Sk-Mel-2, UACC-257, MALME-3M, and MDA-MB435; reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), as well as gastric carcinoma (GTL-16), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa), chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562), pancreatic cancer (SUIT-2), histiocytic lymphoma (U-937), neuroblastoma (IMR5), and nonsmall-cell lung carcinoma (A549). A Taqman probe for human <italic>&#x003b2;-actin</italic> was used as the internal control for each sample. SEMA3B expression levels in cancer cells were then normalized to the mean (REF &#x0003d; 1; dashed line) of values obtained in three different nontumor immortalized cell lines (mammary epithelial cells [MCF-10A], mesothelial cells [Met-5A], and retinal pigmented epithelium [RPE]).

The dashed line indicates the threshold of detection call. None of the nonmalignant samples expressed SEMA3B above the detection confidence threshold, whereas semaphorin expression is high in most melanoma samples (P &#x0003d; 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2051155f01"></graphic></fig><p>These findings seemed to challenge the idea that SEMA3B functions as a tumor suppressor and prompted us to experimentally test in vivo the functional role of SEMA3B in cancer progression and metastasis.

Moreover, in accordance with previous data on MDA-MB435 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), we found that NP1 receptor expressed in tumor cells was likely implicated to mediate this autocrine effect, because NP1-blocking antibodies could rescue SEMA3B-induced growth inhibition, whereas RNA interference (RNAi)&#x02013;mediated suppression of NP2 could not (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072509/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072509/DC1</ext-link>). Notably, we found no evidence of increased cell apoptosis in vitro upon SEMA3B expression, nor that SEMA3B expression significantly affected tumor cell motility or cell scattering in vitro (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>SEMA3B-expressing tumors display reduced growth but increased metastatic dissemination.</bold> (A) MDA-MB435 (MDA) and A549 cells transduced to express SEMA3B (3B) or a noncoding EV were grown in culture for 4 d in 1% FBS.

Tumor volume was periodically measured, and tumor weight was determined upon dissection at the end of the experiment. Tumor xenografts expressing SEMA3B displayed a significant reduction in volume and tumor burden (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>), yet they were surprisingly associated with a remarkable increase of spontaneous metastatic dissemination to the lungs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). The metastatic potential was quantified by scoring macrometastasis in the lungs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>, left). Moreover, we found that the ratio between the number of metastatic foci and the size of respective primary tumors was increased &#x0003e;10 times in SEMA3B-expressing tumors versus controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>, right), indicating a strong increase in the metastatic potential of tumor cells. SEMA3B expression was confirmed in primary tumors by the immunostaining of cryostat sections (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>, top) and by Western blot analysis of protein lysates from tumor samples (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>, bottom). SEMA3B expression was also detected in metastatic cells by immunostaining (unpublished data), ruling out that they represented a selected subpopulation of cells that have lost SEMA3B expression.</p><p>To confirm the specificity of these effects, we expressed SEMA3B under the control of an rTTA- and doxycycline-inducible promoter in A549 cells. This system allowed us to obtain drug-regulated expression of SEMA3B in tumor xenografts in vivo. Notably, low levels of SEMA3B were detected in tumors in the absence of the drug, whereas they greatly increased upon treatment with doxycycline (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>, top). Semaphorin levels in xenografts correlated directly with the metastatic potential and inversely with the tumor burden (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>, bottom).</p></sec><sec><title>Tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis in SEMA3B-expressing tumors</title><p>We hypothesized that the inhibition of tumor growth by SEMA3B could be accounted for by a primary effect on cell proliferation, consistent with our data in vitro. To reliably answer this question, we analyzed tumors of comparable size taken 15 d after transplant. Consistent with in vitro observations, SEMA3B-expressing tumor cells showed a &#x0003e;60% reduction in proliferation rate when transplanted in vivo (as assessed by anti&#x02013;human Ki-67 staining; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), whereas apoptosis was only moderately increased (detected by Tdt-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling [TUNEL]; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>); these results were further confirmed by analyzing tumors at a later stage (30 d; not depicted). Double-staining experiments with markers of endothelia and TAMs did not detect a significant number of mouse stromal cells undergoing apoptosis (unpublished data), consistent with those that were essentially represented by tumor cells. Because it has been shown previously that other semaphorins can inhibit VEGF-induced angiogenesis (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), we asked whether SEMA3B could similarly mediate inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. We could not find any significant difference in vessel area, as measured by lectin-perfused vessels, between SEMA3B xenografts and controls in tumors of comparable size (15 d after transplant); notably, the number of vessels was slightly increased in SEMA3B-expressing xenografts compared with controls, suggesting that vessel structure was altered (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). However reduced angiogenesis was unlikely to be primarily responsible for delayed tumor growth. We observed a 25% reduction of angiogenesis in tumors expressing SEMA3B at later stages (day 30), when they had become remarkably smaller than controls (unpublished data). Moreover, in SEMA3B-expressing tumors, we observed notable defects of pericyte recruitment to blood vessels compared with control xenografts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis in SEMA3B-expressing tumors.</bold> (A) Control or SEMA3B-expressing tumors (15 d after transplant) were immunostained to reveal KI-67 proliferation markers (red), whereas nuclei were visualized by DAPI (blue).

We thus stably transduced various tumor cells expressing medium to high levels of SEMA3B (i.e., A549, HeLa, LoVo, and Sk-Mel-2 cells) with constructs expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting SEMA3B (shSEMA3B) or control unrelated sequences (shCTR).

To this end, we exploited neutralizing antibodies (MAB208) to inhibit IL-8 function in vivo, as successfully done in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). MDA-EV and MDA-3B tumor xenografts were treated with MAB208 or with an irrelevant control antibody from the same day of transplant and twice a week for a period of 2 wk by direct injection at the tumor site. Tumor volume was not significantly altered by MAB208 treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). In contrast, the increased recruitment of macrophages into tumors and the metastatic dissemination induced by SEMA3B were totally prevented by MAB208 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, C and B</xref>, respectively), whereas tumors treated with control antibody were not affected. Moreover, tumor angiogenesis in SEMA3B-expressing tumors was strongly reduced upon MAB208 treatment and associated with sites of residual macrophage infiltration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, D and E</xref>). In contrast, there was no significant reduction in control tumors. These findings suggested a putative antiangiogenic activity of SEMA3B, masked in vivo by increased IL-8 release. Notably, other class 3 semaphorins have been shown to repel endothelial cells and to inhibit angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). In fact, we could demonstrate a repelling activity of SEMA3B on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in co-culture experiments and migration assays in vitro, even if this inhibitory effect was partly mitigated by the autocrine secretion of IL-8 induced by the semaphorin (Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072509/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072509/DC1</ext-link>). Consistent with the reduced vascularization in SEMA3B-expressing tumors treated with MAB208, we also found a fourfold induction of apoptosis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 F</xref>), whereas tumors in all other conditions were not significantly affected.

In particular, <italic>SEMA3B</italic> is considered a putative tumor suppressor gene. In fact, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), we observed that SEMA3B is able to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro and delay the growth of tumor xenografts in nude mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A&#x02013;C</xref>). Based on these premises, high expression of SEMA3B in tumors may be thought to correlate with good patient prognosis and vice versa. However, by analyzing large datasets of human tumor samples, we could not find any statistically significant correlation between SEMA3B expression and patient survival. In contrast, our data indicated that subsets of tumors with elevated SEMA3B levels are associated with metastatic progression and poor prognosis. These unexpected findings prompted us to experimentally test in vivo the functional role of SEMA3B in cancer progression, especially because previous studies had not investigated its potential relevance in tumor invasion and metastasis. Interestingly, we found that an elevated expression of SEMA3B in MDA-MB435 and A549 human cancer cells induced spontaneous metastasis from subcutaneous tumors in mice. This effect was even more striking considering that SEMA3B-expressing primary tumors were remarkably smaller (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Moreover, unlike what was described for SEMA3E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), tumor cells expressing SEMA3B did not show an increased ability to form metastatic lung colonies upon direct injection in the blood circulation (Fig. S7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072509/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072509/DC1</ext-link>), indicating that SEMA3B acts by promoting cancer cell dissemination from the primary tumor, and not by increased cell survival or homing from the circulation.</p><p>Because SEMA3B expression in tumor cells did not seem to affect cell adhesion, cell migration, or cell scattering in vitro in a cell-autonomous manner (unpublished data), we postulated that the increased metastatic potential observed in vivo may implicate regulatory cells in the tumor microenvironment. In fact, we found that SEMA3B expression increased the recruitment of monocytes/macrophages into the tumor microenvironment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>); notably these TAMs are well-known mediators of tumor invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Moreover, SEMA3B expression induced the secretion of IL-8 by tumor cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), a cytokine also associated with tumor progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). By means of neutralizing antibodies, we demonstrated that the activity of IL-8 was responsible for macrophage recruitment and for the prometastatic effect mediated by SEMA3B (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Finally, we identified the receptor and intracellular pathway, namely NP1 and p38&#x02013;MAPK, required to mediate SEMA3B activities in cancer cells, leading to increased expression of IL-8 and the cell-cycle inhibitor p21-Waf (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p>IL-8 is a pleiotropic cytokine produced by tumor cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). IL-8 can also act as chemoattractant for neutrophils and monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown to promote endothelial cell survival and angiogenesis in vivo, as well as tumor cell migration and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Elevated IL-8 expression in tumors is a poor prognostic indicator, correlated with increased metastasis and to remarkable effects on the tumor microenvironment (e.g., leukocyte recruitment and tumor angiogenesis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Studies have shown that IL-8 levels are up-regulated through the activation of p38&#x02013;MAPK and/or NF-&#x003ba;B independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), as well as in response to RAS signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). We now show for the first time that SEMA3B induces IL-8 expression in tumor and endothelial cells, thereby supporting a new and unexpected function of this semaphorin to promote tumor progression and metastasis. The specificity of SEMA3B-dependent regulation of IL-8 was confirmed in different ways: (a) SEMA3B overexpression in a variety of tumor cells&#x02014;under constitutive or drug-regulated promoters&#x02014;correlated with induced IL-8 levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>); (b) RNAi-mediated suppression of endogenous SEMA3B in tumor cells led to reduced levels of IL-8 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>); and (c) one of the two SEMA3B receptors, NP1, was found to be required for SEMA3B-dependent activation of p38&#x02013;MAPK and IL-8 induction (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p>By means of IL-8-blocking antibodies, we have demonstrated that the functional difference between SEMA3B-expressing tumor cells and their respective controls, in terms of monocyte/macrophage-attracting activity and metastatic progression in vivo, was entirely dependent on the release of IL-8 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>; and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, B and C</xref>). As expected, the CM of tumor cells basally contained additional monocyte chemoattractants, independently from SEMA3B regulation. This was consistent with our microarray expression analysis; moreover, we directly investigated by real-time PCR the expression levels of two major monocyte chemoattractants capable of mediating invasive/metastatic tumor progression, such as CSF-1 and MCP-1, in four different tumor cell lines transduced with SEMA3B. We found that these factors are basally expressed; however, unlike what was seen for IL-8, there was no consistent induction of MCP-1 or CSF-1 levels in cancer cells overexpressing SEMA3B (unpublished data). Moreover, by analyzing gene expression in a dataset derived from human melanoma samples, we found that SEMA3B expression is directly correlated with IL-8 levels and with the expression of the macrophage marker CD14 (Fig. S8, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072509/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072509/DC1</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). Intriguingly, we did not observe an increased recruitment of neutrophils in SEMA3B-expressing xenografts in vivo, although SEMA3B-CM increased the basal migration of neutrophils in vitro (by 1.5-fold) because of its content in IL-8 (unpublished data). This discrepancy may be explained by the concept that the recruitment of different leucocytes into growing tumors in vivo is further regulated by the activity of additional factors released in the microenvironment by cancer and stromal cells.</p><p>TAMs recruited from the peripheral blood play a crucial role in tumor angiogenesis and tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), especially by releasing proangiogenic and proinvasive factors such as VEGF or epidermal growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). Notably, we have evidence in vitro that some of the factors released by TAMs, such as epidermal growth factor and VEGF, induce the migration of the tumor cells used in our studies (unpublished data). None of these mechanisms is likely to act alone to mediate invasion and metastasis in vivo. Thus, we propose that the prometastatic function of SEMA3B seen in vivo depends on the activity of IL-8 and on additional factors released by macrophages recruited in the tumor microenvironent.</p><p>Intriguingly, despite the observation that SEMA3B expression in cancer cells induced high levels of IL-8 and increased the recruitment of infiltrating macrophages, we found that the tumor-associated vessel area was not significantly affected. However, upon IL-8 neutralization, not only was SEMA3B-mediated macrophage recruitment inhibited, but vessel area was also markedly decreased compared with control tumors. These data suggested that IL-8 and the proangiogenic signals released by TAMs in SEMA3B tumors were in balance with some antiangiogenic activity. In fact, consistent with what was reported for other class 3 semaphorins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), we found that SEMA3B is capable of repelling HUVECs and inhibiting their migration in vitro, an activity that is probably balanced in vivo by the proangiogenic factors released by TAMs. Notably, although it was recently shown that another semaphorin, SEMA3F, inhibits VEGF expression in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>), we demonstrated that SEMA3B does not affect VEGF levels in cancer cells in vitro or in vivo (Fig. S9, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072509/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072509/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>Blood vessels in SEMA3B-expressing tumors further revealed defects in pericyte recruitment, a mechanism that has been implicated in metastatic dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). In fact, although normal blood vessels get stabilized and remodeled by associated pericytes and other &#x0201c;mural&#x0201d; cells, pericyte recruitment is often affected in tumor vasculature; endothelial cell survival and morphogenesis thereby becomes dependent on the angiogenic factors released by tumor cells and by infiltrating TAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). Notably, we found that most of the vessels in SEMA3B-expressing tumors were in close association with macrophages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>). In conclusion, the metastatic potential of SEMA3B-expressing tumors seems to involve multiple coordinated mechanisms dependent on IL-8 secretion and on remarkable changes in the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>In our study, we also investigated receptors and signaling pathways implicated in SEMA3B-mediated functions in tumor cells. SEMA3B was reported to bind both NP1 and NP2. Our unpublished data show that SEMA3B cannot bind directly to any of the plexins, whereas several plexins are redundantly capable to associate with NP1 and mediate a functional response to SEMA3B in COS cells similar to that known for most secreted class 3 semaphorins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). We thus focused on NPs as required receptors to mediate SEMA3B activity. Notably, NPs are widely expressed in cancer cells and in the tumor microenvironment (e.g., in endothelial cells). It was previously shown that SEMA3B and VEGF have antagonistic functions in regulating tumor growth, and this was explained by binding competition of the two factors for NP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). We have obtained analogous results in A549 cells (unpublished data). However recent findings seem to refute the assumption that semaphorin and VEGF binding sites on NP1 are overlapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). In fact, none of these data ruled out the possibility that SEMA3B and VEGF may independently elicit two antagonistic signaling pathways. In this respect, we have demonstrated that NP1 is responsible for SEMA3B-dependent growth inhibition by blunting this effect with NP1 blocking antibodies (Fig. S3 A). In addition, we showed that SEMA3B triggers p38&#x02013;MAPK activation and IL-8 induction in an NP1-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, F and G</xref>). Notably, p38 signaling is associated with cell-cycle inhibition via the induction of the CDKI p21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), which was also up-regulated in response to SEMA3B in our experiments (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 E</xref>). Thus, p38&#x02013;MAPK activation and the consequent induction of the CDKI p21 could have a major role in growth inhibition induced by SEMA3B. By using RNAi, we could furthermore rule out the requirement of NP2 to mediate SEMA3B functions in tumor cells. For instance, upon RNAi-mediated knock down of NP2, the antiproliferatory effect of SEMA3B in A549 carcinoma cells was preserved or even increased (Fig. S3 B). These data suggest that NP1 and NP2 are alternative receptors for SEMA3B and trigger independent signaling pathways.</p><p>We therefore focused on the intracellular mediators leading to IL-8 induction by SEMA3B in tumor cells. Previous data have shown that IL-8 expression is up-regulated through the activation of p38&#x02013;MAPK (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). In this study, we show that p38&#x02013;MAPK activity is significantly induced by SEMA3B; moreover, IL-8 induction was blocked by treatment with p38 inhibitors (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Interestingly, in addition to its role in cell-cycle arrest, a growing body of evidence implicates p38&#x02013;MAPK in tumor progression and metastasis (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>) This may be explained by a mechanism called &#x0201c;tumor dormancy,&#x0201d; by which cancer cells slow down proliferation to escape environmental stresses while maintaining a high invasive and metastatic potential. Consistent with this scenario, SEMA3B-induced p38 activation may feature an &#x0201c;escape&#x0201d; response of tumor cells, based on slow cell growth and gene induction promoting invasion and metastasis. Interestingly, there are other examples of putative tumor suppressors found to promote cancer progression, e.g., STAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>) and the SMADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>). It was also shown that hypoxic conditions put a brake on tumor growth, whereas they may in turn foster cancer cells that are more aggressive and metastatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>). Moreover, it was recently reported that IL-8 induces angiogenesis and rescues tumor cells from undergoing apoptosis in colon cancer cells that lack HIF1-&#x003b1; expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Notably, although hypoxic conditions have been reported to regulate the expression of IL-8 and its receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>), we detected comparable levels of tissue hypoxia in SEMA3B-expressing tumors and in controls (by pimonidazol staining; unpublished data).</p><p>In conclusion, our results indicate that tumors expressing high SEMA3B levels grow slowly because of reduced proliferation of tumor cells, consistent with our finding that SEMA3B induces p38&#x02013;MAPK activation. In addition, SEMA3B triggers an escape program from cancer suppression, mediated by p38-dependent IL-8 production by tumor cells, and by a stromal response that fosters cancer progression and metastatic dissemination (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). These unexpected findings expand our knowledge of the functional activities mediated by SEMA3B in tumors and suggest a reconsideration of semaphorins as multifaceted regulators of cancer progression.</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed mechanisms for autocrine SEMA3B signaling in tumor progression.</bold> Schematic diagram depicting our current model to explain multiple functional activities of SEMA3B in tumor cells. Autocrine SEMA3B signals, mediated by NP1 receptor (in association with plexins or other receptor subunits to be identified) leads to p38&#x02013;MAPK activation. This results in growth inhibition (via CDKI p21 induction), as well as transcriptional activation of IL-8 expression (via ATF-2). In turn, the activity of IL-8 on stromal cells of the tumor microenvironment (including TAM) promotes invasion and metastasis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2051155f09"></graphic></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines.</title><p>Cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, except for the following: GTL-16 (provided by S.

This method ensured stable gene transfer with a very high efficiency (&#x0003e;95% transgene-positive cells, as determined by immunostaining), without need to select individual cell clones. In addition, to rule out the variability of biological responses, we tested at least three independent batches for each construct that was used to transduce cells. Regulated expression of SEMA3B was achieved by transducing tumor cells with a lentiviral expression construct under the control of an rTTA- and doxycycline-regulated promoter (the cloning plasmid was provided by E.
