MITF is essential for the survival of pigmented cells, but whereas high levels of MITF drive melanocyte differentiation, lower levels are required to permit proliferation and survival of melanoma cells. MITF is phosphorylated by ERK, and this stimulates its activation, but also targets it for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, coupling MITF degradation to its activation. We have previously shown that because ERK is hyper-activated in melanoma cells in which BRAF is mutated, the MITF protein is constitutively down-regulated. Here we describe another intriguing aspect of MITF regulation by oncogenic BRAF in melanoma cells. We show oncogenic BRAF up-regulates <italic>MITF</italic> transcription through ERK and the transcription factor BRN2 (N-Oct3). In contrast, we show that in melanocytes this pathway does not exist because BRN2 is not expressed, demonstrating that MITF regulation is a newly acquired function of oncogenic BRAF that is not performed by the wild-type protein. Critically, in melanoma cells MITF is required downstream of oncogenic BRAF because it regulates expression of key cell cycle regulatory proteins such as CDK2 and CDK4. Wild-type BRAF does not regulate this pathway in melanocytes. Thus, we show that oncogenic BRAF exerts exquisite control over MITF on two levels. It downregulates the protein by stimulating its degradation, but then counteracts this by increasing transcription through BRN2. Our data suggest that oncogenic BRAF plays a critical role in regulating MITF expression to ensure that its protein levels are compatible with proliferation and survival of melanoma cells. We propose that its ability to appropriate the regulation of this critical factor explains in part why BRAF is such a potent oncogene in melanoma.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human cancers arise through a multistage process, driven in part by accumulated genetic aberrations that stimulate cancer cell proliferation and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Hanahan1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

MITF is considered to be the &#x0201c;master regulator of melanocytes&#x0201d; because it is essential for melanoblast survival and melanocyte lineage commitment. It regulates expression of melanogenic enzymes such as tyrosinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Levy1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and contributes to melanocyte differentiation by triggering cell cycle exit through induction of the cell cycle inhibitors p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and p21<sup>Cip</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Loercher1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Carreira1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

In agreement with this, low levels of MITF protein are found in invasive melanoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Hoek1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and are associated with poor prognosis and disease progression in patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Salti1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Zhuang1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

They also suggest that the interaction between oncogenic BRAF and MITF is more complex than previously reported and this prompted us to examine the interaction between these important proteins in more detail. Here we describe a new aspect of MITF regulation by oncogenic BRAF. We show that BRAF induces MITF transcription through the MEK/ERK cascade and the transcription factor BRN2. Thus, we propose that oncogenic BRAF down-regulates the MITF protein by targeting it for degradation in an ERK-dependent manner, but then counters this by stimulating <italic>MITF</italic> transcription in a BRN2-dependent manner. Through these opposing mechanisms, oncogenic BRAF executes exquisite control over MITF expression, ensuring that the protein levels are permissive for melanoma cell survival and proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>MITF expression is dependent on oncogenic BRAF in melanoma cells</title><p>Previous studies have shown that ERK phosphorylates MITF and targets it for degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Hemesath1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Wu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. We have gone on to show that as a consequence of ERK being constitutively activated in melanoma cell lines expressing oncogenic BRAF, MITF protein levels are lower in mutant BRAF melanoma cells than in melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Wellbrock2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002734.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These data suggest that if ERK were inhibited in BRAF mutant melanoma cells, MITF protein levels should increase. We tested this using the MEK inhibitor U0126, which efficiently blocked ERK activity in BRAF mutant melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002734-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, this resulted in a significant reduction in the proportion of high molecular weight, phosphorylated forms of MITF in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002734-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, see &#x0002a;), but surprisingly long-term MEK/ERK inhibition did not lead to an increase in MITF protein as expected, but rather caused an almost complete loss of MITF expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002734-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, in apparent contradiction to our previous findings, these data suggest that ERK activation is necessary for MITF expression in melanoma cells expressing oncogenic BRAF.</p><fig id="pone-0002734-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002734.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>MITF expression requires BRAF in melanoma cells.</title><p>A) Western blot for MITF, phosphorylated ERK (ppERK) and total ERK2 in untreated (-) melanoma cells or in cells treated with DMSO (D) or U0126 (U0; 10 &#x000b5;M) for 48 h.

To ensure the results above were not a post-extraction artefact, we used an immuno-fluorescence approach, depleting BRAF with fluorescently-labelled siRNA oligonucleotides and this also led to a substantial reduction in nuclear MITF staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002734-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

Notably, whereas <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF can induce BRN2 expression in melanocytes, <sup>WT</sup>BRAF does not stimulate BRN2 expression in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002734-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Importantly, when introduced into melanocytes, both <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF and BRN2 can activate the <italic>MITF</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002734-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). Thus in melanocytes although <sup>WT</sup>BRAF does not regulate MITF, <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF can induce expression of BRN2, allowing it to induce MITF transcription. Notably, the induction of BRN2 through MEK and ERK in melanoma cells appears to be fundamental to the ability of <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF to regulate MITF in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002734-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, we have established that in addition to regulating MITF at the protein level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Wellbrock2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, oncogenic BRAF also regulates MITF at the level of gene transcription in melanocytic cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we show that <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF regulates the MITF promoter through the octamer-binding transcription factor BRN2 (N-Oct-3). BRN2 is a neuronal-specific protein that is expressed in developing melanoblasts, but which becomes down-regulated as these cells differentiate into melanocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Cook1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus BRN2 re-expression is important for melanoma progression and we have previously shown that BRN2 is a target of oncogenic BRAF in melanoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Goodall1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we show that BRN2 expression can also be induced by oncogenic BRAF in melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002734-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). We further demonstrate that BRN2 induces MITF transcription through a binding site located at &#x02212;50/&#x02212;36 of the <italic>MITF</italic> promoter, linking MITF expression to oncogenic BRAF through BRN2. Consistent with this, we show that BRN2 and MITF expression occur coincident with oncogenic BRAF in human melanoma samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002734-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Importantly, we show that wild type BRAF does not induce BRN2 expression in melanocytes, and neither does it stimulate MITF transcription in melanocytes or melanoma cells. Together, these data show that the ability of BRAF to regulate MITF expression is a newly acquired function of the oncogenic protein and that this is mediated through its ability to induce expression of BRN2.</p><p>Importantly, we previously reported that <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF suppresses the endogenous <italic>mitf</italic> promoter in mouse melanocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Wellbrock2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In line with this, we find that <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF also suppresses the promoter when expressed in mouse melanoma cells (B16 cells, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002734.s004">Figure S4</xref>). This suggests that the MITF promoter is regulated differently by oncogenic BRAF in mouse and human cells, but it should be mentioned that in contrast to humans, somatic mutations in BRAF do not appear to be a feature of mouse melanomas. Interestingly, we find that like <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF, BRN2 suppresses the MITF promoter in mouse cells (not shown), suggesting that in mouse cells the presence or absence of certain co-factors might modulate the outcome of the action of BRN2 on the MITF promoter. In summary, we have shown that BRN2 induces MITF mRNA expression in human melanoma cells and that through BRN2, <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF can stimulate transcription of the <italic>MITF</italic> gene in both melanoma cells and melanocytes.</p><p>It has previously been shown that MITF activation and degradation are coupled because ERK phosphorylation both activates MITF and targets it for degradation through the ubiquitin pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Hemesath1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Wu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, we demonstrated that because ERK is constitutively activated in BRAF mutant melanoma cells, MITF is constantly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Wellbrock2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002734.s005">Figure S5</xref>), a finding that is in agreement with the observation that MITF protein levels are generally lower in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines than in primary melanocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002734.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, our demonstration here that <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF induces <italic>MITF</italic> transcription appears at first to be counter-intuitive. However, MITF plays a critical role in pigment cell behaviour and as previously described, this is partly controlled by the level of MITF in the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Wellbrock2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Carreira2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>). High levels of MITF trigger cell cycle arrest and differentiation, whereas low levels of activity trigger cell cycle arrest and death (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002734-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, MITF has both tumour promoting and tumour inhibitory activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Levy1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and its ability to control cell fate decisions appears to depend on it levels of expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Wellbrock2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> or possibly its levels of activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Carreira2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0002734-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002734.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>A model of MITF regulation by oncogenic BRAF in melanoma cells.</title><p>MITF protein levels are critical in melanoma cells. High levels of MITF stimulate differentiation, whereas if the levels are too low, the cells die by apoptosis. Therefore to stimulate proliferation in melanoma cells, MITF protein levels must be constrained to within a narrow range. We propose that <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF stimulates MITF activation through ERK phosphorylation, but this targets MITF for degradation. This would reduce MITF protein to levels that are below those required for survival and proliferation, so to counter this, <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF stimulates MITF transcription through up-regulation of BRN2. Thus although MITF is constantly destroyed by proteasome-mediated degradation, its expression persists at a level that is sufficient to maintain expression of cell cycle components such as CDK4 and CDK2 and survival factors such as BCL2, thereby favouring proliferation and survival over differentiation or apoptosis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0002734.g006"/></fig><p>Thus MITF is akin to TGF&#x003b2;, which, is also either a tumour promoter or a tumour suppressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Massague1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and we propose that MITF expression/activity must be carefully regulated in melanoma cells to ensure that the levels are not so low as to cause cell death but equally, not so high as to cause cell cycle arrest and differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002734-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Our data suggest that oncogenic BRAF plays a key role in regulating MITF to ensure that this is achieved and together with our previous observations, these studies demonstrate that the regulation of MITF by oncogenic BRAF is complex and multifaceted. We posit that because constitutively active ERK is so efficient at down-regulating MITF in BRAF mutant melanoma cells, it is necessary for the cells to rescue MITF expression to ensure that they can continue to proliferate and survive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002734-g006">Figure 6</xref>). One strategy that the cells use to achieve this is the activation of the <italic>MITF</italic> promoter by <sup>V600E</sup>BRAF/ERK/BRN2 as described here. Another strategy appears to be gene amplification, since the <italic>MITF</italic> gene is amplified in approximately 15&#x00025; of melanoma cases in which <italic>BRAF</italic> is mutated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Garraway2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

This ensures that the levels of MITF are optimal for tumour progression and suggests one reason for why BRAF is such a potent oncogene in human melanoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell biology approaches</title><p>Culture and transfection and in vitro analysis of melanoma cell lines, human melanocytes, stable melanocyte lines and the MITF siRNA MI have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002734-Wellbrock1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.
