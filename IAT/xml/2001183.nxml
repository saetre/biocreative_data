In adults, it exacerbates chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and in children, it causes otitis media, the most common childhood infection and the leading cause of conductive hearing loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-Rao1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-Murphy1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the need for prophylactic measures, development of a vaccine for preventing NTHi infections has been difficult and still remains a great challenge. Moreover, inappropriate antibiotic treatment contributes to the worldwide emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of NTHi. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing alternative therapeutic strategies for the treatment of NTHi infections based on understanding the molecular pathogenesis of NTHi infections. Like most other bacterial infections, NTHi infection is characterized by inflammation, which is mainly mediated by nuclear factor kappaB (NF-&#x003ba;B)-dependent production of pro-inflammatory mediators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-Murphy2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-Ghosh1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. We have previously shown that NTHi induces Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2-dependent activation of NF-&#x003ba;B via an IKK&#x003b2;-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;- and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-Shuto1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-Imasato1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the key signaling adaptors that link TLR2 with IKK and MAPK in mediating NTHi-induced inflammation remain unknown.</p><p>Although the inflammatory response triggered by bacteria is essential for eradicating bacterial pathogen, excessive inflammatory response is clearly detrimental to the host, due to severe tissue damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-Ulevitch1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-KurtJones1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. To avoid overactive and detrimental inflammatory response in infectious disease, the bacteria-induced inflammatory response must be tightly regulated. During evolution, the host has developed a variety of strategies to prevent detrimental inflammatory response during bacterial infections. Among all strategies, bacteria-induced negative feedback regulation is thought to play a critical role in preventing overactive inflammatory response by tightly regulating the activity of the key receptor-dependent signaling adaptors specifically activated by bacterial pathogens. In the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and otitis media, to avoid detrimental inflammatory responses in NTHi infection, TLR2 signaling must be tightly regulated. However, despite the importance of tight regulation in preventing overactive inflammatory response, the molecular mechanisms underlying the negative feedback regulation of inflammation in the pathogenesis of NTHi infection remain unknown.</p><p>CYLD was originally identified as a tumor suppressor, loss of which causes a benign human syndrome called cylindromatosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-Bignell1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-PobleteGutierrez1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have indicated that CYLD is a member of the deubiquitinating enzyme family that specifically digests polyubiquitin chains. Transfection studies showed that CYLD deubiquitinates TRAF2 and TRAF6 and acts as a negative regulator for activation of NF-&#x003ba;B by tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) and TLR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-Trompouki1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-Kovalenko1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, we, together with others, showed that CYLD also negatively regulates activation of MAPKs, including p38 MAPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-Reiley1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-Reiley2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the expression of CYLD is itself under the control of NF-&#x003ba;B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-Yoshida1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-Jono1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that CYLD is involved in a negative feedback regulation of NF-&#x003ba;B activation and NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent gene expression. Given the important role that NF-&#x003ba;B plays in host immune and inflammatory response in bacteria infection, it is logical to hypothesize that CYLD may act as a negative regulator for immune and inflammatory response against invading bacteria such as NTHi <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, despite recent studies demonstrating the role of CYLD in regulating T cell receptor signaling and tumor cell proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic>, the biological role of CYLD especially its negative role in inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic> still remains unknown.</p><p>In the present study, by using NTHi-induced otitis media and pneumonia model in wild type (WT) and <italic>Cyld</italic>-deficient mice, we provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that NTHi induces pro-inflammatory response through TLR2-dependent MyD88-TRAF6/7-NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway, and CYLD negatively regulates NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent inflammatory response by NTHi via deubiquitination of TRAF6 and TRAF7. These studies may lead to development of novel therapeutic strategies for controlling overactive inflammatory response in respiratory bacterial infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Cyld<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were generated by homologous recombination as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001032-Zhang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Given that prolonged CYLD expression is anticipated to suppress adequate host response to the invading pathogens, which is necessary for the adequate host defense, it is also of particular interest to investigate how CYLD expression is negatively regulated.
