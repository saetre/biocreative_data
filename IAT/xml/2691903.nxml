The present study examines the relationship between the hClCa1 protein and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents using heterologous expression of hClCa1 in HEK293 and NCIH522 cell lines and whole cell recordings. By contrast to previous reports claiming the absence of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents in HEK293 cells, we find that HEK293 and NCIH522 cell lines express constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents and show that hClCa1 increases the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents in those cells. We further show that hClCa1 does not modify the permeability sequence but increases the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> conductance while decreasing the <italic>G</italic><sub>SCN<sup>&#x02212;</sup></sub>/<italic>G</italic><sub>Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup></sub> conductance ratio from &#x0223c;2&#x02013;3 to &#x0223c;1. We use an Eyring rate theory (two barriers, one site channel) model and show that the effect of hClCa1 on the anionic channel can be simulated by its action on lowering the first and the second energy barriers. We conclude that hClCa1 does not form Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels <italic>per se</italic> or enhance the trafficking/insertion of constitutive channels in the HEK293 and NCIH522 expression systems. Rather, hClCa1 elevates the single channel conductance of endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels by lowering the energy barriers for ion translocation through the pore.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Three molecularly distinct Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel families (CLC, CFTR, and ligand-gated GABA and glycine receptors) are well established whereas other gene families (ClCa) were also reported to encode Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels but are less well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Jentsch <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Eggermont, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hartzell <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Loewen &#x00026; Forsyth, 2005</xref>). The human ClCa protein (hClCa1) is strongly up-regulated in mucus-producing epithelium of cystic fibrosis and asthmatic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Hoshino <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Toda <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hauber <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2004</xref>), therefore generating great interest in its clinical relevance. The hClCla1 protein was initially proposed to be a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel. Evidence for this came from its heterologous expression in a range of cellular systems, which resulted in membrane currents activated in Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-selective conditions and with high internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Currents were also blocked with chloride channel blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gandhi <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gruber <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Gibson <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref> expressed hCLCA1 in HEK293 cells and showed that hCLCA1 is constitutively secreted in the extracellular medium. The N-terminal cleavage products of hCLCA1 could also be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid taken from asthmatic subjects demonstrating release from cells in a pathological setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Gibson <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). A bioinformatics analysis did not support the notion of transmembrane domains, further indicating that hCLCA1 is a non-integral membrane protein and is not a chloride channel <italic>per se</italic>. So far, electrophysiological data do not distinguish between ClCa1 family members being modulators or ion channels themselves. Studies with pClCa1, the porcine ortholog of hClCa1, suggest that ClCa1 are chloride channel modulators that increase the amplitude of endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Loewen <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2004</xref>). Even in light of this evidence, questions still remain as to how members of the ClCa family are responsible for the increase of the amplitude of the chloride current. The present study seeks to shed new light on the relationship between the hClCa1 protein and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel by quantifying separate facets of the anion permeation process in cell lines expressing hClCla1. We found that HEK293 and NCIH522 cell lines express constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent chloride currents. When expressed in those two cell lines, hClCa1 increased the conductance of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents while leaving the relative permeability of other anions unaffected. We used a rate theory analysis to develop a model that describes the alteration of anion selectivity in the presence of hClCa1 and showed that the increase of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> conductance in the presence of hClCa1 is due to its effect on the energy barriers that impact on the ion translocation event.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK293 and NCIH522 (a human lung epithelial adenocarcinoma cell line) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd, Dorset, UK), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum; 1% penicillin, streptomycin and glutamine; and 1% non-essential amino acids (all from Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK).

Energy profiles for both Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and SCN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> were fitted simultaneously using the solver function in Microsoft Excel to minimize the sum of the squared difference between data and fit. During this procedure the values of the energy levels <italic>G</italic>12, <italic>G</italic>2 and <italic>G</italic>23 for Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and SCN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> were free to alter as was the number of open channels (<italic>NP</italic><sub>open</sub>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8</xref>, this single site model fitted the data adequately in the presence or absence of hClCa1 expression in either HEK 293 or NCIH522 cells. It was clear, however, that to obtain an adequate fit to the data it was necessary to alter the energy barriers, as simply scaling the current by altering the number of open channels depending on the presence or absence of hClCa1 was inadequate (see dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8</xref>). The single channel conductance (estimated as the average slope conductance) in 126 m<sc>m</sc> Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> was 3.7 pS in the HEK 293 stable cell line and this increased to 11.2 pS in the presence of hClCa1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Similar results were obtained with transient transfection using pcDNA3.1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>).

Unfortunately, most of the known Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel blockers are neither selective nor potent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Greenwood &#x00026; Leblanc, 2007</xref>). Commonly used stillbene disulphonate and niflumic acid display inhibitory effects on various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Greenwood &#x00026; Leblanc, 2007</xref>) and we found that, similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gandhi <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gruber <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>), DIDS blocked the current by about 90% in the absence and presence of hClCa1. DIDS also exerted a more potent block at positive potentials consistent with the voltage dependency of the blocking effect reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Nilius <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Kim <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). Niflumic acid (100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) was a relatively weak blocker in HEK293 and NCIH522 cells even at positive potentials.

One reason for this difference could be the intracellular calcium concentration. Whereas we used 10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, previous studies used 2 m<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup> inside the recording pipette. We did not observe complicated effects of niflumic acid like those reported in vascular smooth muscle where niflumic acid inhibits the calcium-dependent chloride current at positive potentials whilst increasing it at negative potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Piper <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>hClCa1 is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent chloride current modulator</title><p>hClCa1 has originally been suggested to be an ion channel of the calcium-dependent chloride channel family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gandhi <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gruber <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>). Later observations showed that hClCa1, as well as cleavage products of mClCa3, the murine homolog of hClCa1, are non-integral membrane proteins released into the medium. In their studies, the authors conclude that hClCa1 cannot form an anion channel on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Gibson <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Mundhenk <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Furthermore, bioinformatics analyses do not predict the presence of any transmembrane domains and thus hClCa1 is unlikely to be an ion channel <italic>per se</italic>. In their initial study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gruber <italic>et al.</italic> (1998)</xref> have shown that transient expression of hClCa1 in HEK293 cells increased the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated whole cell currents by a factor of 5, producing a time-independent outwardly rectifying current. As there was no mention of endogenous HEK293 channels that could be responsible for a background current mediated by non-selective anion currents, the conclusion was drawn towards hClCa1 being an ion channel itself. By opposition to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gruber <italic>et al.</italic> (1998)</xref>, we have shown that both HEK 293 and NCIH522 cell lines express, in the absence of hClCla1, a small (i.e. about 5 pA.pF<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) calcium-dependent chloride current with 10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> free internal calcium. In both cell lines, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents were outwardly rectifying, time independent and inhibited by DIDS, SITS and niflumic acid, similarly to currents described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gruber <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref> when hClCa1 was expressed in HEK293 cells.</p><p>Our study shows that the expression of hClCa1 upregulates similar types of calcium-dependent chloride channel activity in transiently transfected HEK 293, NCIH522 cells or in clonal cultures of HEK293 cells expressing constitutively hClCa1 thereby confirming the observation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gruber <italic>et al.</italic> (1998)</xref>) that the expression of hClCa1 greatly increased time-independent, outwardly rectifying Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents. Differences in the amplitudes of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents are highly significant (i.e. by a factor of 10 to 20, leading to currents in the nanoamp range) when hClCa1 is expressed. The presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels prior to transfection suggests that hClCa1 is not encoding for novel Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels but rather modulates the amplitude of pre-existing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels of similar biophysical and pharmacological properties. CLC-3 and bestrophin gene expression also cause the appearance of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents that lack the typical voltage dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents seen, for example, in the parotid gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Arreola <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>) and the possibility exists that hClCa1 is involved in the up-regulation of such channels. Nevertheless, bestrophin or CLC-3 properties do not conform to the behaviour of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current observed in our study. Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations higher than 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> have an inhibitory effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents expressed by bestrophins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Barro-Soria <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>) and ClC-3 expression induced currents with time-dependent activation that rectified sharply in the outward direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Matsuda <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>).</p><p>We checked whether an increase in the affinity for internal calcium would account for the effect of hClCa1 on the amplitude of the current by measuring the amplitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current at different internal free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations ranging from 130 n<sc>m</sc> to 486 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>.

Therefore, the small decrease of the EC<sub>50</sub> value in the presence of hClCa1 cannot account for the overall increase of the current amplitude.</p><p>Our observations show variability in the expression of hClCa1 mRNA, hClCa1 protein or the amplitude of the chloride currents. Discrepancies also exist between the different expression levels (mRNA, immunolabelling or chloride currents). For example, HEK293 clone 6 expresses low levels of hClCa1 mRNA or A48 immunolabelling but has chloride currents of similar amplitude to those recorded in clones 4 and 8. In fact, the absence of a proportional relationship between the level of expression of hClCa1 and the up-regulation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current supports the idea that hClCa1 is not encoding <italic>per se</italic> for a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel but is rather a modulator likely to require other proteins in order to get reproducible, quantifiable and predictive effects. Our study also confirms observations with pClCa1, the porcine ortholog of hClCa1, that suggested that ClCa1 was a chloride channel regulator that increased the amplitude of endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels whose identity remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Loewen <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2004</xref>). Finally, our results are in concordance with the effects of mClCa3, the mouse homolog of hClCa1, increasing the amplitude of time-independent and outwardly rectifying Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Winpenny <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, hClCa1 appears to be acting as a chloride channel regulator, increasing the amplitude of endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> chloride channels whose identity remains unknown. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Gibson <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref> showed that hClCa1 can be secreted in the extracellular medium although it is possible that residual hClCa1 remains on the cell surface as shown on microvilli, allowing an interaction with the ion channel. Mouse ClCa1 interacts with the large conductance potassium channel &#x003b2; subunit, increasing the calcium sensitivity of the BK current and evoking large Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Greenwood <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). Whereas in this latter study, a physical association between the two proteins could be demonstrated, resolution of the function of hClCa1 and of the regulatory characteristics will first require a greater understanding of the structure of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel(s) and of the pore-conducting subunit of the channel. The identification of proteins coding for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current in HEK293 cells remains therefore to be elucidated alongside proteins interacting with hClCa1. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Caputo <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> identified TMEM16A as an intrinsic constituent of the calcium-dependent chloride channel and showed that specific mutagenesis of highly conserved amino acids changed intrinsic properties of the channel. Other family members, such as TMEM16F, TMEM16J or TMEM16K, may represent other types of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels with different biophysical properties and mechanisms of regulation and may ultimately be the channel modulated by hClCa1.</p></sec><sec><title>hClCa1 decreases Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel energy barriers</title><p>Altogether our data suggest a modulatory effect of hClCa1 on existing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels. We performed a substitution of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> with different anions and first analysed the permeability sequence (shift of the reversal potential) obtained in those different conditions. Whether in the presence or absence of hClCa1, the permeability sequence for all currents was similar to the permeability sequence reported for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Qu &#x00026; Hartzell, 2000</xref>). We showed that hClCa1 leaves the shift of the reversal potential under bi-ionic conditions unaffected, reflecting a similar ability for anions to enter the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Qu &#x00026; Hartzell, 2000</xref>) in the absence or presence of hClCa1.</p><p>Having shown that hClCa1 increased the amplitude of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents, we then checked whether whole current amplitudes (whole cell conductances, <italic>G</italic>) were similarly increased for all anions. We found that while hClCa1 increased both <italic>G</italic><sub>SCN<sup>&#x02212;</sup></sub> and <italic>G</italic><sub>Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup></sub>, its relative effect on both conductances was different, leading to a proportional higher increase of the conductance when carried by Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> in comparison to SCN<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. As a result, hClCa1 decreased the whole cell conductance ratio <italic>G</italic><sub>SCN</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>/<italic>G</italic><sub>Cl</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>. This suggests that hClCa1 does not increase the ability of ions to enter the pore (permeability) but rather modifies their ability to traverse the entire length of the pore (conductance) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Qu &#x00026; Hartzell, 2000</xref>). Permeability ratios, determined by the difference between the energy required to dehydrate the anion and some stabilization energy due to the anion entering the pore, are not highly dependent on the channel structure. Likewise, permeability ratios turn out to be properties that are least affected by mutations generally. Therefore, the inability of hClCa1 to affect the permeability ratio suggests that hClCa1 does not modify the anionic dehydration and stabilisation energy while entering the pore. Mutations usually affect the conductance. For example, only minor conformational changes of the hydrophobic region of the pore are required to create macroscopic changes in conductance in the ACh receptor&#x02013;channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Corry, 2006</xref>).</p><p>To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the effect of hClCa1 on the decreased whole cell conductance ratio <italic>G</italic><sub>SCN</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>/<italic>G</italic><sub>Cl</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, we performed best fit energy profiles for <italic>G</italic><sub>SCN</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>/<italic>G</italic><sub>Cl</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> using a simple Eyring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Eyring <italic>et al.</italic> 1949</xref>) model. Best fit energy profiles estimated that hClCa1 is likely to neither encode for chloride channels nor alter its opening probability (<italic>N</italic> unaffected) but instead increases the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel conductance from an estimated 3 pS to values exceeding 10 pS, mainly by lowering the first energy barrier <italic>G</italic>12 and also the second energy barrier <italic>G</italic>2. Those estimated conductances are within the range of conductances previously reported for this channel. Calcium-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> conductances as small as 2 pS have been previously reported in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Takahashi <italic>et al.</italic> 1987</xref>) and single channel conductances of 13 pS have also been described in HEK293 cells after transfection with hClCa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gruber <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>). The modulatory effect of hClCa1 could originate from changes in the geometrical properties of the inner core of the channel and modulation of electrostatic interactions between the ion and polar groups within the channel, thereby affecting the free energy profile and lowering the channel energy barriers.</p><p>We do not exclude the possibility that hClCa1 induces other similar types of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels not functionally expressed in the control cells but this possibility seems unlikely considering that the model only fits data when the total number of channels is unchanged. Newly expressed channels would then theoretically need to be accompanied by a proportional decrease of the number of channels already present in order for the model to fit the data. Our results also indicate that the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current are left unchanged after expressing hClCa1. Newly expressed channels would then theoretically display similar biophysical and pharmacological properties. Therefore, the most likely and simple explanation of the effect of hClCa1 lies in the increase of the conductance of the single channel.</p><p>We tried to verify the prediction from the modelling and measured single channels in cells expressing hClCa1. Despite multiple attempts, those measurements were unsuccessful. This could be due to the small single channel conductance that makes the single channel current indistinguishable from the measurement noise. Another likely explanation is linked to the low probability of recording single channels. We estimated an average number of 250 channels in 15 pF cells. Considering 1 pF equals 1 &#x003bc;f cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, this would lead to the probability of measuring a channel in 1 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> patches of 0.25. Ion channels may also form clusters that are unequally distributed within the cell thereby decreasing the probability of success even further. Our modelling studies fitted adequately the effect of hClCa1 when increasing the single channel conductance and leaving the channel number unchanged. Similarities in channel sparseness and clustering in cells expressing hClCa1 can <italic>de facto</italic> explain why in the presence of hClCa1 we could not observe single channels.</p></sec><sec><title>hClCa1: a target for asthma?</title><p>Mucus gland hyperplasia and mucus overproduction and hypersecretion are main features of the airway during asthma. Chloride channels play a major role in the process of transepithelial electrolyte and fluid absorption or secretion and are also involved in the regulation of mucus overproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Anderson <italic>et al.</italic> 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Morris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Patel <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). Upregulation of mClCa3 in murine models of asthma is strongly associated with mucus overproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Nakanishi <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). In humans, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Toda <italic>et al.</italic> (2002)</xref> have shown an up-regulation of hClCa1 in the IL-9-responsive mucus-producing epithelium of asthmatic subjects that supports the hypothesis that hClCa1 may be responsible for the overproduction of mucus in asthmatic subjects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Nakanishi <italic>et al.</italic> (2001)</xref> have highlighted the potential clinical advantage of hClCa1 inhibitors in animal models of asthma, thus hClCa1 inhibition in asthmatic patients may be a new therapeutic strategy. In summary, an up-regulation of hClCa1 during an asthma attack suggests an alteration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel energy profiles that could be related to mucus overproduction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec><title>Authors Contribution</title><p>All authors participated in the conception and design (M.H.; A.G.; A.J.; J.P.W.; L.P.; K.A.; D.T.; M.M.) or to the analysis and interpretation of data (M.H.; A.G.; N.D.; J.P.W.; L.P.; K.A.; D.T.; M.M.).
