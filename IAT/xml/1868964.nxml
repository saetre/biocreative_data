Although most of these functions are in the cytoplasm, there are also well defined functions within the nucleus (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]). In particular, the function of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> in the nucleus has been a major focus of study, both in its own right as a lipid regulator of proteins, and as a precursor for diacylglycerol to activate nuclear PKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Thus the synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> in the nucleus has been extensively studied, but is not yet fully understood.</p><p id="P3">Radiolabelling experiments on isolated nuclei suggest that the major route of synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> is by the expected 5-phosphorylation of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The nuclear synthesis of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> from PtdIns is probably catalysed by the Type III&#x003b2; PtdIns 4-kinase, which has been shown to be partly nuclear in its localisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], and then the synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> must proceed by a Type I PtdIns<italic>P</italic> kinase (PIPkin), most likely the Type I&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] (human nomenclature-the mouse homologue is PIPkin I&#x003b2;). However, there is also evidence in the nucleus for the alternative route of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], which is the 4-phosphorylation of PtdIns5<italic>P</italic> by Type II PIPkins. For example, PtdIns5<italic>P</italic> is found in the nucleus and its nuclear levels change with the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] or when cells are stressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], though its route of synthesis is currently unknown.</p><p id="P4">Of the Type II PIPkins, PIPkin II&#x003b2; has also been suggested to be primarily nuclear, and it may be that a fraction of PIPkin II&#x003b1; is nuclear also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. We previously showed that the nuclear localisation of acutely transfected PIPkin II&#x003b2; was absolutely dependent on a novel nuclear localisation sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] consisting of an acidic &#x003b1;-helix 16 amino acids long, numbered &#x003b1;-helix 7 in the PIPkin II&#x003b2; structure described by Rao et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. We also showed more recently that mutating a single amino acid within that &#x003b1;-helix, substituting Met 296 for a Thr, caused a significant, though not complete, shift to a cytoplasmic distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. A line-up of Type II PIPkins shows that this &#x003b1;-helix is highly conserved in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>) (though interestingly the rat sequence has the same 296 Met-Thr subsitution), with the exception of Zebrafish, where there is an insertion of four extra amino acids. From our earlier work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] we can infer that in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>) and possibly in <italic>Danio</italic>, PIPkin II&#x003b2; will not be nuclear, and in rat it will be only partly nuclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Recently, Gozani et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] have presented evidence that transfected PIPkin II&#x003b2; can modulate PtdIns5<italic>P</italic>-mediated events in the nucleus, and Jones et al have implicated phosphorylation by p38 stress kinase in the regulation of nuclear PIPkin II&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P5">However, set against all this evidence for a nuclear localisation and function for PIPkin II&#x003b2; is the fact that it was first cloned by its apparent interaction with a cell surface receptor &#x02013; that for TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Moreover, PIPkin II&#x003b2; has subsequently been reported to associate with the EGF receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. The knock-out mouse for PIPkin II&#x003b2; shows a phenotype of increased insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], consistent with the observations from Carricabura et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], who showed that increasing PIPkin II&#x003b2; by transfection resulted in decreased PtdIns(3,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> production in response to insulin, probably caused by increased PtdIns(3,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> degradation. The suggested mechanism was that PtdIns5<italic>P</italic> is a stimulator of PtdIns(3,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> phophatase(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. All these data together suggest a (perhaps major) cytoplasmic function for PIPkin II&#x003b2;. Finally, in all our transfection experiments, we frequently saw some cytoplasmic PIPkin II&#x003b2; present, even when it was mostly nuclear, and indeed, there were also 5-10% of cells in every transfected dish with very little in the nucleus and the majority in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Moreover, differences between transfected and endogenous localisations have also been observed with Type I PIPkins (e.g. human Type I&#x003b2; PIPkin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]).</p><p id="P6">Thus we are in a position with PIPkin II&#x003b2;, as with many other proteins, that acute transfection may not be giving the full picture of its physiological location and regulation &#x02013; indeed we actually have no evidence for a nuclear location of the endogenous enzyme. One way round this problem in the absence of a highly isoform-specific antibody is to tag the endogenous protein genetically. This can be done comparatively easily by exploiting the extremely high rate of homologous recombination of DT40 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], as exemplified by the tagging of Hef, a protein component of the Fanconi anemia-related tumor-suppressor complex, by Mosedale et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Here we describe the generation and characterisation of a DT40 cell that expresses active PIPkin II&#x003b2; tagged at its C-terminus. We use this cell line to show that PIPkin II&#x003b2; is indeed a nuclear enzyme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell culture, transfection and visualisation</title><p id="P7">DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 plus glutamine supplemented with 7% (v/v) foetal calf serum, 3% (v/v) heat-treated chicken serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin solution (GIBCO) and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

As we have found before, PIPkin II&#x003b2; is much less active than PIPkin II&#x003b1; under these assay conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>), but nevertheless from the &#x02018;tagged&#x02019; cells we were able to immunoprecipitate activity that was significantly above the background from Wild-type cells. In three independent experiments, the ratio (&#x02018;tagged&#x02019; cells to Wild-type) of immunoprecipitated enzyme activity, quantified by densitometry or by scintillation counting, was 2.37 &#x000b1; 0.27 (this is different from unity with a P &#x0003c; 0.01 by student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Localisation of PIPkin II&#x003b2;</title><p id="P21">The level of expression of PIPkin II&#x003b2; was too low for immunocytochemistry using either anti-FLAG or anti-His antibodies (we found that DT40 cells had a high background with both sets of antibodies &#x02013; significantly higher than several mammalian cell lines in comparative experiments). However, we could gain quantitative insight into its localisation by fractionating DT40 cells into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, blotting a portion of these with anti-actin and anti-H3 histone as markers for the purity of the fractions, and then quantifying the PIPkin II&#x003b2; content of the remainder by Nickel bead pull-down followed by anti-FLAG blotting, as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We assessed the cytoplasmic contamination of the nuclear fractions by blotting for &#x003b2;-actin. This is not a perfect marker, as we would expect a small percentage of actin to be truly nuclear (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]), but it served to confirm independently our microscopical examinations, which told us that the cells had been lysed and that we had prepared pure nuclei. The predominance of PIPkin II&#x003b2; in the nuclear fraction demonstrates the nuclear localisation of the endogenous enzyme. A key question is: how much of the small amount of PIPkin II&#x003b2; in the cytoplasmic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>) can be accounted for by nuclear disintegration or by leakage of PIPkin II&#x003b2; during the factionation? We have used a histone antibody as a marker for this, but there is no perfect marker in this context. Histone H3 has a lower molecular weight than PIPkin II&#x003b2;, so it could be argued to be more likely to leak out than the PIPkin; however, Histone H3 is also integral to chromatin structure whereas PIPkin II&#x003b2; is probably not, and so Histone H3 could be argued to be less likely to leak out. As we do not know to what degree PIPkin II&#x003b2; is freely diffusable in the nucleoplasm, these arguments limit the degree to which we can unambiguously assign a complete nuclear localisation to PIPkin II&#x003b2;, and they also make it pointless to pursue other nuclear markers &#x02013; each will suffer from similar <italic>caveats</italic>. However, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref> do enable us to say that within the error limits of our protocol, the endogenous PIPkin II&#x003b2; in these cells is mostly nuclear.</p><p id="P23">In conclusion, we have shown that genomic tagging of PIPkin II&#x003b2; reinforces our earlier acute transfection studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The issue of whether there is any cytoplasmic PIPkin II&#x003b2; at all, as some experiments imply (see Introduction), cannot be resolved by our data. But we can support the likely physiological significance of nuclear PIPkin II&#x003b2; and PtdIns5<italic>P</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], and importantly, our data also confirm the reality and novelty of PIPkinII&#x003b2;&#x02019;s unusual nuclear localisation sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Finally, we suggest that this technique may be useful to study other signalling molecules for which transfection or a lack of good antibodies is a hinderence. As well as exploring the true localisation of a protein (as we have done here), this approach enables its physiological interactions with other proteins, or changes in localisation or post-translational modifications to be followed in a clear and unambiguous way.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Ackowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a Programme Grant from the Wellcome Trust (J.P.R., J.H.C. and R.F.I.) and by the Royal Society (R.F.I.).
