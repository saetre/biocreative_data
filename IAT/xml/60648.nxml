We sought to determine the molecular identity of the relevant PLD using murine basal forebrain cholinergic SN56 cells in which the expression and activity of the two PLD isoforms, PLD1 and PLD2, were experimentally modified. ACh levels were examined in cells incubated in a choline-free medium, to ensure that their ACh was synthesized entirely from intracellular choline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PLD2, but not PLD1, mRNA and protein were detected in these cells and endogenous PLD activity and ACh synthesis were stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Introduction of a PLD2 antisense oligonucleotide into the cells reduced PLD2 mRNA and protein expression by approximately 30%. The PLD2 antisense oligomer similarly reduced basal- and PMA-stimulated PLD activity and ACh levels. Overexpression of mouse PLD2 by transient transfection increased basal- (by 74%) and PMA-stimulated (by 3.2-fold) PLD activity. Moreover, PLD2 transfection increased ACh levels by 26% in the absence of PMA and by 2.1-fold in the presence of PMA. Overexpression of human PLD1 by transient transfection increased PLD activity by 4.6-fold and ACh synthesis by 2.3-fold in the presence of PMA as compared to controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data identify PLD2 as the endogenous enzyme that hydrolyzes PC to generate choline for ACh synthesis in cholinergic cells, and indicate that in a model system choline generated by PLD1 may also be used for this purpose.</p></sec></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh)<sup>1</sup> in cholinergic neurons is dependent on the availability of its precursor, choline, most of which is derived from the circulation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]) and enters cholinergic neurons via a process catalyzed by a specific transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Some of the choline used for ACh synthesis is stored in membrane phosphatidylcholine (PC). Previous studies have shown that this choline is liberated from PC in a one-step reaction, thus indicating that it is produced by a phospholipase D (PLD, EC 3.1.4.4) -an enzyme that hydrolyzes the phospholipid into choline and phosphatidic acid (PA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, the molecular identity of this PLD remains to be determined.</p><p>There are two distinct PC-specific mammalian PLDs, designated as PLD1 and PLD2 and encoded by separate genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The two enzymes share 50% amino-acid identity, however, regulation of their activity and cellular localization are different. PLD1 is an extracellular signal-activated phospholipase; its activity rises when receptors for certain hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, cytokines, and other mediators are activated, and upon treatment of cells with phorbol esters (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). Studies using recombinant PLD1 tagged with green fluorescent protein or Flu-epitopes indicate that it is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, late endosomes, and plasma membrane ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). In vitro, basal PLD1 activity is usually low and can be stimulated by a variety of factors, including phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), protein kinase C (PKC), and several small GTPases, e.g. ADP ribosylation factors (ARF) and Rho (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). Regulation of PLD2 is less well understood. The enzyme exhibits a high constitutive activity in vitro, but it too can be activated by ARF (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]), and by phorbol esters, in intact cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Several reports have suggested that PLD2 is mainly localized to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], possibly in lipid rafts and caveolar membrane microdomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Most studies on the physiological functions of PLDs have focused on the product PA, a second messenger involved in mitosis, cellular morphological changes and vesicular trafficking (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]). However, the downstream events that occur as a consequence of PLD-generated PA production, and the identity of target proteins that are directly regulated by PA remains to be determined. PA can be further metabolized to diacylglycerol (DAG) and lysophosphatidic acid by PA phosphohydrolase and phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>, respectively. DAG is an activator of certain isozymes of PKC and lysophosphatidic acid acts as an intercellular messenger for many cell types.</p><p>The second product of PLD-catalyzed PC hydrolysis, choline, is used by all cells as a precursor of PC, and uniquely by cholinergic neurons as precursor of ACh. Previous studies have shown that choline derived from PC is indeed used for ACh synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and that this choline is generated by a PLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This pathway may become particularly important when extracellular circulating choline concentrations are low (e.g. during dietary choline deficiency) or when ACh synthesis and release are accelerated by high neuronal activity, thus generating a high demand for choline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we used a cholinergic cell line, SN56 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], which is derived from the fusion of septal neurons of postnatal day 21 mice with N18TG2 murine neuroblastoma cells, as a model for cholinergic neurons, in order to determine the possible role of PLD 1 and PLD2 in generating choline for ACh synthesis. We found that the cells express exclusively PLD2 and that downregulating PLD2 expression reduces ACh synthesis, while overexpressing and/or stimulating PLD2 activity increases the synthesis of the neurotransmitter, indicating that PLD2-catalyzed hydrolysis of PC generates choline for ACh synthesis in cholinergic cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PLD2 mRNA was present in SN56 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) while PLD1 message was undetectable either by Northern blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) or RT-PCR (data not shown). Consistent with these results an approximately 90 kDa PLD2 protein was found in SN56 cells by Western blot; however, no PLD1 protein could be detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Positive controls for these studies showed that our PLD1 probe and antibody were robust in detecting this PLD isoform in rat brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These data show that SN56 cells express exclusively PLD2 and thus experimental manipulations of the activity of this PLD isoform were subsequently employed to determine if this enzyme is capable of producing choline for ACh synthesis in cholinergic cells. In order to reduce PLD2 activity in SN56 cells, we sought to inhibit its expression. The cells were treated with a 25-mer antisense oligonucleotide at different concentrations and PLD2 mRNA levels were measured. Northern blot showed that PLD2 mRNA expression was reduced by the antisense oligonucleotide in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), and that, at the maximally-effective concentration of the oligo (200 nM), this inhibition reached 34% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B,C</xref>). In contrast, the control oligomer was inactive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B,C</xref>). Consistent with these findings. Western blot showed that the antisense oligomer decreased the PLD2 protein level by about 28%, whereas the control oligomer had no significant effect on PLD2 protein expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D,E</xref>). Given the fact that the transfection efficiency obtained in these experiments was approximately 30% (as determined with fluorescent dye-labeled oligonucleotides; data not shown), the results indicate that, in cells that had taken up the antisense oligomer, the inhibition of PLD2 expression was complete.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>SN56 cells express PLD2 but not PLD1 mRNA and protein.</bold> Total RNA or protein lysates were prepared and subjected to Northern or Western blot analyses as described in the Experimental Procedures.

Thus we hypothesized that activation of PLD with PMA in SN56 cells would elevate intracellular concentrations of its product, choline, and result in increased ACh production. We tested the effects of PMA on PLD activity and ACh content in SN56 cells incubated in a choline-free medium. Under these conditions the choline precursor used for the synthesis of ACh is derived entirely from the intracellular pool, which includes the choline in PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Consistent with previous studies, treatment of the cells with PMA activated PLD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The maximal effects of PMA (3.3 fold increase in the amount of its product [<sup>3</sup>H]phosphatidylpropanol relative to controls) was observed after 45 minutes (data not shown), a time period employed in subsequent studies. Free choline accumulation was also significantly increased by PMA. The magnitude of this effect tended to be small (approximately 15%), presumably because free choline is a rapidly turning over metabolic intermediate that does not accumulate in cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Moreover, PMA stimulated ACh accumulation by 26% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), in the cells. The fact that PMA increased both PLD activity and ACh content provided the initial evidence for a relationship between the endogenous PLD activity (i.e. PLD2) and ACh production. In control studies performed in the presence of choline (15 &#x003bc;M) in the medium PMA had no effect on ACh levels (data not shown), indicating that it did not stimulate the process of ACh synthesis but only the supply of choline.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>PLD2 antisense oligonucleotides down-regulate PLD2 activity, and acetylcholine and choline levels in SN56 cells.</bold> SN56 cells were transfected with either control or antisense oligonucleotides as described in the Experimental Procedures.

In the absence of PMA, the antisense oligomer decreased PLD2 activity by 19%. Although small, this change was statistically significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05). In the presence of PMA, antisense oligomer decreased PLD2 activity by 27% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Concomitantly the cellular choline content was decreased by 30% both in the presence and absence of PMA by the antisense oligomer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Moreover, the antisense oligomer decreased the cellular ACh content by approximately 30% compared to control oligomer treated cells both in the presence and absence of PMA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). These results indicate that downregulation of PLD2 activity by antisense oligomers in SN56 cells decreases not only the endogenous PLD2 activity but also the intracellular choline and ACh content. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that PLD2 can generate choline for ACh synthesis in SN56 cells.</p><p>To further confirm this hypothesis, we transiently transfected the cells with a mouse PLD2 expression plasmid. Overexpression of PLD2 for 48 hours in the cells caused a 74% increase of basal PLD2 activity and this activity was further increased by PMA by 3.2-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). To examine the ACh synthesis and choline turnover in these PLD2 transfectants, the cells and the media were collected and ACh and choline content were measured. In the absence of PMA, overexpression of PLD2 alone increased intracellular ACh levels by 26% and choline concentrations in the medium by 57%. In the presence of PMA, intracellular ACh levels and choline concentration in the medium rose further in the PLD2 transfectants reaching values more than two-fold higher than those in the control cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B,C</xref>). Together with the data presented above, these results show that up-regulation of PLD2 activity by overexpression and/or stimulation with PMA increases intracellular ACh levels.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of PLD2 in SN56 cells increases enzyme activity, acetylcholine synthesis and choline content in the medium.</bold> The cells were transfected with the expression plasmid as described in the Experimental Procedures.

These data raised the possibility that certain populations of cholinergic neurons may express PLD1 in addition to, or instead of, PLD2. Therefore we transfected SN56 cells with PLD1 expression construct, in order to determine if choline generated by this enzyme could be used as ACh precursor. Transfection of PLD1 into SN56 cells resulted in increased PLD activity and ACh synthesis in a fashion similar to that observed in PLD2 transfectants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) indicating that choline generated by PLD1 was converted to ACh.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of PLD1 in SN56 cells increases enzyme activity, acetylcholine synthesis and choline content in the medium.</bold> The cells were transfected with the hPLD1 expression plasmid as described in the Experimental Procedures.

We found that these cells expressed exclusively PLD2, a property that facilitated subsequent experiments. First, antisense oligonucleotides were used to down-regulate endogenous PLD2 activity. Although only 30% of the cells took up the oligonucleotides, PLD2 mRNA, protein expression, and activity were reduced proportionally to the transfection efficiency of the antisense oligomer, demonstrating high efficacy of this technique in the transfected cells. Significantly, intracellular choline and ACh content were similarly decreased by the antisense oligonucleotides, indicating that PLD2-catalyzed hydrolysis of PC provides choline for ACh synthesis. Next, PLD2 activity was up-regulated by either overexpressing a mouse PLD2 protein and/or by stimulation with PMA. Both PLD2 overexpression and stimulation with PMA increased PLD activity, choline production, and ACh accumulation. Moreover, PLD2 transfection and PMA treatment had a synergistic effect on PLD activity and ACh levels.</p><p>Our observation that PLD2 but not PLD1 was present in SN56 cells raised the possibility that the former might be preferentially expressed in cholinergic neurons. The data are consistent with the report that a variant of PC12 cells also express exclusively PLD2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and this expression is stimulated by nerve growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], a treatment known to upregulate the cholinergic phenotype of PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. PLD2 mRNA is abundant in many regions of the adult rodent central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], including cerebellum, frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain, brainstem, striatum, and spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The latter three regions are enriched with cell bodies of cholinergic neurons. PLD1 is also highly expressed in brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], notably in neurons in medial septum, cranial motor nuclei and ventral spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], all of which are likely cholinergic. However, no data are currently available on the possible coexpression of PLD1 and/or PLD2 and cholinergic markers (e.g. choline acetyltransferase) in vivo. Transfection of PLD1 into SN56 cells resulted in increased PLD activity and ACh production suggesting that PLD1, like PLD2, could potentially be used to supply choline for ACh synthesis. Thus, while the catalytic activities of both PLD1 and PLD2 appear to be equivalent in generating choline for ACh synthesis in transfected cells, it is possible that the modes of regulation of their activity might specify which one is expressed in a particular population of cholinergic neurons in vivo. It will be important to determine the mechanisms that control the expression of the two PLD isoforms and their possible relationships with the mechanisms that regulate the cholinergic phenotype.</p><p>Stimulation of PLD activity by PMA and the resulting increase of ACh synthesis from PLD-generated choline indicates that this pathway is regulated by PMA-responsive PKC isozymes. In vivo, this form of regulation of ACh synthesis would be controlled by neurotransmitters released by neurons that innervate particular cholinergic cells. There are multiple neurotransmitters whose receptors are coupled to PKC-dependent activation of PLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and thus this mode of regulating the availability of choline for ACh synthesis is likely to be widespread. Significantly, among the five subtypes of muscarinic ACh receptors (MAChRs), Ml and M3 receptors have been shown to efficiently activate PLD (and PKC) in various cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], whereas activation of PLD by M2 and M4 receptors is less robust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These observations suggest that in a cholinergic synapse, ACh released into the synaptic cleft might stimulate PLD activity leading to a release of choline that could be used for ACh synthesis. Since these MAChRs may be present on the pre- and postsynaptic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], this choline may be derived from PC residing in the membranes of either. However, while the presynaptically-derived choline released into the cytoplasm can be converted directly to ACh, the choline released by the postsynaptic cell must be initially taken up by the cholinergic nerve terminals. Our previous results in cholinergic human neuroblastoma LA-N-2 cells indicated that the choline moiety from PC breakdown was released directly into the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and a kinetic study using [<sup>3</sup>H]choline in BHK cells also showed that choline was initially released inside the cells by PMA-activated PLD and then rapidly appeared in the medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Consistent with the latter study, we also observed a rise in the medium choline levels in SN56 cells transfected with either PLD1 or PLD2 and treated with PMA.</p><p>Although it is clear that the PLD-generated choline is efficiently utilized by cholinergic cells (LA-N-2 and SN56) as a precursor of ACh, the quantitative significance of this pathway and mechanisms that regulate it remain to be fully determined. Studies on a variety of preparations indicate that most of the choline used for ACh synthesis is derived from the extracellular space (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]) and therefore the PLD pathway has to be considered as an accessory process. Interestingly, PLD activity is upregulated in the hippocampus of rats whose mothers consumed a choline-supplemented diet during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Given that prenatal choline supplementation improves memory and attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], two cognitive functions that require the hippocampal cholinergic system, it is possible that the upregulated PLD pathway underlies, at least in part, the cognitive enhancement observed in the prenatally choline-supplemented animals.</p><p>Abnormalities in the PLD-mediated release of choline would be expected to result in an impairment of cholinergic neurotransmission and/or in a generalized malfunction of cholinergic cells. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by such a malfunction together with degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, and it is thought that memory loss in this disease is partly caused by this cholinergic lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In vitro studies point to two novel mechanisms that might cause dysregulation of PLD2 activity in AD. The first is based on observations that PLD2 is inhibited by &#x003b1;-synuclein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], a protein of unknown function that accumulates in the amyloid deposits in AD brain. Normally &#x003b1;-synuclein is present in the synaptic nerve terminals (including those of cholinergic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]) but in AD its processing is altered, causing it to be abnormally deposited in plaques composed primarily of aggregates of &#x003b2;-amyloid peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. However, how this abnormal turnover of &#x003b1;-synuclein contributes to the pathophysiology of AD remains to be determined. Recent in vitro observations that &#x003b1;-synuclein is phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases, and that this phosphorylation relieves its inhibitory action on PLD2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], suggest a novel mechanism by which neurotransmitter receptors (including muscarinic receptors) might modulate PLD2 activity. Since multiple receptor classes are affected by the pathophysiological processes of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], abnormal phosphorylation of &#x003b1;-synuclein may contribute to both altered &#x003b1;-synuclein turnover and abnormal regulation of PLD2 activity. The second set of observations indicate that reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate PLD2 in a PKC-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. There is much evidence that ROS generation is upregulated in AD brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that PLD2 may be activated in this disease resulting, perhaps, in dysregulation of PC metabolism. Indeed evidence of an accelerated PC turnover has been repeatedly observed in post-mortem samples of AD brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] as well as in an in vitro model of this disease characterized by the generation of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Most of the previous studies on the physiological functions PLDs have concentrated on the role of its product, PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Our data show that PLD has a dual function in cholinergic cells, as the second product of its activity, choline, is used as a metabolic precursor of ACh, and suggest that this pathway may be regulated by the type of PLD isoform expressed in a particular class of cholinergic neurons. In our basal forebrain-derived SN56 cells, this isoform is PLD2. However, our observations that PLD1 overexpression increases ACh production form endogenous sources suggest that PLD1 may serve the same function as PLD2 in other cholinergic cells. Moreover, the data showing that this pathway is stimulated by PMA, suggest that it is subject to regulation by PKC-activating neurotransmitters. The physiological, and possible pathophysiological significance in neurological diseases, of this pathway remains to be determined. It will also be important to determine how cholinergic cells regulate the metabolism of PA &#x02013; a compound with multiple signaling and structural functions &#x02013; when the PLD pathway is stimulated to meet the demand for choline.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Lipofectamine Plus reagents were from Gibco BRL Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY).
