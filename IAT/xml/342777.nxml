We determined a sequence of 169 nucleotides which included the complete 3' non-coding region of the gamma-globin mRNA. The codon for amino acid 136 was GCA, indicating that this cloned fragment was derived from the Agamma-globin gene. In conjunction with the surrounding sequences, the GCA codon provides the Agamma-species with a unique CTGCAG hexanucleotide that is recognized by the restriction enzyme Pst I. The 3'-untranslated region of the gamma-globin mRNA consists of 90 nucleotides, and shares little homology with that of the human beta-globin mRNA. As in other mammalian mRNAs, a symmetrical sequence and the hexanucleotide AAUAAA are present.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00473-0157-a" xlink:role="4627"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00473-0155.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4625"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00473-0156.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4626"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00473-0157.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4627"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00473-0158.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4628"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00473-0159.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4629"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00473-0160.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4630"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
