Here, we report the identification and characterization of a novel archaeal LAGLIDADG-type HEase, I-ApeI, encoded by the ApeK1.S908 intron within the 16S rDNA of <italic>Aeropyrum pernix</italic> K1. I-ApeI consists of 222 amino acids and harbors two LAGLIDADG-like sequences. It recognizes the 20 bp non-palindromic sequence 5&#x02032;-GCAAGGCTGAAAC&#x02193;TTAAAGG and cleaves target DNA to produce protruding tetranucleotide 3&#x02032; ends. Either Mn<sup>2+</sup> or Co<sup>2+</sup> can be substituted for Mg<sup>2+</sup> as a cofactor in the cleavage reaction. Of the 20 bases within the minimal recognition site, 7 are essential for cleavage and are located at positions proximal to the cleavage sites.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Homing endonucleases (HEases) are a diverse collection of site-specific endonucleases that recognize and cleave sequences of 14&#x02013;40 DNA base pairs and tolerate various degrees of degeneracy of their target sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> they play a pivotal role as 'target selector proteins' in the homing of mobile introns and inteins in the genomes of bacteriophages, bacteria, archaea and unicellular eukaryotes. HEases are encoded within the mobile elements themselves, except for freestanding enzymes, such as F-SceII (HO endonuclease) and F-TevI (SegA). The hitherto identified HEases are grouped into four families, LAGLIDADG, GIY&#x02013;YIG, His&#x02013;Cys and HNH, on the basis of their conserved motifs. The LAGLIDADG family is the largest of the four families with at least 200 members (see REBASE at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rebase.neb.com/cgi-bin/azlist?homing"/>).</p><p>Much interest has focused on the target specificity of these HEases due to their potential as tools for genome mapping, cloning of megabase DNA fragments and gene targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Searches for naturally occurring HEases that recognize novel sequences remain important, though a few artificial rare-cutting enzymes with novel specificity have also been created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Archaea are promising sources of novel HEases, because their rRNA genes (rDNAs) are interspersed with a number of mobile introns, &#x0223c;40% of which contain open reading frames (ORFs) encoding LAGLIDADG-like sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the identification and characterization of a new intron-encoded LAGLIDADG-type HEase, I-ApeI, from the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeote <italic>Aeropyrum pernix</italic> K1. We also describe the effects on cleavage of single base pair substitutions within the I-ApeI recognition sequence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>A.pernix</italic> strain K1 was grown as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> INV&#x003b1;F&#x02032; (Invitrogen) was grown in liquid or in solid Luria&#x02013;Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with ampicillin and used for plasmid manipulations; <italic>E.coli</italic> BL21(DE3) pLysS was used as the host for protein overexpression.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><sec><title>Plasmids containing wild-type and mutant target sites</title><p>The nomenclature of archaeal rDNA introns is based on a proposal by Morinaga <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The DNA base pairs around the insertion site (IS) of the ApeK1.S908 intron are named as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>. The wild-type target DNA spanning positions &#x02212;12 to +12 was generated by annealing the 25 bp complementary oligonucleotides 5&#x02032;-CGCAAGGCTGAA*ACTTAAAGGAATA and 5&#x02032;-ATTCCTTTAAGT*TTCAGCCTTGCGA (asterisk indicates the IS of the ApeK1.S908 intron). The duplex was ligated into a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) to yield pWT. A series of pWT derivatives with mutated target sites were prepared by cloning appropriate synthetic oligonucleotide duplexes into pCR2.1. All the cloned inserts were verified by sequencing both strands.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression plasmid</title><p>The I-ApeI gene was PCR amplified from <italic>A.pernix</italic> K1 chromosomal DNA with primers apeI-For(5&#x02032;-<underline>CATATG</underline>GATGGGTATGCTTTATTTT) and apeI-Rev (5&#x02032;-<underline>GGATCC</underline>TTAAGCGGCAGGCTCCACCCCT). The product was cut at its NdeI and BamHI sites (underlined) and ligated into the same sites in pET-15b (Novagen) to yield plasmid pIA1. The insert was then sequenced to eliminate PCR artifacts.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p><italic>E.coli</italic> BL21(DE3) pLysS was transformed with pIA1, and the transformants were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in LB broth supplemented with 50 &#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.4. Expression of His<sub>6</sub>I&#x02013;ApeI was induced by adding isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside to a concentration of 0.5 mM and continuing incubation for another 3 h at 37&#x000b0;C. The culture was then chilled on ice, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4&#x000b0;C. The cell pellet was washed and resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol and 0.5 mM DTT), and all subsequent steps were performed at 4&#x000b0;C. The cells were disrupted by sonication, and the crude lysate was centrifuged to remove intact cells and cellular debris. The resulting supernatant was heated at 60&#x000b0;C for 30 min, and thermally denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was adjusted to a final ammonium sulfate concentration of 20% saturation and centrifuged. Ammonium sulfate was then added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 50% saturation, and the precipitate was pelleted, dissolved in buffer A and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialysate was fractionated on a HiTrap SP column (Amersham) followed by a HiTrap heparin column (Amersham). Each column was pre-equilibrated with buffer A, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2&#x02013;1 M NaCl. The final fractions containing His<sub>6</sub>I&#x02013;ApeI were pooled and loaded onto a Superdex 75 pg column (Amersham) equilibrated with buffer A, and the purified protein was flash frozen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Endonuclease assays</title><p>The double-stranded DNA endonuclease activity of I-ApeI was assayed using linearized plasmids. Plasmid pWT and its derivatives were linearized with NcoI, which cleaves the vector DNA 1.6 kb from the I-ApeI target site. The resulting 4.0 kb fragments were extracted with phenol&#x02013;chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. This substrate DNA (0.1 pmol) was incubated with I-ApeI (10 pmol) in a total volume of 10 &#x003bc;l of 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.5 at 25&#x000b0;C), 180 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM DTT at 90&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Unless otherwise stated, reactions were performed under these standard conditions. The assay mixtures were incubated in an iCycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) without oil sample overlays. The reactions were terminated by placing the samples on ice and adding 2 &#x003bc;l of loading buffer containing 0.25% bromophenol blue, 1 mM EDTA and 30% glycerol. The products were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. The gels were photographed using a GelDoc2000 digital imaging system (Bio-Rad), and the band intensities were determined using Quantity One software (PDI).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of the recognition sequence and cleavage site</title><p>To identify the minimal recognition sequence, plasmids containing a series of deletions surrounding the IS of the ApeK1.S908 intron were used as substrates in the cleavage reaction. A decrease in reaction products was interpreted as an indication that the deleted base pairs lay within the recognition sequence.</p><p>For cleavage site (CS) mapping, the double-stranded DNA substrates for I-ApeI cleavage were PCR amplified from pWT using the universal primers M13(&#x02212;20) and M13 reverse, both of which were biotinylated at their 5&#x02032; end. Each labeled primer was used in a separate PCR together with the appropriate non-labeled partner primer. Denatured I-ApeI-digested substrates (labeled as &#x02018;X&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) were run on 6% polyacrylamide/8.3 M urea gels, alongside the corresponding dideoxy sequencing reactions generated from the same 5&#x02032; end-labeled primers. Biotinylated DNA was detected using an Imaging High Kit (Toyobo).</p><p>The nature of the cohesive termini generated by I-ApeI digestion was also examined. I-ApeI-digested pWT was treated with T4 DNA polymerase (Takara) in the presence of dNTPs, and the resulting blunt ends of the DNA fragment were re-ligated, to generate pWT&#x00394;PE8. The sequence of pWT&#x00394;PE8 was then compared with that of pWT.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>A polyclonal antibody against the 16-residue synthetic polypeptide SSRKTPWPTPQRVKDC, which corresponds to residues 87&#x02013;101 of I-ApeI, was raised in female New Zealand White rabbits. Native I-ApeI protein was partially purified from the cell-free extract of <italic>A.pernix</italic> K1 using HiTrap SP, HiTrap heparin and Superdex 75 pg columns as described above. Aliquots of the samples were separated on 0.1% SDS&#x02013;18% PAGE and subjected to western blotting with the rabbit antiserum followed by goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich) and the colorimetric substrate Western Blue (Promega).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of molecular weight</title><p>To determine the molecular weight, 120 &#x003bc;g of the purified His<sub>6</sub>I&#x02013;ApeI protein was sedimented in a 4.6 ml 10&#x02013;30% glycerol gradient in 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM DTT. Size standards included 1 mg each of BSA (66 kDa), pepsin (34.7 kDa), trypsinogen (24 kDa) and lysozyme (14.3 kDa). Centrifugation was carried out in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor at 45&#x02009;000 r.p.m. for 40 h at 4&#x000b0;C. Of the 200 &#x003bc;l samples that were taken from the top of the gradient, 50 &#x003bc;l was subjected to 0.1% SDS&#x02013;18% PAGE and detected by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue or western blotting with anti-I-ApeI serum. Each fraction was diluted 1:10 in buffer A, and 1 &#x003bc;l was used in the I-ApeI activity assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Thermostability studies</title><p>The thermostability was tested by incubating the purified His<sub>6</sub>I&#x02013;ApeI protein (10 pmol/&#x003bc;l) at 70, 80 and 90&#x000b0;C in buffer A. Aliquots were stored on ice at different intervals, and the remaining activities were assayed under standard conditions.</p><p>The effect of the substrate DNA on the stability of I-ApeI activity was examined by incubating a mixture containing the His<sub>6</sub>I&#x02013;ApeI protein (1 pmol/&#x003bc;l) and the NcoI-linearized pWT (0.01 pmol/&#x003bc;l) in buffer A at 90&#x000b0;C. The remaining activities at the intervals indicated were monitored as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Structure modeling</title><p>The structural coordinates of PI&#x02013;PfuI (PDB entry: 1DQ3) were used to model the LAGLIDADG interface of I-ApeI. A model was built using the 3D-JIGSAW program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and visualized using RasMol software (version 2.7.1.1).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Identification of I-ApeI</title><p>A previous study showed that the <italic>A.pernix</italic> 16S rRNA gene is interrupted by a 699 bp archaeal intron, ApeK1.S908 (formerly designated I&#x003b1;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). An ORF (726 bp) that uses an ATG start codon located 32 bp downstream of the 5&#x02032; end of the intron has been annotated as the gene encoding a putative HEase. However, this prediction is not correct, because an assigned Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno (SD) sequence for the ORF, GGGAGG, is far removed (17 bp) from the start codon. Torarinsson <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) revealed that 86% of single genes and the first genes of operons in the <italic>A.pernix</italic> genome lie 7&#x02013;15 bp downstream of the predominant SD sequence, GGGG. In view of these data, we reexamined the intron sequence and identified a suitable coding region for the putative HEase. The newly identified ORF (669 bp) uses an ATG start codon located 83 bp downstream of the 5&#x02032; end of the intron, continues through the 3&#x02032; intron&#x02013;exon junction and extends 52 bp into the 3&#x02032; exon. The putative SD sequence, GGGG, precedes the ORF 7 bp upstream from the start codon. This ORF was estimated to encode a protein of 222 amino acids with a molecular mass of 25.0 kDa.</p><p>Alignment with the amino acid sequences of known archaeal HEases revealed that the intronic ORF contains two copies of LAGLIDADG-like sequences (L<sub>9</sub>VGALRDG<sub>16</sub> and V<sub>111</sub>KGFVDAEG<sub>119</sub>, termed P1 and P2, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The P1 and P2 sequences have three characteristic features: (i) a high content of hydrophobic residues, (ii) a scattering of small residues such as Gly and Ala that can form van der Waals contacts between protein backbone atoms and (iii) the presence of the acidic residues (D15, E118) capable of forming the active site. Whereas the P2 sequence has the GxxxG motif common to LAGLIDADG enzymes and transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), P1 has a one-residue gap in the C-terminal half region. Homology-based structural modeling of the ORF product using the endonuclease domain of PI-PfuI as a template suggests that its overall structure consists of two similar &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; domains (&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b2;&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b2;&#x003b1;) that assemble as a monomer with the domains related by pseudo 2-fold symmetry, and that the LAGLIDADG helices (corresponding to &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;4) are located at the center of this symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Owing to the gap in the P1 sequence, the C-terminal region of the &#x003b1;1 helix appears to have an anomalous structure. However, from these computational analyses, it remains unclear whether the aberration in the &#x003b1;1 helix has a significant effect on the formation of the LAGLIDADG two-helix bundle, which is mainly responsible for the domain interface as well as for the proper spacing of the neighboring acidic residues forming the active site.</p><p>To test the ability of the ORF product to cleave DNA in a sequence-specific manner, we prepared the N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tagged recombinant protein. The ApeK1.S908 intron ORF is in-frame with the downstream exon sequence and the translation termination site is not predictable. Therefore, we expressed the ORF product from precursor rRNA using plasmid pIA1. Five purification stages were needed to obtain a homogeneous protein (His<sub>6</sub>I&#x02013;ApeI): heat treatment and ammonium sulfate fractionation, followed by three chromatographic steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A western blotting using specific anti-His<sub>6</sub> tag antibodies confirmed that this single band, with an apparent molecular mass (Mr) of 27 kDa, corresponds to the overexpressed protein (data not shown). Despite the presence of the His<sub>6</sub> tag, the recombinant protein did not bind to a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity column under the native conditions used. Using the purified His<sub>6</sub>I&#x02013;ApeI protein, the endonuclease activity was assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Incubation of NcoI-linearized pWT with His<sub>6</sub>I&#x02013;ApeI and Mg<sup>2+</sup> at 90&#x000b0;C generated discrete cleavage products of 1.6 and 2.4 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lane 2). Incubation of the same substrate with either His<sub>6</sub>I&#x02013;ApeI or Mg<sup>2+</sup> on its own resulted in no cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lanes 1 and 3). The same activity was also demonstrated for the ORF product corresponding to translation from the excised intron RNA (data not shown). These results show that the archaeal intron ApeK1.S908 encodes a site-specific double-stranded DNA endonuclease whose activity depends on Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>Translation of the I-ApeI protein in the archaeal cells was confirmed by western blotting. Trace amounts of I-ApeI activity were present in the host cells. After partial purification from a cell-free extract, a fraction containing I-ApeI activity was obtained. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, a single band with an Mr of 25 kDa was detected in an aliquot of this fraction (lane 2). The position of this band was slightly different from that of the His<sub>6</sub>I&#x02013;ApeI protein (Mr = 27 kDa; lane 1), reflecting the absence of the His<sub>6</sub> tag. In general, the homing mechanism of mobile introns requires the translation of intron-encoded HEases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). This result indicates that homing might take place in natural hydrothermal environments.</p><p>In an attempt to determine its native molecular weight, the purified His<sub>6</sub>I&#x02013;ApeI was re-chromatographed on a calibrated Superdex 200 column. The <italic>V</italic><sub>e</sub> observed for His<sub>6</sub>I&#x02013;ApeI yielded a <italic>K</italic><sub>av</sub> of 0.81, corresponding to an invalid apparent molecular mass of &#x0223c;7 kDa. This retarded elution may be due to non-specific interaction between the protein and the column. Then, we determined the size of I-ApeI by density gradient ultracentrifugation. His<sub>6</sub>I&#x02013;ApeI was detected in the resulting fractions by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) as well as by enzymatic assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The protein migrated with a distance of 17.1&#x02013;18.9 mm (fractions 9 and 10), which corresponds to a molecular size of 21&#x02013;28 kDa for a globular protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These results imply that I-ApeI is a monomeric enzyme with an Mr of 25.0 kDa.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical characterization of I-ApeI</title><sec><title>Recognition sequence</title><p>To determine the minimal recognition sequence, a 24 bp stretch of DNA spanning the IS of the ApeK1.S908 intron was analyzed. A series of gradually truncated target sequences were prepared for the I-ApeI cleavage assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). The initial reaction rate was reduced with substrates having deletions that included the segment from &#x02212;11 to +9. I-ApeI cleaved the substrate DEL13, containing only the sequence from &#x02212;11 to +9 as efficiently as the wild-type substrate, WT. These results indicate that the minimal target sequence for I-ApeI cleavage comprises 20 bp (5&#x02032;-GCAAGGCTGAAACTTAAAGG). No HEase with this specificity has been reported previously. The fact that I-ApeI targets a non-palindromic DNA sequence is consistent with the conclusion that I-ApeI is a monomeric LAGLIDADG enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>Cleavage sites</title><p>The CSs were mapped by comparison of the fragments digested with I-ApeI with dideoxy sequencing ladders. From the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, it can be inferred that the I-ApeI CSs are after +2 and &#x02212;2 on the top and bottom strands, respectively. Additional evidence supporting this conclusion was obtained from sequencing pWT&#x00394;PE8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The outcome indicates that cleavage by I-ApeI creates 4 bp 3&#x02032;-protruding ends that are removed by the exonucleolytic activity of T4 DNA polymerase. The ends generated were a 5&#x02032;-phosphate and a 3&#x02032;-OH, as confirmed by ligation-recutting of the products (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Optimum reaction conditions</title><p>The molar ratio of DNA:I-ApeI (1:100) was adjusted so that no more than 70% of the substrate was converted to the products, and the reaction rate was linear as a function of the time within 10 min. The excess amount of I-ApeI could attribute to its low thermostability as described below.</p><p>I-ApeI was active between 70 and 90&#x000b0;C, with a maximum at 90&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Even at temperatures &#x0223c;90&#x000b0;C, the double-stranded DNA substrate was stabilized by Mg<sup>2+</sup>. However, at temperatures &#x0003e;95&#x000b0;C, I-ApeI activity could not be estimated precisely due to rapid denaturation of the DNA. I-ApeI exhibited high activity at relatively high (180&#x02013;220 mM) concentrations of NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The optimal pH for cleavage was 7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Divalent metal ions are essential cofactors for all phosphoryl-transfer reactions catalyzed by nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). I-ApeI cleavage required Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>); excess EDTA completely inhibited the reaction. Interestingly, I-ApeI preferred Mn<sup>2+</sup> as a cofactor at low concentrations (1&#x02013;5 mM) to Mg<sup>2+</sup>, without altering its cleavage site on the wild-type substrate DNA. I-ApeI had no activity at 10 mM Mn<sup>2+</sup> because of aggregation of the substrate DNA. Co<sup>2+</sup> (1 mM) was able to substitute for Mg<sup>2+</sup> as a cofactor, but resulted in less efficient cleavage (83%). We did not examine whether star activity was created in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Co<sup>2+</sup>. No activity was observed when Mg<sup>2+</sup> was replaced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup> or Sr<sup>2+</sup>, although the presence of these divalent cations did not cause aggregation of the substrate DNA.</p><p>In order to evaluate the thermostability of I-ApeI, the time course of its heat inactivation was monitored at temperatures of 70, 80 and 90&#x000b0;C. There was no apparent activity loss after the enzyme was incubated alone for 10 min at 70&#x000b0;C, whereas the I-ApeI apoenzyme was extremely labile at 90&#x000b0;C and retained no activity after 2 min of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Nevertheless, significant protection against thermal inactivation was exerted by the substrate DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). After 2, 4 or 6 min of incubation with the substrate DNA at 90&#x000b0;C, the enzyme still retained 51, 18 and 7%, respectively, of its catalytic activity. These results led us to hypothesize that some molecular interaction between I-ApeI and genomic DNA could be responsible for the prevention of the enzyme decay in the hyperthermophilic archaeal cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Single base pair substitutions that influence I-ApeI cleavage efficiency</title><p>To identify the DNA bases essential for I-ApeI cleavage, we performed systematic assays with a set of variant substrates with single base pair substituted one by one with the three alternative bases. A total of 63 single base pair variants at 21 positions from &#x02212;11 to +10 were prepared. Each of the variant substrates was incubated with His<sub>6</sub>I&#x02013;ApeI for 10 min, and the extents of cleavage observed are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>Mutations at positions &#x02212;7, &#x02212;6, &#x02212;4, &#x02212;3, &#x02212;2, +2 and +3 significantly reduced the efficiency of cleavage. A &#x0003e;80% loss of I-ApeI function was observed with any of the alternative bases at these positions, indicating that these seven bases are strongly involved in the DNA&#x02013;protein interaction. The effect of base substitutions at positions &#x02212;3 and +3 are of particular note, since similar results have been obtained in mutational experiments on the substrates of other LAGLIDADG enzymes, such as I-CreI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), I-CeuI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), I-SceI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), I-SceII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), I-PorI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) and PI-SceI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). This leads to the general rule that the bases located close outside the CSs are essential for recognition by LAGLIDADG enzymes. In agreement with this inference, structural data on DNA co-crystals of I-CreI, I-MsoI, I-AniI, I-SceI, E-DreI and PI-SceI have demonstrated that the bases at positions &#x02212;3 and +3 make direct contact via hydrogen bonds with residues of the proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Conversely, substitution of &#x02212;8 had little or no effect on the extent of cleavage, suggesting that the base at this position is of minor importance in the cleavage reaction. Biased base preferences were observed at the positions of &#x02212;5, &#x02212;1, +1, +4, +5, +6, +7, +8 and +9.</p><p>In conclusion, the preferred sequence for I-ApeI cleavage is 5&#x02032;-RCANGGCTG^ADRC&#x02193;TTMMADR [N = A or C or G or T, D = A or G or T, R = A or G, M = A or C; ^ and &#x02193; indicate the cleavage site on the bottom and top strand, respectively]. The effects of multiple substitutions within the recognition sequence on I-ApeI cleavage reaction are yet to be determined.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas &#x02018;Genome Biology&#x02019;, and by the National Project on Protein Structural and Functional Analyses, from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan.
