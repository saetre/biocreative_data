Both subunits are required for plasma membrane localization of the functional transporter but it is unclear how and where the subunits interact and whether glycosylation is required for functional activity. We sought to examine these questions for the human OST&#x003b1;-OST&#x003b2; transporter using the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, and COS7 cells transfected with constructs of human OST&#x003b1;-FLAG and OST&#x003b2;-Myc.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Tunicamycin treatment demonstrated that human OST&#x003b1; is glycosylated.

Immunofluorescence of both cells indicated that, in the presence of OST&#x003b2;, the alpha subunit could still be expressed on the plasma membrane after tunicamycin treatment. Furthermore, the functional uptake of <sup>3</sup>H-estrone sulfate was unchanged in the absence of N-glycosylation. Co-immunoprecipitation indicates that the immature form of OST&#x003b1; interact with OST&#x003b2;. However, immunoprecipitation of OST&#x003b2; using an anti-Myc antibody did not co-precipitate the mature, complex glycosylated form of OST&#x003b1;, suggesting that the primary interaction occurs early in the biosynthetic pathway and may be transient.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, human OST&#x003b1; is a glycoprotein that requires interaction with OST&#x003b2; to reach the plasma membrane.

In the human, OST&#x003b1;-OST&#x003b2; is found predominantly in epithelial cells of liver, intestine, kidney, adrenal gland and testis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is expressed on the basolateral membrane of these cells and has been shown to transport estrone 3-sulfate, digoxin, dehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulfate, prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>and a variety of bile acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Regulation of this basolateral transporter is through the action of the bile acid-activated nuclear receptor, the farnesoid &#x000d7; receptor (FXR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus, conditions of cholestasis have been shown to result in up-regulation of OST&#x003b1;-OST&#x003b2; at both the mRNA and protein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Recently the importance of this transporter in intestinal bile acid transport and in the enterohepatic circulation has been confirmed in Ost&#x003b1;-/- mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Data from studies of these mice highlight the role of Ost&#x003b1;-OST&#x003b2; and FGF15 in regulating hepatic bile acid synthesis.</p><p>It was noted early on that transport activity required the coexpression of two distinct gene products. The first, Ost&#x003b1;, is a predicted 340-amino acid protein with seven membrane spanning domains and the second, Ost&#x003b2;, is a 128-amino acid, single membrane spanning protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Transport is bidirectional across the plasma membrane, and most likely occurs by facilitated diffusion of substrates down their electrochemical gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Plasma membrane localization and functional activity requires the expression of both subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Several groups have shown that the functional requirement for co-expression of both subunits is associated with the physical association of the two proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Dawson and colleagues demonstrated that mouse Ost&#x003b2; was necessary for mouse Ost&#x003b1; to acquire N-glycosylation in transfected HEK293 cells, thus suggesting that the beta subunit is acting as a chaperone to allow the alpha subunit to exit the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Quality control at the level of the ER can involve many different mechanisms. Newly synthesized proteins must be folded correctly and, in some cases, must be assembled into multimeric protein complexes in order to be trafficked to the Golgi and plasma membrane. If this does not occur the protein may be ubiquitinated and designated for degradation. Thus, the chaperone activity of OST&#x003b2; may require a properly folded alpha subunit or may aid in the folding of the peptide. Alternatively, the protein-protein interaction may mask a retention/retrieval motif or reveal a forward trafficking motif in the alpha subunit. Recent work shows that both subunits must be expressed in order to prevent degradation of the other subunit, suggesting a specific interaction between the two proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Sun and colleagues have suggested that OST&#x003b2; is interacting with the N-terminus, and not the C-terminus, of OST&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This raises the question of whether the glycosylation of the alpha subunit could influence the interaction with the beta subunit and, thus, affect membrane localization and function of the intact transporter. Therefore, in this study we have sought to examine more fully the interaction of OST&#x003b1; and OST&#x003b2; in two mammalian expression systems where we can look at both the endogenous and exogenous, transfected expression of the human transporter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture</title><p>The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2, and the monkey kidney cell line, COS7, were acquired from ATCC (Manassas, VA).

Twenty four to forty-eight hours after addition of CDCA, RNA and protein were isolated or cells were fixed for immunofluorescence as described below.

Immunoprecipatation was performed using anti-FLAG affinity gel (M2, Sigma, St Louis, MO) or anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (abcam, Cambridge, MA) and Protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz). Lysates were precleared and negative controls were performed with non-specific anti-mouse IgG. In the case of immunoprecipitation of endogenous protein from HepG2 cells, a Native IgG kit from Pierce was used with polyclonal antibodies raised against OST&#x003b1; (hOST&#x003b1;-327) and OST&#x003b2; (hOST&#x003b2;-1) provided by Ned Ballatori (Rochester, NY).</p><p>Pulse-chase experiments were carried out in COS7 cells 24 hr after transfection.

Quenching of non-specific fluorescence in formaldehyde fixed cells was done with 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl for 20 min prior to blocking 20 minutes in blocking buffer (PBS, 1% BSA, 0.05% Triton X-100). In the case of OST&#x003b2;, non-permeablized conditions using no detergent was found to give better surface labeling. Primary antibody was diluted in blocking buffer and incubated on the cells for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing in PBS, secondary antibody (Alexa 594 or 488 anti-IgG (Invitrogen)) was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Fluorescence was visualized with a Zeiss LSM510 (Carl Zeiss Inc, Thornwood, NY) confocal microscope and images processed with Photoshop (Adobe, Mountainview, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>Transport assay</title><p>HepG2 cells were cultured in 35 mm dishes as described above. At ~70% confluency 50 &#x003bc;M CDCA or vehicle was added and the culture continued for 48 hrs. <sup>3</sup>H-Taurocholate (1 &#x003bc;M) or <sup>3</sup>H-estrone 3-sulfate (15 nM) were made up in transport buffer (116 mM NaCl, 5.3 mM KCl, 1.1 mM KH2PO4, 0.8 MgSO4.7H2O, 1.8 mM CaCl, 11 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES) and warmed to 37&#x000b0;C. For each time point, triplicate dishes were washed 3 times with warm transport buffer alone and then incubated for the given time with 1 ml transport buffer containing <sup>3</sup>H-substrate. Uptake of substrates was stopped by rapid addition and aspiration of 1 ml of cold transport buffer three times. Cells were lysed with 1 ml 0.5% Triton X100. Cell lysates (600 &#x003bc;l) were combined with OptiFluor scintillation fluid (5 ml) and counted in a PerkinElmer WinSpectral LSC (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Protein content of the lysates was determined with the BCA reagent (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) and used to normalize the counts.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>N-glycosylation of OST&#x003b1; is not required for plasma membrane expression in HepG2 cells</title><p>Previous studies indicate that human hepatocytes express OST&#x003b1;-OST&#x003b2; on their basolateral membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In untreated human hepatoma, HepG2, cells, there was little expression of OST&#x003b1;-OST&#x003b2; mRNA or protein. However, treatment with the FXR agonist, CDCA, up-regulated mRNA levels of both subunits rapidly within one hour and peaked between 12 and 24 hours. mRNA levels increased ~12 fold for OST&#x003b1; and ~20 fold for OST&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Protein levels for both subunits were not detectable until at least 12 hrs after treatment with 50 &#x003bc;M CDCA or 2 &#x003bc;M 6-ethyl CDCA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Both subunits were visualized on the plasma membrane at that time, with 70&#x02013;90% of cells expressing the transporter after 48 hrs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). A time course using immunofluorescence detected no OST&#x003b1; prior to 12 hrs, although OST&#x003b2; could be visualized in a perinuclear localization at earlier time points (data not shown). Finally, uptake of both <sup>3</sup>H-taurocholate and <sup>3</sup>H-estrone 3-sulfate was increased 3&#x02013;4 fold in CDCA treated cells, indicating that OST&#x003b1;-OST&#x003b2; was functional in these cells when expressed on the plasma membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Uptake of taurocholate can also be mediated by other basolateral transporters such as the sodium taurocholate co-transporting protein (NTCP) and the family of organic anion transporter proteins (OATPs). Therefore, we also measured mRNA levels for OATP1A2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and NTCP by Q-PCR. While most were unchanged after CDCA treatment, mRNA for OATP1B3 was up-regulated (data not shown), consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, we cannot rule out that some of the uptake was due to OATP1B3.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>FXR agonists up-regulate OST&#x003b1; and OST&#x003b2; mRNA and protein in HepG2 cells.</bold> (A) mRNA was isolated from HepG2 cells treated with CDCA for the indicated time periods.

(B) Lysates from HepG2 cells treated with CDCA for the indicated time periods were combined with Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE.

(D) Transport studies in HepG2 cells using <sup>3</sup>H-taurocholate (1 &#x003bc;M) and <sup>3</sup>H-estrone 3-sulfate (50 nM) indicate that treatment with 50 &#x003bc;M CDCA up-regulates functional activity 3&#x02013;4 fold over non-treated cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-9-57-1"/></fig><p>Examination of the amino acid sequence of the alpha subunit has indicated that, unlike in the mouse, rat and skate sequences, the human OST&#x003b1; subunit does not have the traditional N-glycosylation consensus sequence of Asn-X-Ser/Thr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Therefore, it was of interest to determine if the human OST&#x003b1; protein was glycosylated. Tunicamycin is an antibiotic that has been shown to inhibit N-glycosylation of proteins by blocking the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to dolichol phosphate, the first step in the formation of core oligosaccharide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Treatment of HepG2 cells with tunicamycin (1 &#x003bc;g/ml), 5 hours after the addition of 50 &#x003bc;M CDCA and for a total of 15 hrs, reduced the molecular weight of OST&#x003b1; from ~36 kD to ~30 kD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Treatment with the glycosidases, Endo H and PNGase F, confirmed that these proteins were the mature and non-glycosylated forms of OST&#x003b1; (data not shown). There was no shift in the molecular weight of the OST&#x003b2; subunit after tunicamycin treatment. This confirms previous data demonstrating that the only potential N-glycosylation consensus sequence in mouse Ost&#x003b2; is in a presumably transmembrane domain and, thus, is not utilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These data indicate that endogenously expressed human OST&#x003b1; is a glycoprotein. However, despite the lack of N-glycosylation in these treated cells, immunofluorescence demonstrated that the OST&#x003b1; subunit was still expressed on the plasma membrane at similar levels to untreated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Furthermore, the tunicamycin treated HepG2 cells showed no difference from untreated cells in <sup>3</sup>H-estrone 3-sulfate uptake, demonstrating that the non-glycosylated OST&#x003b1; was still capable of associating with OST&#x003b2; to form a functional transporter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In contrast, previous work has suggested that N-glycosylation of Oatps is essential to their functioning[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The lack of difference in uptake after tunicamycin treatment suggests that little, if any, of the <sup>3</sup>H-estrone 3-sulfate transport was through OATPs.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Tunicamycin prevents glycosylation of OST&#x003b1; but does not affect its plasma membrane localization or its transport function.</bold> Tunicamycin (1 &#x003bc;g/ml) was added to HepG2 cells 5 hrs after the addition of 50 &#x003bc;M CDCA and incubation continued for a total of 15 hrs. Cells were then extracted with RIPA buffer for PAGE and Western blotting, fixed for immunofluorescence, or subjected to the transport assay as described in Methods. (A) Western blot analysis of cell lysates indicates that the molecular weight of the OST&#x003b1; subunit was reduced from ~36 kD to ~28&#x02013;30 kD (see arrows), indicating that this subunit is glycosylated.

When OST&#x003b1;-FLAG alone was transfected, immunofluorescence revealed only an intracellular signal and never detected protein on the plasma membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

These data are similar to that reported for mouse ileum and for HEK293 cells transfected with mouse Ost&#x003b1; and Ost&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and suggest that this band represents a mature, complex glycosylated form of the OST&#x003b1; subunit. Indeed, when N-glycosylation was inhibited with tunicamycin (0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml, 24 hrs) this 40 kD band disappeared (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In addition, the 35 kD band also disappeared, suggesting that this band represents the core glycosylated or precursor form found in the ER. The 31 kD band was not eliminated by tunicamycin treatment indicating that it is the non-glycosylated OST&#x003b1; subunit. In contrast to HepG2 cells, tunicamycin treatment of COS7 cells appeared to reduce the expression of a higher molecular weight band of the OST&#x003b2; subunit (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), although this was not a consistent finding.

These two enzymes can distinguish between N-glycans that only contain the core oligosaccharide that has been added in the ER (Endo H sensitive) and those that have trafficked through the Golgi and have had their carbohydrate chains modified (PNGase F sensitive, Endo H resistant) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> shows that the 40 kD band was sensitive to PNGase F, but not Endo H, treatment, indicating that the mature alpha subunit has exited the Golgi. The 35 kD band was sensitive to both Endo H and PNGase F and, thus, represents a glycoprotein that has not trafficked through the Golgi. The 31 kD band remains after both glycosidase treatments, confirming that it represents the non-glycosylated OST&#x003b1; subunit. These data demonstrate that human OST&#x003b2; is required for human OST&#x003b1; to be processed from the high mannose type N-linked glycan in the ER to complex oligosaccharides in the cis/medial Golgi region. Immunofluorescence of tunicamycin treated COS7 cells transfected with OST&#x003b1;FLAG and OST&#x003b2;-Myc showed that the lack of glycosylation did not prevent OST&#x003b1; trafficking to the plasma membrane, confirming data seen in HepG2 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Thus, the interaction of the beta subunit with the alpha subunit in the ER and the subsequent trafficking through the Golgi does not require that OST&#x003b1; be glycosylated.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation demonstrates that immature forms of OST&#x003b1; and OST&#x003b2; associate</title><p>In order to gain further insight into the interaction of the two subunits, immunoprecipitation was conducted using antibodies to the tags associated with both the alpha and beta subunits. In COS7 cells, when OST&#x003b1;FLAG was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG agarose beads, the precipitate also contained OST&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Although all the OST&#x003b1; was efficiently precipitated, only a fraction of the OST&#x003b2; was found in the precipitate. When OST&#x003b2; was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, only the two lower molecular weight forms of OST&#x003b1; were found in the precipitate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Despite repeated attempts using more protein and over-exposure of the blots (data not shown) the mature, complex glycosylated form of OST&#x003b1; was never seen. Metabolic labeling of transfected COS7 cells demonstrated that the 40 kD form of OST&#x003b1; appeared only after co-transfection of the alpha and beta subunits and after a time lag of &#x0003e; 15 min (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>; earlier time points not shown). Furthermore, anti-FLAG precipitated all forms of OST&#x003b1; as well as OST&#x003b2;, but anti-Myc co-precipitated only OST&#x003b2; and the immature forms of OST&#x003b1; (31 and 35 kD bands), confirming the previous data. This suggested that the physical association of the two subunits may be necessary for the transporter to be processed and trafficked through the intracellular compartments, but possibly not necessary once OST&#x003b1; reaches the plasma membrane.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the intracellular, immature OST&#x003b1; and OST&#x003b2; are physically associated.</bold> (A) Lysates from COS7 cells transfected with OST&#x003b1;-FLAG and OST&#x003b2;-Myc for 48 hrs were subjected to immunoprecipitation using mouse anti-FLAG agarose beads (left two panels) or rabbit anti-Myc and proteinA/G beads (right two panels). Following PAGE and transfer to PVDF membrane the blots were probed with rabbit antibodies to OST&#x003b1; (top left panel) and OST&#x003b2; (bottom left panel) or mouse antibodies to FLAG (top right panel) and His (bottom right panel), respectively. As noted in the Methods, OST&#x003b2;-Myc also contains a His tag. Anti-FLAG agarose efficiently removes all OST&#x003b1;-FLAG from the lysate (Lys), however, it only co-precipitates a portion of OST&#x003b2;(left two panels). Although anti-Myc was rather inefficient in removal of OST&#x003b2;-Myc from the lysate, it was capable of co-precipitating the immature forms of OST&#x003b1;(right two panels).

Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were pulsed for 15 min with <sup>35</sup>S-Trans label. Cells were either lysed immediately (0 chase) or chased for 2 hrs (120 chase). Immunoprecipitation was carried out using mouse anti-FLAG agarose beads (left panel) or rabbit anti-Myc and proteinA/G beads (right panel). The left panel shows that the higher molecular weight band (glycosylated form of OST&#x003b1;) is only present in cells transfected with both subunits, and only after the 2 hr chase (arrowhead). A time course indicated that it was detectable after 30 min of chase (data not shown). The ~20 kD OST&#x003b2; subunit is co-precipitated from these cells (+).

Although it is clear that function of this facilitated transporter requires expression of both subunits, it is not known whether functional activity depends upon (1) the acquisition of N-glycosylation of the alpha subunit, (2) the beta subunit for its ability to release the alpha subunit from an ER retention signal, or (3) the physical interaction of the two proteins at the plasma membrane. The data provided here indicate that glycosylation of OST&#x003b1; is not necessary for transporter localization or function. Furthermore, it shows that the physical interaction of the two subunits may be transient, suggesting that association at the plasma membrane may not be necessary for transporter function.</p><p>Glycosylation of a protein is one of the major biosynthetic functions of the ER and is a common post-translational modification of membrane proteins. Although the addition of the "core" oligosaccharide occurs in the ER, further extensive processing or trimming occurs in the Golgi and results in what is commonly referred to as the complex or mature glycoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. N-glycosylation is found usually in the sequences Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr, where X is any amino acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Although this consensus motif is found in the N-terminus of the alpha subunit in the mouse, rat and skate, it is not present in the human OST&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Instead, the sole asparagine residue in an extracellular site is in the sequence Asn<sup>25</sup>-X-Gly in the N-terminus. We have shown in this study that, despite the lack of traditional consensus sequence, human OST&#x003b1; is expressed on the cell surface as a glycoprotein. Similar to previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] our data indicate that endogenous alpha subunit migrates in SDS-PAGE as a single band and precursor forms are not detected. This suggests that in the presence of the beta subunit the glycoprotein is efficiently trafficked through the Golgi. It is only in the over-expressing transfected cells that the multiple forms of the alpha subunit are seen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> this manuscript; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The necessity for glycosylation of proteins has been studied for many years and is largely believed to be important in proper folding and stabilization of newly synthesized proteins and in affecting the charge and solubility of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The critical nature of this folding is highlighted by the finding that detection of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER can result in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our data indicate that the lack of oligosaccharide chain on the alpha subunit does not designate the polypeptide for ERAD. Instead, after tunicamycin inhibition of glycosylation, the transporter was still trafficked properly to the plasma membrane where it was fully functional, indicating that interaction between the alpha and beta subunits is not compromised by the lack of oligosaccharide. Perhaps because the alpha subunit of the organic solute transporter has only one asparagine residue in an extracellular domain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], the affect of the absence of the carbohydrate on folding is not critical. Tunicamycin treatment has been used to study glycosylation of other hepatocyte proteins. The absence of oligosaccharide did not affect the secretion of transferrin or very low density lipoprotein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], but did interfere with the ability of the apical membrane protein, Mrp2, to be trafficked to the plasma membrane in rat hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. And recently the N-linked carbohydrates have been described for the hepatocyte basolateral membrane protein oatp1a1 and found to be important in the protein's localization and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In HepG2 cells it has been reported that five of eight glycoproteins studied did not require glycosylation for their trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Mochizuki et al have shown that rat Bsep requires at least two of its four N-linked glycans for proper protein stability, intracellular trafficking and functional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, we (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] have shown that the absence of one of the subunits leads to degradation of the other subunit. Thus, it is the presence and interaction of the two subunits that are critical to the stability of the heteromeric, intact transporter, and not the glycosylation of the alpha subunit. Protein-protein interactions in the ER are known to be critical for many different processes, including trafficking and function of multimeric membrane proteins. The presence of fully functional oligomeric complexes at the plasma membrane can involve specific ER retention/retrieval motifs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], anterograde ER export signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], interaction with scaffold protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and phosphoylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The necessity for interaction between OST&#x003b1; and OST&#x003b2; subunits in the ER suggests that physical association of the two proteins may mask a retention/retrieval motif or, alternatively, may reveal a forward trafficking motif. The RXR motif is one such retention/retrieval sequence and it is interesting that both the alpha and beta subunits contain an RXR-like motif in their C-terminal sequence. It remains to be determined whether this sequence is important in the localization of the organic solute transporter.</p><p>Our immunoprecipitation data confirm that the OST&#x003b1; and OST&#x003b2; interaction is essential early in the biosynthetic process, but suggest that it may not be necessary later once the major protein gets to the plasma membrane. Because the only way to get OST&#x003b1; to the plasma membrane is to co-express the beta subunit, it is impossible to determine if the alpha subunit actually requires the beta subunit for its functional activity. However, the lack of co-precipitation between the mature form of OST&#x003b1; and the OST&#x003b2; subunit suggests that this may not be the case. When Li and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] performed similar immunoprecipitations in HEK293 cells transfected with mouse Ost&#x003b1; and Ost&#x003b2; constructs, they also saw only a single band after precipitation with anti-Myc. However, they indicate that it is the mature form of the protein. Given that all data point to the interaction of the subunits in the ER, one would also expect to see the immature form precipitated. Similarly, in mouse ileum Li et al show only one band for Ost&#x003b1; on Western blots and this protein is co-precipitated by an antibody to Ost&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Although the explanation for these differences in immunoprecipitation is still unclear, we cannot discount that it is due to species variability or species-specific antibody affinity.</p><p>The possible transient nature of the subunit interaction also appears to be in conflict with immunofluorescent studies which suggest co-localization of the subunits at the plasma membrane in transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, the finding of a yellow color indicating co-localization may be due to the close proximity of the two subunits, not the actual association. Optical microscopes are unable to resolve two items that are closer together than 200 nm. Also, we cannot discount the possibility that, similar to tunicamycin treated cells, some "immature" protein might be expressed on the plasma membrane, and, thus, be detected by the primary antibodies. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation has also been used to study the interaction of the two subunits in HEK293 cells transfected with mouse Ost&#x003b1; and Ost&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These studies clearly show that complementation occurs between Ost&#x003b1; and Ost&#x003b2; and results in plasma membrane localization. However, the possibility that the interaction might be transient cannot be assessed because, once the complementation reaction occurs, it is irreversible.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that, although human OST&#x003b1; is a glycoprotein, the carbohydrate chains are not necessary for interaction with OST&#x003b2; or subsequent exit from the ER. Furthermore, plasma membrane localization and functional activity of the organic solute transporter does not depend upon N-glycosylation. Interaction between the two subunits occurs early in the biosynthetic pathway, but may not be necessary at the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CDCA: chenodeoxycholate; Endo H: endoglycosidase H; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; FXR: farnesoid &#x000d7; receptor; OST/Ost: organic solute transporter; PNGase F: peptide:N-glycosidase F</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CJS designed and carried out all experiments, except Q-PCR, and was responsible for the writing of the manuscript.
