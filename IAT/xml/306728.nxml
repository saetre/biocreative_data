The plasmids used in this study involved pTA1015, pTA1020, pTA1030, pTA1040, pTA1050 and pTA1060. The SSO of pTA1015 was isolated by shotgun cloning in a specially designed vector, pWM100, which has no SSO of its own. Sequence analysis revealed that the SSO of pTA1015 is almost identical to formerly described palT type SSOs. Also pTA1020 and pTA1060 were shown to contain SSOs highly homologous to palT. Using Southern hybridization with the palT of pTA1015 as a probe, the SSO of pTA1040 was cloned. Sequence analysis revealed a region of 200 bp which is 77% identical to the palT of pTA1015. The plasmids pTA1030 and pTA1050 contain an SSO which is highly homologous to the SSO of pTA1040. The majority of the SSOs of rolling-circle plasmids from B.subtilis seem to belong to two related families which we denote as palT1 (present on pTA1015, pTA1020 and pTA1060) and palT2 (present on pTA1030, pTA1040 and pTA1050). Both families of SSOs are highly efficient single-strand-conversion signals in B.subtilis.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00004-0082-a" xlink:role="614"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00004-0083-a" xlink:role="615"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00004-0084-a" xlink:role="616"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00004-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="612"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00004-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="613"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00004-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="614"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00004-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="615"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00004-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="616"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00004-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="617"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00004-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="618"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00004-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="619"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
