It is a ribonucleoprotein that utilizes a short sequence within its RNA subunit as the template for reverse transcription, synthesizing d(TG)-rich repeats, which in vertebrates comprises the hexanucleotide d(TTAGGG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c1">1</xref>). In human tissues, telomerase activity can be detected in germ and stem cells, but not in most somatic or differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c2">2</xref>). The absence of telomerase activity leads to telomere erosion due to the inability of the conventional replication machinery to duplicate the ends of linear chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c3">3</xref>). Cells cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> may undergo senescence when their telomeres shorten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c4">4</xref>). The expression of various viral oncoproteins in cells allows them to bypass this state of growth arrest and re-enter the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c5">5</xref>). However, at some critical point, continued cellular proliferation in the absence of telomerase activity results in chromosomal instability&#x02014;a phenomenon known as cell crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c7">7</xref>). Although crisis normally refers to cells grown in culture, data from telomerase RNA gene knockouts in mice strongly suggest that analogous events may also occur <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c9">9</xref>). During crisis, most cells in a population undergo apoptotic death. In rare instances cells can emerge from crisis, which is nearly always concomitant with the re-acquisition of telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c10">10</xref>). Cells expressing telomerase have the potential to be immortal, which in fibroblasts, retinal pigment epithelial cells and endothelial cells also appears to be sufficient for proliferative immortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c13">13</xref>). Moreover, telomerase expression is one of several key events required for the malignant transformation of cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c14">14</xref>), which serves to explain the earlier correlation linking telomerase activity with the vast majority of malignant tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c15">15</xref>). This, as well as the finding that over-expression of a dominant negative form of the enzyme could drive tumor cell lines into crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c16">16</xref>), provided the rationale for selecting telomerase as an attractive target for anticancer therapy.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic>, telomerase catalyzes the addition of d(TTAGGG) repeats onto a single-stranded DNA substrate. Two telomerase components are necessary and sufficient for activity <italic>in vitro</italic>: an RNA, part of which serves as the template for the synthesis of hexanucleotide repeats, and a protein that comprises the catalytic subunit. Vertebrate telomerase RNAs are similar in length and recently a secondary structure has been proposed based on phylogenetic comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c17">17</xref>). Several conserved domains emerged from this comparison. In the 5&#x02032;-half of the RNA, a putative pseudoknot structure was identified in addition to the template region. Three conserved domains could be also found in the 3&#x02032;-half of the molecule. One of these, the box H&#x0002f;ACA domain, was recognized previously in human telomerase RNA (hTR) and found to be essential for RNA processing and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c18">18</xref>). The core H&#x0002f;ACA SnoRNA proteins have been shown to interact with hTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c21">21</xref>) and are probably part of the telomerase holoenzyme.</p><p>The telomerase protein components (TERTs) that have been identified in yeast, ciliates and mammals are similar in size (&#x0223c;100&#x02013;130 kDa), but their region of sequence homology is limited to a small portion of the gene product. While there is a small stretch of amino acids that represents a unique motif among the TERTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c22">22</xref>), the majority of the homology is shared with other reverse transcriptases (RTs). These RT motifs are critical structural elements, as single amino acid substitutions have been shown to abolish telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c26">26</xref>). This information has limited utility, though, in aiding the design of inhibitors for the catalytic subunit. Apart from nucleoside analogs, in the absence of additional structural information, it is difficult to consider a rational approach for choosing inhibitors of the active site of telomerase. The RNA component, on the other hand, appears more amenable to such a rational approach and may be an ideal candidate for an oligonucleotide-based approach to inhibition. Indeed, there have been several reports describing oligonucleotides complementary to the template region as potent inhibitors of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c30">30</xref>).</p><p>We have designed modified oligonucleotides complementary to the template region of hTR, and have found these compounds to inhibit telomerase with high potency <italic>in vitro</italic> (IC<sub>50</sub> values of &#x0223c;1 nM; R.Pruzan and S.Gryaznov, unpublished data). These are N3&#x02032;&#x02192;P5&#x02032; phosphoramidate (NP) oligonucleotides, where a 3&#x02032;-amino group is substituted for the 3&#x02032;-oxygen in the 2&#x02032;-deoxyribose ring. These compounds have been shown to form very stable duplexes with single-stranded RNA, are resistant to nuclease degradation and display high specificity for RNA and DNA targets, with a relatively low affinity for proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c31">31</xref>). While NP oligonucleotides targeted against the template region of hTR are potent telomerase inhibitors, we were interested in finding additional regions of the RNA that might be sensitive to inhibition by NP oligonucleotides. We have identified a segment of hTR nearly 100 nt downstream from the template region that is susceptible to inhibition by NP oligonucleotides complementary to this region. Upon binding of an NP oligonucleotide to that region, we have found a marked decrease in affinity of single-stranded DNA primer for the enzyme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Telomerase extracts and activity assay</title><p>Telomerase was prepared from 293 suspension cells that over-expressed the hTERT gene, using a myeloproliferative sarcoma virus promoter (MPSV).

While six of the nucleotides serve as a template for reverse transcription, others may be involved in the enzyme&#x02019;s substrate recognition or stabilization of its complex with telomeres. Several types of oligonucleotides complementary to this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c30">30</xref>) have already been described as potent telomerase inhibitors in biochemical assays and <italic>in vitro</italic> cell assays. We were interested in finding additional regions of hTR that might be susceptible to oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition. We initially targeted a region of hTR (nucleotides 137&#x02013;179) that we believed contained a single-stranded RNA region, and which also appeared essential for telomerase activity (R.Pruzan and J.Kealey, unpublished observations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c36">36</xref>).</p><p>In order to assess the effects of various oligonucleotide inhibitors, we converted the conventional gel-based telomerase assay to one that followed the incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotide triphosphates into DNA, monitored as acid insoluble material. This assay allowed us to measure enzymatic activity directly, and to quantify the results in a simple manner (Materials and Methods). Performing this assay with highly purified telomerase extract allowed us to obtain a signal-to-background ratio of greater than 20:1.</p><p>Inhibition of telomerase activity was determined following incubation of the enzyme with varying concentrations of NP oligonucleotides prior to the addition of DNA primer and deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). The enzymatic activity was measured and expressed as femtomoles of nucleotides added to primer. The addition of nucleotides to primer was linear over the period of time used and can thus be considered a rate. Nucleotide addition rates were plotted as a function of the inhibitor&#x02013;NP oligonucleotide concentration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f1">1</xref>). These graphs in turn were used to derive the IC<sub>50</sub> values (as described in the legend to Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f1">1</xref>), which are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref>.</p><sec><title>Inhibition of telomerase activity by non-template addressed oligonucleotide NPs</title><p>Several NP oligonucleotides were synthesized that were complementary to the hTR region mentioned above (nucleotides 137&#x02013;179; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref>). One of these, GRN137155, complementary to nucleotides 160&#x02013;179, was found to inhibit telomerase activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of &#x0223c;2 nM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f1">1</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref>). A second oligonucleotide, GRN137158, complementary to nucleotides 137&#x02013;166 and overlapping with the 3&#x02032;-end of GRN137155 had an IC<sub>50</sub> value of &#x0223c;0.5 nM (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref>). We focused our attention on the latter oligonucleotide because a shortened version of it retained potency, whereas attempts to shorten GRN137155 without loss of activity were unsuccessful (data not shown). We found that the 3&#x02032;-half of GRN137158 (compound GRN137159) was as active as the parental 30-nt molecule (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f1">1</xref>B; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref>).</p><p>In order to further define the active region, we synthesized several additional NP oligonucleotides. An 11mer NP oligonucleotide (GRN137212, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref>) was nearly as active as the 15mer (GRN137159, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref>). While removal of 4 nt from the 3&#x02032;-end of GRN137159 had little effect on its potency, elimination of 4 nt from the 5&#x02032;-end completely abolished the oligonucleotide&#x02019;s activity (GRN137166, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref>). Both of these 11mers were able to form duplexes with similar stabilities when mixed with a segment of telomerase RNA from this region (nucleotides 137&#x02013;166) (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of &#x0003e;70&#x000b0;C in phosphate-buffered saline, data not shown). Shortening GRN137159 by even 2 nt from the 5&#x02032;-end resulted in a &#x0003e;10-fold reduction in the compound&#x02019;s activity (GRN137165, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref>). Nucleotides complementary to 148&#x02013;151 on hTR therefore appear critical for activity of these oligonucleotides. Additional nucleotides at the 5&#x02032;-end of the oligonucleotide, complementary to nucleotides 152&#x02013;153 of hTR, do not increase the potency of the compound (GRN137223, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the 5&#x02032;-end of GRN137159, where removal of 4 nt results in complete inactivation of the compound, deletions of 5 nt from the 3&#x02032;-end of GRN137159 are well tolerated (GRN137249, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref>). Any further shortening from the 3&#x02032;-end of GRN137249, however, affected the potency of the compounds. Eliminating 1 additional nt at the 3&#x02032;-end (GRN137251, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref>) or 2 additional nt from the 3&#x02032;-end (GRN137255, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref>) resulted in only a partial inhibition (50 and 20&#x00025;, respectively) of activity (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref> and data not shown). This may be explained by partial inhibition of all the enzyme molecules, or the existence of two discrete enzyme populations&#x02014;one sensitive and the other refractory to the inhibition by the oligonucleotides. Our observations are consistent with the first possibility, as partial inhibition with compound GRN137251 was by &#x0223c;50&#x00025;, whereas inhibition with GRN137255 was only by &#x0223c;20&#x00025;. Furthermore, this partial inhibition revealed an inelastic response to inhibitor concentrations over a 100-fold range of concentrations (data not shown), suggesting that hTR binding with the NP compounds can occur, but the resultant complexes retain activity. Taken together, the experimental data indicate the presence of 10 nt complementary to positions 142&#x02013;151 on hTR are necessary to render the NP oligonucleotide an effective telomerase inhibitor. As a result of the high stability of an RNA&#x02013;NP duplex, even an 11-nt long NP oligonucleotide is quite a potent telomerase inhibitor when targeted to a functionally important and accessible hTR region (GRN137212, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref>). The dramatic decrease in potency observed with deletions from the 5&#x02032;-end of GRN137159 suggest that activity is lost due to the inability of that NP oligonucleotide to bind to telomerase. The partial loss of activity resulting from 3&#x02032;-end deletions may suggest the compound&#x02019;s inability to perturb a structure necessary for enzymatic activity.</p></sec><sec><title>A mutant hTR, having a substitution within the critical region, is refractory to inhibition by GRN137159</title><p>Identification of the minimal effective NP oligonucleotide sufficient for inhibition of telomerase activity indicated the indispensability of 4 nt 5&#x02032;-(GTGG) at the 5&#x02032;-end of NP GRN137159, which may form potential base pairs with nucleotides 148&#x02013;151 of hTR (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref> and see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f6">6</xref>). The removal of these nucleotides resulted in a &#x0003e;250-fold reduction in potency as was seen with GRN137166 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref>). In order to unequivocally demonstrate that the 5&#x02032;-end of GRN137159 potentiates the compound&#x02019;s activity because of its ability to form a duplex with complementary sequences of hTR, we tested the ability of GRN137159 to inhibit a mutant telomerase enzyme that had an altered hTR sequence at positions 149&#x02013;152. This mutant hTR would not allow the formation of 3 bp with the 3 5&#x02032;-terminal nt of GRN137159, which were already shown to be critical for activity. If inhibition of telomerase by the NP oligonuceotide were a consequence of duplex formation with hTR, then the absence of activity with GRN137166 would predict that the mutant enzyme should also be refractory to inhibition by GRN137159.</p><p>A system was designed that facilitated the overproduction of telomerase comprising mutant hTR (nucleotides 149&#x02013;152 were changed from 5&#x02032;-CACC to 5&#x02032;-ACTA), or wild-type hTR, along with hTERT. Two plasmids containing SV40 origins of replication were used to transfect COS-7 cells, one expressing hTERT and the other expressing hTR. The COS-7 cells, which express SV40 large T antigen, allow the plasmids to replicate to a high copy number. The cells were harvested following transfection with the plasmids, and telomerase-containing extracts were prepared. The extracts were purified (see Materials and Methods) and assayed for the presence or absence of telomerase activity. It is important to note that the enzymatic activity in this system was completely dependent upon transfection with both the hTR and the hTERT bearing plasmids (data not shown). The hTR 5&#x02032;-CACC to 5&#x02032;-ACTA mutation of nucleotides 149&#x02013;152 appeared to have a minimal effect on telomerase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f2">2</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2 with 5 and 6).</p><p>Two different concentrations of extract were used to measure telomerase activity in order to demonstrate the linearity of the assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f2">2</xref>, lanes 1 and 2, and 5 and 6). Addition of 100 nM of the oligonucleotide (GRN137159) to the assay mixture abolished the activity of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f2">2</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 3), whereas telomerase comprising the mutant hTR was refractory to this treatment, and only a modest effect can be observed at 1 &#x000b5;M (compare lanes 6&#x02013;8). The latter concentration is 1000-fold above the IC<sub>50</sub> that we have determined for this NP oligonucleotide (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb1">1</xref>). The data support the notion described above, that the 5&#x02032;-end of GRN137159 is critical for its inhibitory effect on telomerase, and its role may be to facilitate the binding of the oligonucleotide to telomerase.</p><p>Although unlikely, there remained the formal possibility that the difference in potency between GRN137159 and GRN137166 was not a manifestation of their ability to bind to telomerase. In order to eliminate this possibility, we carried out an experiment to directly examine the potential of these labeled NP oligonucleotides to bind telomerase. Affinity purified telomerase was incubated with either <sup>32</sup>P end-labeled GRN137159 or GRN137166. Following incubation the samples were analyzed by native gel electrophoresis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f3">3</xref>). In the sample that contained labeled GRN137159, a complex can be visualized that migrates in the region of the gel where active telomerase is found (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f3">3</xref>, lanes 1 and 3). This is in sharp contrast to the absence of a visible complex when labeled GRN137166 is used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f3">3</xref>, lane 2). The position of telomerase on this native gel was determined by the auto-labeling of a pre-bound telomeric primer, having a 3&#x02032;-terminal sequence of d(AGG), following the addition of &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dGTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f3">3</xref>, lane 3). When the GRN137159-labeled complex is treated with proteinase K, the complex is converted into a discrete band that migrates in the position of hTR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f3">3</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;8). Once again nothing can be seen in the GRN137166 sample treated with proteinase K.</p><p>This demonstrates that labeled GRN137159 binds to telomerase and that binding occurs via a stable interaction with hTR. The tight interaction of telomerase with primer, in comparison, is destroyed by proteinase K treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f3">3</xref>, lanes 4 and 5), which indicates that the primer&#x02013;enzyme complex is primarily stabilized by contacts with the protein.</p><p>The auto-labeled telomerase complex reveals the presence of four distinct telomerase-specific bands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f3">3</xref>, lane 3). It is unclear if they represent telomerase complexes differing in protein content, conformation or multimers of the enzyme. A similar pattern, however, is observed following blotting and probing with an anti-sense hTR (R.Pruzan, unpublished data). Interestingly, only two bands are illuminated following incubation with labeled GRN137159, which may indicate that the compound is able to partially disrupt the complex. We also tested the ability of the labeled oligonucleotides to bind <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized hTR. GRN137166 is also severely limited in its ability to bind hTR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f3">3</xref>, lanes 7 and 8), which would suggest that the intrinsic structure of the RNA is the determining factor in binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Mixed mode of inhibition with non-template addressed NP oligonucleotide</title><p>In an effort to uncover the mode of action of GRN137159, we measured the inhibition of telomerase activity by this oligonucleotide as a function of the DNA primer concentration. If the compound acts as a competitive inhibitor with the DNA primer substrate of telomerase, then its inhibitory effect should be overcome by higher primer concentrations. This inhibitory mechanism would result in a higher <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value for the primer while the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of the enzyme would not be affected. If, on the other hand, inhibition was non-competitive with respect to the primer concentration, then the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values should not change and only the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> should be lower.</p><p>Telomerase activity was measured at primer concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 250 nM. The primer titration was done without the inhibitor oligonucleotide and in the presence of 1 or 2&#x000a0;nM of GRN137159. The resulting data were used to generate double-reciprocal plots: 1&#x0002f;rate of nucleotide addition as a function of 1&#x0002f;concentration of primer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f4">4</xref>). The <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> at each concentration of the inhibitor were derived from the <italic>y</italic> and <italic>x</italic> intercepts, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb2">2</xref>). Both the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> are affected by GRN137159 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf135tb2">2</xref>). This indicates a mixed mode of telomerase inhibition, which might be the result of the inhibitor directly affecting both the catalytic rate of the enzyme and its interaction with primer, or solely affecting the latter. A decreased enzyme affinity for the primer would result in a less processive enzyme and, thus, appear as an overall lower rate of nucleotide addition, if one assumes that processive elongation occurs faster than substrate turnover.</p></sec><sec><title>A more rapid dissociation rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>) is observed for a primer in the presence of GRN137159</title><p>One possible explanation for the observed higher <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value for the primer in the presence of GRN137159 would be a reduction of affinity for that primer by telomerase in the presence of the NP oligonucleotide. The estimation of stability of the enzyme&#x02013;primer complex can be derived from either a determination of dissociation equilibrium constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>), or alternatively through measuring the dissociation rate of the primer from the enzyme (<italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>). Experimentally, the latter approach was the more tractable one. Dissociation rates were determined by a gel-based electrophoresis method using two primers of different lengths (Materials and Methods). We measured the <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> values in the absence or in presence of the NP oligonucleotide inhibitor (GRN137159). The enzyme was equilibrated with a saturating amount of a short telomeric primer &#x0005b;100 nM d(TTAGGG)<sub>3</sub>&#x0005d;. This incubation was followed by challenge with vast molar excess of a longer primer &#x0005b;20 &#x000b5;M d(TTAGGG)<sub>4</sub>&#x0005d;. At various times following the addition of the longer primer, aliquots were taken from the reaction mixture and pulse labeled (5 min) with dTTP and &#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled dATP. Only the primer associated with the enzyme will be labeled by dTTP and radioactive dATP using this experimental design. A labeled product of either a 21mer or a 27mer oligonucleotide product should result. The disappearance of the 21-nt oligonucleotide product and the concomitant appearance of the 27mer with passage of time were monitored by a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The obtained comparison of the dissociation rates of the primer from telomerase with or without the addition of the inhibitory NP oligonucleotide is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f5">5</xref>. The bands corresponding to the two possible products seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f5">5</xref>A were quantified and presented graphically in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f5">5</xref>B. The half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>1&#x0002f;2</sub>) of an 18-nt long telomeric primer d(TTAGGG)<sub>3</sub> is &#x0223c;300 min at 30&#x000b0;C, whereas it is reduced to &#x0223c;35 min in the presence of the NP oligonucleotide (GRN137159). Moreover, we observed formation of a more labile complex between the enzyme and primer irrespective of whether GRN137159 was added prior or subsequent to the addition of primer to the reaction mixture (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have identified a segment of hTR, &#x0223c;100 nt downstream of the hTR template region, whose structural integrity is crucial for telomerase enzymatic activity. An NP oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 137&#x02013;151 of hTR inhibits the enzyme at sub-nanomolar concentrations. Elimination of 4 nt at the 5&#x02032;-end of this compound, complementary to nucleotides 148&#x02013;151 of hTR, render it inactive. Conversely, with modified telomerase, where 3 of the 4 nt of hTR were mutated to prevent formation of proper Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs with the 5&#x02032;-end of GRN137159, this NP oligonucleotide has a dramatic reduction in its inhibitory activity. Furthermore, we have shown directly that GRN137159 can bind to telomerase, while GRN137166, which is shortened by 4 nt at the 5&#x02032;-end, has a limited ability to bind to telomerase.</p><p>Taken together, our results are consistent with a proposed mechanism whereby GRN137159 inhibits telomerase activity via binding to hTR and by doing so disrupts its functionally important secondary structure. The inability of a 5&#x02032;-shortened oligonucleotide GRN137166 to inhibit telomerase, as well as the observation that an enzyme containing the mutated hTR sequence (at nucleotides 148&#x02013;151) becomes refractory to inhibition by GRN137159, suggest that these 4 nt may be part of a single-stranded RNA region. This region may serve as an &#x02018;entry point&#x02019; for the oligonucleotide GRN137159 facilitating its hybridization with hTR. This conclusion is supported by the direct binding data, which demonstrate that indeed the 4 nt complementary to 148&#x02013;151 in hTR facilitates that binding to telomerase. The obtained data also suggest that GRN137159 probably disrupts the active hTR structure by forming a more stable heteroduplex with the RNA segment. It was reported earlier that NP oligonucleotide duplexes with RNA are up to &#x0223c;3&#x000b0;C more stable (per base pair) than for those with the corresponding native phosphodiester oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c31">31</xref>). Indeed, a phosphodiester oligonucleotide, isosequential to GRN137159, does not inhibit telomerase activity (data not shown).</p><p>Recently, a secondary structure for hTR has been proposed, which is based on phylogenetic conservation among other vertebrate telomerase RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c17">17</xref>). This structure suggests that hTR nucleotides 136&#x02013;144 are involved in an intramolecular duplex with nucleotides 65&#x02013;72 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f6">6</xref>). This proposed secondary structure of hTR is consistent with the suggestion that hTR nucleotides 148&#x02013;151 may provide a single-stranded &#x02018;entry point&#x02019; for the hybridization of NP oligonucleotide (GRN137159) to telomerase. Given the stability of a NP&#x02013;RNA duplex, it is reasonable to propose that this partial NP&#x02013;RNA duplex can proceed further and invade the RNA helix just beyond the template region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f6">6</xref>, nucleotides 65&#x02013;72 paired with 136&#x02013;144, or P2a.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c17">17</xref>).</p><p>One of the conserved features that emerged from the previously mentioned phylogenetic comparison of mammalian telomerase RNAs was a pseudoknot structure, which in hTR would predict base pairing between nucleotides 107&#x02013;115 with nucleotides 174&#x02013;183 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf135c17">17</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf135f6">6</xref>). While we did not pursue further experiments with GRN137155, it is interesting to note that this oligonucleotide overlaps extensively with this proposed structure and it is reasonable to hypothesize that GRN137155 may inhibit telomerase by its ability to disrupt this putative structure. This compound may prove to be a useful reagent for further studies involving this region of hTR.</p><p>While binding of the NP oligonucleotide (GRN137159) to its complementary hTR sequence appears to be crucial for its inhibitory effect, the interesting question arises as to this oligonucleotide&#x02019;s mechanism of action. We observed a mixed mode of telomerase inhibition by GRN137159, both competitive and non-competitive with a DNA primer. We measured telomerase enzymatic activity as a rate of nucleotides incorporated into DNA, where this number represents the activity of an aggregate enzyme population. A lower <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> could represent a reduced rate of nucleotide addition or possibly a lower percentage of active enzymes in the total population. Thus, the allosteric effect of GRN137159 binding to hTR, which is manifested in a reduced telomerase affinity for the primer, may either result in less efficient catalysis or, for example, in a less stable telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex. Presently we are unable to distinguish between these alternatives. The inhibition can be explained in part by the determined reduction (nearly 10-fold) in affinity of the telomere sequence based primer d(TTAGGG)<sub>3</sub> for the enzyme. Reduced affinity for the primer was observed irrespective of the order of the inhibitors addition to the reaction mixtures. It is yet unclear how perturbation of the structure of hTR distal to the template region might affect primer binding, which must await further elucidation of the hTR structure.</p><p>Further work will elucidate the extent to which GRN137159 acts as an effective inhibitor in cells. In a preliminary experiment we have not observed inhibition in ACHN cells by GRN137159. However an NP oligonucleotide directed to the template region of hTR inhibited enzyme activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.3 &#x000b5;M under similar experimental conditions (data not shown; 37). Lack of telomerase inhibition in cells by GRN137159 may either reflect the inaccessibility of the targeted hTR sequence in cells, or may reflect the differences in affinity to the natural substrate in cells versus a synthetic primer used in the purified system. The exact structure of DNA&#x02013;protein complex substrate for telomerase, as well as potential important telomerase accessory factors in cells are still unknown.</p><p>We have, however, discovered an allosteric oligonucleotide-based reagent that apparently perturbs the secondary structure of the telomerase, resulting in the enzyme inhibition in a cell-free system. Further study will be required to define the relationship between the targeted region of hTR and the catalytic and template sites of telomerase.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf135f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Dose&#x02013;response inhibition of telomerase by phosphoramidate oligonucleotides directed against a non-template region of hTR.
