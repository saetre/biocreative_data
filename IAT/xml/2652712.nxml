The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Neurogenin2 (Ngn2) and NeuroD1 are key regulators in these processes. Based on existing classification, we analyzed the molecular events occurring during hippocampal neurogenesis, primarily focusing on juvenile animals. We found that Ngn2 is transiently expressed by late type-2a amplifying progenitors. The Ngn2 progenies mature into hippocampal granule neurons. Interestingly, the loss of Ngn2 at early stages of development leads to a robust reduction in neurogenesis, but does not disturb granule neuron maturation <italic>per se</italic>. We found that the role of Ngn2 is to maintain progenitors in an undifferentiated state, allowing them to amplify prior to their maturation into granule neurons upon NeuroD1 induction. When we overexpressed Ngn2 and NeuroD1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we found NeuroD1 to exhibit a more pronounced neuron-inductive effect, leading to granule neuron commitment, than that displayed by Ngn2. Finally, we observed that all markers expressed during the transcriptional control of hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents are also present in the human hippocampus. Taken together, we demonstrate a critical role of for Ngn2 and NeuroD1 in controlling neuronal commitment and hippocampal granule neuroblast formation, both during embryonic development and in post-natal hippocampal granule neurogenesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons are born not only during development of the central nervous system, but neurogenesis also continues into adulthood.

We first establish a hierarchy of transcriptional events that occur during neurogenesis in the DG and then define the place that Ngn2, NeuroD1 and other transcription factors have in this cascade.

We show that Ngn2 is required for granule neuroblasts production/amplification. <italic>Gain-of-function</italic> of NeuroD1 during development of the DG results in an efficient generation of granule neuroblasts, an effect that we do not observe when we overexpress Ngn2.

While Tbr1 expression ceases during granule maturation, that of NeuroD1 is weakly maintained when NeuN expression starts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004779-g001">Figure 1G and 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004779.s001">figure S1G and S1H</xref>).

Thus NeuroD1 is expressed in type-2b and type-3 cells, as well as immature granule neurons. Finally, we found that NeuroD2 starts to be expressed just after NeuroD1 and, unlike NeuroD1, continues to be highly expressed in mature neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004779-g001">Figure 1J</xref> and data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Mash1 and Ngn2 define the early versus late type-2a stage in 2 weeks old mice</title><p>Having established the hierarchy of transcription factors and cellular markers appearing during hippocampal neurogenesis, we set out to clarify the position of the two bHLH transcription factors Ngn2 and Mash1, in this process. We found that more than 90&#x00025; of Ngn2-immunoreactive cells are Pax6 positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004779-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), and almost all co-express Tbr2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004779-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, Ngn2 appears to be expressed by type-2a cells. As our antibodies against Ngn2 and NeuroD1 were made in the same species, we could not determine if there was an overlap between these two proteins. However, by comparing their overlapping expression pattern with that of Tbr2, we propose that some Ngn2&#x0002b; cells co-express NeuroD1, and that they appear at the onset of NeuroD1 expression and downregulation of Ngn2. We base this assumption on the facts that more than 50&#x00025; of the Tbr2&#x0002b; cells are Ngn2&#x0002b; and more than 50&#x00025; of Tbr2&#x0002b; cells also express NeuroD1. The expression of Ngn2 in adult hippocampus was hard to detect using immunohistochemistry due to the low expression of the protein (data not shown).

We found that the transcription factor Pax6 is initially expressed by both radial glia stem cells (type-1) and early amplifying progenitors (type-2a). The next transcription factor to appear in chronology is Mash1. Mash1 expression characterizes the early stage of hippocampal progenitor amplification (early type-2a). The role of Mash1 during hippocampal granule neurogenesis is still unclear. Mash1 null mutant mice do not display any clear malformation of the DG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004779-Galichet1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Based on these observations, we hypothesize that Mash1-expressing cells are not yet committed towards a granule cell fate. They may still have the potential to generate both neurons and oligodendrocytes, as is the case in the SVZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004779-Parras2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In agreement with different developing brain regions, we found that Ngn2 starts to be expressed in Mash1-positive transiently amplifying progenitors, i.e. &#x0201c;late type-2a cells&#x0201d; according to the classification we propose. We observed that Pax6 expression persisted longer than that of Mash1, in Ngn2-expressing cells (late type-2a cells), in juvenile but not adult DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004779-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004779.s001">figure S1</xref>). Later on, Ngn2 is downregulated, whilst Tbr2 expression persists (type-2b cells). The transition from amplifying progenitor to neuroblast is defined by the expression of NeuroD1. Thus, Ngn2 is expressed at the beginning of the transiently amplifying progenitor phase while NeuroD1 marks the end of that period. This applies both to the juvenile and adult rat brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004779-Ozen1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004779-Hodge1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. After NeuroD1 is turned on the progenitors leave the cell cycle, gradually mature, express PSA-NCAM, NeuroD2, Calretinin, Prox1, Tbr1 and, finally, NeuN.

We found the sequential expression of these markers conserved in juvenile (P2 and 2 weeks) and adult rodent brains. Importantly, we observed that the same transcription factors and neuronal markers are also present in the adult human hippocampus and arranged spatially in a manner reminiscent with what we saw in rodents. It is possible, however, that some of these markers are expressed for longer or shorter periods at postnatal and adult stages of hippocampal progenitor maturation.

(A) The overexpression of NeuroD1 results in the generation of hippocampal DG granule neurons. These neurons (NeuroD1/GFP -positive) express the mature neuronal marker NeuN and are very often localized in the external granule layer (first layers generated during the DG development). (B1&#x02013;B6) A few cells transduced with NeuroD1 retrovirus (GFP-positive) have a glial-like shape. These cells still express NeuroD1.
