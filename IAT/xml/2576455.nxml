To understand these interactions for the nutrient copper, we used a chemical genetic screen for zebrafish mutants sensitive to developmental copper deficiency. In this screen, we isolated two mutants that define subtleties of copper metabolism. The first contains a viable hypomorphic allele of <italic>atp7a</italic> and results in a loss of pigmentation when exposed to mild nutritional copper deficiency. This mutant displays incompletely penetrant skeletal defects affected by developmental copper availability. The second carries an inactivating mutation in the vacuolar ATPase that causes punctate melanocytes and embryonic lethality. This mutant, <italic>catastrophe</italic>, is sensitive to copper deprivation revealing overlap between ion metabolic pathways.

Proper uptake, transport, and excretion of copper are critical for use of this metal while reducing its inherent toxicity.

We have used zebrafish, a genetically useful animal model system, to study genetic interactions with copper deficiency during development. We treated mutant embryonic zebrafish with a chelator that reduces the level of available copper and screened for mutants that displayed a copper deficient phenotype only in the presence of the chelator. We identified and characterized two mutants that advance our understanding of copper metabolism during the early periods of development, as well as show an interaction between copper metabolism and another fundamental pathway&#x02014;that of proton transport.

The Dutch Famine Study examined the consequences of nutrient deprivation on developmental outcome during severe food shortages near the end of the Second World War and clearly demonstrated that inadequate nutrient availability during human gestation increases the likelihood of developmental anomalies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000261-Susser1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. From these initial observations arose the well-recognized link between maternal folate supplementation and the suppression of neural tube defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000261-Czeizel1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite overwhelming epidemiologic data indicating the benefits of folate and other nutrient supplementation we do not fully understand the genetics of predisposition to these abnormal developmental phenotypes when faced with suboptimal nutrient levels. There are several large difficulties in the study of these processes in mammals that have prevented faster progress. The first is that the genetics of mammals has been cumbersome. The second, and more important, is that development of placental animals occurs <italic>in utero</italic> making rapid detection of developmental phenotypes difficult. Finally, controlling the level of nutrient available to the developing embryo cannot be done with precision as it depends both on the genetics of the mother and the embryo as well as maternal nutrition.</p><p>Copper is an essential nutrient which when absent results in severe developmental abnormalities. This is most clearly illustrated by Menkes disease (OMIM #309400), a rare X-linked disorder of copper metabolism. Patients with Menkes disease have an array of symptoms including seizures, neurodegeneration, hypopigmentation, and lax skin which result from decreased copper incorporation into critical enzymes such as dopamine-&#x003b2;-hydroxylase and lysyl oxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000261-Menkes1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000261-Menkes2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. This usually fatal disease is caused by mutations in a copper transporter, <italic>ATP7A</italic> (NM_000052), which resides in the secretory pathway and is responsible for transport of copper into this compartment. The Menkes gene product is also responsible for placental copper transport. While patients complete <italic>in utero</italic> development apparently normally, it is clear from biochemical studies at birth that there are significant defects that arise from gestational copper deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000261-Kaler1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In order to study the effects of developmental copper deprivation our lab has previously created a zebrafish model of severe copper deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000261-Mendelsohn1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. High doses of the cell permeable copper chelator neocuproine cause embryonic zebrafish to exhibit a Menkes-like phenotype with neurodegeneration, hypopigmentation, and connective tissue defects. Isolation and cloning of the mutant <italic>calamity</italic>, which shared these same characteristics, revealed a loss-of-function mutation in the zebrafish orthologue of <italic>ATP7A</italic> (NM_001042720). In this current study we expand this model to study the effects of induced genetic alterations on the developmental response to <italic>mild</italic> copper deprivation. We describe two mutants sensitive to nutritional copper deficiency that illustrate the potential power of this approach to overcome the limitations of studying gene-nutrient interactions in vertebrate organisms and that define combinations of loss-of-function mutations of known ion homeostatic pathways that result in aberrant development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Copper Deficiency Screen</title><p>In order to elucidate the molecular genetics of copper metabolism we performed a forward genetic screen for zebrafish mutants with enhanced sensitivity to subthreshold copper deficiency. To control copper levels zebrafish embryos were treated with the cell permeable copper specific chelator neocuproine which has been previously shown to cause a copper-deficient phenotype including loss of pigmentation and notochord defects at a dose of 1 to 10 &#x000b5;M due to loss of cuproenzyme activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000261-Mendelsohn1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000261-Smith1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Prior to screening, a subthreshold dose of 100 nM neocuproine was determined to cause no alteration in pigmentation in wild-type, haploid embryos. We then used this concentration of neocuproine to screen clutches of haploid embryos derived from F1 carriers of ENU-induced mutations. One half of each clutch was placed in 100 nM neocuproine at 3 hours post fertilization (hpf) and allowed to develop until 48 hpf when clutches were screened for loss of melanin pigmentation in 50&#x00025; of the embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000261-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Only those clutches which had loss of pigmentation at 100 nM neocuproine but contained at least some pigmentation when untreated were scored as mutant. In this pilot screen we examined 700 F1 females and found five potential mutants. Seven hundred mutagenized haploid genomes at an estimated single locus mutation rate of 1.1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> represents approximately a 65&#x02013;70&#x00025; coverage of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000261-SolnicaKrezel1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Of the five potential mutants, four were confirmed as true mutants as defined by the transmission of the neocuproine sensitive phenotype to the offspring. One of these mutants fit the &#x0201c;ideal&#x0201d; criteria (no defect in vehicle and complete loss of pigment in 100 nM neocuproine in 50&#x00025; of the haploid clutch) as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000261-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and subsequent analysis revealed important insight into the intersection of genetics with sub-optimal copper nutrition in early development. A second mutant reveals a role for proton transport in copper metabolism. The final two mutants were similar in phenotype to the first but full analysis has not been completed.</p><fig id="pgen-1000261-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000261.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Chemical genetic screen for zebrafish mutants sensitive to copper deficiency.</title><p>(A) Diagram outline of the sensitivity screen.

Fibroblasts from patients with Menkes disease which lack functional <italic>ATP7A</italic> were transfected with tyrosinase in combination with either wild-type or mutant zebrafish <italic>atp7a</italic> created via site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type cDNA.

In contrast to zebrafish mutant embryos, equal amounts of wild-type and mutant Atp7a were obtained via transfection in these fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000261-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). L-DOPA staining of cells expressing mutant cDNA was only mildly reduced when compared with wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000261-g002">Figure 2D vs. E</xref>) indicating that the mutant retains some transport function.

Adult homozygous mutant zebrafish placed in varying doses of neocuproine did not display an overt sensitivity phenotype (data not shown). However, further study revealed a maternal effect of this mutation on embryonic copper metabolism. Homozygous mutant embryos derived from heterozygous females had a normal quantity and distribution of pigmentation that was partially sensitive to 100 nM neocuproine which abolished pigment in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and reduced pigment over the body of the fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000261-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>). In contrast, homozygous mutant embryos derived from homozygous mutant females had no pigment in the RPE and reduced pigment over the body; treatment of these embryos with 100 nM neocuproine completely abolished pigmentation throughout the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000261-g003">Figure 3C, D</xref>). The effect of the mother's genotype on the embryonic phenotype indicates that though not overt, the adult homozygous mutant does have defects in copper metabolism demonstrated by a nutrient-deficient state in the offspring. Thus the sensitivity of the embryo to neocuproine is due not only to aberrant embryonic copper metabolism, as the embryos from heterozygous mothers are sensitive to copper deficiency, but also to a deficient maternal loading of copper into the egg as the phenotype is exacerbated by maternal homozygosity.</p><fig id="pgen-1000261-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000261.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title><italic>calamity<sup>gw71</sup></italic> embryos display developmental defects that are sensitive to maternal and environmental copper availability.</title><p>(A&#x02013;D) Maternal effect on pigmentation in untreated <italic>gw71</italic> homozygous embryos.

Homozygous mutant embryos were stained at 21 dpf with alcian blue/alizarin red to reveal bone and cartilage respectively. These were compared with wild-type syngeneic age-matched controls raised in the same manner. The wild-type fish had straight vertebral columns along the entire length with long, straight bony processes extending from each vertebra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000261-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, homozygous <italic>gw71</italic> fish displayed variable vertebral defects, most often a significant warping of the bony structures in the caudal-most region of the column caused by irregular length of vertebrae and defects in the joint angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000261-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). In addition the bony processes were also shortened and bent. Consistent with the observations in embryos that the mutation in <italic>gw71</italic> brings the homozygous embryo close to, but not over, a threshold for copper deficiency, the persistent skeletal defects in the juvenile fish were not fully penetrant. Whereas wild-type fish had no vertebral defects (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;26), a significant number (38&#x00025;, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;60) of the <italic>gw71</italic> fish contained defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000261-g003">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>Incomplete penetrance of the defect in the homozygous mutant fish could be attributed to either separate subtle genetic interactions or to variable nutrient availability. We hypothesized that if the penetrance of the defects were based on nutrient availability then reducing the nutrient levels would worsen the defects and increase the penetrance and vice versa. We thus took <italic>gw71</italic> mutant embryos and placed them in either normal egg water or egg water supplemented with 100 nM neocuproine or 500 nM CuCl<sub>2</sub> from 3 to 51 hpf (48 hour exposure). In addition, two separate groups of embryos were treated with neocuproine from 16 to 64 hpf and from 30 to 78 hpf to determine if there was a window of developmental time critical for the genesis of later defects. At 21 dpf the larvae were stained with alcian blue/alizarin red and scored for the presence or absence of vertebral defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000261-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). Untreated wild-type embryos (not shown) or wild-type embryos treated with 100 nM neocuproine from 3&#x02013;51 hpf had no perceptible skeletal defects. Thirty-eight percent of <italic>gw71</italic> embryos had skeletal defects and this number was not significantly affected by treatment with 100 nM neocuproine or 500 nM CuCl<sub>2</sub> from 3&#x02013;51 hpf. However, there was a 50&#x00025; increase in the number of skeletal defects in <italic>gw71</italic> embryos treated with 100 nM neocuproine from 16 to 64 hpf. The larvae treated with 100 nM neocuproine from 30 to 78 hpf died approximately 8 dpf from an unidentified cause.

Wild-type cells from <italic>actin::GFP</italic> transgenic zebrafish were transplanted into <italic>cto</italic> embryos and examined at 48 hpf for pigmented cells and GFP expression. Transplantation resulted in a few well-pigmented and stellate melanocytes over the head and body as well as clusters of pigmented retinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000261-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). These same embryos were mosaic for GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000261-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). In body melanocytes the melanin obscured GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000261-g005">Figure 5E arrowhead</xref>). In contrast, the retinal pigment epithelial melanocytes display GFP fluorescence in the central area not covered by melanin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000261-g005">Figure 5E arrow</xref>). From this we make two observations: First, the melanized melanocytes are derived from wild-type donor cells, and secondly, that nearby wild-type epidermal cells are not required for normal melanin pigmentation nor stellate appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000261-g005">Figure 5E arrowhead</xref>). Thus copper metabolism must not be significantly disrupted on an organismal level, as these wild-type melanocytes in a mutant host still receive adequate copper for normal pigmentation. Also, the stellate appearance indicates that the defect that causes punctate pigment cells in <italic>cto</italic> is also cell-autonomous.</p><p>The transplant experiment addresses delivery of copper to each cell, but the uptake or distribution of copper within the individual cell could also be affected in <italic>cto</italic> embryos.

Fifth, the <italic>gw71</italic> mutant displays an incompletely penetrant developmental hyperostosis phenotype which is easily detected. The proximal etiology of these defects is unknown.

Alternatively, lack of rescue with copper could point to residual genetic heterogeneity leading to phenotypic differences. Whichever is the case, this aspect of the mutant phenotype may provide a model to further our understanding of this poorly understood defect.

While abolition of this protein results in loss of proton transport into the secretory pathway, the embryo is capable of developing relatively normally to about 48 hpf when defects become visibly apparent. This lag is most likely due to the persistence of maternal protein and mRNA. At this time point the changes in melanin pigmentation patterns signal the visible presence of defects in proton transport. Grossly the melanocytes become punctate which, upon ultrastructure analysis, is shown to be a loss of mature melanosomes and a rounding of the cell body with vacuolization. The observed relationship between lack of melanosome formation and cellular morphology is not understood but may suggest a toxic effect of inappropriate melanization in the multi-vesicular bodies seen with electron microscopy or may be due to a particular sensitivity of melanocytes to loss of proton transport.

Since the effect on copper metabolism in <italic>cto</italic> mutants is only revealed in the context of sub-threshold copper nutrition, without a screen of this nature, this inter-relationship of two ion transport pathways in the vertebrate organism would never have been appreciated.</p><p>There are two models which could explain the defect in cuproenzyme function when proton transport is compromised. The first is that an acidic pH is important for copper incorporation into the nascent cuproproteins within the secretory pathway. The second model is that a proton gradient is required for copper transport, to balance the charge transfer across the vesicular membrane. These models are not mutually exclusive and a combination of the two could result in the final phenotype.</p><p>The data presented in this paper demonstrate the power of the zebrafish model system to examine gene-nutrient interactions as well as to delineate basic cell biologic pathways.
