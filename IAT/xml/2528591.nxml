Incomplete or continuous DNA replication without cell division can cause aneuploidy and disturb genomic stability. During metazoan development, however, some cells do not follow this once per cycle rule. For example, cells such as trophoblasts in mammalian placenta and salivary gland cells in dipterans undergo endoreplication, producing multiple copies of their nuclear DNA without dividing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edgar and Orr-Weaver, 2001</xref>). In some organisms, certain genes are amplified in some cells to meet massive demand for their products at particular developmental stages, such as the single locus in the <italic>Sciara coprophila</italic> puffII/9A region and ribosomal DNA genes in <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tower, 2004</xref>). These variants of DNA replication are essential for cellular function in metazoan development.</p><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> epithelial follicle cells provide an excellent model for study of developmental regulation of cell cycle programs, DNA replication, and cell differentiation. The single monolayer of follicle cells that surrounds 16 interconnected germline cells to form the egg chamber undergo three distinctive cell cycle programs during oogenesis. In early stages (1&#x02013;6), they carry out the normal mitotic cycle, including complete G1, S, G2, and M phases. After stage 6, they undergo three rounds of endocycle, duplicating their genomic DNA without division. At stage 10B, genomic DNA replication stops, and the main body follicle cells (columnar cells that surround the oocyte rather than those that cover the nurse cells) switch from endoreplication to synchronized amplification of some genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calvi et al., 1998</xref>). During amplification, continuous origin firing occurs without obvious gap phases. The amplified genomic regions encode eggshell proteins, which are in high demand during late oogenesis.</p><p>At the switch of cell cycle programs, follicle cells also change the expression pattern of molecular markers such as Cut, Hindsight (Hnt), and Fasciclin III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun and Deng, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2007</xref>). The mitotic cycle/endocycle (M/E) switch is induced by Delta-Notch signaling originating from the germline cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deng et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lopez-Schier and St Johnston, 2001</xref>). Notch activates expression of Hnt, a zinc-finger protein, in follicle cells during endocycle stages. Hnt mediates the role of Notch in suppressing the expression of a homeobox gene, <italic>cut</italic>, and the Cdc25 phosphatase, <italic>string</italic>, to regulate the M/E transition. Hnt also suppresses hedgehog signaling, which promotes follicle cell proliferation in early oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun and Deng, 2007</xref>).</p><p>However, the developmental signal triggering the endocycle gene/amplification (E/A) switch remains unknown, although amplification has been demonstrated to use the same DNA replication machinery as is used in the mitotic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Claycomb and Orr-Weaver, 2005</xref>). Gene amplification requires the replication origins at specific genomic regions to be fired repeatedly without cell division, whereas all other origins in the genome are inhibited. Several proteins and protein complexes required for forming the prereplication complex are involved, including the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdt1 (encoded by <italic>double parked</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), and the minichromosome maintenance complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Landis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Whittaker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schwed et al., 2002</xref>). ORC2 moves from a diffused nuclear distribution into a localized distribution at the amplification foci in stage 10 egg chambers but is undetectable at stage 12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Royzman et al., 1999</xref>). Restriction of ORC2 to amplification foci depends on dE2F1, which forms a heterodimer with dDp and acts as a transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Royzman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bosco et al., 2001</xref>). The <italic>dE2F1<sup>i1</sup></italic> mutant lacks punctate ORC2 staining and shows decreased intensity of chorion gene amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Royzman et al., 1999</xref>). dE2F1 and dE2F2 forming complexes with Rbf1, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue for retinoblastoma, are also involved in suppression of genomic replication during amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cayirlioglu et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>Rbf1<sup>120a</sup>/Rbf1<sup>14</sup></italic> follicle cells have an additional round of genomic DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cayirlioglu et al., 2003</xref>). dE2F2 and Rbf also belong to the Myb-Muv B&#x02013;dREAM complex that constrains genomic DNA replication during amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beall et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Georlette et al., 2007</xref>). Some evidence also indicates that chromatin modification regulates origin activity during amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal and Calvi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartl et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The steroid hormone ecdysone and its receptor may be involved in chorion gene expression. Ecdysone functions during postembryonic development, including larval molts and metamorphosis. 20-hydroxyecdysone, the active hormone produced in the peripheral tissues by metabolism of ecdysone, binds to the ecdysone receptor (EcR), which forms heterodimers with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> RXR homologue USP (encoded by the gene <italic>ultraspiracles</italic>), and activates the ecdysone signaling pathway, which turns on the early response genes, including Broad, E75, and E74, during metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thummel, 1996</xref>). In adult flies, ecdysone is mainly synthesized in ovaries, and the ecdysteroid hierarchy is known to regulate <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis and reproduction (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kozlova and Thummel, 2000</xref>). Egg chambers with germline clones of <italic>ecdysoneless</italic>, which disrupts production of ecdysone, arrest before vitellogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gaziova et al., 2004</xref>). Both EcR-A and EcR-B1, two EcR isoforms, are expressed in nurse and follicle cells during oogenesis. Removal of EcR function in germline cells causes abnormal egg chamber formation, loss of vitellogenic egg chambers, and nurse cell degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carney and Bender, 2000</xref>). Recently, EcR activity was shown to be required for follicle cell migration, dorsal appendage tube formation, and chorion gene expression and amplification. The EcR activity in the dorsal anterior region is also sensitive to Ras signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hackney et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that Notch signaling is down-regulated in main body follicle cells at stage 10B. Extended Notch signaling causes an extra round of genomic DNA replication and suppresses ecdysone signaling and the up-regulation of the zinc-finger protein Tramtrack (Ttk), both key regulators of the E/A switch. Overexpression of Ttk69 before stage 10 is sufficient to induce exit from the endocycle. Our findings elucidate a developmental pathway that includes down-regulation of Notch activity, activation of the EcR pathway, and up-regulation of Ttk to regulate the E/A switch.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Extended Notch activity prolongs endocycle and prevents synchronous gene amplification</title><p>The important role of Notch signaling in follicle cell proliferation and differentiation led us to examine the temporal and spatial pattern of Notch activity during oogenesis. Three independent reporter lines, <italic>Gbe-Su(H)m8-lacZ</italic> (<italic>Gbe-lacZ</italic>), <italic>E(Spl)m&#x003b2;-CD2</italic> (<italic>m&#x003b2;-CD2</italic>), and <italic>E(spl)m7-lacZ</italic> (<italic>m7-lacZ</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Celis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Furriols and Bray, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assa-Kunik et al., 2007</xref>), showed similar patterns of Notch activity in follicle cells, as revealed by costaining of anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;-galactosidase or anti-CD2 antibodies with Cut antibody for egg chamber staging. During stages 1&#x02013;6, Notch activity was limited to anterior and posterior ends of the egg chamber (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802084/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802084/DC1</ext-link>; and not depicted), which is related to the role of Notch in polar and stalk cell differentiation. At around stage 7, Notch activity was detected in the entire follicle cell epithelium and reached its highest level at stage 8 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and Fig. S1 A). It then slowly decreased until stage 10A in main body cells. No Notch activity was observed in these follicle cells at stage 10B (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), when follicle cells have already left the endocycle and begun synchronous site-specific DNA replication. The residual levels of reporter gene detected may result from the longevity of the gene product. The coincidence of Notch down-regulation and initiation of gene amplification in follicle cells was verified by a BrdU incorporation assay in the <italic>Gbe-lacZ</italic> reporter line. Normally, cells undergoing gene amplification have a unique punctate BrdU incorporation pattern. Each nucleus contains four BrdU incorporation foci representing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> amplicons in follicle cells (Fig. S1, C and C&#x02032;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calvi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Claycomb et al., 2004</xref>). Sometimes the fifth focus was also detected with our sensitized BrdU labeling protocol (Fig. S1 C). Notch activity was absent from the main body cells that began to show gene amplification (Fig. S1, B and B&#x02032;), suggesting a potential connection between Notch down-regulation and the E/A switch.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Down-regulation of Notch activity is required for the proper E/A switch and cell differentiation.</bold> DAPI (B&#x02013;F, I, and J; blue) was used to mark cell nuclei.

NICD-misexpressing cells showed high levels of Notch activity after stage 10B (not depicted), when such activity had already diminished in the wild type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and Fig. S1 A). Through BrdU incorporation analysis, we found that NICD-misexpressing cells did not have the punctate BrdU incorporation pattern but instead showed an oscillating genomic BrdU incorporation pattern at stage 10B and later (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>; &#x0003e;300 egg chambers counted with 100% penetrance), so they are in either the mitotic cycle or the endocycle. Staining with mitotic markers cyclin B and phosphohistone 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deng et al., 2001</xref>) showed that the NICD-misexpressing cells stopped expressing these markers after stage 6, like the wild-type cells (unpublished data), so they are probably not maintained in the mitotic cycle. Together, these data suggest that extended Notch signaling in main body follicle cells keeps them in the endocycle when they would otherwise have proceeded to synchronous gene amplification.</p><p>To determine whether NICD-misexpressing cells complete an extra round of the endocycle, we isolated follicle cells from NICD mosaic egg chambers (marking the NICD-misexpressing cells with GFP) and analyzed the genomic DNA content by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The wild-type follicle cells (GFP negative) showed four different cell populations, with 2C, 4C, 8C, and 16C DNA contents, consistent with three endocycle rounds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>). In contrast, NICD-misexpressing (GFP positive) cells additionally showed a fifth peak indicating 32C DNA content (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>), which suggests that they undergo an extra round of the endocycle. Normally, cells with more copies of genomic DNA have larger nuclei, and indeed, nuclei of the NICD-misexpressing cells were larger than those of their wild-type neighbors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><p>Gene amplification requires that replication origins be fired repeatedly without cell division. To fulfill this task, ORC2 becomes restricted at the amplification foci in stage 10B egg chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Royzman et al., 1999</xref>). Staining ORC2 in NICD mosaic egg chambers, we found that the punctate ORC2 pattern normally seen in wild-type cells was not detected in follicle cells with continued Notch activity at stage 10B (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 50). These follicle cells showed unrestricted localization of ORC2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and C&#x02032;</xref>), suggesting that continued Notch signaling blocks the transition to competency for gene amplification.</p></sec><sec><title>Extended Notch activity disrupts dE2F1, Hnt, and Cut expression during late oogenesis</title><p>Restriction of ORC2 to amplification foci depends on dE2F1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Royzman et al., 1999</xref>). Staining wild-type egg chambers with a polyclonal antibody against dE2F1, we found that dE2F1 expression oscillated in follicle cell nuclei until about stage 10A (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), a pattern probably related to the involvement of dE2F1 during the onset of S phases in both the mitotic cycle and the endocycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Follette et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reis and Edgar, 2004</xref>). Starting at stage 10B, dE2F1 was expressed in all main body follicle cell nuclei (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), coincident with the E/A switch, but this uniform expression of dE2F1 was disrupted in cells with NICD misexpression. dE2F1 expression continued to oscillate in stage 10B and older follicle cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>; &#x0003e;20 egg chambers counted). The other member of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> E2F transcription factor, dE2F2, which is also involved in promoting the E/A switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cayirlioglu et al., 2001</xref>), is expressed in all follicle cells throughout oogenesis (Fig. S2, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802084/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802084/DC1</ext-link>), but continued Notch activity did not change dE2F2 expression in follicle cells (Fig. S2 B).</p><p>dE2F1 has been shown to regulate cyclin E (CycE) expression, and CycE/Cdk2 activity is required for gene amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duronio and O'Farrell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calvi et al., 1998</xref>). To determine whether that activity is altered by extended Notch activity, we used the MPM2 antibody, which detects the CycE/Cdk2-dependent phosphoepitope at the histone locus body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">White et al., 2007</xref>) to stain NICD-misexpressing mosaic egg chambers. MPM2 appeared in an oscillating dotted pattern in follicle cells in the endocycle, but, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calvi et al. (1998)</xref> reported, it accumulated in all main body follicle cells at stage 10B in the wild type. In contrast, NICD-misexpressing follicle cells showed an oscillating pattern of the MPM2 signal at stage 10B (Fig. S2, C&#x02013;C&#x02034;), consistent with the conclusion that these cells are still in the endocycle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In addition, some of the NICD-misexpressing follicle cells had higher MPM2 signal intensity than did their wild-type neighbors (Fig. S2 C&#x02034;), suggesting that continued Notch activity affects CycE/Cdk2 activity during the E/A switch.</p><p>Cut expression is down-regulated by Notch signaling during the endocycle but resumes at around stage 10B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun and Deng, 2005</xref>). This resumption is not essential for the E/A switch, as <italic>cut</italic> mutant clones at stage 10B showed normal gene amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun and Deng, 2005</xref>). Nonetheless, expression of Cut in late follicle cells serves as a marker for late follicle cell differentiation. Staining Cut in egg chambers with extended Notch activity, we found that NICD misexpression sufficed to block Cut expression during late oogenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 I</xref>; &#x0003e;100 egg chambers counted), suggesting that down-regulation of Notch signaling in follicle cells is required for resumption of Cut expression in those cells.</p><p>Hnt, a positive target of Notch signaling, is normally expressed in follicle cells during stages 7&#x02013;10A and down-regulated in main body cells at stage 10B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun and Deng, 2007</xref>). In main body cells with NICD misexpression during late oogenesis, Hnt expression continued (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 J</xref>; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 100), indicating that extended Notch signaling maintains Hnt expression. The maintenance of the middle stage expression patterns of dE2F1, Hnt, and Cut in NICD-misexpressing cells during late oogenesis suggests that extended Notch activity suffices to keep the middle stage (endocycle) identity of follicle cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Ttk function is required for the E/A switch</title><p>To elucidate regulation of the E/A switch further, we performed a mosaic screen to isolate <italic>P</italic> element insertion mutations that disturb late Cut expression in follicle cells.

Here, we report that inactivation of the Notch signaling pathway in late oogenesis is important for cell differentiation and cell cycle regulation. Down-regulation of Notch is required for main body follicle cells to switch from genomic DNA replication in the endocycle stage to site-specific DNA replication in the gene amplification stage. The developmental pathway involved in this E/A switch also includes the activation of ecdysone signaling and up-regulation of a zinc-finger transcriptional repressor, Ttk. On the basis of our current findings, we propose the following model to explain the developmental regulation of the E/A switch in follicle cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>). At around stage 10, main body cells down-regulate Notch signaling as the prerequisite for activation of ecdysone signaling, which promotes the up-regulation of Ttk69. High levels of Ttk69 stop endoreplication and allow the cells to enter the synchronous gene amplification stage. Our data suggest that the Notch and EcR pathways have opposite function in the regulation of Ttk69 expression and the E/A switch. Their interaction is probably indirect because Notch signaling is usually involved in activation of gene expression.</p><p>Our results did not reveal a developmental signal sufficient to trigger the E/A switch. Although extended Notch activity sufficed to drive an extra round of endocycle, premature down-regulation of Notch activity by an <italic>N<sup>ts</sup></italic> allele caused neither premature exit from the endocycle (Fig. S4 B), probably because it was insufficient for premature up-regulation of Ttk69 (Fig. S4 D), nor premature entry into the gene amplification stage (Fig. S4 C). Down-regulation of Notch therefore provides only a permissive signal for the E/A switch. Our data also indicate that EcR signaling is required for the E/A switch. Is ectopic activation of EcR in follicle cells sufficient to drive premature E/A switch? Treating egg chambers with ponasterone A (PonA) can activate the EcR sensor in follicle cells before stage 10 (Fig. S5 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802084/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802084/DC1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hackney et al., 2007</xref>), but it did not cause any up-regulation of Ttk69 or defects in BrdU incorporation (Fig. S5 A&#x02032;; and not depicted). Notch activity in PonA-treated follicle cells was normal during midoogenesis (Fig. S5 A&#x02034;), so ectopic EcR activity could not interfere with Notch signaling. The combination of Notch down-regulation and EcR activation in midoogenesis did not result in premature E/A transition either (Fig. S5 B). Although ectopic EcR activity may therefore not suffice to induce premature E/A switch, we could not rule out that 5-h incubation is not long enough for EcR to up-regulate Ttk69 indirectly. In addition, the sensor line might be more sensitive to PonA treatment, whereas the target gene expression requires higher levels of EcR activity. Unfortunately, no constitutively active EcR transgenes are currently available. In summary, these analyses have not ruled out that EcR is the inductive signal. Alternatively, the E/A switch may require involvement of other developmental signals.</p><p>Although we proposed a model that involves Notch, EcR, and Ttk in regulating the E/A switch, the relationships among Notch, ECR, Ttk69, and a Notch target, Hnt, are complicated. Extended Notch signaling suppresses Ttk69 up-regulation. Loss of <italic>ttk</italic> function does not affect Notch activity but causes continuous expression of Hnt, whereas misexpression of Ttk69 suffices to down-regulate Hnt expression early (unpublished data). Similarly, DN EcR misexpression affects Hnt expression but not Notch activity reporters, suggesting that EcR regulates Hnt through Ttk69. Indeed, coexpression of DN EcR and Ttk69 restored almost normal expression patterns of Hnt and Cut in late follicle cells (Fig. S3, A and B). These data also suggest that Hnt is probably not a direct target of the NICD&#x02013;Su(H) activator complex and that Ttk69 intersects with Notch signaling downstream of Su(H) but upstream of Hnt. Our previous study showed that <italic>hnt</italic> mutant cells had only one extra round of mitotic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun and Deng, 2007</xref>) and that Hnt misexpression had no obvious defects in the E/A switch. Notch may therefore have additional targets to maintain the endocycle in follicle cells.</p><p>Notch signaling has been implicated in a wide range of biological and pathological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolos et al., 2007</xref>) and has prompted much research into the biological consequences of its activation. Notch activation at stages 6 and 7 is necessary for follicle cells to enter the endocycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deng et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lopez-Schier and St Johnston, 2001</xref>). Our current findings indicate that its down-regulation is also a critical step for them to continue to differentiate and exit the endocycle. Both up- and down-regulation of Notch may therefore play important roles in temporal regulation of follicle cell differentiation and cell cycle programs. In accordance with the temporal pattern of Notch activity in follicle cells, Delta (Dl), the ligand for Notch signaling in follicle cells, was gradually down-regulated from its peak level at stages 7 and 8, especially in the oocyte (Fig. S1, D and E; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bender et al., 1993</xref>). By stage 10, no Dl expression was detected in oocyte membranes adjacent to main body follicle cells (Fig. S1 F), so Dl down-regulation is probably the cause of the down-regulation of Notch activity during late oogenesis. An interesting exception is the centripetal cells, which are located anterior to the main body cells and migrate centripetally to separate the nurse cells and the oocyte at stage 10B. In these cells, Notch activity is still detected after stage 10B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dobens et al., 2005</xref>), but how it is maintained remains unclear. The centripetal cells do enter gene amplification, but not at the same time as main body cells; we often observe genomic DNA replication in centripetal cells at stage 10B when main body cells have obvious gene amplification. Other developmental signaling pathways are also known to be active in these cells, and they could regulate the expression of cell cycle machinery genes that are responsible for gene amplification in the presence of Notch activity.</p><p>Use of a tissue-specific Gal4 (<italic>slbo&#x0003c;Gal4</italic>) has been reported to reduce amplification in follicle cells expressing DN EcR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hackney et al., 2007</xref>), in contrast to our finding that the DN EcR cells stay in the endocycle. These discrepancies could be caused by the different Gal4 lines used. The expression of <italic>slbo&#x0003c;Gal4</italic> is probably too low to significantly block EcR activity in main body cells. Several lines of evidence suggest that EcR regulates the E/A switch at the transcriptional level. First, expression levels of Ttk69 are reduced by the DN form of EcR, which does not block EcR binding to DNA but does block transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cherbas et al., 2003</xref>). Second, a transcriptional target of EcR during metamorphosis, the broad complex, also confers a fragile eggshell phenotype when mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tzolovsky et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Ttk was first isolated as a transcriptional repressor of the <italic>fushi tarazu</italic> segmentation gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harrison and Travers, 1990</xref>) and is also an inhibitor of the neuronal fate of cells such as photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiong and Montell, 1993</xref>). In the peripheral nervous system, Ttk is positively regulated by Notch signaling to fulfill the suppression of the neuronal fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo et al., 1996</xref>). It is generally expressed in follicle cells throughout oogenesis, but its expression is not regulated by Notch during the M/E switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun and Deng, 2007</xref>). The involvement of Ttk in late follicle cells appears to be negatively regulated by Notch because up-regulation of Ttk69 at stage 10B was completely blocked by extended Notch activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Notch most likely blocks Ttk69 up-regulation by suppressing EcR activity. How exactly does the Notch&#x02013;EcR&#x02013;<italic>ttk</italic> pathway regulate endocycle exit as well as gene amplification? It probably acts by regulating dE2F1 and CycE/Cdk2 activity, as follicle cells with extended Notch activity or disruption of EcR or <italic>ttk</italic> function retained oscillating patterns of dE2F1 and MPM2 staining at stage 10B (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, E and G</xref>; Fig. S2 C; and not depicted). Some NICD cells had levels of MPM2 signal higher than the uniform level in the wild-type cells undergoing gene amplification (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref> and Fig. S2 C), indicating higher Cdk2 activity in those cells. To initiate genomic DNA replication, levels higher than the uniform levels of CycE/Cdk2 activity in late follicle cells are probably required. Ttk up-regulation during the E/A switch is probably important for lowering the CycE/CDK2 activity to a level too low to initiate an additional round of genomic replication yet sufficient to allow the amplification of specific loci. Consistently, <italic>ttk</italic> can suppress CycE expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> glial cells and bristle cell lineage and thus exit from the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badenhorst, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audibert et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, other cell cycle&#x02013;related genes such as <italic>dacapo</italic> (CDK2 inhibitor; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lane et al., 1996</xref>), <italic>dmyc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maines et al., 2004</xref>), and <italic>dmyb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beall et al., 2002</xref>) could be targets of <italic>ttk</italic>. Indeed, extended Notch activity, which suppresses Ttk69 up-regulation, suffices to prolong the expression of dMyc after stage 10B (Fig. S2 D), whereas misexpression of Ttk69 suffices to down-regulate dMyc expression precociously (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, E and E&#x02032;</xref>). Determining whether any of these genes is a direct target of Ttk69 will be interesting.</p><p>We also show that an increase in Ttk expression suffices to induce precocious exit from the endocycle, but the cells did not then go into gene amplification, perhaps because the Gal4-UAS&#x02013;induced expression of Ttk69 is much higher than the endogenous level of Ttk69 during late oogenesis. Because different levels of Ttk69 have profound effects on DNA replication patterns in follicle cells, these much higher levels could have eliminated all DNA replication in follicle cells. The ability of different expression levels of transcription factors to induce a different cellular differentiation status is well documented in early <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. Gradients of morphogens, mostly transcription factors, are the major source of segmentation and pattern formation in embryos. Follicle cells also adopt this rule to allow different cellular functions of Ttk at different oogenesis stages. Low levels of Ttk69 contribute to stage 6 entry into the endocycle, whereas high levels of Ttk69 permit exit from the endocycle and further differentiation at stage 10. Notch signaling, probably in concert with other signals, ensures the proper timing of up-regulation of Ttk69 and thus proper egg chamber development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Genetic strains</title><p><italic>N<sup>ts</sup></italic> allele was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center (BSC) and recombined to the <italic>FRT18D</italic> chromosome. <italic>FRT82B ttk<sup>1e11</sup></italic> and <italic>UAS-Ttk69, ttk<sup>1e11</sup></italic> were obtained from C.
