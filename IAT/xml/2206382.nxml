Current evidence implicates intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration and herniation as major causes, although the pathogenesis is poorly understood. While several cytokines have been implicated in the process of IVD degeneration and herniation, investigations have predominately focused on Interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;). However, to date no studies have investigated the expression of these cytokines simultaneously in IVD degeneration or herniation, or determined which may be the predominant cytokine associated with these disease states. Using quantitative real time PCR and immunohistochemistry we investigated gene and protein expression for IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF&#x003b1; and their receptors in non-degenerate, degenerate and herniated human IVDs. IL-1&#x003b2; gene expression was observed in a greater proportion of IVDs than TNF&#x003b1; (79% versus 59%). Degenerate and herniated IVDs displayed higher levels of both cytokines than non-degenerate IVDs, although in degenerate IVDs higher levels of IL-1&#x003b2; gene expression (1,300 copies/100 ng cDNA) were observed compared to those of TNF&#x003b1; (250 copies of TNF&#x003b1;/100 ng cDNA). Degenerate IVDs showed ten-fold higher IL-1 receptor gene expression compared to non-degenerate IVDs. In addition, 80% of degenerate IVD cells displayed IL-1 receptor immunopositivity compared to only 30% of cells in non-degenerate IVDs. However, no increase in TNF receptor I gene or protein expression was observed in degenerate or herniated IVDs compared to non-degenerate IVDs. We have demonstrated that although both cytokines are produced by human IVD cells, IL-1&#x003b2; is expressed at higher levels and in more IVDs, particularly in more degenerate IVDs (grades 4 to 12). Importantly, this study has highlighted an increase in gene and protein production for the IL-1 receptor type I but not the TNF receptor type I in degenerate IVDs. The data thus suggest that although both cytokines may be involved in the pathogenesis of IVD degeneration, IL-1 may have a more significant role than TNF&#x003b1;, and thus may be a better target for therapeutic intervention.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><p>See related editorial by Goupille <italic>et al.</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arthritis-research.com/content/9/6/110"/></p></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration and IVD herniation are major causes of low back pain (LBP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], which is a common, debilitating and economically important disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, none of the current treatments for LBP are directed at the altered cell and matrix biology underlying IVD degeneration or IVD herniation. Recent advances in therapeutics, particularly cell and tissue engineering, offer potential methods for inhibiting or reversing IVD degeneration, which has not previously been possible. However, the pathogenesis of IVD degeneration and IVD herniation is still not fully understood, and a greater understanding is necessary before such therapies can be fully developed for successful translation in the clinic.</p><p>The cells of the IVD behave abnormally during IVD degeneration, with decreased synthesis of the normal IVD matrix and increased production of degradative enzymes leading to a loss of the normal homeostatic metabolism in the IVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As a result there is destruction of the matrix with loss of hydration, resulting in spinal instability and a reduced ability to withstand load. Furthermore, IVD degeneration can also precede herniation of the IVD, which results in local nerve irritation, inflammation and further pain. In addition to the matrix degrading enzymes, these catabolic processes are thought to be mediated by a number of soluble mediators, including IL-1, tumour necrosis factor TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6, IL-8 and prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Of these, the cytokines IL-1 and TNF&#x003b1; have been the focus of a number of studies investigating the pathogenesis of IVD degeneration, herniation and sciatic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. TNF&#x003b1; has been linked to IVD herniation and nerve irritation by a number of studies and the outcome of recent experiments using TNF&#x003b1; inhibitors has implicated this cytokine as an important mediator in LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], whilst IL-1 has been shown to be directly involved in the decreased matrix synthesis and increased matrix degradation associated with IVD degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Importantly, elevated levels of IL-1 and TNF&#x003b1; have been found in aged and degenerative IVDs from both animal models and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated the synthesis of IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-1 receptor type I (RI), IL-1&#x003b2; converting enzyme and IL-1Ra by the resident chondrocyte-like cells in human IVDs with significant increases in IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-1RI and IL-1&#x003b2; converting enzyme, but not IL-1Ra, during IVD degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Weiler and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] found a positive correlation between TNF&#x003b1; and IVD degeneration, with approximately 80% of nucleus pulposus (NP) and 75% of annulus fibrosus (AF) cells staining positively for this cytokine. However, although Weiler and colleagues demonstrated an increase in TNF&#x003b1; immunopositivity in surgical samples compared to autopsy controls, the surgical samples were derived from a mixture of both herniated and degenerate IVDs and, thus, it was unclear from this study whether increased TNF&#x003b1; immunopositivity was observed in both disorders or just in herniation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A recent study by Bachmeier and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] also investigated the protein expression of TNF&#x003b1;, TNF receptors and the TNF&#x003b1; activating enzyme TACE in human IVD and demonstrated expression of all four molecules. Interestingly, although TNF&#x003b1; receptors were observed in autopsy samples, no results were presented for TNF receptor expression in surgical samples, thus raising the question as to whether TNF&#x003b1; is biologically active in such samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Thus, to date, it is not apparent whether both cytokines are involved in IVD degeneration or herniation and, if so, whether one has a predominant role in each disease state, an important question if future therapies are to be successful at targeting the processes involved in IVD degeneration and herniation.</p><p>Here, we use fully quantitative real time PCR and immunohistochemistry to investigate the gene and protein expression of IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF&#x003b1; and their receptors in non-degenerate, degenerate and herniated human IVDs to investigate whether both cytokines are expressed during IVD degeneration and herniation, and whether one may have a more predominant role.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Tissue selection and grading of IVDs</title><p>Human IVD tissue was obtained either at surgery or post-mortem examination with informed consent of the patient or relatives.

A number of cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IVD degeneration and herniation, with particular attention being paid to IL-1 and TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first study to simultaneously investigate the gene expression and protein production of IL-1 and TNF&#x003b1; and their receptors in non-degenerate, degenerate and herniated human IVDs.</p><p>This study demonstrated that IL-1 and TNF&#x003b1; are expressed along with their receptors in the human IVD. Both cytokines were present in non-degenerate IVDs at low levels, with similar numbers of immunopositive cells seen, although the gene expression analysis suggested that IL-1&#x003b2; was more highly expressed than TNF&#x003b1; in non-degenerate IVDs. TNF RI gene expression was observed in all non-degenerate samples; however, immunohistochemistry showed only a small number of cells with TNF RI protein, suggesting that the gene was not translated to protein. An alternative explanation may be that real time PCR is more sensitive than immunohistochemisty and, thus, may have identified gene expression where protein levels could not be detected. IL-1 RI protein, however, was produced by a greater number of cells than TNF RI, suggesting that non-degenerate IVD cells were more responsive to the local levels of IL-1 than TNF&#x003b1;. This suggests that IL-1 is important in the normal homeostasis of the IVD where IL-1 is controlled by the natural antagonist IL-1Ra, which we have previously shown to be synthesized by endogenous IVD cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>During IVD degeneration and IVD herniation, an increase in the protein production for both cytokines was observed, agreeing with the two earlier studies on protein production of these cytokines in degenerate human IVDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, the number of IL-1&#x003b2; immunopositive cells was higher than the number of TNF&#x003b1; immunopositive cells in both degenerate and herniated samples. In addition, gene expression for IL-1&#x003b2; but not TNF&#x003b1; was significantly increased in degenerate compared to non-degenerate IVDs.</p><p>This study also showed an increase in both IL-1RI gene expression and protein production in degenerate and herniated IVDs compared to non-degenerate IVDs, a finding that agrees with our earlier study in which we demonstrated increased immunopositivity for IL-1RI in degenerate compared to non-degenerate IVDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The biological activity of TNF is mediated through two distinct but structurally homologous TNF receptors, type I (p60 or p55) and type II (p80 or p75). Although TNF binds to each with high affinity, TNF RI is more ubiquitously expressed and it is generally believed that TNF RI is responsible for the majority of biological actions of TNF while TNF RII may function to potentate the effects of TNF RI. We have previously shown that TNF RII is not expressed by IVD cells either in normal or degenerate IVDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The current study also shows the expression and production of TNF RI within human intervertebral IVDs, which together with the recent study by Bachmeier and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] suggests that human IVD cells are capable of responding to TNF&#x003b1; <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, no increase in TNF RI synthesis was seen during IVD degeneration or herniation. In fact, a decrease in TNF RI gene and protein expression was seen in degenerate and herniated IVDs compared to non-degenerate IVDs, suggesting that the biological activity of TNF&#x003b1; is reduced during degeneration and herniation due to these IVDs having reduced responsiveness to TNF&#x003b1;.</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that in human IVD cells, IL-1 treatment results in decreased matrix production and increased production of the degradation enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases and ADAMTs (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], features characteristic of IVD degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Similar responses have been observed in animal IVD cells following treatment with TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], although these responses have not been shown to date in human IVDs. Here we demonstrate the expression and localisation of the TNF RI to the chondrocyte-like cells of the human intervertebral IVDs, and although only expressed in a low percentage of IVD cells, this suggests that the human IVDs are capable of responding to TNF&#x003b1;, which could result in decreased matrix synthesis and increased matrix degradation in a similar manner to that seen with IL-1. However, as our data demonstrated low expression of TNF RI in human IVD samples, this suggests that these effects would be limited.</p><p>Although our study indicates that TNF&#x003b1; may have limited effects on IVD cells during IVD degeneration, during IVD herniation the TNF&#x003b1; produced by IVD cells in the herniated IVDs may have additional detrimental effects. During IVD herniation, IVD tissue comes into contact with the nerve root and inflammatory cells. TNF&#x003b1; has been shown to result in the sensitisation of nerve roots and stimulation of nerve growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As such, the TNF&#x003b1; generated by the IVD cells in herniated IVD tissue could have a detrimental effect on the local nerves, resulting in the generation of LBP. Indeed, the use of TNF blocking antibodies has shown some promise in a small clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], although two more recent placebo controlled trials suggest that this treatment may only be of use in a small subset of sciatica patients (that is, those with L4/5 or L3/4 herniation with modic changes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Our data suggest that TNF&#x003b1;, in addition to IL-1, may have a role in the pathogenesis of IVD degeneration. However, we have shown that IL-1 is expressed and produced at higher levels than TNF&#x003b1;, suggesting IL-1 may be more predominant in the processes of IVD degeneration. In addition, this study has highlighted that IL-1 RI expression by native IVD cells is upregulated during IVD degeneration and herniation, suggesting that there is increased responsiveness to IL-1 during these disease states. In contrast, TNF RI was only produced by a small proportion of IVD cells in non-degenerate IVDs and its expression and production were decreased during IVD degeneration and herniation, suggesting that the responsiveness of IVD cells to TNF&#x003b1; in degenerate human IVDs may only be at low levels.</p><p>The data presented in the current study together with our previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] suggest that IL-1 would be a viable target for the inhibition of disc degeneration. Indeed, IL-1Ra therapies such as Anakinra are already in clinical use for limiting cartilage degradation in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and, as such, its pharmacology and side effects are increasingly well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated successful transfer of IL-1Ra to IVD tissue <italic>in vitro </italic>using gene therapy and, thus, delivery to the IVD is a viable option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The inhibition of IL-1 driven processes, leading to disc degeneration, could be important in two therapeutic strategies; first, inhibition of disc degeneration at an early stage (such as degeneration induced at adjacent levels following spinal fusion or disc replacement); and second, defining the optimal tissue niche for regenerating the end stage degenerate IVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data show that both IL-1 and its receptor are significantly upregulated in IVD degeneration and are, therefore, more likely to be major mediators in the processes of IVD degeneration. By contrast, whilst TNF&#x003b1; expression is upregulated in degeneration, gene and protein expression of the predominant TNF receptor (TNF R1) is, if anything, reduced, with few cells showing demonstrable protein production. The implication, therefore, is that overall biological activity of TNF&#x003b1; within the degenerate IVD is reduced. The herniated IVD is, however, rather different. Although TNF RI expression is low, TNF&#x003b1; gene and protein expression are higher overall than in the non-degenerate IVD and whilst the biological activity of TNF&#x003b1; within the IVD tissue will still be restricted by the low receptor expression our results would support the data from others implicating a potential paracrine effect of TNF produced by IVD cells in inducing sciatica. To conclude, the results from this study suggest that IL-1 rather than TNF&#x003b1; would be a better target for therapeutic approaches to inhibit IVD degeneration and associated LBP.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CLM helped conceive the study, participated in its design, performed all the laboratory work and analysis and drafted the manuscript.
