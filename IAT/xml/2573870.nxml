Humans and Dalmatian dogs produce uric acid during purine degradation, which leads to elevated levels of uric acid in blood and urine and can result in significant diseases in both species. The defect in Dalmatians results from inefficient transport of uric acid in both the liver and renal proximal tubules. Hyperuricosuria and hyperuricemia (huu) is a simple autosomal recessive trait for which all Dalmatian dogs are homozygous. Therefore, in order to map the locus, an interbreed backcross was used. Linkage mapping localized the huu trait to CFA03, which excluded the obvious urate transporter 1 gene, SLC22A12. Positional cloning placed the locus in a minimal interval of 2.5 Mb with a LOD score of 17.45. A critical interval of 333 kb containing only four genes was homozygous in all Dalmatians. Sequence and expression analyses of the SLC2A9 gene indicated three possible mutations, a missense mutation (G616T;C188F) and two promoter mutations that together appear to reduce the expression levels of one of the isoforms. The missense mutation is associated with hyperuricosuria in the Dalmatian, while the promoter SNPs occur in other unaffected breeds of dog. Verification of the causative nature of these changes was obtained when hyperuricosuric dogs from several other breeds were found to possess the same combination of mutations as found in the Dalmatian. The Dalmatian dog model of hyperuricosuria and hyperuricemia underscores the importance of SLC2A9 for uric acid transport in mammals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Animals excrete waste products in their urine. When most mammals metabolize compounds, called purines, they produce allantoin as one waste product in their urine. Humans, great apes, and Dalmatian dogs produce a different breakdown product, uric acid. This leads to high levels of uric acid in the urine and blood. In humans, this can result in diseases such as kidney stones and gout and may cause hypertension. In Dalmatians, high uric acid levels result in bladder stones that often have to be removed surgically. The cause of high uric acid levels in humans and great apes is not the same as in the Dalmatian dog. Here we report the genetic cause of the Dalmatian condition. This change is shared by dogs from unrelated breeds, indicating that it predates the separation of dog breeds. The gene that causes excretion of uric acid in Dalmatians is important for controlling the amount of uric acid in human blood and is therefore important for human diseases. It is not clear why humans and great apes have evolved to excrete uric acid, but it appears that some dogs have developed a different mechanism that leads to the same result: elevations in urine and blood uric acid levels.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Uric acid is the predominant product of purine metabolism in humans, great apes and one breed of dog, the Dalmatian; all other mammals excrete allantoin. During primate evolution, urate oxidase (UOX), which catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid into allantoin, accumulated several independent nonsense mutations that led to its silencing and resulted in high serum and urine uric acid levels in humans and great apes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Friedman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Oda1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Uric acid freely circulates in the form of urate, the salt of uric acid, in the plasma where it serves as a free-radical scavenger. Although uric acid has evolved in humans to be the main product of purine metabolism, this change has had some negative effects. High levels of urate predispose humans to gout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Choi1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Lin1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, uric acid levels have been correlated with hypertension, vascular disease and metabolic syndrome although it is unclear whether hyperuricemia is primary or secondary in these cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Short1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Choi2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>As in humans, all Dalmatian dogs have a defect in urinary metabolism that leads to excretion of uric acid rather than allantoin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Benedict1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. As a result, Dalmatians are predisposed to form urinary calculi composed of urate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000246-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Hyperuricosuria in the Dalmatian is relatively easy to identify since Dalmatian urine forms a crystallized precipitate when cooled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000246-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This trait was probably fixed in the breed through selection for a more distinctive spotting pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Keeler1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Schaible1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Dalmatian coat pattern involves mutations in at least three different spotting genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000246-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Dalmatians have a mutation for extreme white in the MITF gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Karlsson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> that leads to an all white coat. A dominant mutation, called T for ticking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Little1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, is responsible for adding the pigmented spots to the white coat.

In the kidney, uric acid is filtered by the glomerulus and then a portion is reabsorbed in the proximal tubules where it re-enters circulation. There are species-specific differences in the production of uric acid versus allantoin and the relative amounts of reabsorption and secretion in the proximal tubules, making the use of animal models in this area of research challenging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-RochRamel1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Dogs and humans, unlike many other mammals, undergo bidirectional transport of urate along the nephron, which results in net reabsorption of urate from the glomerular filtrate. In Dalmatians, reabsorption is lost entirely and urate excretion equals or exceeds the glomerular filtration rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Friedman2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. This change in uric acid excretion by the Dalmatian kidney is not secondary to hyperuricemia since non-Dalmatian dogs with artificially raised serum uric acid levels can only clear uric acid at &#x0223c;1/3 the rate of the Dalmatian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Friedman2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Free-flow micropuncture experiments were used to demonstrate that in Dalmatian kidneys there is a deficiency of proximal tubular reabsorption of urate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-RochRamel2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although findings stated above implicate the kidney in Dalmatian huu, reciprocal liver and kidney transplant experiments between Dalmatian and non-Dalmatian dogs demonstrate that the liver is also important for the phenotype. Kidney transplants between normal dogs and Dalmatians only partially ameliorated the hyperuricosuria phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Kuster1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Appleman1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Dalmatian hepatocyte transplants can correct the phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Kuster1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, a logical cause for the Dalmatian phenotype is a mutation in urate oxidase, similar to humans. However, Dalmatian liver homogenates are capable of oxidizing uric acid to allantoin and the urate oxidase gene was excluded genetically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Safra1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The Dalmatian phenotype could also be explained by a generalized defect of urate transport since liver slices were not capable of converting uric acid to allantoin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Giesecke1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Dalmatian dog erythrocytes have been shown to transport urate normally, demonstrating that Dalmatians do not have a generalized defect in urate transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Vinay1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Although Dalmatians have functional urate oxidase activity in their livers, they effectively have a similar phenotype to humans and great apes since they cannot transport urate into the liver for degradation. The Dalmatian phenotype can be summarized as a hepatic and renal urate transport defect which leads to hyperuricosuria and relative (compared to other dogs) hyperuricemia.</p><p>The discovery of various proteins that transport urate has shed some light on the control of serum and urine uric acid levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Hediger1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. In the kidney, urate is transported across the apical membrane of the proximal tubules and then across the basolateral membrane before re-entering circulation. In humans, the transporter that reabsorbs urate across the apical membrane in the proximal tubule is Urat1, or SLC22A12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Enomoto1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, which is expressed exclusively in the kidney.

Using recombination breakpoints in the interbreed backcross and taking advantage of the homozygosity within the Dalmatian breed for huu, a critical interval containing four candidate genes was defined.

SLC2A9 coding exons 2&#x02013;12, as well as the exon-intron boundaries, were sequenced in a Dalmatian and a Labrador Retriever. Six SNPs were discovered in the SLC2A9 sequence. Two are exonic; exon 5 G563T;Cys188Phe (nucleotide and amino acid numbering are reported with reference to variant N) and exon 11 G1303A;Val435Ile (nucleotide and amino acid numbering are reported with reference to variant N), two are located 99 and 101 bp 5&#x02032; to the start codon of variant O. SNPs were also identified in introns 1 and 10. None of the intronic SNPs are within or near conserved splice-site elements. The SLC2A9 exon 11 G1303A SNP is polymorphic in the 24 unrelated Dalmatians tested, consistent with its genomic location outside of the region homozygous in Dalmatians (SNP17, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000246-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

Positional cloning of the huu locus using an interbreed backcross, as well as homozygosity within the Dalmatian breed, has identified SLC2A9 as the cause of the change in uric acid handling by this dog breed. Unrelated breeds of dog with hyperuricosuria or urate stone disease share the same haplotype as Dalmatian dogs, providing compelling evidence that this is the gene responsible. This result was somewhat unexpected because SLC2A9 was classified as a member of the large glucose transporter family and did not have an assigned function with respect to urate transport until recently.</p><p>SLC2A9 is classified as a part of the large glucose transporter family based on amino acid sequence identity of 44&#x00025; and 38&#x00025; to Glut5 and Glut1, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Phay1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. SLC2A9 has been localized to the cell surface in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Augustin1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. It contains 12 transmembrane domains and, based on homology to other glucose transporters, the central channel is essentially formed by helices 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-SalasBurgos1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. The Cys188Phe amino acid change occurs within a highly conserved residue located within the fifth transmembrane domain of the protein. Although a cysteine to phenylalanine amino acid change is not expected to disrupt the localization of the alpha helix to the transmembrane, this change could disrupt the proper function of the protein by altering the pore. Precedent for single amino acid changes altering substrate specificity has been shown for a number of the SLC2A transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Manolescu1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Expression differences between Dalmatian and non-Dalmatian samples were observed for one of the isoforms (O) of the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000246-g004">Figure 4</xref>). SNPs in the promoter region of this variant were identified and were fixed in the Dalmatian breed. These same SNPs were also identified in non-Dalmatians without hyperuricosuria. Therefore, these SNPs alone are not sufficient to confer the phenotype but along with the missense mutation they may contribute to the expression of the phenotype. It remains to be determined if there are variant O transcript differences in the general dog population and if the SNPs identified in this work are responsible for the differences in the level of variant O expression. In humans, the equivalent isoform to variant O is expressed on the apical surface of the proximal tubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Augustin1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Reduction in the amount of the protein combined with a deficiency in the protein itself may contribute to the decreased conversion to allantoin by the liver as well as the increased excretion of uric acid in these dogs. SLC2A9 tissue expression in dogs is similar to that observed in humans and mice. Expression in humans is highest in kidney, liver and placenta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Phay1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In humans, isoform 1 has been localized within polarized canine kidney cells to the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubules while isoform 2 is localized to the apical side <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Augustin1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The tissue and cellular localization of SLC2A9 is consistent with the Dalmatian huu phenotype and with SLC2A9 having a role in urate transport in both the liver and kidney.</p><p>Mutations in SLC2A9 will likely have important consequences for a number of different disorders of uric acid homeostasis in people. Significant alterations of SLC2A9 could cause primary renal hypouricemia in people similar to SLC22A12 mutations since genetic heterogeneity exists for this disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Ichida1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Tzovaras1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutations in SLC2A9 could also cause cases of primary gout by significantly altering the serum uric acid concentration. In addition, more subtle changes could alter serum uric acid levels by changing the amount of uric acid excreted in the urine. There is evidence that polymorphisms in SLC22A12 are capable of increasing serum uric acid levels in Japanese populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Shima1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. A significant association of SLC2A9 to serum uric acid levels was recently reported among Caucasian individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Wallace1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and among Sardinian and Chianti cohorts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Li1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Two other papers were recently published on the importance of the SLC2A9 gene to urate transport in humans. The first demonstrated that human SLC2A9 is a high capacity, low affinity uric acid transporter and that genetic variants are associated with gout; however causative mutations were not determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Vitart1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The second paper documented a strong association between SLC2A9 and uric acid levels in cohorts of German and Austrian nationalities as well as a correlation between RNA expression levels of this gene and serum uric acid levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Doring1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, strong evidence exists that SLC2A9 functions as a urate transporter in humans, and likely in dogs.</p><p>In addition to the potential influence with respect to human uric acid disorders, the present studies also impact our understanding of the history of this defect in dogs. The story of hyperuricosuria in dogs started in 1916 when Benedict first recognized the similarity of uric acid defects in the Dalmatian dog and people <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Benedict1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the origin of this defect may have preceded the development of the Dalmatian breed. The present studies show that the same genetic mutation is present in Bulldogs and Black Russian Terriers, breeds that are not known to be closely related to the Dalmatian. It appears that affected individuals from these breeds share the same haplotype as the Dalmatian, indicating that the mutation is identical by descent between these breeds. The mutation must be quite old since it would have to predate breed formation; however, additional evaluation of the extended haplotype in all three breeds is necessary to estimate an actual age. Alternatively, although unlikely, the mutation could have been introduced into these other breeds by crosses between breeds. Although Dalmatians are fixed for hyperuricosuria, this is not true of the other breeds. Therefore, genetic testing and selection in those breeds can eliminate the disease. Within the Dalmatian breed, the possibility exists for correction of this defect by the introduction of unaffected Dalmatian&#x000d7;Pointer backcross dogs into the purebred gene pool. These dogs are currently registered with the United Kennel Club in the United States. The disease allele probably became homozygous in modern Dalmatians through selection for more distinctive spots. However, most low uric acid excreting backcross dogs have acceptably sized spots (according to the breed standard), allowing breeders the unique opportunity to correct a fixed genetic defect while maintaining the breed characteristic that may ultimately be responsible for its fixation.</p><p>Two independent lines of evidence from different species point to the key role of SLC2A9 in urate transport; the Dalmatian uric acid phenotype itself and genome wide association studies linking SLC2A9 to uric acid levels in people along with direct uric acid transport data. There are many questions to be answered about the role of SLC2A9 in urate homeostasis and its other transport functions. In dogs and other mammals with endogenously low serum uric acid, SLC2A9 may normally play a different transport role than in people where it appears to have an important function in uric acid transport. Since degradation of uric acid to allantoin does not occur in humans and great apes, SLC2A9 may play a different role in transport in the liver as compared to those species that excrete allantoin. The positional cloning of the hyperuricosuria locus in the Dalmatian dog has provided a compelling new avenue of investigation toward a better understanding of urate transport in mammals and successfully completes a story started in 1916 when Benedict first recognized the similarity of the uric acid defect in the Dalmatian dog and people.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>DNA samples from backcross dogs were acquired as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000246-Safra2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.
