ADAM proteins also contain a single transmembrane domain, a C-rich region and an EGF-like repeat.

The mouse ADAM33 protein contains all of these motifs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and based on sequence, the metalloprotease domain of mouse ADAM33 is likely to be functional.

The size of the 2.7 kb RNA corresponds exactly to the prediction based on sequence, but the molecular basis for the testis-specific 2 kb transcript is not known (attempts to amplify the cDNA from testis using primers in exon 1 and the 3'UTR were unsuccessful). Using a more sensitive assay for expression based on semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed expression in all samples examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), including total RNA from mouse embryos on days 8.5, 9.5, 12.5 and 19 of development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Mouse <italic>Adam33</italic> expression.

Slight variation in the apparent mobility among lanes is due to sample differences; fragments of identical mobility among different tissue samples were produced when individual RT-PCR reactions were repeated. Absence of signal in the 1000&#x000d7; but presence in the 100&#x000d7; dilutions for two of the tissues are likely to be caused by contaminants in the RNA preparation that inhibited the RT-PCR reaction.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-3-2-3"/></fig><p>The expression pattern of <italic>Adam33</italic> in the adult brain was also examined by in situ hybridization of coronal brain sections (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

The expression of <italic>Adam33</italic> in two of the primary locations of granule neurons in the brain is intriguing and it will be interesting to follow expression of this gene during neuronal migration; while Xenopus ADAM13 has been implicated in neural crest cell migration during embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], perhaps ADAM33 plays a role in the migration of granule neurons in the mouse brain. In Drosophila, the ADAM protein kuzbanian (orthologous to mammalian ADAM 10) is required for proteolytic cleavage of notch and delta, associates with a number of molecules that have been implicated in axon guidance and migration, and has been shown to play a role in axon guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Expression pattern of <italic>Adam33</italic> in adult mouse brain.

Gene order and orientation are conserved between this region of mouse chromosome 2 and human Chromosome 20p13, and human <italic>ADAM33</italic> has the same transcriptional orientation as its closest neighbors, <italic>SN,</italic> which lies immediately upstream, and <italic>GFRA4,</italic> which lies immediately downstream. A bona fide human cDNA for <italic>ADAM33</italic> has not been isolated (see below), and only some of the exons have been annotated correctly in human genomic sequence. However, comparison of human genomic sequence to the mouse <italic>Adam33</italic> cDNA reveals an identical exon-intron structure and a putative 814 aa protein with 71% identity and 78% similarity to mouse ADAM33 and 37% identity and 61% similarity to X-ADAM13 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>ADAM33</italic> designation was originally assigned to an ~3000 bp testis cDNA clone, DKFZp434K0521, whose full-length sequence (AL117415) was determined as part of a large-scale genome project. Comparison to the mouse cDNA and to human genomic DNA reveals that the testis cDNA clone represents residues 300&#x02013;813 (with one frameshift) of our predicted human ADAM33 protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Is ADAM33 the mammalian ortholog of X-ADAM13?</title><p>The most closely related homolog of mouse and human <italic>ADAM33</italic> is <italic>X-ADAM13,</italic> which encodes a 3200 bp cDNA with an ORF of 915 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The overall level of similarity between mouse or human ADAM33 and X-ADAM13 is lower than that of other mammalian and <italic>Xenopus</italic> ADAM orthologs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In addition, there are no putative SH3 binding sites in the cytoplasmic tail of the mouse or human proteins, whereas X-ADAM13 contains several. Like the mammalian ADAM33 proteins, X-ADAM13 has all the hallmark motifs of an ADAM protein, including potential metalloprotease, disintegrin and signaling activities. It is expressed during embryogenesis in somitic mesoderm and neural crest cells, suggesting a likely role in embryonic development. Mouse and human ADAM33 are also highly similar to X-MDC13, another Xenopus ADAM protein that is highly homologous to X-ADAM13 and is expressed in embryos and adult testes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Characterization of the <italic>Adam33</italic> embryonic expression pattern may provide additional insight into cross-species relationships, however, it should be noted that much of the work on X-ADAM13 to date has focused on its putative SH3 binding sites to identify interacting proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and the absence of these sites in mouse and human ADAM33 proteins indicates that such interactions are likely not conserved in mammals. Recent work does indicate that the metalloprotease domain of X-ADAM13 is active and that this protein is required for normal cranial neural crest cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As the metalloprotease domain of ADAM33 also matches the consensus sequence for an active metalloprotease, further study of this protein's potential catalytic activity and identification of its target proteins will be important in determining its biological role. In addition, availability of genomic sequence surrounding mouse <italic>Adam33</italic> will facilitate cross-species comparisons to identify conserved regulatory sequences.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>As complete genomic DNA sequence becomes available for more species, the number of putative genes identified at the sequence level will increase and more cross-species comparisons will become possible. While analyzing the sequence of a large BAC containing the <italic>Attractin</italic> locus, we identified a novel member of the ADAM family, <italic>Adam33,</italic> which was most similar to a partial human cDNA for <italic>ADAM33</italic> and to <italic>Xenopus laevis ADAM13.</italic> Mouse <italic>Adam33</italic> is expressed during embryogenesis and in a number of adult tissues, and preliminary characterization of its protein sequence predicts that ADAM33 contains an active metalloprotease domain. Despite overall sequence similarity to X-ADAM13, mouse ADAM33 does not contain putative SH3 binding sites in its cytoplasmic tail, suggesting that either these two proteins are not orthologs, or their functions have diverged during evolution. Further investigation is required to determine whether mouse ADAM33 has metalloprotease activity and, if it does, identification of its substrates would provide insight into its evolutionary and functional relationship to X-ADAM13 beyond what is possible by sequence analysis alone. Finally, mouse <italic>Adam33</italic> is expressed in discrete regions of the adult brain, suggesting an important function for this gene in adult mice. Its expression in two regions of the brain critical for granule neuron migration and production suggests a possible role in neurogenesis and/or neuronal migration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Random-insert Ml3 clones for mouse BAC clone 389B9 (Research Genetics) were generated and sequenced by the Stanford DNA Sequencing and Technology Center, following their standard protocols <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sequence-www.stanford.edu/group/techdev/inp.html"/>.
