It has been demonstrated that the elongation process can be reconstituted with distinct protein factors, DNA polymerase &#x003b4; (pol &#x003b4;), replication factor C (RFC), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and replication protein A (RPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). These replication factors, in addition to the polymerase &#x003b1;-primase complex (pol &#x003b1;), are required components of the <italic>in vitro</italic> simian virus 40 (SV40) replication system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The pol &#x003b4; heterotetrameric complex, consisting of 125, 66, 50 and 12 kDa proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), is the major polymerase involved in chromosomal replication in eukaryotic cells. RFC is composed of one large subunit (145 kDa) and four smaller ones (40, 38, 37 and 36 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and has DNA-dependent ATPase activity, loading sliding clamp PCNA onto DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). PCNA itself is a homotrimeric ring-shaped protein with a molecular mass of 29 kDa for each monomer, which encircles double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The likely role of PCNA in pol &#x003b4; replication is in stabilizing the pol &#x003b4;&#x02013;DNA interaction to maintain the processivity of the polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17">11&#x02013;17</xref>). RPA is a heterotrimeric single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding protein, consisting of 70, 32 and 14 kDa proteins, required for the initiation and elongation phases of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>The initiation phase of DNA replication with these protein factors has been investigated intensively, and it has been demonstrated that their actions are well coordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24 B25 B26">19&#x02013;26</xref>). An important process is the switch from pol &#x003b1; to pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), mediated by RFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>After an elongation complex is once established, concerted actions of these protein components could still be required. However, the architecture and actions within elongation complexes remain obscure. It is generally believed that an elongation complex containing pol &#x003b4; and PCNA, but not RFC, is somehow extremely stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). However, we have obtained surprising results, revealing a markedly dynamic picture for elongation complexes consisting of pol &#x003b4;, PCNA and RFC. We thus have evidence that pol &#x003b4; frequently repeats a dissociation&#x02013;association cycle at growing 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl ends. RFC appears to remain at the primer terminus throughout the elongation phase, probably holding PCNA from which pol &#x003b4; has detached, with the potential to catalyze unloading of PCNA. Once pol &#x003b4; dissociates from a growing 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl end, a significant fraction of PCNA may remain at the primer terminus through interaction with RFC, while the remainder may be unloaded by RFC or slide out of the primer terminus. RFC persisting around primer termini then may reload PCNA from solution to restart DNA synthesis. In addition, characterization of the dynamic properties of the same protein factors with a subassembly of pol &#x003b4; lacking the POLD3 subunit revealed a crucial function of POLD3 in the efficient recycling of PCNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The expression plasmid for human PCNA was as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and that for human RPA, p11d-tRPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), was a generous gift of Dr Marc S.

In the reaction for 10 min, we detected a long product, probably corresponding to the full-size mp18 DNA (7.2 kb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), and the amount increased with further incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The size of the products was heterogeneous, indicating several pausing sites. Omitting PCNA or RFC from the reaction mixture resulted in virtually no incorporation of dNMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). In the absence of RPA, heterogeneity in the length of the products was emphasized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Under the experimental conditions used, efficient dNMP incorporation was observed within the first 5 min, and then DNA synthesis continued at slower rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C).

Some proteins remain associated continuously with the growing 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl end (acting processively), and others repeat a cycle of association and dissociation (acting distributively). The distributive factors have to be reloaded many times from solution during elongation, while the processive factors are loaded only once at the initiation.</p><p>How each of the proteins acts during replication on ss mp18 DNA can be investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) as described below. If a protein acts distributively, then the product size is expected to vary proportionally with the concentration of the protein in the reaction mixture; the average size of products should be shorter at lower concentrations of the proteins because association of the protein to primer termini would be random and all primer termini would be utilized with the same efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). On the other hand, if a protein acts processively, limiting its concentration in solution would be expected to affect only the frequency of the first assembly event (initiation), but not the size of products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). If the association and dissociation rates were much faster than other chemical steps, the binding process would not be rate limiting, and the incorporation rate of dNMP would not vary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B, right panels). In the following experiments, we investigated the mode of action of proteins by analyzing size distributions of products by electrophoresis on agarose gels under denaturing conditions. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Analysis of the modes of action of replication factors in ss mp18 DNA replication.

Amounts of proteins used in the titration were the same as for D and E.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm822f2"/></fig></p><p>First, the concentration of pol &#x003b4; was varied in the presence of saturating amounts of the auxiliary proteins, and the product size was analyzed by alkaline-agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). The results showed that the amount and length of the products increased as more pol &#x003b4; was added to the reaction mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), implying that pol &#x003b4; frequently dissociated from the growing 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl end and reassociated randomly with free 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34 B35 B36">34&#x02013;36</xref>). The dissociation might be caused by the secondary template structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that pol &#x003b4; is not completely processive in this assay system.</p><p>Next, we changed concentrations of RFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). The result was different from the case of pol &#x003b4;. Essentially, the concentration of RFC affected only the amount of products, but not their size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), although increase of size at higher concentrations of RFC was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, lanes 6 and 7). The processive nature of RFC might be explained in two alternative ways. One is that the sole role of RFC is loading of PCNA at the initiation step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Once PCNA is loaded, due to stable association with DNA, RFC may no longer be required. If so, even after dissociation of pol &#x003b4; from the growing 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl end, once loaded PCNA may remain at the primer terminus and assist reassociation of pol &#x003b4;. The other explanation is that once RFC binds to a primer end and loads PCNA to DNA, it may travel with PCNA and pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In the latter case, after dissociation of pol &#x003b4;, RFC may continue to hold PCNA at the primer terminus, and if the RFC unloaded PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41 B42 B43">41&#x02013;43</xref>) or if PCNA slide out of the primer terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), the remaining RFC could reload PCNA quickly from solution. Therefore, it seems to be a very critical question, how the concentration of PCNA affects the size of the products. If PCNA behaves as a processive factor, RFC should be required only for the initiation step to load PCNA. On the other hand, if PCNA behaves as a distributive factor, then RFC would have to be traveling with growing 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl ends as a processive factor for loading PCNA anytime during elongation.</p><p>Thus, we subsequently examined effects of varying PCNA concentrations on the product size distribution. When the concentrations of PCNA were low, sizes of the products became slightly decreased and smears &#x0003c;2 kb appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E, lanes 2&#x02013;4). However, large products (4&#x02013;5 kb) were also detected, even at the lowest concentration of PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E, lane 2). In these assays, full-size products are excessively represented by their greater incorporation of radioactive nucleotides. To avoid this problem, we used a 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled primer. Note that the size distribution of the products in the PCNA titration, different from that in RFC titration, was more clearly visualized with a 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled primer than with incorporation of [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]dTMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F and G). The results revealed that the concentration of PCNA did not affect the initiation step, because the amount of utilized primer was not appreciably decreased with lower concentrations of PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>G). On the other hand, the initiation was limited at a low concentration of RFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F), suggesting inefficient turnover of RFC. We consider that after dissociation of pol &#x003b4; from the growing 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl end, some PCNA does not remain at the primer terminus, rather sliding out or being unloaded by RFC. In both cases, another PCNA might be reloaded from solution. Therefore, the results suggested that PCNA is partially distributive in our assay system, and also suggested that the processive nature of RFC is due to a stable association at the primer terminus during elongation of DNA replication. These issues were addressed intensively in subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA replication on linearized ss mp18 DNA</title><p>For further analysis of PCNA and RFC actions during elongation, we examined the effects of linearization of mp18 DNA after initiation of DNA replication by introduction of a restriction enzyme, HincII, into reaction mixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). A unique cutting site of HincII in the template DNA is located 29-bases downstream from the 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl end of the primer. Soon after initiation of DNA replication, the region should be converted to double-stranded DNA and become cleavable by HincII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). In standard reaction mixtures, we introduced 10 U of HincII that can digest more than 98% of double-stranded mp18 DNA, for 15 s. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, the sizes of all the products became uniformly much shorter in the presence of HincII and incorporation of dNMP was decreased by half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), probably due to a defect in elongation, rather than initiation, because the average size of products was also reduced by almost a half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). We considered that the decreased efficiency of DNA synthesis was probably the consequence of dissociation of PCNA, suggesting that some PCNA once assembled into the elongation complex might not remain at primer termini during elongation, and with a circular template, the majority of detached PCNA slides back to be reutilized. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Effects of linearization of newly synthesized DNA just after initiation of DNA replication.

This implies that DNA synthesis can be resumed again after PCNA is once dissociated from the primer termini. If this were indeed the case, the size of the products should increase in a time-dependent manner. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C indicate that incorporation increased and the products became longer depending on the incubation time, but with a slower rate, suggesting reloading of PCNA from solution. Because pausing likely promotes the dissociation of pol &#x003b4; from PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), some PCNA also would be released from the primer termini at pausing sites. As expected these became more prominent, resulting in a more heterogeneous size distribution of products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C).</p><p>Then, we further tested whether the concentration of RFC could affect the size of products in the presence of HincII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). Again, only the amount, but not the size distribution, was affected, although increase of the size at higher concentrations of RFC was observed, as in the reaction without HincII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). In contrast, the concentration of PCNA partially affected the size distribution of products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E). The difference between RFC and PCNA titration was not clear by visualization with incorporation of the radioactive nucleotides. However, the 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled primer, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F and G, was unavailable because of the restriction cutting. To solve the problem, newly synthesized strands were visualized, instead, by Southern hybridization with an oligonucleotide annealed to the newly synthesized strand just downstream of the HincII site. Results confirmed the difference in size distributions of the products between in the PCNA titration and RFC titration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>F and G). Since some PCNA slides out of the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) and is reloaded from solution many times by RFC to continue DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C), the size of the products would depend on the concentration of RFC, if this acted distributively. Therefore, our results again suggested that RFC acts processively, binding in the initiation of DNA replication and traveling with pol &#x003b4;.</p></sec><sec><title>Inefficient elongation by spontaneous loading of PCNA from template DNA ends</title><p>It is known that PCNA is spontaneously loaded from a double-stranded end of template DNA in an RFC-independent manner, and supports elongation with pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Therefore, the restart reactions after dissociation of PCNA observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C could be due to spontaneous loading of PCNA at the ends. To determine the efficiency of RFC-independent restart, ss mp18 DNA was linearized first, then subjected to reactions in the absence of RFC. In this assay, a primer covering HincII site was annealed to ss mp18 DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). HincII was introduced in standard reaction mixtures, and then the reactions were started by addition of pol &#x003b4; after pre-incubation for 1 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). The time course of the reaction revealed the extension rate to be much slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B) than that of RFC-dependent reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C) and the primer ends were hardly extended beyond the pausing site around 4 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Next, we examined effects of varying PCNA concentrations on the size distribution of the products. The results demonstrated that the length of the products is uniformly short at a low concentration of PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C), suggesting that PCNA once assembled with pol &#x003b4; is not stable during elongation. These results revealed differences between RFC-dependent and -independent reactions, indicating a requirement of RFC for efficient restart after dissociation of PCNA on linearized DNA. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Effect of PCNA loaded spontaneously at ends of template DNA.

At 15 s after the initiation complex was presumably assembled, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was diluted 10-fold either into a pre-warmed reaction mixture containing all the auxiliary proteins and pol &#x003b4;, or into a similar one omitting one or two of PCNA, RFC and pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Then, reactions were continued for further 10 min, and the products were analyzed by alkaline-agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Dilution of either PCNA or pol &#x003b4; resulted in a decrease in the size of the products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, lanes 2 and 4) as compared to the complete case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 1). This effect was more pronounced when both PCNA and pol &#x003b4; were diluted together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 7); virtually no products were detected. On the other hand, dilution of RFC exerted no influence (compare lanes 1 and 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Furthermore, when both PCNA and RFC were diluted together, the size distribution of products was almost identical to that with dilution of PCNA alone (compare lanes 2 and 5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). These results indicated that PCNA and pol &#x003b4; are supplied from solution, whereas RFC is not, during the elongation. Furthermore, we noted that when both RFC and pol &#x003b4; were diluted together, the product size was decreased to a much greater extent than with dilution of pol &#x003b4; alone (compare lanes 4 and 6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). This suggested that when reassociation of pol &#x003b4; is limited, RFC is needed from solution.

In contrast, the size of products varied with the concentration of PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E), in line with a requirement for a continuous supply of PCNA from solution for efficient DNA synthesis. Notably, with low concentrations of PCNA, all the products were uniformly small in reactions with pol &#x003b4;*, exhibiting an entirely distributive nature. Furthermore, we tested the effect of linearization on mp18 DNA after initiation of DNA replication by addition of HincII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>F). DNA synthesis with pol &#x003b4;* was very sensitive to linearization of DNA, and increasing concentrations of PCNA slightly restored the defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>F). However, the majority of intermediates on elongation could not overcome the first pausing site (around 0.6&#x02013;1 kb), even at the highest concentration of PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>F). These results suggested frequent dissociation of PCNA during elongation with pol &#x003b4;*.</p></sec><sec><title>Amounts of PCNA loaded on mp18 DNA during elongation</title><p>Since an excess PCNA was required for efficient DNA synthesis with pol &#x003b4;* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E), we considered whether PCNA might accumulate on DNA during elongation. If so, the frequency of sliding back to the primer terminus would increase and an increase in the local concentration of PCNA would help interactions with pol &#x003b4;* at the primer terminus. To measure the amount of PCNA loaded on DNA directly, a primer containing an extended 5&#x02032; tail with one biotin molecule was annealed to ss mp18 DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). The primed ss mp18 DNA was then attached to magnetic beads and DNA replication reactions were carried out under standard reaction conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). The 5&#x02032; tail did not exert any influence on DNA synthesis (data not shown). In the reactions, 33 ng of pol &#x003b4; and 140 ng of pol &#x003b4;* were used since these amounts lead to equivalent efficiency of DNA synthesis (&#x0223c;40 pmol of the incorporation of dNMP) and to the same size distribution of products (compare lane 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C with lane 7 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). After reactions for 10 min, PCNA bound to beads was detected by western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). In this assay, non-specific association of PCNA with beads or DNA was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, lane 2). When RFC was introduced into the reaction, an increase of binding of PCNA was observed. The increased amount of PCNA (difference between lanes 2 and 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B) was 40 fmol, which was equivalent to that of primer template (33 fmol), suggesting specific loading to the primer terminus. Introduction of pol &#x003b4; increased the amount of PCNA only slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, lane 4). The majority of PCNA was dissociated by introduction of HincII with a decreasing signal to background level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, lane 5), again indicating specific loading on the DNA. When pol &#x003b4;* was used instead of pol &#x003b4;, excessive accumulation of PCNA was unexpectedly not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, lane 6), suggesting that we cannot attribute the entire distributive nature of PCNA on the reaction with pol &#x003b4;* to only the decreasing affinity between PCNA and pol &#x003b4;*. We therefore considered the possibility that loading and unloading of PCNA is equilibrated in both pol &#x003b4; and pol &#x003b4;* cases, and importantly, could be accelerated in the reaction with pol &#x003b4;*. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Amounts of PCNA loaded on DNA during elongation.

The studies documented here showed very different dynamics of the various protein factors in the elongation phase of DNA replication.</p><p>DNA synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic> by pol &#x003b4; has been investigated extensively. Previous studies have shown that pol &#x003b4; itself is a very distributive enzyme, which turns into a processive polymerase when bound to the clamp, PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>).

Our results support the conclusion that human pol &#x003b4; has a distributive nature for DNA replication in our model system <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>The length of products synthesized by pol &#x003b4; does not depend on the concentration of RFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The processive nature of RFC might be explained in two alternative ways. One is that the sole role is loading of PCNA at only the initiation step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Some biochemical data for yeast and human RFC support this possibility, because RFC has been found to dissociate from DNA after loading PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). The other explanation is that once RFC finds a 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl end and loads PCNA, it then travels with PCNA and pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In earlier work with yeast RFC, formation of tertiary complexes on DNA was also suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Later, Yuzhakov and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) also reported that human RFC travels with pol &#x003b4;, and a similar complex has been isolated from the elongation phase of SV40 replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Our observations also provide support for continuous binding of RFC.</p><p>Because PCNA is a sliding clamp, it should be able to freely slide along double-stranded DNA and fall off at the ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). However, the fate of PCNA in the elongation phase of DNA replication is currently obscure. We here obtained evidence that some PCNA does not remain at the primer terminus after dissociation of pol &#x003b4;. However, in titration experiments of PCNA, the longer products (around 4 kb) still remained even at low concentrations of PCNA, independent of the presence or absence of HincII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>E and G, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>E and G), indicating that significant fractions of the intermediates of elongation phase could continue DNA synthesis without supply of PCNA from solution. In such fractions, PCNA must remain at the primer terminus even after dissociation of pol &#x003b4;. The observations support the conclusion that PCNA has a partially distributive nature in our DNA replication system with RFC <italic>in vitro</italic>. On the other hand, PCNA was entirely distributive in the RFC-independent reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Taken the results together, we suggest the possibility that RFC could hold PCNA from which pol &#x003b4; has detached.</p><p>We here propose a model for dynamics of replication factors during a dissociation&#x02013;association cycle of pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). The elongation complex consists of RFC, PCNA and pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, stage I). Pol &#x003b4; dissociates frequently from growing 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl ends and PCNA during elongation of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, pathway 1). Then, PCNA from which pol &#x003b4; has detached would be held by the remaining RFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, stage II). If pol &#x003b4; reassociated quickly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, pathway 2), RFC could remain around the primer terminus, and travel with pol &#x003b4; and PCNA during elongation of DNA replication. In this cycle, PCNA is not released out of the replication complex, which implies &#x02018;recycling PCNA&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Since the DNA&#x02013;RFC&#x02013;PCNA complex (stage II) is not stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), the RFC could unload PCNA, or release the PCNA out of the primer terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, pathway 3). Probably, the unloading reaction does not predominate, as shown in yeast RFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). If PCNA were available from solution or along the DNA, RFC could incorporate PCNA into the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, pathway 4). Otherwise, RFC would dissociate from the primer terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, pathway 5). At higher concentrations greater than saturated amounts of RFC, the size of products was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>D and F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D and F). Probably, with such concentrations, RFC is sufficient for initiation and remaining RFC in solution could help to overcome the pausing site, implying dissociation of RFC at strong pausing sites. However, this was negligible under normal replication conditions, and was detectable in reactions omitting pol &#x003b4;, as shown in lane 6 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B. This suggested that pol &#x003b4; prevents dissociation of RFC. In intensive studies of PCNA-loading reactions with yeast RFC, no stable RFC&#x02013;DNA complex was detected in the absence of PCNA and only became detectable in the presence of ATP&#x003b3;S, and RFC dissociated quickly from DNA after loading PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Therefore, it has been considered that RFC is absent in elongation complexes. Our results may explain the discrepancy regarding the prevention of dissociation of RFC by sequential loading of PCNA (pathway 4) and pol &#x003b4; (pathway 2) in the replication assay, but not PCNA loading assays. Therefore, we consider that our model is consistent with the previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Gomes <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) has also proposed a loading pathway, in which PCNA&#x02013;RFC complex first forms an ATP-dependent ring-opened complex and subsequently associates with DNA and delivers PCNA to the template&#x02013;primer junction. RFC associated with the DNA cannot recruit PCNA nor load it at termini, first having to dissociate coupled with ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Our model is consistent with the loading mechanism. RFC is probably detached from the primer terminus before loading PCNA, but associated around primer terminus via interaction with RPA (stage III) as proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>A model for dynamics of replication factors during pol &#x003b4; dissociation&#x02013;association cycles. The elongation complex consists of RFC, PCNA and pol &#x003b4; in the elongation phase of DNA replication (Stage I). Pol &#x003b4; contacts with PCNA and prevents RFC from dissociating. Contribution of RFC&#x02013;RPA interaction for stable association in the complex has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Pathway 1, dissociation of pol &#x003b4; leaving RFC and PCNA on DNA (Stage II). DNA&#x02013;RFC&#x02013;PCNA complex formation could be coupled with dissociation of pol &#x003b4;, mediated by the POLD3 subunit. Pathway 2, reassociation of pol &#x003b4; to form the elongation complex. The POLD3 subunit of pol &#x003b4; might mediate efficient transfer of PCNA from RFC to pol &#x003b4;. Pathway 3, unloading or sliding of PCNA out of the primer terminus, leaving RFC (Stage III). RFC probably interacts with RPA for retaining around primer terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Pathway 4, reloading of PCNA from solution or PCNA sliding back along the DNA to reform the DNA&#x02013;RFC&#x02013;PCNA complex. Pathway 5, dissociation of RFC from DNA (Stage IV). The main pathways are shown as thick arrows.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm822f8"/></fig></p><p>Here, we further examined the dynamics of protein factors in the reaction with pol &#x003b4;* to elucidate functions of the POLD3 subunit. This, together with its budding and fission yeast counterparts, Pol32 and Cdc27, respectively, has a PCNA-binding domain that is responsible for processive DNA synthesis on M13 ss DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54 B55 B56 B57">54&#x02013;57</xref>). We demonstrated that the size of products varies depending on the concentration of PCNA exhibiting an entirely distributive nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). If PCNA were accumulated on the DNA reflecting an increase amount in solution, the requirement of large excess of PCNA in solution could be simply due to decreasing affinity between pol &#x003b4;* and PCNA. We failed to demonstrate excessive accumulation of PCNA on the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Rather, the concentration of PCNA in solution little affected that on DNA. Therefore, it is impossible to attribute the entire distributive nature of PCNA on the reaction with pol &#x003b4;* to simply a decreasing affinity between PCNA and pol &#x003b4;*. We consider that the defect with pol &#x003b4;* could be due to not only decreased affinity to PCNA, but also failure in recycling of PCNA after dissociation. In the reactions with pol &#x003b4;, significant fractions of intermediates in the elongation stage could continue DNA synthesis without supply of PCNA from solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E), indicating efficient recycling of PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, pathways 1 and 2). In contrast, such a fraction was not detected in reactions with pol &#x003b4;* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E), presumably due to predominant loss of PCNA from the primer terminus. This could be a consequence of unloading of PCNA by RFC, since excessive accumulation of PCNA was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B) under conditions whereby excess loading of PCNA from solution was expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). Yeast studies have predicted a second function of subunits enhancing processivity of pol &#x003b4; in a manner independent of the PCNA-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). We propose that the previously unknown function of POLD3 subunit is stimulation of recycling of PCNA in the dissociation&#x02013;association cycle with pol &#x003b4;.</p><p>It has been shown that RFC binds non-specifically to DNA with a potential for loading PCNA on the double-stranded DNA, independent of the primer ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Is the processivity of RFC observed in this work only apparent and due to non-specific loading of PCNA? If PCNA molecules were loaded anywhere on the double-stranded DNA and accumulated on the DNA, it could explain that size of the products of DNA synthesis depends on the concentration of PCNA, especially in reactions with pol &#x003b4;* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). However, we failed to detect excessive accumulation of PCNA on the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Furthermore, spontaneously loaded PCNA from the end of DNA did not well support elongation, even an excessive amount of PCNA was present in the RFC-independent reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that loading of PCNA at primer terminus is crucial for the efficiency. We speculate that PCNA loaded non-specifically on the DNA is probably ineffective, just like spontaneously loaded PCNA. Although we could not exclude the possibility of contribution of non-specific loading of PCNA to the apparent processivity of RFC, it is probably not predominant in our reaction conditions.</p><p>PCNA functions as a platform not only for elongation but also for Okazaki fragment processing through interaction with protein factors, FEN1 and DNA ligase I. Recently, the Kunkel laboratory has provided evidence that pol &#x003b5; is active in DNA synthesis on the leading strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>), suggesting the pol &#x003b4; is active on the lagging strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). Consistent with this, stable association of RFC in elongation complexes with pol &#x003b4; for efficient utilization of PCNA could thus be of benefit to maturation of Okazaki fragments. Consistently, physical interactions between RFC and DNA ligase I have been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>), implying a functional significance of stable association of RFC in elongation complexes on the lagging strand.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm822_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm822_nar-01547-m-2007-File010.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Dr Marc S.
