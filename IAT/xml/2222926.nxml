A gene expression oscillator, the somite segmentation clock, operating in this tail region, marks out a periodic spatial pattern and so controls the segmentation process. Evidence from mutants shows that the Notch cell-cell signalling pathway has a critical role in the clock mechanism. However, when we switch on a blockade of Notch signalling, by immersing zebrafish embryos in the chemical inhibitor DAPT, the next &#x0223c;12 somites form normally, and only after that do disrupted somites appear. We show that this is because Notch signalling is needed only to maintain synchrony between the clocks of individual cells. The cells take about seven cycles to drift out of synchrony when Notch-mediated communication is blocked, and then a further five cycles to pass from the site where the tissue receives its &#x0201c;time-stamp&#x0201d; to the site where overt segmentation begins. By mathematical modelling, backed up with measurements on transgenic embryos, we show how Notch signalling may act at a molecular level to synchronise the intracellular oscillators of adjacent individual cells.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000d6;zbudak EM, Lewis J (2008) Notch signalling synchronizes the zebrafish segmentation clock but is not needed to create somite boundaries.

But how do they cause this effect? What specific part does Notch signalling play in creating the regular somite pattern?</p><p>At least three different answers have been suggested. All of them start from the observation that the spatially periodic pattern of somites and intersomitic clefts is laid down sequentially through a temporally periodic clock-like process operating at the tail end of the embryo, in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). Cells in the PSM show oscillating expression of several genes, with neighbouring cells oscillating in synchrony.

As a result of the proliferation, there is a continual overflow of cells from the anterior end of the PSM; here, the emerging cells cease oscillating and rearrange their contacts to form visible somites. The segmentation clock runs at its full speed in the cells in the posterior part of the PSM, and this dictates the periodicity of the whole process of somite formation: the set of cells emerging from the PSM in the course of one such clock cycle constitute precisely one somite.</p><p>As successive groups of PSM cells pass from the posterior into the anterior part of the PSM, their oscillations slow down in preparation for exit from the PSM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;; at the same time, the cells switch on expression of additional genes which, in a manner not yet fully understood, create the final segmentation pattern that becomes manifest as the cells at last emerge from the PSM and halt their oscillations (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;). These additional genes operating in the anterior part of the PSM in effect read the phase of oscillation of each cohort of cells as they enter the anterior PSM and stamp the successive cohorts with different final characters according to their clock phase at the time of entry into that region &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;.

We shall call this the <italic>oscillation-generator hypothesis</italic>.</p><p>Notch pathway mutations also disrupt the pattern of expression of the read-out genes in the anterior PSM. Hence, another suggestion is that Notch signalling has an additional role at a later stage, while cells are in the anterior part of the PSM, where it could be required to create the sharp boundaries of gene expression that demarcate each new somite &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b037">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, just as it is required in the insect wing disk to create the sharp boundary between dorsal and ventral compartments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. We shall call this the <italic>boundary-formation hypothesis</italic>.</p><p>Lastly, Notch pathway mutations lead to a loss of coordination between neighbouring cells in the PSM, so that the tissue appears as a pepper-and-salt mixture of cells expressing the oscillator genes at different levels. This has led to a third hypothesis: that cell&#x02013;cell communication via the Notch pathway is required to keep the oscillations of neighbouring cells synchronized &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. We shall call this the <italic>synchronization hypothesis</italic>.</p><p>These three hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and in principle they could all be true. Indeed, persuasive evidence has been adduced in favour of each of them, although this evidence comes from observations in different vertebrate species in the different cases. In the chick, blocking Notch signalling with the &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor DAPT, for example, leads to a failure of oscillation of the clock gene <italic>Lfng</italic>, or at least a drastic reduction of its amplitude &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, favouring the oscillation-generator hypothesis. In the mouse, sharp boundaries in the level of activation of Notch foreshadow the formation of intersomitic clefts, favouring the boundary-formation hypothesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b041">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. And in zebrafish, the pepper-and-salt pattern of expression of the clock gene <italic>deltaC</italic> in Notch pathway mutants supports the synchronization hypothesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. This last hypothesis also fits the curious observation that mutations in Notch pathway components, while disrupting the segmentation of posterior somites, generally allow the first four to eight somites to develop normally &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;: if PSM cells in a mutant all start their oscillations in synchrony when the PSM is first established during gastrulation, but then take four to eight oscillator cycles to drift out of synchrony, such a result is expected &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Recent papers on zebrafish somitogenesis have added to the evidence for the synchronization hypothesis. Thus Horikawa et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d; have used genetic mosaics to show that the oscillations of neighbouring cells in the PSM are coupled via the Notch pathway, and have also demonstrated that blocking Notch signalling with the inhibitor DAPT leads to loss of synchrony. Giudicelli et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d; have tested the predictions of a mathematical model of the proposed synchronization mechanism &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d; and have shown that the measured delays in the pathway are consistent with the model. Mara et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;, on the basis of a complex set of experiments with mutants and inhibitors, have argued that signalling via the Notch ligand DeltaC serves to synchronize oscillations in the PSM. Most recently, Riedel-Kruse et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d; (in a study published after the present paper was submitted) have studied the effects of inhibiting Notch signalling to varying degrees, starting before the onset of somite segmentation, and have presented a mathematical model illustrating how the resulting variation in the level of onset of somite defects can be explained on the basis of the synchronization hypothesis. These recent papers, however, while supporting the synchronization hypothesis, still do not put forward arguments to exclude the oscillation-generator hypothesis or the boundary-formation hypothesis.</p><p>Are all three ideas then correct and true of somite development for vertebrates in general? In this paper, we argue that the answer is no: in the zebrafish, at least, Notch signalling is required for one and only one function in somite segmentation&#x02014;to keep the oscillations of neighbouring PSM cells synchronized. A simple mathematical model of the segmentation clock mechanism explains how Notch signalling can exert its synchronizing influence. Using a reporter transgene, we measure the influence of Notch signalling on the mean level of clock gene expression; the effect is relatively small&#x02014;about 25&#x00025;&#x02014;but of just the magnitude predicted by the model.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Previous attempts to define the role of Notch signalling in somite patterning have mostly relied on analysis of mutants, morphants and embryos in which specific genes have been overexpressed from the beginning of development. The final outcome then reflects the cumulative effect of the genetic disturbance and does not tell us whether a gene has acted early, or late, or both early and late in the history of a given somite &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In this paper we take a different approach, focusing on the zebrafish and blocking or overactivating the Notch signalling pathway abruptly part-way through the process of somitogenesis. To block, we use the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. To overactivate, we use heat shock in transgenic embryos to drive expression of NICD, the activated form of Notch &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>If Notch signalling is required in the anterior part of the PSM, the effect on somite segmentation in either case should be more or less immediate, because the next somite to form consists of cells exiting from the anterior PSM. If Notch signalling is required only in the posterior part of the PSM, but is needed there to keep individual cells oscillating with adequate amplitude, the effect should be somewhat delayed, because cells leaving the posterior part of the PSM take five somite cycle times to traverse the anterior PSM before they form somites, and in this period disturbances of their <italic>her1</italic>/<italic>her7</italic> oscillations have no effect on their subsequent somitogenesis behaviour &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Lastly, if Notch signalling is needed only to maintain synchrony in the posterior PSM, the effect on somite formation should be seen only after a much longer delay, corresponding to the sum of the time taken for loss of synchrony in the posterior PSM and the time then taken by the desynchronized cells to traverse the anterior PSM. The time for desynchronization should be predictable from the number of somites that form normally in Notch pathway mutants or in embryos where Notch signalling has been blocked ab initio, if the formation of the first few somites is controlled in the same way as that of the subsequent ones.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>DAPT Treatment Results in Somite Defects with a Long Delay</title><p>To block Notch signalling in a temporally controlled manner, we immersed zebrafish embryos at somitogenesis stages in a DAPT solution &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;.

In all these DAPT pulse experiments, all of the embryos recovered normal segmentation posterior to the defect. Continuous exposure to the same dosage starting at the same time gave somite defects starting at 8.7 &#x000b1; 1.3 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 24) somites, but without recovery. Evidently, when the duration of DAPT treatment is as short as one hour, the eventual loss of synchrony is often too slight to tip the tissue over the threshold for gross disruption of segmentation. The stochastic nature of the process means that one side of the embryo may be disrupted while the other is not; but in cases where such disruption is seen, even if only on one side of the embryo, the delay before onset of disruption is very nearly the same as when DAPT treatment is continuous. We conclude that the time of onset of somite disturbances is primarily a function of the time of onset of the DAPT blockade, and not of DAPT dosage or duration.</p><p>These findings all concur in showing, first of all, that Notch signalling is not required for the clock read-out process occurring in the anterior half of the PSM; for if it were required there, we should have seen somite segmentation defects within a few cycles after the onset of the Notch blockade. It seems that the boundary-formation hypothesis cannot be true for the zebrafish.</p><p>We can go further, and use these observations to judge the other two hypotheses. Our previous study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d; showed that disruption of oscillatory expression of the clock genes <italic>her1</italic>, <italic>her7</italic>, and <italic>deltaC</italic> during somitogenesis stages results in boundary defects with a delay of 5 somites, implying that the cells in the anterior half of the PSM are immune to the disruption of the segmentation clock, and that the segmentation pattern reflects the level at which the clock genes were expressed at the moment when the future somite cells were passing from the posterior into the anterior PSM region, 5 clock cycles before they segment overtly. From the delay we see following DAPT treatment, therefore, we can infer that the pattern of clock gene expression in the posterior PSM was not effectively disrupted until long after the beginning of DAPT treatment: for treatment beginning at the 5-somite stage, not until 13.4 &#x000b1; 1.1 &#x02212; 5, i.e., 8.4 &#x000b1; 1.1, clock cycles had elapsed; for treatment beginning at the 9-somite stage, not until 12.8 &#x000b1; 1.9 &#x02212; 5, i.e., 7.8 &#x000b1; 1.9, clock cycles had elapsed. From these delays, we should subtract the short period&#x02014;2 clock cycles at most&#x02014;required for DAPT to diffuse into the tissue and accomplish the block of Notch signalling. Thus we can say that, regardless of whether the DAPT treament begins at the 5-somite stage or the 9-somite stage, approximately 6 to 8 somite cycles must elapse from the time when the blockade of Notch signalling begins to the time when the pattern of clock gene expression is effectively disrupted.</p><p>For treatment beginning at 3hpf, 7 hours before the onset of somitogenesis, the calculation is slightly different. If we assume that the first somite is formed from cells in which the clock was set going synchronously by some shared developmental cue for the initiation of somitogenesis, we can infer that the critical oscillations were not significantly disrupted by the presence of Notch blockade until 7.3 &#x000b1; 1.3 cycles after this initiating cue.</p><p>All these observations point to the same conclusion: Notch signalling cannot be directly required for genesis of the clock oscillations, since these evidently continue for 6 to 8 cycles after the onset of the blockade. For the zebrafish at least, the oscillation-generator hypothesis seems to be excluded.</p><p>All the observations are, however, perfectly consistent with the synchronization hypothesis, if we assume that the cells in the posterior PSM continue oscillating when Notch signalling is blocked, but drift out of synchrony over the course of 6 to 8 cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040015-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-0040015-g003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Cartoon to Show Why Somite Boundary Defects Appear only After a Long Delay Following Blockade of Notch Signaling</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0040015.g003"/></fig><p>To check this interpretation, we looked at the pattern of <italic>her1</italic> expression.

But how can Notch signalling do this? In a previous paper &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, we proposed a mathematical model that offered an answer. According to this model, the closely linked <italic>her1</italic> and/or <italic>her7</italic> genes are the pacemakers of a clock that operates in each PSM cell individually: their expression oscillates as a result of a delayed negative feedback loop, in which the Her1/7 protein products act back on the <italic>her1/7</italic> promoter to inhibit transcription. The oscillating levels of these proteins also drive oscillating expression of the Notch ligand DeltaC, and thereby activate Notch cyclically in the neighbouring cells. And activated Notch&#x02014;that is, NICD&#x02014;somehow combines with Her1/7 protein so as to modulate <italic>her1/7</italic> transcription in each cell and thereby entrain neighbours to the same rhythm.</p><p>Recent quantitative experiments have supported this mathematical model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. In computing the behaviour of the model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, however, there was one detail where we made an assumption that is clearly wrong in the light of our present data. Although we allowed for different forms of combinatorial regulation of <italic>her1</italic>/<italic>7</italic> by Her1/7 in conjunction with NICD, we showed computations for the case where we assumed arbitrarily that the main regulation was multiplicative (i.e., described by multiplying an inhibitory term representing the effect of Her1/7 by a stimulatory term representing the effect of NICD). The assumption implied a zero level of expression of <italic>her1/7</italic> in the absence of Notch signalling, and the DAPT data show that this is wrong.</p><p>We have therefore reconsidered how NICD and Her1/7 might jointly regulate <italic>her1/7</italic> transcription. One highly plausible possibility is that NICD and Her1/7 compete in some way to bind to the regulatory DNA of <italic>her1/7</italic>, as documented for some other gene regulatory proteins at other loci (e.g., &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;). For example, NICD and Her1/7 might bind at separate enhancers in the <italic>her1/7</italic> regulatory DNA, and these enhancers might then compete for binding at the promoter site (through DNA looping &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;). In this way, Her1/7 would inhibit <italic>her1/7</italic> transcription, but the presence of NICD would prevent it from doing so. A similar effect will be obtained if NICD and Her1/7 compete directly for binding to a regulatory site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040015-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We have recomputed the behaviour of the model on the assumption of competitive regulation, with the rule that when NICD is bound to the regulatory DNA, or neither NICD nor Her1/7 is bound, transcription is permitted; but when Her1/7 is bound, transcription is blocked. For simplicity, we assume that NICD and Her1/7 compete directly for a binding site. With this small correction of the original model (spelled out in detail in the Text S1), we reproduce all the essential properties described originally, plus the behaviours observed in the present work, including oscillations that are synchronized in the presence of normal Notch signalling but continue unsynchronized (though with reduced amplitude) when Notch signalling is either blocked or constitutive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040015-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-0040015-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>A Model of <italic>her1/7</italic> Gene Regulation by NICD and Her1/7 Protein, and the Predictions That It Makes</title><p>The left column explains the basic hypothesis: NICD and Her1/7 protein compete to bind to a regulatory site of the <italic>her1/7</italic> gene.

In both cases, the cells would be unable to use variations in clock-driven Notch signalling to display their clock cycle phase to their neighbours, and so would be unable to coordinate their clocks. Our mathematical model indeed shows this behaviour: when a steady level of &#x0201c;exogenous&#x0201d; Notch pathway activation is superimposed on the normal system, synchronization fails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040015-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The model also makes two other, less obvious, predictions, however. First, with moderately high levels of overexpression of NICD, the loss of synchrony goes with a <italic>reduction</italic> in the peak levels of <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> expression. Second, when NICD is very strongly overexpressed, the oscillations become damped and the system tends toward a state of uniform moderately high expression of <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic>.

As with DAPT, however, somite boundary defects were seen only after a much longer delay: a 30-minute heat shock at 10 hpf (the 0-somite stage), for example, generated boundary defects only after a delay of 15.7 &#x000b1; 1.8 (mean &#x000b1; SD, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10) somites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040015-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Allowing for the delay required for production of NICD, this result is very similar to the one obtained with DAPT treatment. In batches of embryos heat-shocked at later (3- to 5-somite) stages, the delay before onset of visible defects was again long, but not so long, with defects becoming visible after 10 to 11 further somites had formed. (We do not know why the delay varies with the stage at the time of heat shock; one possibility is that there are variations in heat-shock efficacy, leading to differences in the induced level of NICD.) These findings are consistent with the predictions of our model for moderate to high overexpression of NICD (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040015-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, ISH analysis of the patterns of expression of <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> shows that the appearance of somite boundary defects is preceded by a disruption of the synchronized expression of these genes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040015-g004">Figure 4</xref>), which tend toward an expression level that is uniform and lower than the peak seen in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040015-g007">Figure 7</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040015-g007">7</xref>E&#x02032;), as the model predicts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040015-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

We have found that blocking Notch signalling part way through somitogenesis disrupts the pattern of somite boundaries only after a delay, in the same way that a lack of Notch signalling from the very beginning of somitogenesis still allows the first few somites to form. The long delay before somite defects appear shows that Notch signalling plays no significant part in patterning of the prospective somite boundaries while the cells are in the anterior part of the PSM: its time of action must be earlier in the history of each somite, while the future somite cells are still in the posterior part of the PSM.

For example, they differ in their dependence on <italic>her1</italic> as opposed to <italic>her7</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, and the most anterior somite boundaries are particularly susceptible to disruption by loss of the <italic>integrinalpha5</italic> (<italic>before eight</italic>) gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;; cells destined to form anterior rather than posterior somites also express different members of the <italic>tbx</italic> gene family &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. But this does not mean that the role of Notch signalling is different.</p><p>Our observations do not address the question of how oscillations start, at the point where PSM cells originate, although it has been suggested that Notch signalling may have a special role in this initiation process &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. But the finding that the initial oscillations occur normally &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d; and the first few somites form normally even when Notch signalling is blocked ab initio argues against the idea that Notch signalling is required for this initial step.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Fish and Amniotes May Differ</title><p>We should emphasize that our findings relate only to the zebrafish.

It is possible that our DAPT treatment did not block all Notch signalling absolutely, and that residual levels of Notch signalling were sufficient for function in the anterior PSM. Conversely, it is possible that our <italic>hsp70:Gal4VP16</italic>;<italic>UAS:myc-notch1aICD</italic> technique, by driving production of NICD to unphysiologically high levels, could have given a misleading impression as to the normal role of NICD. The concordance of our results from these two very different techniques, however, as well as the evidence from mutants and morphants, amounts to strong evidence that Notch signalling in zebrafish somitogenesis is responsible for synchronization of the cell oscillators and little else.</p><p>A further caveat is that our experiments only test the role of canonical Notch signalling&#x02014;that is, Notch signalling that depends on &#x003b3;-secretase and the production of NICD. In the fly wing disc, it has been suggested that Notch might play a part in boundary formation through a direct interaction with the actin cytoskeleton, independent of any activation of Notch by &#x003b3;-secretase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;. Our data do not exclude such a possibility in the context of somitogenesis, although it seems unlikely, given that mutations in <italic>notch1a</italic> (<italic>deadly seven</italic> mutations) cause practically the same disturbances of somite segmentation as does treatment with DAPT &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>The Oscillatory Behaviour of Individual Desynchronized Cells Remains To Be Analysed</title><p>One key aspect of our theory of the segmentation clock mechanism remains to be tested directly: we have not proved that individual cells continue to oscillate, rather than simply fluctuate randomly, in the absence of Notch signalling. Moreover, we have not established whether single cells continue to oscillate indefinitely in these conditions, or whether their oscillations are at first desynchronized and then eventually damped out. In the mouse, a luciferase reporter has been used to demonstrate the oscillations of individual cells in the PSM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040015-b062">62</xref>&#x0005d;; but in the zebrafish, with its much more rapid segmentation clock cycles, this feat has not yet been achieved. A conclusive analysis of dynamical phenomena such as the behaviour of the somite segmentation clock will require both time-resolved perturbations such as we have used in this paper, and real-time reporters that provide an accurate picture of the dynamics of gene expression in individual cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fish stocks.</title><p>Fish were kept on a regular light-dark cycle at 28 &#x000b0;C.

Embryos, with chorions torn but not completely removed, were transferred into the diluted DAPT or control medium containing the same concentration of DMSO. Embryos were incubated in this at 28 &#x000b0;C until the time of fixation. They were then fixed immediately in ice-cold buffered 4&#x00025; formaldehyde for ISH. The position of boundary defects in each embryo was determined by averaging the positions of defects on the left and right sides of that embryo. This average number was then used to calculate the population average for the onset of boundary defects. In scoring the positions of defects, we had to take account of the fact that loss of synchrony, and the corresponding disruption of somite segmentation, are not instantaneous all-or-none events. There was, however, a relatively abrupt threshold effect, such that posterior to a certain level (definable with an accuracy of about one somite width), segmentation became grossly disordered, in the sense that the somite boundaries posterior to this level, as marked by <italic>titin</italic> expression, appeared fragmented and randomly positioned. We took this as our criterion for the onset of a segmentation defect. In some cases, as would be expected, slight alterations in the shaping of somite boundaries preceded the onset of the gross disruption.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>In situ hybridization.</title><p>In situ hybridization was performed according to standard protocols.
