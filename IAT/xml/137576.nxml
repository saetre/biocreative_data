Here we describe an attempt to generate a transgenic mouse model for choroideremia (CHM), a slow-onset X-linked retinal degeneration caused by mutations in the Rab Escort Protein-1 (REP1) gene. REP1 is part of the Rab geranylgeranylation machinery, a modification that is essential for Rab function in membrane traffic. The loss of REP1 in CHM patients may trigger retinal degeneration through its effects on Rab proteins. We have previously reported that Rab27a is the Rab most affected in CHM lymphoblasts and hypothesised that the selective dysfunction of Rab27a (and possibly a few other Rab GTPases) plays an essential role in the retinal degenerative process.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To investigate this hypothesis, we generated several lines of dominant-negative, constitutively-active and wild-type Rab27a (and Rab27b) transgenic mice whose expression was driven either by the pigment cell-specific tyrosinase promoter or the ubiquitous &#x003b2;-actin promoter. High levels of mRNA and protein were observed in transgenic lines expressing wild-type or constitutively active Rab27a and Rab27b. However, only modest levels of transgenic protein were expressed. Pulse-chase experiments suggest that the dominant-negative proteins, but not the constitutively-active or wild type proteins, are rapidly degraded. Consistently, no significant phenotype was observed in our transgenic lines. Coat-colour was normal, indicating normal Rab27a activity. Retinal function as determined by fundoscopy, angiography, electroretinography and histology was also normal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We suggest that the instability of the dominant-negative mutant Rab27 proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> precludes the use of this approach to generate mouse models of disease caused by Rab27 GTPases.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Membrane traffic in eukaryotic cells is mediated by vesicular carriers, which bud from a donor compartment, are targeted to, and fuse with the appropriate acceptor membrane. The Rab family of Ras-like GTPases is known to play a crucial role controlling these mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Among Rabs, the Rab27 subfamily consists of two isoforms, Rab27a (previously designated Ram) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and Rab27b (previously designated c25KG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In order to function in membrane traffic, Rabs require the covalent addition of one or two C20 geranylgeranyl groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Geranylgeranylation serves as a membrane-anchoring device in Rab proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This reaction is complex and occurs in several steps. Newly synthesised Rab proteins first associate with Rab Escort Protein (REP) and form a stable 1:1 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The complex then serves as a substrate for Rab geranylgeranyl transferase to catalyse geranylgeranylation via thioether bonds to carboxy-terminal cysteine residues in Rabs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Alternatively, newly synthesised Rabs can associate with a pre-formed REP:Rab-geranylgeranyl-transferase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. After geranylgeranylation, the REP:Rab complex is competent for delivery of the newly prenylated protein to cellular membranes by a process that has not been characterised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The human genome contains two related REP genes, <italic>REP1</italic> and <italic>REP2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Loss-of-function mutations in <italic>REP1</italic> result in choroideremia, an X-linked slow-onset retinal degeneration that affects photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium and the choroid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We have speculated that the disease is caused by selective defects in Rab geranylgeranylation in the affected retinal cells and have identified Rab27a as one Rab that appears selectively unprenylated in choroideremia lymphoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, Rab27a, which is expressed at high levels in the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid, could play an important role in triggering the degenerative process in choroideremia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The rationale for the present study was to generate transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative mutant Rab27 proteins in order to interfere with the function of the wild type alleles and disrupt the Rab27 regulatory function. We found that dominant-negative Rab27 proteins are unstable and quickly degraded <italic>in vivo</italic>, and are thus unable to generate a dominant-interfering effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Construction of transgenic vectors</title><p>Previous studies indicated that selective point mutations in Ras-like proteins that interfere with the cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis produce either dominant-negative or constitutively-active mutant proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Equivalent mutations were introduced into Rab27a cDNA with the predicted effects indicated in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. In order to study whether Rab27a played a role in the retinal degenerative process observed in choroideremia, we wished to generate transgenic mouse lines expressing dominant-negative Rab27a.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Mutations affecting the GTP/GDP cycle of Rab27a</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Rab27a mutation</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>expected biochemical properties</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>expected effect</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>T23N</bold></td><td align="left">preferential binding of GDP</td><td align="left">dominant-negative</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Q78L</bold></td><td align="left">reduced GTPase activity</td><td align="left">constitutively-active</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>N133I</bold></td><td align="left">low affinity for GDP/GTP</td><td align="left">dominant-negative</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>We constructed two sets of transgenic lines. For one set we took advantage of the tyrosinase tissue-specific promoter to drive expression of the transgene in pigmented cells including retinal pigment epithelium and choroidal melanocytes, given that these cell types are probably the primary site of degeneration in choroideremia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. cDNAs for Rab27a wild-type, dominant-negative mutants (Rab27a<sup>T23N</sup> and Rab27a<sup>N133I</sup>) and constitutively-active mutant (Rab27a<sup>Q78L</sup>) were cloned downstream of the tyrosinase promoter and upstream of the human growth hormone. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> provides a schematic diagram of the PTyr/Rab27a/hGH expression constructs. These constructs include a 2,200-bp fragment of the tyrosinase promoter, a 650-bp rat Rab27a coding sequence and 600-bp of sequence derived from the human growth factor gene, which provides a polyadenylation signal. To generate transgenic lines, a 3.4 kb <italic>Xho</italic>I &#x02013; <italic>Not</italic>I fragment containing the expression cassette was injected into (C57BL/6JxCBA) embryos according to standard procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

Mice containing the Rab27a transgenes were identified by PCR using primers specific to the tyrosinase promoter or myc-epitope (5' primer) and Rab27a cDNA (3' primer) (data not shown). In addition, each line was subjected to Southern blotting. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows a typical Southern blot screening following <italic>Kpn</italic>I digestion and hybridisation using the entire coding sequence of Rab27a as a probe. Note that <italic>Kpn</italic>I cuts the transgene once between the myc-tag and the coding sequence of Rab27a. Thus, a single transgenic integration will generate one hybridising fragment in addition to the endogenous bands. A tandem array of transgenes will generate two bands, one at 3.4 kb corresponding to the transgenic array and one of variable size corresponding to the Rab27a cDNA nearest the adjacent genomic DNA. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, DNA from mouse 21 showed a single extra band, suggesting a single integrated copy while DNA from mouse 25 exhibited one band at about 12 kb and one at 3.4 kb suggesting tandem integration. An accurate number of transgenic sequences per cell was not determined in part because the transgene expression was independent of transgene copy number, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. For all the constructs injected, the germ line integration was approximately 20% and thus quite efficient. At least two founders that transmit each transgene were generated. All the founder animals (F0) obtained were successfully bred with C57BL/6J mice to establish transgenic lines. We also attempted to generate homozygous transgenic mice but this was only possible for a restricted number of lines.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Screening of transgenic mice.

We designed an assay where both transgenic and endogenous Rab27a mRNA could be amplified by selecting primers that would anneal equally well to the mouse and rat sequences. The RT-PCR products were then digested with <italic>Eco</italic>RI (cutting only the rat sequence) or <italic>Sma</italic>I (cutting only the mouse sequence) restriction enzymes to distinguish between endogenous and transgenic-derived products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This assay allowed us to distinguish between lines that do not express significant amounts of the transgene, such as A27aT25/1 from those that express high levels, such as A27aT25/2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Almost all actin promoter-driven transgenic lines expressed high levels of transgenic mRNA as revealed by this assay. To quantify approximately the level of expression, the Rab27a or Rab27b product was compared to Hprt product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). All actin promoter-driven transgenic lines tested, except A27aT25/1, appeared to express the transgene at significant levels, approximately 3&#x02013;12 times higher than the endogenous counterpart. Conversely, the expression levels in tyrosinase promoter-driven transgenes were much lower, typically not exceeding 3-fold over the endogenous levels (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Detection of Rab27a mRNA.

Spleen was chosen because it contains relatively high amounts of endogenous Rab27a, which could be used as an internal control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We used initially a specific monoclonal anti-Rab27a antibody, 4B12 as a probe and observed a 27-kDa band corresponding to the endogenous Rab27a protein in all lysates tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In addition, a slower migrating band was also detected in samples prepared from some of the transgenic mice, corresponding to the myc-tagged transgenic protein as confirmed by immunodetection using the anti-myc antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). To assess the range of tissues in which transgenic protein was expressed, twelve different organs (eye, spleen, liver, skin, lung, kidney, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, brain, testis and heart) were harvested and subjected to Western blotting analysis using anti-Rab27a or anti-myc specific probes.

The phenotype of GS is characterised by partial albinism (coat colour dilution in the mouse) and loss of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) killing activity resulting in immunodeficiency.

These studies included fundoscopy, angiography, electroretinography and histology and were performed at different ages, from 1 month to over 1 year old.</p><p>Fundoscopy is a method that allows detection of gross abnormalities such as retinal or subretinal deposits, defects in the RPE, new vascularisation and detachments of the retina. The system allows rapid, inexpensive and serial examination of the retina and also obtaining very high quality images of the posterior segment of the mouse eye. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> shows representative photographs of wild type (C57BL/6J) and transgenic (Rab27a<sup>T23N</sup>) mice at 6 months of age. The examination of the fundus of transgenic mice revealed regular pigmentation at the level of the RPE. The optic nerve and retinal blood vessels in fundus seemed to be normal. Fundi of mice from all transgenic lines have been examined up to one year old and no significant alterations have been detected, with one exception. The T27aT15 line exhibited extensive pathological alterations in both the anterior and posterior segments of the eye, which were probably caused by the disruption of one or more genes at the site of transgene insertion (J.S. Ramalho and M.C. Seabra, manuscript in preparation).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Photographs of the fundus of the Rab27a<sup>T23N</sup> transgenic mouse.

In a Ganzfeld setup, the stimulus (usually a Xenon tube flash of less than 1 ms duration) passes through a diffusor that yields a relatively homogeneous distribution of light intensity on the inside of a bowl. The term 'Ganzfeld' meaning 'full field' denotes that the stimulus reaches practically all parts of the retina and its intensity is approximately equal across that area. For most applications, the ERG, which is an electric sum potential generated by retinal cells following exposure to light, is non-invasively measured at the corneal surface. Typically, the evoked response consists of an initial negative deflection (a-wave), followed by a large, positive component (b-wave). Superimposed on the ascending portion of the b-wave are the oscillatory potentials (OPs), a set of wavelets oscillating with approximately 4&#x02013;5 times the frequency of the a- and b-wave. Finally, a prolonged positive component (c-wave) follows, which takes several seconds to develop.</p><p>Due to characteristic contributions of photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and amacrine cells, the ERG is a valuable indicator of retinal function beyond the ganglion cell level. To assess whether potential functional changes in the transgenic lines could be picked up with this method, the lines that presented higher levels of transgenic protein were subjected to ERG at six months of age. Representative lines from each transgenic construct were analysed at six months and found to be indistinguishable from wild type in all but one case. In A27aT25/2 mice (Rab27a<sup>T23N</sup>), the b-wave amplitudes were all in the low-normal range (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) but these differences were not statistically significant. Interestingly, this transgenic line showed the highest level of dominant-negative transgenic protein and thus the low-normal ERG may have resulted from a dominant-negative effect of mutant Rab27a. However, as only one of the lines studied showed this result, the disruption of a gene with important function in the retina upon transgenesis in the A27aT25/2 appears to be the most likely explanation.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Electrophysiological characteristics of the A27aT25/2 transgenic mouse line.

We decided to generate transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative forms of Rab27 for several reasons. Firstly, the strategy of generating Rab proteins defective in either GTP hydrolysis (constitutively-active) or GDP/GTP exchange (dominant-negative) to selectively alter the function of individual Rab proteins in cultured cells has been extensively used previously (for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]). In some cases, these mutants have had profound effects on membrane trafficking such as with Rab5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], but in others such as Rab11a the effects were more subtle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Secondly, a transgenic approach to express the equivalent Rab5 dominant-negative mutant, Rab5<sup>N133I</sup> in immune cells reportedly resulted in the desired phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Thirdly, this approach was the best model for studying the partial dysfunction of Rab27a observed previously since dominant-negative proteins would unlikely inactivate 100% of wild type activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In addition, the dominant-negative approach could also result in inactivation of Rab27b activity, if not other related proteins. In contrast, a gene knock-out approach would result in complete absence of Rab27a while retaining full activity of the related protein Rab27b. Our recent finding that Rab27b shows functional redundancy with Rab27a further suggests that Rab27a-related Rabs may be involved in CHM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Fourthly, we observed that these same Rab27a mutations were effective in cell culture models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>While this work was in progress, there was a considerable advance in understanding the function of Rab27a and its role in disease. Loss-of-function mutations in Rab27a were observed in patients with Griscelli syndrome (online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) # 214450, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim/"/>) and in the corresponding mouse model, <italic>ashen </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. GS is a rare, lethal autosomal recessive disorder, characterised by pigment dilution of the hair (and to a lesser extent of skin) together with early-onset immune deficiency with episodes of hemophagocytic (uncontrolled T lymphocyte and macrophage activation) syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The partial albinism in GS patients is due to clumping of melanin pigment in the hair shaft and accumulation of melanosomes around the nucleus within melanocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The immune deficiency is due to loss of CTL killing activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. If the Rab27a mutant proteins Rab27a<sup>T23N</sup> and Rab27a<sup>N133I</sup> acted as strong dominant-negative mutants, as they do in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], the transgenic lines generated should exhibit a phenotype resembling <italic>ashen</italic> mice, possibly with additional phenotypes due to inactivation of Rab27b as well. Unfortunately, no phenotype could be detected in the transgenic lines. Coat colour was not affected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) and CTL activity could not be studied given that the &#x003b2;-actin promoter used in this study does not express in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We also performed detailed analysis of the retina in the transgenic lines, including fundoscopy, angiography, histology and ERG, and could not detect any significant pathological changes.</p><p>The lack of phenoytpe in the transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative mutant Rab27a and Rab27b could have been due to non-functional mutant proteins. However, this explanation seems unlikely as the same type of mutants are functional in cultured melanocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. It has been proposed that one mechanism for dominant-negative action by these mutations in Ras-like proteins is by competition for GDP/GTP exchange factors, required for activation of the endogenous proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, the absence of phenotype in these mice is probably due to inadequate levels of protein expression to elicit a dominant-negative effect. Indeed, out of more than twenty transgenic lines generated so far expressing dominant-negative mutant forms of Rab27a or Rab27b, only one (A27aT25/2) had transgenic protein levels close to the endogenous counterpart (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p><p>The low levels of dominant-negative transgenic protein are not due to poor expression of the transgenes as very high levels of mRNA was observed in many of the lines. In addition the wild-type and constitutively active proteins were present at high levels from similar constructs. The low levels of protein are probably due to more rapid turnover of the dominant-negative mutant proteins and we observed that the Rab27a<sup>T23N</sup> and Rab27a<sup>NI33I</sup> proteins have half-lives 4&#x02013;8 times shorter than the wild type protein in tissue culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This fast turnover of the dominant-negative protein compared to the constitutively-active and wild-type proteins probably results from a combination of factors. The transgenic protein could be poorly prenylated, a possibility supported by the finding that only a small percentage of transgenic protein was membrane-associated (data not shown). Also, the mutation could reduce the stability of the tertiary structure of the mutant protein resulting in an increased rate of unfolding. Although the rate of turnover of Rab27b proteins was not determined, the low levels of dominant negative mutant protein in transgenic lines expressing high levels of mRNA suggests that Rab27b<sup>T23N</sup> and Rab27b<sup>NI33I</sup> also have high rates of turn-over. These observations <italic>in vivo</italic> contrast with the effects observed in cultured cells, where transient transfection leads to acute expression of very high levels of mutant proteins.</p><p>Our initial hypothesis that Rab27a plays a role in the retinal degenerative process of CHM remains untested given the lack of success of this approach. As we proposed originally, it is unlikely that Rab27a is the only dysfunctional Rab protein in this disorder and our inability to test retinal tissue from patients has hampered the identification of other Rabs that might be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, the availability of Rab27a knock-out mice (<italic>ashen</italic>) may allow us to determine whether Rab27a plays an important role in retinal physiology and further elucidate the pathogenesis of CHM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results presented here suggest that the use of dominant-negative proteins in <italic>in vivo</italic> models should be carefully considered. We report the generation of several transgenic lines expressing dominant-negative mutants of Rab27a and Rab27b where no phenotype could be elicited. The lack of a phenotype is likely due to the very modest levels of protein expression, probably caused by rapid degradation, despite very high levels of mRNA resulting from transcription driven by a strong promoter in the transgene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All animals described here were maintained on 12-h light/12-h dark conditions at Imperial College, CBS Unit, London, UK, under Home Office Project Licence 70/5071.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of mutant Rab27a transgenic vectors</title><p>Two general transgenic constructs were constructed, the first contained the pigment cell-specific tyrosinase promoter, Rab27a cDNA and the human growth hormone poly A signal and the second contained the strong ubiquitous chicken &#x003b2;-actin promoter and CMV-IE enhancer (PCAG), followed by an amino-terminal myc-epitope-tagged version of Rab27a or Rab27b, followed by rabbit &#x003b2;-globin poly(A) signal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

In most cases, the transgene expression was much higher than the endogenous expression making quantification impossible. Therefore, the transgene expression level was determined in each line by quantitating the Rab27 (endogenous plus mutant mRNA) relative to Hprt cDNA using all four primers, 0.025 &#x003bc;Ci of [&#x003b1;-<sup>33</sup>P] dATP and 23 cycles in PCR reaction. The oligonucleotides used for Hprt amplification were Hprt1 (5'-CCTGCTGGATTACATTAAAGCACTG) and Hprt2 (5'-GTCAAGGGCATATCCAACAACAAAC). Possible contamination of mRNA with transgenic DNA was excluded by control reactions without reverse transcriptase. The radiolabelled PCR products were separated on 2.5% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, transferred onto 3 MM Whatman paper and quantified using a Cyclotron Storage Phosphor Screen (Packard).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblot analysis</title><p>Immunoblotting was performed according to procedures described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] with some modifications using total, cytosol or membrane protein fractions obtained from several C57BL/6J wild-type or transgenic tissues. All the transgenic and non-transgenic mice used for immunoblotting studies were thoroughly perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) prior to dissection of the tissue samples that included eye (the lens was always removed from the ocular globe), spleen, liver, lung, kidney, skin, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, brain, testis and heart. Tissue samples were washed with PBS, and thoroughly homogenised using a Polytron homogeniser in 3&#x02013;5 volumes of homogenisation buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml leupeptin, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml aprotinin, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml pepstatin and 1 mM DTT. Homogenisation was followed by sonication for 5&#x02013;10 seconds. To sediment unbroken cells and cell nuclei, the homogenates were centrifuged at 5,000 g for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The postnuclear supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C, resulting in the separation of cytosolic (supernatant) and membrane (pellet) protein fractions. The membrane fractions were resuspended into the same volume of homogenisation buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. The protein concentration was determined only in the total fraction by BCA method (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoblot analysis, samples containing 50 &#x003bc;g of protein were separated into soluble or membrane fractions and identical volumes were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis. After being resuspended into loading buffer, protein samples were loaded onto 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, run at 35 mA and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) membrane in a minitrans-blot cell (Amersham) at room temperature in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 192 mM glycine, and 10% methanol for 1 h and 30 min at 500 mA. To block non-specific binding sites, dried membranes were incubated in blocking solution containing 0.1% polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaureate (Tween-20), 4% non-fat milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were subsequently incubated with PBS/0.1% Tween-20 solution supplemented with the following preparation of antibodies: monoclonal 4B12 antibody (0.3 &#x003bc;g/ml) anti-rat Rab27a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], monoclonal antibody anti-myc-tag (0.3 &#x003bc;g/ml) purchased from Oncogene (Cambridge, MA, USA) or polyclonal anti-calnexin antibody (1:5,000) purchased from StressGene (Victoria, BC, Canada). The mixture was incubated with the primary antibody with gentle agitation for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed and washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 for 15 min, 3 times. Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Dako). The blots were washed as described above and bands were visualised by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescence Substrate (Pierce) according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. All blots were calibrated with prestained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad Laboratories).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture, transfections and labelling</title><p>COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed using lipofectamine (Qiagen). Total amounts of transfected DNA were 1 &#x003bc;g/6-cm dish. For pulse-chase experiments, cells were washed with methionine/cysteine-free medium and subsequently incubated with 140 &#x003bc;Ci of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine/cysteine per 6-cm dish for 2 h. After this, cells were washed three times in PBS, and further maintained in normal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. At indicated time points (0, 30 min, 3, 5, 8 and 22 h), cells were lysed by incubation in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml leupeptin, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml aprotinin, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml pepstatin, 1 mM DTT and 1% NP-40 for 20 min on ice followed by 5&#x02013;10 s of sonication. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, equal amounts of radioactive lysates were incubated under agitation with 5 &#x003bc;g of 4B12 antibody for 1 h at RT, after lowering the concentration of NP-40 to 0.5% by dilution. Subsequently, 30 &#x003bc;l of protein G-Sepharose beads were added to the radioactive material and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, while rocking. Then beads were washed four times in PBS, denatured in SDS-containing sample buffer and loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto 3 MM Whatman paper and quantified using a Storm system (Amersham).</p></sec><sec><title>Fundus photography</title><p>Fundus photographs of mice were taken using a small animal fundus camera (Kowa Genesis) according to John and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In order to have a better magnification and focal depth of the fundus, the camera was used in conjunction with an external 90 diopter condensing lens (Volk). This condensing lens was mounted between the camera and the mouse eye. The lens was placed about 5 cm below the camera. All the photographs were taken without anesthesia and with mice's vibrissae trimmed to avoid ocular clouding and obscuring photograph problems. Pupils were dilated with a drop of 1% Mydriacyl (Alcon Laboratories) 20&#x02013;30 min before taking the photographs. For conventional photography of the fundus, Kodak 200 ASA slide film was used. The photographic flash on the power pack was set up for its highest level (position 6&#x02013;7) for C57BL/6J mice as the highest intensity of light produced better results on pigmented mice. The mice were held beneath the external lens and the focusing was achieved by moving the mouse. To reduce the light reflection, a major problem of this technique, the position of the eye was very important. Accordingly, the procedure involved focusing through an off central position of the ocular globe.</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescein angiography</title><p>The retinal angiography was performed using the general fundus photography procedure. The camera was set up for angiography through addition of an emission barrier filter specific for fluorescein emission and the power pack was set up for fluorescein angiography by changing the excitation light to fluorescein excitation. For this type of photography Kodak black and white Tmax 400 ASA professional film was used. The photographic flash on the power pack was set up for its highest level (position 6&#x02013;7). Mice were intraperitoneally injected with 20% injectable sodium fluorescein (Faure) at a dose of 10 &#x003bc;l per 5&#x02013;6 g body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Photographs were taken at several intervals, starting at 30 s post-injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Electroretinography</title><p>ERGs were obtained according to previously reported procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Briefly, before anesthesia with ketamine (66.7 mg/kg), xylazine (11.7 mg/kg), and atropine (1 mg/kg), the pupils of dark-adapted mice were dilated. The ERG equipment consisted of a Ganzfeld bowl, a DC amplifier, and a PC-based control and recording unit (Multiliner Vision, Jaeger/Toennies, Hoechberg, Germany). Band-pass filter cut-off frequencies were 0.1 and 3000 Hz. Single flash recordings were obtained both under dark-adapted (scotopic) and light-adapted (photopic) conditions. Light adaptation before the photopic session was performed with a background illumination of 30 cd/m<sup>2</sup> for 10 minutes. Single flash stimulus intensities were increased from 10<sup>-4</sup> cd*s/m<sup>2</sup> to 25 cd*s/m<sup>2</sup>, divided into ten steps of 0.5 and 1 log cd*s/m<sup>2</sup>. Ten responses were averaged with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of either 5s or 17s (for 1, 3, 10, 25 cd*s/m<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Histology</title><p>Eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 5% glutaraldehyde and 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 1 h. Subsequently, the eyes were cut in half and the anterior segment was removed. Fixed eyes were washed three times for 10 min at room temperature with PBS. Specimen were embedded in paraffin, sectioned to 3&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;m thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin according to standard procedures.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>CHM, choroideremia; REP, Rab Escort Protein; CTL, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte; GS, Griscelli syndrome; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate buffered-saline; Hprt, Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JSR designed, performed and analysed all but the ERG experiments, RA generated the transgenic lines and performed some screenings, GBJ and MS performed the ERG experiments, CH and MCS designed, analysed and coordinated the study.
