FDCs retain native immune complexes with complement and Fc&#x003b3; receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), and display them to B cells, which they embrace with intricate dendritic networks. This is thought to facilitate the GC reactions, and the selection of B cells that gives rise to high-affinity antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) and long-term memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). But others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) have questioned the importance of FDCs because primary immune responses, affinity maturation, and memory B cells arise in mice engineered to lack the retention of immune complexes by FDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), and even in <italic>Lta<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice that are deficient in lymphotoxin (LT) signaling and lack FDCs completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Hence, the functional contribution of FDCs to affinity maturation remains unclear.</p><p>Some biomarkers, including the complement receptors CD21/35 and the complement factor C4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), allow for FDC immunodetection in vivo, yet none of them are exclusively restricted to FDCs. A more specific marker is hybridoma clone 4C11, whose reactivity is confined to FDCs and tingible-body macrophages (TBM&#x003c6;s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). The antigen recognized by 4C11 was provisionally termed FDC-M1, but its identity has remained unknown.</p><p>Phagocytosis of apoptotic GC B cells, the remnants of which are recognizable as tingible bodies inside TBM&#x003c6;s, is thought to be a crucial function of TBM&#x003c6;s. Apoptotic cells are engulfed upon opsonization by milk fat globule epidermal growth factor (EGF) 8 (Mfge8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), which binds bifunctionally to phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells and to integrins expressed by phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Originally identified as a membrane component of milk-fat globules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), <italic>Mfge8</italic> was reported to be expressed by various phagocytes, including TBM&#x003c6;s, activated peritoneal macrophages (PM&#x003c6;s), and immature DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>).</p><p><italic>Mfge8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice suffer from impaired engulfment of GC B cell corpses by TBM&#x003c6;s. Consequently, their TBM&#x003c6;s carry supernumerary nonengulfed apoptotic B cells, which cause them to appear enlarged. This defect is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and autoimmune glomerulonephritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). In this report, we provide conclusive evidence that the FDC-M1 antigen identified by clone 4C11 is identical to Mfge8, that FDCs are the only source of splenic Mfge8, and that TBM&#x003c6;s only acquire surface Mfge8 if situated in the proximity of <italic>Mfge8</italic>-expressing FDCs or in lymph nodes that drain exogenous Mfge8. The absence of FDCs in mice lacking LTs or their receptors correlated with the profound depletion of splenic Mfge8 in LT-deficient mice, suggesting that impairment of FDC homeostasis contributes to their autoimmune pathologies.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>FDC-M1 and Mfge8 are identical</title><p>The present report originated from our serendipitous observation that FDC-M1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> networks were completely absent from splenic cryosections of <italic>Mfge8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice stained with anti&#x02013;FDC-M1 antibody 4C11 (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071019/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071019/DC1</ext-link>). This was unexpected, because no FDC abnormalities had been reported in <italic>Mfge8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice despite progressive splenomegaly, enlarged splenic TBM&#x003c6;s, and hyperplastic follicles with increased numbers of peanut agglutinin&#x02013;positive (PNA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). The absence of 4C11 immunoreactivity in <italic>Mfge8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> spleens did not result from an absence of mature FDCs, because FDC networks were easily identifiable by CD21/35 immunostains (Fig. S1).</p><p>The anti-Mfge8 antibodies 18A2-G10 and 2422 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) identified FDC networks and colocalized with 4C11 immunostains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). We therefore considered the possibility that FDC-M1 and Mfge8 are the same antigen. Indeed, preincubation with excess rMfge8, but not with rEGF or recombinant prion protein (rPrP), inhibited the binding of both 18A2-G10 and 4C11 to FDC networks. The presence of FDCs in these sections was independently confirmed by PrP<sup>C</sup>-specific immunolabeling, which is abundantly expressed by FDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>FDC-M1 and Mfge8 are identical.</bold> (A) Two-color immunolabeling of a WT spleen stained with anti-Mfge8 antibody 18A2-G10 (green) and anti&#x02013;FDC-M1 antibody 4C11 (red), or anti-Mfge8 antibody 2422 (green) and 4C11 (red). Both anti-Mfge8 antibodies showed colocalization with 4C11. (B) Preincubation with 25 &#x003bc;g/ml rMfge8 blocked the labeling of FDCs with 18A2-G10 or 4C11. To visualize FDCs, sections were stained with anti-PrP antibody POM2. For control, sections were preincubated with rEGF or rPrP. Bars, 100 &#x003bc;m. (C) Splenic protein extracts (WT and <italic>Mfge8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) were immunoprecipitated with 2422 or 4C11, or to a rat IgG2c isotype control antibody.

Paramagnetic beads were conjugated to immunoaffinity-purified antibodies 4C11, anti-Mfge8 antibody 2422, or rat IgG2c isotype control antibody. Beads were incubated with protein extracts from WT or <italic>Mfge8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> spleens, and precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Mfge8 antibody 18A2-G10. After immunoprecipitation with anti-Mfge8 antibodies, two bands with molecular masses of &#x0223c;45 and 55 kD were detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). After immunoprecipitation with anti&#x02013;FDC-M1 beads, two signals were obtained with molecular masses matching those of the 2422 immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Both signals were absent in spleens from <italic>Mfge8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, confirming their identity as genuine Mfge8.</p><p>We next verified the interaction of rMfge8 with anti&#x02013;FDC-M1 antibody 4C11 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). 4C11 was injected onto Biacore sensor chip surfaces covalently coated with rMfge8 or, for control, rPrP. Interaction of 4C11 with immobilized rMfge8 was observed over several serial injections until binding had reached saturation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, I). When anti-Mfge8 antibody 2422 was subsequently injected, its binding was minimal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, I, arrow, 2422), suggesting that 4C11 interfered with the binding of 2422 to rMfge8. Binding of anti-Mfge8 antibody 18A2-G10, in contrast, was not affected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, I, arrow, 18A2-G10). Rat IgG2c did not interact with immobilized rMfge8 (not depicted).</p><p>Antibodies were then reinjected in a different order. First, 2422 was added until saturation was reached (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, II). 4C11 was injected, yet it did not bind to rMfge8 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, II, arrow, 4C11). In contrast, 18A2-G10 always bound to rMfge8, even in the presence of previously bound 2422 or 4C11 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, I and II). Hence, the 18A2-G10 epitope is distinct from those of the other two antibodies. These results indicate that 4C11 and 2422 abrogate each other's binding to Mfge8, either because they share a common or overlapping epitope, or because they sterically hinder each other. This was confirmed by the next experiment: immobilized 18A2-G10 was used to capture rMfge8. Then, the antibodies 18A2-G10, 2422, and 4C11 were added in a sandwich design. Under these conditions, injected 18A2-G10 did not bind to surfaces decorated with 18A2-G10&#x02013;captured rMfge8, confirming that 18A2-G10 binds to a single epitope on Mfge8 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, III). Subsequent injection of 4C11 resulted in a strong interaction with captured rMfge8. When 2422 was applied, no binding occurred. We then reversed the order of injections: 2422 was added before 4C11. In this case, the first antibody, 2422, interacted with 18A2-G10&#x02013;captured rMfge8, whereas 4C11 did not (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, IV).</p><p>These data show that the FDC-M1 antigen identified by antibody 4C11 is Mfge8. The molecular identification of FDC-M1 expands the arsenal of tools for functional and morphological studies of FDCs in many ways. Because Mfge8 is secreted, its histological assignment by RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) is more informative of its cellular origin than immunohistology and will help define the precise histogenesis of FDCs. Also, we found that anti-Mfge8 antibody 18A2-G10 labels FDCs on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (unpublished data), thereby enabling the recognition of FDCs in archived tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>FDCs are the major source of Mfge8 in the spleen</title><p>The finding that Mfge8 is detected in TBM&#x003c6;s within splenic follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) may be compatible with the above results if Mfge8 were secreted by FDCs and trapped by TBM&#x003c6;s. We tested this proposition in reciprocal BM chimeras between <italic>Mfge8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and WT mice. FDCs are stromal and radioresistant, whereas TBM&#x003c6;s are mononuclear phagocytes of hematopoietic origin and are thought to be radiosensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). To provide an independent histogenetic marker, lethally irradiated <italic>Mfge8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice expressing the CD45.2 allelic variant were reconstituted with BM from CD45.1 congenic WT mice, and vice versa.</p><p>The mean reconstitution efficiency determined by FACS analysis of peripheral blood was 93.8 &#x000b1; 3.6% (unpublished data). The donor origin of TBM&#x003c6;s was confirmed by multicolor immunofluorescence with antibodies against CD45.1, CD45.2, and CD68 in &#x0003e;50 follicles of five mice per group. The results ruled out the possibility that host-derived TBM&#x003c6;s may have survived irradiation (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071019/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071019/DC1</ext-link>). Immunostains of <italic>Mfge8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>&#x02192;<italic>Mfge8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (all CD45.2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and WT&#x02192;WT (all CD45.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) spleens confirmed the absence of cross-reactivity (Fig. S2). Two-color immunolabeling of <italic>Mfge8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>&#x02192;WT spleens with antibodies against CD68 (cyan) and CD45.1 (red) confirmed that TBM&#x003c6;s were not host derived, whereas TBM&#x003c6;s of WT&#x02192;<italic>Mfge8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> spleens did not express CD45.2 (Fig. S2). Therefore, in all chimeras the overwhelming majority of TBM&#x003c6;s always originated from donor BM.</p><p>Early analyses of BM chimeras suggested a hematopoietic derivation of FDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), but most current evidence favors a stromal origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Indeed, <italic>Ptprc</italic>, which encodes CD45, was markedly reduced in MACS-enriched FDC clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), whereas <italic>Mfge8</italic> and <italic>Cxcl13</italic> (a B cell&#x02013;attracting chemokine expressed by FDCs; reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) were increased (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071019/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071019/DC1</ext-link>). We conclude that FDCs do not express CD45, and were therefore not identifiable as host derived in CD45.1/CD45.2 immunostains.</p><p>BM-chimeric mice were immunized and boosted with OVA/alum to induce GCs before analysis. 9 wk after reconstitution, splenic Mfge8 and CD68 expression were analyzed immunohistochemically. Surprisingly, <italic>Mfge8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice that had received WT BM (WT&#x02192;<italic>Mfge8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) completely lacked splenic Mfge8 immunoreactivity. Not only radioresistant FDCs but also BM-derived CD68<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TBM&#x003c6;s were phenotypically Mfge8 negative (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, top) although they had clearly originated from <italic>Mfge8<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> donors (Fig. S2).

Irrespective of their genotype, therefore, TBM&#x003c6;s were always Mfge8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> whenever FDCs expressed Mfge8, yet they were always Mfge8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> whenever FDCs lacked Mfge8.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of splenic <italic>Mfge8</italic> expression by immunofluorescence and ISH.</bold> (A) BM chimeras were stained with anti-Mfge8 antibody (clone 2422; green) and anti-CD68 antibody (red).

In addition to modulating the survival of GC B cells, FDCs appear to regulate their removal once these cells have undergone apoptosis. These results indicate that FDCs provide Mfge8 to GCs, which then binds to phosphatidylserine on apoptotic B cells and targets them for removal by TBM&#x003c6;s. This would explain why TBM&#x003c6;s register as Mfge8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> upon ingestion of apoptotic B cells, and indeed, we were able to show that TBM&#x003c6;s take up extracellular Mfge8 after subcutaneous injection of rMfge8 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>This model predicates a functional interaction of two distinct cell types, FDCs and TBM&#x003c6;s, in the removal of apoptotic cells from GCs. This is plausible for physiological and anatomical reasons. Apoptosis of GC B cells is very frequent, and their rapid and efficient removal seems important to avoid autoimmunity. But the paucity of scavenging cells, TBM&#x003c6;s, may limit the removal process. However, it would be wasteful for TBM&#x003c6;s to produce both Mfge8 and its receptors, &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>5</sub> integrins. Conversely, these data suggest a tunable mechanism, with FDCs establishing a gradient of Mfge8 availability within GCs. Through their strategic microanatomical positioning within follicles, FDCs arm TBM&#x003c6;s for engulfment only in the vicinity of apoptotic B cells. Accordingly, the apoptotic body load was dramatically increased in macrophages residing within GCs. Because of their intimacy with GC B cells, FDCs may directly decorate negatively selected B cells with Mfge8 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This two-tiered mechanism may help ensure that numerous dying cells are recognized and degraded by far fewer TBM&#x003c6;s.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Mfge8-dependent removal of apoptotic cells from the GC.</bold> (A) In acute inflammatory conditions, macrophages secrete <italic>Mfge8</italic> (step 1; reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), which targets apoptotic bodies (step 2) and allows macrophages to bind them via integrins (step 3).
