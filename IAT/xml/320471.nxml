The gene encodes a polypeptide consisting of 848 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 97,542. The deduced protein structure reveals that cyclase is comprised of two domains, an amino-terminal region exhibiting catalytic activity and a carboxy-terminal region possibly carrying regulatory function. The frequent appearance of rare codons in the beginning of the gene as well as the sequence duplication in the promoter-initiator region suggest possible regulation(s) at the translational level. An unknown gene (cyaX) which seems to code for a very hydrophobic protein was found following the cya gene. Sequence analysis suggests that the cyax is a part of the cya operon.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0204.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9427"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0205.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9428"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0206.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9429"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0207.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9430"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0208.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9431"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0209.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9432"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0210.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9433"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0211.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9434"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0212.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9435"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0213.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9436"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0214.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9437"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0215.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9438"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0216.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9439"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0217.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9440"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
