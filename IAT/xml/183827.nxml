During normal starvation, pairs of haploid cells can occasionally fuse, apparently at random, to give diploid progeny. These are stable enough to grow, develop and form spores while remaining diploid. If cells of two different strains, each carrying a different selectable marker, are starved together, diploids will be formed from one cell of each parental strain. These can be separated from the haploid background by applying both selections simultaneously, so each haploid parent is killed but diploids survive. As long as selection is maintained, the diploids may remain reasonably stable, but there is a continual process of haploidization in which individual lines lose one chromosome of each diploid pair. This segregation is apparently random, which means that diploids can be used to reassort chromosomes from different haploid strains, in much the same way as sexual recombination. The process has therefore been called parasexual genetics, because the two parents are usually of the same mating type, and because crossovers between the paired chromosomes of diploids very rarely occur. Loomis (1987) gives a thorough discussion of the mechanics of parasexual genetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>More recently, <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>has gained popularity as an experimental organism because of the relative ease with which gene disruption mutants may be generated. However, genetics has almost never been used in conjunction with gene disruption. The main reason for this lies in the way cells are grown. Earlier work on parasexual genetics chiefly used cells which had been grown on bacterial lawns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Such cells are healthy and grow rapidly, but are unsuitable for most molecular genetic manipulations. The bacteria cause several difficulties. They provide a large reservoir of exogenous DNA, which complicates experiments, and they frequently sequester or break down the drugs used to select transformed cells. Most molecular genetic experiments are therefore performed on cells grown axenically in liquid medium. However, the techniques most frequently used to select for diploids in bacterially-grown <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>have proved to be unworkable under axenic conditions. The <italic>bsg </italic>selectable markers require growth on <italic>Bacillus subtilis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and while selections using temperature sensitive mutants have been successful, the resulting diploid strains have been highly unstable and unsuitable for genetic manipulations, apparently because diploid growth is extremely inefficient at the high temperatures used for selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>A set of techniques for generating and handling diploid strains would be invaluable for <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>workers. One major problem for the field has been the relative lack of selectable markers. Only three markers have been widely used for gene disruption &#x02013; <italic>pyr</italic>56 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], <italic>thy</italic>A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and blasticidin resistance (Bsr) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Selections with <italic>pyr</italic>56 and <italic>thy</italic>A have never been performed together, and other drugs such as G418 and hygromycin have proved inefficient for gene disruption. These experimental limitations have made the generation of double disruptants difficult, and more complex mutants seriously problematical. An experimentally usable parasexual cycle would enable existing mutants to be crossed, even if they were made using the same selectable marker, and thus greatly diminish this problem.</p><p>In this paper we describe techniques for generating, handling and segregating diploid <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>in axenic medium. We have used these techniques to recombine <italic>rasS </italic>and <italic>gefB </italic>mutants, generating a <italic>ras</italic>S<sup>-</sup>/<italic>gef</italic>B<sup>- </sup>double null. RasS is one of at least seven <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>ras proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and GefB one of a large family of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RasGEFs), which activate Ras proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The exact numbers in each family will not be known until the genome is completely sequenced, but at least 20 have already been identified, making redundancy nearly certain. A thorough analysis of Ras pathways in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>will therefore depend on an effective method of recombining gene disruptants. RasS and GefB are particularly suitable for this study because of conflicting data about their genetic relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Mutants in both genes move unusually rapidly and have serious defects in fluid-phase endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], but recent work has shown that the two mutants move rapidly using different mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Two explanations are possible. Either RasS and GefB lie in parallel pathways which are needed for related biological functions, or the pathway is linear and GefB is the principal GEF for RasS but the differences in motility are incidental. In the first case, double mutants should display a compound phenotype, while a linear pathway should yield double mutants with no additional defects. In this paper we describe a genetic approach to this question.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Selection and Maintenance of Diploids in Axenic Culture</title><p>Previous attempts at growing diploid <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>in axenic culture have not been productive. This is mainly caused by incompatibility between axenic growth and the selectable markers used to maintain the strains. Diploids are formed at low efficiency during normal <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Experimental isolation of diploids therefore requires genetic selections which allow diploids, but not haploids, to grow. Typical selections involve two parents, each of which carries a different recessive mutation, so neither parent can grow under appropriate selective conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In diploids both mutants are complemented, so growth is possible. Some selections, for example growth on <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, cannot be used without bacteria, while temperature sensitivity selections are apparently too harsh for efficient axenic growth of diploids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We therefore designed schemes for selecting diploids which work optimally under axenic conditions. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows diagrams of two such schemes. In fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref> one parent, DH1, carries a deletion in the <italic>pyr</italic>56 gene and thus requires exogenous uracil for growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The other parent is JH10, which requires added thymidine because of an insertion of <italic>pyr</italic>56 in the <italic>thy</italic>A gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus neither parent is able to grow in FM minimal medium. Diploids formed by the fusion of JH10 and DH1 cells carry a single copy of both <italic>pyr</italic>56 and <italic>thy</italic>A, however, and are thus able to grow in FM.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Selection of diploid strains. The figure shows a schematic representation of the genotype on chromosome 3.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-4-12-1"/></fig><p>A second scheme is shown in fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>. Instead of combining two mutant strains, a wild type parent can be fused with a mutant in which the <italic>thy</italic>A gene has been disrupted using the G418<sup><italic>r </italic></sup>marker. Neither haploid can grow in axenic medium containing G418 but no added thymidine, but diploids grow normally. Again, diploids are stable because both markers are situated at the same locus. This scheme has several advantages and disadvantages compared with the <italic>pyr</italic>56/<italic>thy</italic>A method. In particular, previously existing mutants may be recombined without further genetic modification, but the progeny will be G418 resistant and therefore cannot be transformed by most common shuttle vectors.</p><p>Diploids are generated experimentally by shaking 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells of JH10 and DH1 overnight in 10 ml FM medium, then transferring the whole mixture to a Petri plate and incubating for 10 days. As negative controls, 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells of each parent are used alone. Under these conditions we generally see from 10 to 500 diploid colonies per plate. Growth in the control plates is never seen, though many DH1 cells survive without growth. Following one such fusion, we isolated one diploid clone and named it DIR1. These cells were used for most of the tests described below.</p><p>We verified that DIR1 cells were true diploids using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and chromosome staining. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> shows a typical FACS result. After propidium iodide staining, both haploid parents exhibit a peak intensity at a DNA content of about 181 &#x000b1; 13, with a smaller additional peak at 380 &#x000b1; 29. DIR1 diploids, on the other hand, contained a large peak at 307 &#x000b1; 14 with a smaller peak at 650 &#x000b1; 42, an increase of ~70% for both peaks. This is as expected as the mitochondria contribute almost 30% of the total cellular DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The ploidy of DH1, JH10 and DIR1 cells was verified by (A) FACS analysis of DNA content, and (B) cytological staining of mitotic nuclei to visualise the chromomsomes.

The larger complement of chromosomes of the diploids is clearly visible. It is interesting to note that there are plainly seven chromosomes in many of the images from haploid parents, and fourteen chromosomes in the diploids. We have examined a large number of mitotics spreads, and while it is often ambiguous whether apparently overlapping blobs are separate chromosomes, about half of all haploid nuclei examined clearly contain seven separate entities. We also checked cells from other strains, including AX2 and the nonaxenic parents NC4 and V12 (data not shown). In each case, seven mitotic chromosomes were clearly visible. Although older data had concluded that <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>contains seven chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], it has been difficult to find markers in more than six linkage groups, leading to a consensus that only six bona fide chromosomes exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This argument has recently been addressed by Sucgang et al. (2003), who conclude that one of the seven chromosomes seen by DAPI staining derives from multiple copies of the ribosomal DNA aggregated into a single, chromosome-sized body which disintegrates during FISH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Growth and Stability of Diploids</title><p>Diploid cells grow well in axenic medium under a variety of conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In petri dishes, DIR1 cells grow as rapidly under selective conditions (without additions) as either parent (with thymidine or uracil added as appropriate). The doubling time under these conditions is just over 20 hrs for DIR1 diploids and both parents. When cells are grown in shaken culture, the growth rate of diploids is also similar to that of haploids. Shaken DIR1 double every 21 hours, compared with approximately 19 hours for JH10 and DH1. The long-term stability and ploidy of DIR1 diploids is ensured by the way in which the JH10 parental strain was generated. JH8, the strain from which JH10 was made, contains an deletion in the <italic>pyr</italic>56 gene and JH10 was then generated from this by re-insertion of the intact <italic>pyr</italic>56 gene into <italic>thy</italic>A. As indicated in fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>, this means that the intact <italic>pyr</italic>56 gene in JH10 is situated at the same genetic locus as the <italic>thy</italic>A gene in DH1. This means that no normal segregation can generate a haploid that is able to grow in FM minimal medium. Only an unequal crossover or similar, extremely rare, event can generate haploid cells containing both <italic>thy</italic>A and <italic>pyr</italic>56. DIR1 diploids are thus exceedingly stable when grown under selective conditions. The growth of diploids is strongly favoured even in milder conditions &#x02013; <italic>thyA</italic><sup>- </sup>haploids die and <italic>pyr56</italic><sup>- </sup>cells grow extremely poorly in normal, unsupplemented axenic medium (data not shown). Even after 30 generations of growth under these conditions, &#x0003e;60% cells are diploid. It is important to note that, due to the difficulty in getting perfectly separate chromosomes, the proportion of diploid cells estimated by cytological staining is likely to be underestimated &#x02013; many of the cells scored as having 12 or 13 chromosomes are actually diploid.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Growth of DIR1 diploids in FM medium in (A) dishes and (B) shaken flasks.

We were therefore surprised to find that DIR1 diploids were remarkably stable even in the absence of selection. As shown in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, even after 20 generations grown in medium supplemented with both uracil and thymidine, 42% of the cells were still diploid. Similarly, DIR1 diploids could be grown for prolonged periods on bacterial plates without reverting to the haploid state, despite the lack of selection under these conditions. 96% of bacterially grown cells were still diploid after 2 weeks growth, making growth on bacterial lawns feasible for cloning or assessing development.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Strains used in this work.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Strain</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Parent(s)</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Genotype</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Ref.</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">AX2</td><td align="left">NC4</td><td align="left">Wild type (axenic)</td><td align="left">[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">AX3</td><td align="left">NC4</td><td align="left">Wild type (axenic)</td><td align="left">[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">DH1</td><td align="left">AX3</td><td align="left"><italic>pyr</italic>56<sup>-</sup></td><td align="left">[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">JH10</td><td align="left">AX3</td><td align="left"><italic>thy</italic>A<sup>-</sup></td><td align="left">[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">IR110</td><td align="left">AX3</td><td align="left"><italic>thy</italic>A::G418<sup><italic>r</italic></sup></td><td align="left">this work</td></tr><tr><td align="left">IR150</td><td align="left">AX2</td><td align="left"><italic>thy</italic>A::G418<sup><italic>r</italic></sup></td><td align="left">this work</td></tr><tr><td align="left">DIR1</td><td align="left">DH1/JH10</td><td align="left"><italic>pyr</italic>56<sup>+/-</sup>, <italic>thy</italic>A<sup>+/-</sup></td><td align="left">this work</td></tr><tr><td align="left">DIR2</td><td align="left">AX3/IR150</td><td align="left"><italic>thy</italic>A<sup>+</sup>/<italic>thy</italic>A::G418<sup><italic>r</italic></sup></td><td align="left">this work</td></tr><tr><td align="left">JK41</td><td align="left">AX3</td><td align="left"><italic>ras</italic>S<sup>-</sup>, <italic>gef</italic>B<sup>-</sup></td><td align="left">this work</td></tr><tr><td align="left">JK42</td><td align="left">AX3</td><td align="left"><italic>ras</italic>S<sup>-</sup>, <italic>gef</italic>B<sup>-</sup></td><td align="left">this work</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Stability of DIR1 diploid cells under different growth conditions.

Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> shows the process of segregation of diploid cells. After two days growing in benomyl or thiabendazole, as many as 69% of the cells were aneuploid, with the rest split between diploid and haploid. Four days of treatment resulted in a population in which nearly all cells were haploid. It is therefore clear that segregation under axenic conditions is an efficient way of generating haploid progeny from diploid parents.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Segregation of diploids.

Several researchers have observed major differences in behaviour between AX2 and AX3, including cell size, macropinosome formation, and the phenotypes of mutations which affect proteins such as IQGAPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and RasS (R.H.I., unpublished data). These differences led us to wonder whether additional mutations were needed for optimal growth in addition to the three known axenic loci, and these were different in AX2 and AX3. In this case, diploids with one AX2 and one AX3-derived parent would grow more slowly than either parent, or even not at all. To our initial surprise, AX2/AX3 diploids (here named DIR2) are as healthy or healthier than either parent, giving robust growth in axenic medium, and producing large colonies which sometimes produce larger fruiting bodies than either parent (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In retrospect this observation is less surprising. AX2 and AX3 are known to carry the same three axenic mutations. Each was generated independently by heavy mutagenesis of NC4. They therefore presumably both carry a large number of secondary mutations, but in different loci. In AX2/AX3 diploids like DIR2, most of the secondary mutations from each parent are likely to be complemented by intact genes in the other.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Diploid hybrids between AX2 and AX3.

This in turn was crossed with a <italic>ras</italic>S null to give a <italic>ras</italic>S<sup>-</sup>/<italic>ras</italic>S<sup>wt </sup><italic>gef</italic>B<sup>-</sup>/<italic>gef</italic>B<sup>wt </sup>thyA<sup>G418</sup>/thyA<sup>wt </sup>diploid. When this diploid was segregated, all possible combinations of mutant and wild type in <italic>ras</italic>S and <italic>gef</italic>B were found, as shown by PCR screens (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>). We selected two <italic>ras</italic>S<sup>- </sup><italic>gef</italic>B<sup>- </sup>double mutant clones and named them JK41 and JK42. The whole procedure took a little over one month, with relatively few hours of hands-on work during that period.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Production of a <italic>ras</italic>S/<italic>gef</italic>B double mutant by parasexual recombination.

In particular, there was no sign of a synthetic phenotype &#x02013; in each case, the double mutants were no worse affected than their parents. Colonies resembled both parents in the morphology of their feeding fronts, producing fruiting bodies which resembled those produced by the <italic>gef</italic>B<sup>- </sup>parent (data not shown).

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> shows two such assays. In fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>, the cell speed of unstimulated, bacterially-grown double mutants is around three times the speed of wild type cells, comparable with both <italic>ras</italic>S<sup>- </sup>and <italic>gef</italic>B<sup>- </sup>parents. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref> shows the rate at which cells clear a suspension of bacteria. Wild type cells diminished the OD<sub>600 </sub>from 0.45 to below 0.2 in 5 hours. In the same interval, <italic>ras</italic>S<sup>- </sup>and <italic>gef</italic>B<sup>- </sup>mutants only cleared the OD<sub>600 </sub>to around 0.4. Both double mutants behaved in the same way, revealing a serious defect in phagocytosis in all mutant strains, but one that is not worsened by the double disruption.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Relative rates of (a) motility and (b) phagocytosis of <italic>ras</italic>S<sup>-</sup>, <italic>gef</italic>B<sup>- </sup>and double mutant strains.

Parasexual genetics and diploid cells have been rarely used in the past 20 years, principally because the selection schemes which were previously used are not appropriate for axenic culture, and are therefore impractical for most of the techniques and transformed cell lines used in molecular genetics. We have used a selection scheme which is ideal in axenic culture, and has the additional advantage of making highly stable diploids, because the selectable markers are present at the same genetic locus of each parent. We anticipate that our protocols will be widely used in coming years.</p><p>The ability to handle diploids allows several possibilities. Firstly, as described for <italic>ras</italic>S and <italic>gef</italic>B in this work, pre-existing mutants may be recombined to give double and multiple knockouts. Currently this technique does not permit intrachromosomal rearrangements, so only one locus per chromosome can be manipulated. Mitotic recombination and sexual crossover are both known to occur in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, though [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], so we look forward to addressing this limitation in the near future. Secondly, it will now be possible to make gene disruptions in genes thought to be required for survival. This will allow a test for genetic lethality, because heterozygote mutants will be unable to segregate into haploids containing the gene disruption. Thirdly, we will be able to address a number of issues where the parental background of mutants affects their phenotype. In many cases, inconsistent results have been obtained by comparing AX2- and AX3-based cells. For cells to grow axenically, at least three genes must be mutated. In the two most widely used axenic strains, AX2 and AX3, these mutations were generated by heavy mutagenesis followed by a long period of selection for growth in liquid medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. As a result, both AX2 and AX3 (which were generated independently) are less robust in growth on bacteria and development than their parent, NC4. Classical <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>mutagenesis using DNA-damaging agents causes multiple mutations, so we presume that both AX2 and AX3 strains have several secondary mutations which are responsible for this multifaceted lack of robustness. By making AX2/AX3 hybrids, we have generated a strain missing the secondary mutations which presumably cause inconsistency, and which should therefore be a much closer relative of wild type cells.</p><p>The lack of a synthetic phenotype in <italic>ras</italic>S and <italic>gef</italic>B double mutants strongly suggests that these genes are a part of the same genetic pathway. When the <italic>gef</italic>B gene was first disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the mutant phenotype's similarities to those of <italic>ras</italic>S nulls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] led to the conclusion that both genes acted in the same pathway. However, a detailed analysis of the motility of <italic>ras</italic>S and <italic>gef</italic>B mutants showed that, while both moved rapidly, the mechanisms underlying the rapid movement were completely different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. <italic>ras</italic>S null cells move by extending a number of short-lived, rapidly-extending pseudopods, while <italic>gef</italic>B nulls use a single, dominant pseudopod which is much larger than usual. These differences raised the possibility that <italic>ras</italic>S and <italic>gef</italic>B might be involved in different aspects of motility. This work strongly suggests that only a single pathway is involved, which leads to an opposite conclusion. The movement phenotypes of <italic>ras</italic>S and <italic>gef</italic>B mutants, different as they are on the surface, must be caused by the same underlying defect. Presumably this defect leads to rapid actin turnover, but the manner in which the excess actin is organised can vary from cell type to cell type. This is a surprising conclusion for the cell motility field, and an elegant demonstration of the usefulness of parasexual genetics. We also look forward to more detailed studies on the motility of the double mutants, which would show which pseudopod behaviour is dominant, or whether a third mechanism of rapid motility is seen.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The diploid systems described in this work are an important technical advance and will facilitate a number of experiments that are currently impractical. We have used parasexual recombination to show that <italic>rasS </italic>and <italic>gefB </italic>work through the same genetic pathway, presumably because the RasGEFB protein directly activates RasS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell strains and culture</title><p>For selection of diploids 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells of each parental strain were co-cultured in shaking flasks overnight in FM medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. For selections with G418 the medium was subsequently changed to normal HL-5 medium and selected at 10 &#x003bc;g/ml. All medium was supplemented with a cocktail of vitamins (20 &#x003bc;g/l biotin, 5 &#x003bc;g/l cyanocobalamin, 0.2 mg/l folic acid, 0.4 mg/l lipoic acid, 0.5 mg/l riboflavin, 0.6 mg/l thiamine).

In normal growth the mitotic index of axenic cells is &#x0003c;1%, therefore to facilitate observation of multiple mitotic nuclei the cells were treated with 33 &#x003bc;M nocodazole for a further 2 hours. This raised the mitotic index to 10&#x02013;20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Prior to fixation the medium was aspirated off and replaced with ice-cold distilled water for 10 minutes.
