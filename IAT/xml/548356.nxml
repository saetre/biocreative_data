The metabolism of Appr&#x0003e;p remains poorly defined. A cyclic phosphodiesterase (Cpd1p) has been shown to convert Appr&#x0003e;p to ADP-ribose-1&#x02033;-phosphate (Appr1p). We used a biochemical genomics approach to identify two yeast phosphatases that can convert Appr1p to ADP-ribose: the product of ORF YBR022w (now Poa1p), which is completely unrelated to other known phosphatases; and Hal2p, a known 3&#x02032;-phosphatase of 5&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-pAp. Poa1p is highly specific for Appr1p, and thus likely acts on this molecule <italic>in vivo</italic>. Poa1 has a relatively low <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> for Appr1p (2.8 &#x003bc;M) and a modest <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> (1.7 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), but no detectable activity on several other substrates. Furthermore, Poa1p is strongly inhibited by ADP-ribose (<italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub>, 17 &#x003bc;M), modestly inhibited by other nucleotides containing an ADP-ribose moiety and not inhibited at all by other tested molecules. In contrast, Hal2p is much more active on pAp than on Appr1p, and several other tested molecules were Hal2p substrates or inhibitors. <italic>poa1-&#x00394;</italic> mutants have no obvious growth defect at different temperatures in rich media, and analysis of yeast extracts suggests that &#x0223c;90% of Appr1p processing activity originates from Poa1p.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>tRNA splicing in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> occurs in three essential steps and produces the by-product adenosine diphosphate ribose 1&#x02033;,2&#x02033;-cyclic phosphate (Appr&#x0003e;p). In the first step of splicing, tRNA endonuclease recognizes the pre-tRNA and removes its intron, leaving a 5&#x02032; tRNA half-molecule with a 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032; cyclic phosphate on its 3&#x02032; end and a 3&#x02032; half-molecule with a hydroxyl on its 5&#x02032; end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). tRNA ligase opens the 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032; cyclic phosphate to a 2&#x02032;-phosphate, phosphorylates the hydroxyl on the 3&#x02032; half-molecule and joins the two half-molecules to leave a mature length tRNA with a 2&#x02032;-phosphate at the splice junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). This 2&#x02032;-phosphate is removed by tRNA 2&#x02032;-phosphotransferase in two distinguishable steps: ADP-ribosylation of the 2&#x02032;-phosphate with the cofactor NAD, followed by resolution of the intermediate to form mature length spliced tRNA and Appr&#x0003e;p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Hence, the cyclic phosphate of Appr&#x0003e;p originates as a backbone phosphate of the pre-tRNA, and Appr&#x0003e;p is produced in equimolar yield with spliced tRNA.</p><p>Determination of the pathway by which Appr&#x0003e;p is metabolized is of interest for two reasons. First, Appr&#x0003e;p is produced in appreciable quantities. Based on the number of tRNA molecules made per generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), and the fraction of tRNA genes with introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), it is estimated that &#x0223c;500&#x02009;000 molecules of tRNA are spliced per generation. In the absence of a metabolic breakdown pathway, Appr&#x0003e;p could reach a concentration of 10&#x02013;40 &#x003bc;M in the cell. Second, Appr&#x0003e;p could act as a regulatory molecule to signal the status of tRNA splicing in the cell, since it is produced every time a tRNA is spliced, and tRNA splicing is likely the only significant source of the molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Appr&#x0003e;p may also be produced during <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA splicing in the unfolded protein response, since tRNA ligase is involved in the joining step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), and the resulting 2&#x02032;-phosphate would likely have to be removed by Tpt1p. However, if so, the amount of Appr&#x0003e;p produced by <italic>HAC1</italic> splicing would be negligible compared with that produced by tRNA splicing, based on the number of <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA molecules likely to be made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>A likely first step in Appr&#x0003e;p metabolism in yeast extracts is the conversion of Appr&#x0003e;p to adenosine diphosphate ribose-1&#x02033;-phosphate (Appr1p) by Cpd1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). A highly specific cyclic phosphodiesterase was originally identified in yeast extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Subsequently, this activity was attributed to <italic>CPD1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), Cpd1p was shown to encode cyclic phosphodiesterase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), and extracts from <italic>cpd1-&#x00394;</italic> yeast strains were shown to have no detectable CPDase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). These results suggest that Cpd1p acts on Appr&#x0003e;p <italic>in vivo</italic> to produce Appr1p, although there is no evidence that explicitly addresses this role.</p><p>To determine the next step in Appr&#x0003e;p metabolism, we extended a previous search of a yeast genomic library of purified glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase&#x02013;open reading frame (GST&#x02013;ORF) fusion proteins to find proteins that act on Appr1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). We report here that ORF YBR022w (now named <italic>POA1</italic>) and <italic>HAL2</italic> each encode phosphatases that can convert Appr1p to ADP-ribose <italic>in vitro</italic>. Poa1p is unusual because it is substantially more specific and slower than most phosphatases that act on small molecules; of a number of substrates tested, only Appr1p is appreciably dephosphorylated by Poa1p. Hal2p was previously described as a 3&#x02032;-phosphatase acting on pAp produced during methionine biosynthesis in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Although Hal2p prefers pAp as a substrate to other common nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), Hal2p has appreciable activity on Appr1p in our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. Although either protein could catalyze a phosphatase reaction after Cpd1p converts Appr&#x0003e;p to Appr1p, our evidence suggests that Poa1p is responsible for &#x0223c;90% of Appr1p processing activity in yeast extracts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains, plasmids and growth</title><p>Strains NSY32 (<italic>hal2::kan</italic>, clone ID#1756) and NSY34 (<italic>poa1::kan</italic>, clone ID#3159) are derivatives of strain NSY60 (BY4741, <bold>MATa</bold>, <italic>his3-&#x00394;1</italic>, <italic>leu2-&#x00394;0</italic>, <italic>ura3-&#x00394;0</italic>, <italic>met15-&#x00394;0</italic>, <italic>lys2-&#x00394;0</italic>), and were purchased from Open Biosystems.

Assignment of Appr1p processing activity to this ORF involved purification of 64 pools of GST&#x02013;ORF fusion proteins, each derived from 96 strains, assays of the pools and deconvolution of the active pool 6 to show that ORF YBR022w is associated with the activity.</p><p>Another screen of this same library, using Appr1p labeled with <sup>32</sup>P on the phosphate adjacent to the adenosine (denoted Ap*pr1p, see Materials and Methods), and longer incubation times for increased sensitivity, revealed pool 6, as expected, as well as pool 49, as having apparently identical activity on Appr1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In each case, it appears that three products are formed during the reaction, labeled I, II and III. Deconvolution of pool 49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) shows that Appr1p processing activity co-purifies with the previously described pAp phosphatase, Hal2p (Met22p).</p><p>The products of ORF YBR022w and Hal2p could each have catalytic activity, could each be associated with separate activities or could both be part of the same complex. To examine the activity of the proteins separately from other yeast components, each protein was expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> and purified. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, crude extracts from cells expressing each protein produce a prominent polypeptide of the expected size (27 kDa for the product of ORF YBR022w and 45 kDa for Hal2p) that is absent in control extracts (cf. lanes a and b and lanes e and f). Each protein was then purified by immobilized metal-ion chromatography (see Materials and Methods), resulting in substantially purified preparations, as determined by SDS&#x02013;PAGE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes c, d, g and h). Examination of Appr1p processing activity demonstrates that YBR022w protein and Hal2p have similar activities, each producing substantial amounts of products I and II, but much less of product III, which co-migrates with AMP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes c&#x02013;g and lanes h&#x02013;l).</p><p>Since Hal2p is a known phosphatase acting on the 3&#x02032;-phosphate of pAp, it seems likely that both YBR022w protein and Hal2p are phosphatases acting on the 1&#x02033;-phosphate of Appr1p, although the appearance of two products from each protein was unexpected. To further characterize the products observed upon reaction with these proteins, we compared the activities of YBR022w protein and Hal2p with that of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, incubation of Appr1p with CIP yields the same characteristic two products I and II as YBR022w protein and Hal2p, both of which co-migrate with ADP-ribose from a commercially obtained standard (cf. lanes c&#x02013;g and h&#x02013;l with lanes m&#x02013;q). We have confirmed that CIP and YBR022w protein produce the same products from Appr1p with several other TLC systems, although in most of these systems ADP-ribose migrates as a single spot (data not shown). This result demonstrates that YBR022w protein and Hal2p are phosphatases that remove the 1&#x02033;-phosphate from Appr1p, and therefore we assigned the name <italic>POA1</italic> to ORF YBR022w (phosphatase of ADP-ribose 1&#x02033;-p).</p></sec><sec><title>A kinetic characterization of Poa1p and Hal2p reveals differing catalytic efficiencies for Appr1p</title><p>To evaluate the possible contribution of each protein to Appr1p metabolism, we compared the steady-state kinetic parameters of Poa1p and Hal2p with Appr1p and with pAp, the previously known substrate of Hal2p. We used labeled Appr1p and pAp to monitor phosphatase activity and measured the reaction progress as a function of increasing concentration of either substrate. Both spots that have been identified as ADP-ribose (I and II) were summed to equal the total amount of products in each reaction and all reactions were linear over the time measured. Some representative time courses for the hydrolysis of Appr1p with Poa1p are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. The resulting initial rates were plotted as a function of substrate concentration and were fit to the Michaelis&#x02013;Menten equation to yield the steady-state <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> for each enzyme and substrate combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; data not shown). The data were well described by this equation and are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>The results of the kinetic characterizations indicate that Poa1p is a more efficient enzyme for hydrolysis of Appr1p than Hal2p, although both act relatively slowly on this substrate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). With Appr1p, both enzymes have similar <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values (Poa1p, <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> = 1.7 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, Hal2p, <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> = 3.2 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), but Poa1p has an &#x0223c;25-fold lower <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> (Poa1p, <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> = 2.8 &#x003bc;M, Hal2p, <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> = 74 &#x003bc;M), resulting in a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> difference of 14-fold in favor of Poa1p. Thus, this data suggest that either enzyme could work on Appr1p <italic>in vivo</italic> in yeast.</p><p>Hal2p greatly prefers its known substrate pAp, whereas Poa1p appears to not recognize this substrate. Consistent with previously published values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), we find that Hal2p has a much lower <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> (0.1 &#x003bc;M) and a much higher <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> (54 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) for pAp than is observed for Appr1p. In contrast, Poa1p has no detectable activity on pAp, under conditions where a turnover of 0.005 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (0.3% of the activity with Appr1p) should be easily observed (data not shown). Thus, Hal2p prefers the substrate pAp by 10<sup>4</sup>-fold relative to Appr1p, as measured by <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values, whereas Poa1p prefers Appr1p at least 340-fold relative to pAp, as measured by observed rates.</p><p>A number of experiments confirmed that the slow rate of Appr1p hydrolysis by Poa1p was likely not an artifact.</p><p>First, we showed that the position or the presence of the purification tag did not affect the activity. Titration experiments of purified proteins demonstrate that Poa1p with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag is equally as active as Poa1p with a C-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag, and titrations of extracts demonstrate that the His<sub>6</sub>-Poa1p has the same activity as Poa1p with a different N-terminal tag, or Poa1p with no tag at all (data not shown).</p><p>Second, the activity of Poa1p is not stimulated by altering salt concentrations. Indeed, as the salt was raised from 4 to 104 mM, the rate of hydrolysis was reduced by 21% under <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> conditions, and by 72% under <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> conditions.</p><p>Third, the activity of Poa1p was not significantly affected by pH under <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> or <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> conditions. We determined the rate of hydrolysis of Appr1p by Poa1p at different pH values ranging from pH 4.0 to pH 8.0, using a concentration of Appr1p well below the <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> under standard conditions (25 nM). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, a bell-shaped curve is observed under <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> conditions, with pKa values at pH 5.0 and pH 7.0, and a maximum at &#x0223c;pH 6.0. However, the rate of hydrolysis at pH 6.0 is only &#x0223c;3.5-fold greater than that at pH 7.5. Experiments with different buffers at several pH values ensure that these differences are not due to buffer effects. A similar small difference was observed under <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> conditions. At Appr1p concentrations of 40 &#x003bc;M, well above the <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> at pH 7.5, the observed rate of Appr1p hydrolysis varied only &#x0223c;2-fold as the pH was varied from 7.5 to 6.2 (data not shown). Thus, Poa1p phosphatase activity is not affected significantly at either high or low concentrations of Appr1p within this pH range.</p></sec><sec><title>Poa1p is highly specific for Appr1p</title><p>Although Poa1p is a relatively slow phosphatase when acting on Appr1p, it appears to be highly specific for this substrate. We examined a number of other small molecules as possible substrates for Poa1p, but did not find any other molecule that was subject to Poa1p-catalyzed dephosphorylation. Ribose-1-p was a likely candidate, because Poa1p removes the 1&#x02033; phosphate from the ribose moiety of Appr1p; however, no significant activity (&#x0003c;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was found from an overnight incubation of 5.3 &#x003bc;M Poa1p with ribose-1-p*, when assayed at both low and high concentrations of the substrate. Similarly, Poa1p had no detectable activity above background (&#x0003c;0.004&#x02013;0.01 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) with 1 mM concentrations of other potential substrates, including pAp, NADP, ribose-5-p, fructose-6-p, Gp, G<sup>p</sup>, Ap, A<sup>p</sup>, pA, U<sup>p</sup>, C<sup>p</sup> and 5&#x02032;2&#x02032; pAp using a sensitive colorimetric assay (see Materials and Methods), and assays at either the optimum pH or in many cases also at pH 7.5. In contrast, CIP exhibited phosphatase activity on all of the substrates.</p></sec><sec><title>Poa1p specifically recognizes the ADP-ribose moiety</title><p>Of a number of molecules examined as potential inhibitors of Poa1p, only those with an ADP-ribose moiety have any significant effect. We surveyed the effect of 10 mM concentrations of various nucleotides and sugar phosphates on the activity of Poa1p measured at Appr1p concentrations well below <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> (26 nM), or at 1.8 <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> (5 &#x003bc;M), and then determined IC<sub>50</sub> values of those that inhibited. Poa1p phosphatase activity was strongly inhibited by ADP-ribose (IC<sub>50</sub>, 30 &#x003bc;M), moderately inhibited by other molecules that contained an ADP-ribose moiety (AppA, NAD and NADP, with IC<sub>50</sub> values in therange 1&#x02013;2 mM), marginally inhibited by ADP, Ap and C<sup>p</sup> (with IC<sub>50</sub> values &#x0003e; 10 mM) and not inhibited at all by any other tested nucleotide or sugar phosphate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This result underscores the suggestion that Poa1p is specific for Appr1p, and suggests further that recognition involves the ADP-ribose moiety. In contrast, Appr1p phosphatase activity of Hal2p (monitored at concentrations of Appr1p well below <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>) is inhibited by a variety of molecules including ADP-ribose, NADP, Ap, pAp, G<sup>p</sup> and ribose 5-phosphate, as might be expected of a phosphatase with several substrates (data not shown).</p><p>To determine the mode of inhibition of ADP-ribose, the strongest of the Poa1p inhibitors, initial rates were determined at varied concentrations of both Appr1p (0.031&#x02013;25 &#x003bc;M) and ADP-ribose (0&#x02013;300 &#x003bc;M). The resulting inverse initial rates for each substrate concentration were plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), yielding plots with slopes that vary as a function of [S], and converge on the same <italic>y</italic>-intercept, indicative of classical competitive inhibition. A Dixon plot of the resulting slopes for each line versus 1/[Appr1p] yields the <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub>,<sub>ADP-ribose</sub> of 17 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Therefore, Poa1p is strongly inhibited by the product of its own reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Extracts of <italic>poa1-&#x00394;</italic> mutants have little activity on Appr1p <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Examination of Appr1p processing in yeast extracts suggests that Poa1p is responsible for most of the observed Appr1p phosphatase activity. We compared the activity of crude extracts from a wild-type control haploid strain with those from <italic>poa1-&#x00394;</italic> mutants, <italic>hal2-&#x00394;</italic> mutants and <italic>poa1-&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>hal2-&#x00394;</italic> double mutants (see Materials and Methods). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, high concentrations of a wild-type extract (lane a) produce predominantly Pi, whereas lower concentrations (lanes b and c) produce primarily AMP. Presumably, ADP-ribose is formed initially, and then rapidly cleaved by a pyrophosphatase to produce AMP, which is then hydrolyzed by another phosphatase to yield Pi. Although ADP-ribose co-migrates with AMP in the TLC shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, resolution of the products in a different TLC system demonstrates that little ADP-ribose is evident in the products (data not shown). Quantification of the titrations shows that Appr1p is 50% processed by 1.8 &#x003bc;g wild-type extract, 1.2 &#x003bc;g <italic>hal2-&#x00394;</italic> extract, 33 &#x003bc;g <italic>poa1-&#x00394;</italic> extract or 20 &#x003bc;g <italic>poa1-&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>hal2-&#x00394;</italic> double mutant extract. Thus, in crude extracts under these conditions, Poa1p is responsible for &#x0223c;90% of the phosphatase activity on Appr1p, while Hal2p has little detectable activity on this molecule. The phosphatase activity that is remaining in a <italic>poa1-&#x00394;</italic> extract is likely due to one or more non-specific phosphatases, since it is inhibited by Gp, an unrelated substrate (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Poa1p has no significant homologies by blast search</title><p>Comparison of the sequence of Poa1p with other proteins in available databases reveals little sequence homology to other proteins as determined by BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) and, in particular, no homology to any known phosphatase. Poa1p is a member of a family that is highly conserved in <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> (e<sup>&#x02212;53</sup>) and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (e<sup>&#x02212;22</sup>), as well as four other fungal species (e<sup>&#x02212;20</sup> to e<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>), but only poorly conserved in other organisms. The best other BLAST score is 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, with an Enterobacteria phage RB69 sequence for a homologous protein of unknown function (accession nos AAP76015.1 and GI:32350416). The role of these homologs in their respective organisms is unknown. The entire Poa1p sequence has also been defined as a domain in the SMART database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smart.embl.-heidelberg.de/smart/do_annotation.pl?DOMAIN=A1pp"/>). This domain, A1pp, occurs in 301 proteins from organisms in all three major kingdoms. Notably, the A1pp domain occurs three times in human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 14, in the C-terminal region of the macro-histone H2A family, and in the non-structural proteins of some single-stranded RNA viruses. We note that Poa1p does not appear in any of the physical interaction, genetic interaction or localization data sets, as summarized at the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/"/>); thus, there is no additional information about its function.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have identified two phosphatases that can act on Appr1p, a probable downstream product of the tRNA splicing pathway in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, to produce ADP-ribose: Poa1p, a previously undescribed protein; and Hal2p, a known phosphatase that acts on pAp produced during methionine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). The kinetic data suggest that either enzyme could act on Appr1p <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although Poa1p has a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> for Appr1p that is &#x0223c;14-fold higher than that of Hal2p for this molecule (1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> versus 7.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>2</sup>), this preference is partially offset by the 6.3-fold increased cellular concentration of Hal2p relative to Poa1p (7330 versus 1170 molecules) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>).</p><p>Two lines of evidence suggest that Poa1p is responsible for Appr1p phosphatase activity in the cell. First, Poa1p is highly specific for Appr1p. A survey of a number of small molecules yielded no other potential substrate of Poa1p, under conditions where 0.3% of the activity observed with Appr1p could be detected. Furthermore, among a variety of molecules tested, significant inhibition of Poa1p activity is only observed from dinucleoside pyrophosphates bearing an ADP-ribose moiety (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that this moiety is a major determinant of specificity. In contrast, Hal2p is a much less specific phosphatase for Appr1p; indeed, Hal2p is known to remove the 3&#x02032;-phosphate of pAp and the 2&#x02032;-phosphate of certain nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), in addition to its activity described here on the phosphate at the 1 position of ribose. Second, &#x0223c;90% of the activity observed in cell extracts appears to be due to Poa1p, as determined by the analysis of extracts from mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, the remainder is likely due to a phosphatase other than Hal2p, based on the lack of observed difference in Appr1p phosphatase activity between wild-type and <italic>hal2-&#x00394;</italic> extracts, and between <italic>poa1-&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>poa1-&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>hal2-&#x00394;</italic> extracts; this minor phosphatase was not observed in our genomic survey, perhaps because the proteome examined is not complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that Poa1p acts on Appr1p in the cell.</p><p>Poa1p is an unusual phosphatase in two respects. First, it lacks homology with any other phosphatase. Other known small molecule phosphatases in yeast are members of a yeast phosphatase family or have close orthologs in other organisms (BLAST scores of e<sup>&#x02212;30</sup> or less). For example, among yeast phosphatases Pho3p, Pho5p, Pho11p, Pho12p and Dia3p form a highly homologous family, with &#x0003e;75% identity among them, and Dog1p, Dog2p, Gpp1p and Gpp2p align with &#x0003e;35% identity. Similarly, two other yeast phosphatases, His2p and Ser2p, are highly conserved phosphatases from species to species, with roles in amino acid biosynthesis, and Hal2p shares a conserved domain with fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase according to the cDART database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/lexington/lexington.cgi"/>). In contrast, Poa1p is not closely related to any known phosphatase by these search methods. The only connection to a protein of known function is the presence of the A1pp domain of Poa1p in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 14 and in the macro-histone H2A family, as defined by the SMART database. This A1pp domain in other proteins may have a similar phosphatase activity or a similar ADP-ribose binding activity to that of Poa1p.</p><p>Second, Poa1p is highly specific for its substrate Appr1p. A large number of acid and alkali phosphatases found in <italic>E.coli</italic> and eukaryotes remove phosphates from a wide range of small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>); indeed, even metabolic phosphatases, such as glucose-6-phosphatase, have significant activity on several other substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). In contrast, the high specificity of Poa1p for its substrate Appr1p is much more similar to the high specificity of regulatory phosphatases, such as fructose 2,6 bisphosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>).</p><p>The results described here illuminate the likely last steps of a unique metabolic pathway, in which Appr&#x0003e;p is formed during tRNA splicing and then broken down to more common metabolites after splicing. Formation requires the sequential action of tRNA ligase to generate ligated tRNA with a splice junction 2&#x02032;-phosphate, and Tpt1p to transfer the phosphate to NAD to form Appr&#x0003e;p. Breakdown of Appr&#x0003e;p is likely initiated by Cpd1p, generating Appr1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). This is inferred from the lack of Appr&#x0003e;p cyclic phosphodiesterase activity in extracts lacking Cpd1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), and the specificity of Cpd1p for Appr&#x0003e;p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) (N. P. Shull and E. M. Phizicky, unpublished data), although others have found that Cpd1p is only modestly specific for Appr&#x0003e;p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Then, based on the results described here, Appr1p is processed by Poa1p, and possibly another minor phosphatase, to generate ADP-ribose. Finally, it seems likely that a pyrophosphatase converts ADP-ribose to AMP, based on the observed production of pA and subsequently Pi in extracts. Since <italic>poa1-&#x00394;</italic> extracts lack most of the Appr1p phosphatase activity, and produce much less pA and Pi than wild-type extracts, we conclude that the pyrophosphatase acts primarily on ADP-ribose and not on Appr1p.</p><p>The recent remarkable findings of Schwer <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>) demonstrate that the otherwise essential ligase/phosphotransferase pathway of tRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) can be replaced by T4 enzymes that ligate tRNAs without producing splice junction 2&#x02032;-phosphates or Appr&#x0003e;p, and that cells expressing the corresponding T4 genes have no obvious growth defect. We speculated previously that Appr&#x0003e;p might have a regulatory role because it is formed in equimolar yield during tRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Although the results of Schwer <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>) suggest that the production of Appr&#x0003e;p is not essential, the accumulation of Appr&#x0003e;p could have cellular consequences.</p><p>We note that the cellular population of Poa1p is not quite enough to clear all of the Appr1p generated by tRNA splicing and the subsequent action of Cpd1p, based on our estimate of 500&#x02009;000 tRNAs spliced per generation, the concentration of Poa1p in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) and the kinetic parameters of Poa1p. Experiments described above establish that the low hydrolysis rate of Poa1p is not due to factors, such as salt concentration, pH or the presence of the purification tag on the protein. Rather, the slow turnover might be inherent to the protein, perhaps due to the slow release of ADP-ribose. Thus, there may be a basal concentration of Appr1p in the cell, unless Poa1p is stimulated by other cellular factors, or there is another source of Appr1p processing activity. We note that Cpd1p does not stimulate or inhibit Poa1p under <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> or <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> conditions. It is possible that the slow turnover of Poa1p is tolerated due to the low metabolic demand for Appr1p processing and the lack of physiological consequence of Appr1p in the cell. In this connection, we note that <italic>poa1-&#x00394;</italic> mutants, which might be expected to accumulate Appr1p, have no obvious growth phenotype in rich media at different temperatures, and that <italic>poa1-&#x00394; hal2-&#x00394;</italic> double mutants do not have any noticeable growth defect relative to single mutants.
