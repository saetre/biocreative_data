The ovary is organized as a bundle of individual ovarioles, each of which contains germline stem cells at its anterior tip. These stem cells give rise to 16-cell cysts that mature into functional oocytes as the cysts move along the ovariole. After pre-meiotic DNA replication and recombination are completed, the oocyte enters an extended prophase while the cyst matures, concluding with nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB). After NEB, the meiotic chromosomes build an acentriolar spindle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Theurkauf1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, and then undergo an extended prometaphase that concludes with the chromosomes arresting at metaphase I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Gilliland1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition to the changes in the oocyte nucleus, numerous changes in the 16-cell cyst and its contents are also taking place throughout oocyte development, including the growth and degradation of the polytene nurse and follicle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Brand1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, the kenotic dumping of nurse cell contents into the oocyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-MahajanMiklos1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, the formation of a membranous sheath around the meiotic spindle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Kramer1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, the growth of the dorsal appendages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Tran1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, and the maturation of the vitelline membrane and chorion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-King1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

These filaments, which were present in &#x0223c;70&#x00025; of wildtype oocytes, did not colocalize with tested candidate structural proteins (including tubulin, actin, anillin, septin, or lamin), appeared to polymerize at the onset of NEB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Gilliland3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, and were not observed in syncytial embryos, although some early preblastoderm embryos showed Mps1 localization to small filaments or foci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Pandey1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, consistent with the filaments being disassembled shortly after fertilization.

Therefore, the assembly and disassembly of these filaments appears to be taking place in parallel with the maturation of other oocyte contents at NEB, and the localization of Mps1 and Polo to the filaments could potentially have important functional consequences for the regulation of this process. Interestingly, despite the fact that there is no Mps1 homolog in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Winey1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, similar-appearing filaments containing kinetochore components in <italic>C. elegans</italic> prometaphase oocytes have also been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Monen1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that these filaments may represent an evolutionarily conserved structure.</p><p>While our previous study reported the existence of these filaments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes, it did not identify the structural backbone components, address their functional role in the oocyte, or determine why they were not present in all oocytes. Here, we demonstrate that rather than being components of the filaments themselves, Mps1 and Polo proteins are transiently localized to the filaments in response to hypoxia on a time scale of approximately 10 minutes. This localization is reversible, and repeated exposure to hypoxia indicates that the filaments are static structures to which Mps1 and Polo become sequestered. Furthermore, we use immunogold electron microscopy to characterize the filaments as being proteinaceous structures approximately 150 nm in diameter, with the Mps1 localizing in a triple-helical pattern on the surface. The Mps1 and Polo localization to filaments is also disrupted by the injection of collagenase, suggesting that the structural components of the filaments include one of a number of proteins bearing a collagenase cleavage site in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome. However, the two collagen-like genes we have tested (<italic>vkg</italic> and <italic>CG42543</italic>) have not appeared to associate with the filaments. Finally, similar to Mps1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Pandey1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, we show that during mitosis hypoxia changes the localization of Polo, suggesting a role for this protein in mediating the hypoxic response.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Localization of Mps1 and Polo to filaments is a transient response to hypoxia</title><p>Based on fixed images, we reported that Mps1 and Polo filament formation appeared to initiate at the onset of nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Gilliland3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, an observation that has been confirmed by analysis of subsequent oocytes that were fixed during the process of NEB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007544-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

An image of a late stage 12 or early stage 13 GFP-Polo oocyte, which was presumably fixed in the early stages of nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB), with the anterior end of the oocyte on the left and the posterior end on the right. While this image is of a fixed sample and it is therefore impossible to be certain that this oocyte is undergoing NEB, the characteristics of the cell (the shape of the karyosome (inset), the growth of the dorsal appendages, and the appearance of the nuclear envelope) are all similar to those of oocytes that were imaged going through NEB. The GFP-Polo filaments cannot be seen at this magnification. 1B. A composite of five individual image stacks, showing the GFP-Polo localization of the region inside the rectangle in 1A. Note the GFP-Polo localization to the nuclear envelope on the left. The filaments become shorter and less abundant moving across the oocyte from posterior to anterior, with the location of the last resolvable filaments indicated (asterisk). This pattern is consistent with the linear polymerization of filaments occurring at NEB, with filaments growing linearly from &#x0201c;seeds&#x0201d; and polymerization being triggered by a wave that propagates across the oocyte from posterior to anterior.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0007544.g001"/></fig><p>This failure to observe oocytes in long-duration live-imaging was unexpected, as approximately 70&#x00025; of fixed prometaphase oocytes contained filaments, and our previous study had readily observed GFP filaments with both fixed oocytes expressing GFP-Mps1 and in live oocytes expressing GFP-Polo. This was also not an artifact of the GFP tag, as filaments were first identified by antibodies against native Mps1 protein, and we had previously demonstrated that GFP-Polo and anti-Mps1 antibody highlighted the same structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Gilliland3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The previous observation of GFP-Polo filaments in live oocytes also ruled out the possibility that the failure to find filaments was a fixation artifact, and indicated that the cause of the failure to find the filaments using our standard protocol for live-imaging reflected a way the experiment was methodologically different from previous GFP imaging experiments.</p><p>Among the methodological differences between the previously published live imaging of the GFP-Polo line and our standard long duration live-imaging protocol were the steps taken to prolong oocyte viability. When preparing oocytes for GFP-Polo imaging, females had been anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub> and dissected oocytes were covered with a glass coverslip for immediate visualization. However, using our standard protocol for long duration live-imaging analysis of oocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Hughes1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> preparations are covered in an oxygen-permeable membrane, and the time required for sample preparation meant that imaging did not begin until &#x0223c;20 minutes after anesthetization. As Mps1 is required to correctly arrest mitotic <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells in response to hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Fischer1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and is relocalized to kinetochores during hypoxia in mitotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Pandey1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, we hypothesized that the localization of Mps1 to ooplasmic filaments was also a response to hypoxia. The previous GFP-Polo experiments would then have found GFP-Polo attached to filaments due to the oocytes still being hypoxic after CO<sub>2</sub> anesthetization of the flies prior to fixation.</p><p>To test this possibility, we prepared live oocytes with an oxygen permeable membrane, and after examination of oocytes to verify the absence of GFP filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007544-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), we induced hypoxia by filling a chamber covering the stage with CO<sub>2</sub>. For both GFP-Mps1 and GFP-Polo, GFP became visibly associated with filaments after approximately 8&#x02013;12 minutes of CO<sub>2</sub> (GFP-Mps1 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007544-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; GFP-Polo data not shown).

Reapplication of CO<sub>2</sub> restored the localization to filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007544-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), which despite some movement during the course of live-imaging, reappeared in approximately the same locations throughout the oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007544-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0007544-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007544.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Hypoxia reversibly sequesters GFP-Mps1 to filaments.</title><p>A live stage 13 GFP-Mps1 oocyte, positioned with the anterior end at the upper right and the posterior end towards the lower left, shows reversible sequestration of GFP-Mps1 to filaments under hypoxia. The entire cell was larger than the microscope's field of view at this magnification. Five other oocytes on the same slide were monitored (but not imaged) at the 2A, 2B, and 2D time points; all exhibited similar localization of GFP-Mps1 to filaments. 2A: Prior to exposure to CO<sub>2</sub>, the oocyte does not exhibit GFP-Mps1 localization to filaments. 2B: After exposure to CO<sub>2</sub>, GFP-Mps1 shows localization to both ooplasmic filaments as well as small foci along the meiotic spindle (arrow).

This image shows that the cell has flattened out slightly, as the lateral width across the cell has increased, and some filaments have moved slightly. However, most of the filaments have reappeared with the same topology and in roughly the same locations (300&#x00025; enlargement of area near center, inset).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0007544.g002"/></fig><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that this localization is a specific response to hypoxia and not a generalized stress response or due to CO<sub>2</sub> acidification of buffer during incubation. First, filaments could be observed in live imaging by the use of N<sub>2</sub> gas as well as CO<sub>2</sub>, and were also observed in flies that were held in CO<sub>2</sub> for 10 minutes prior to dissection and immediate fixation (data not shown). Second, incubation of oocytes in the presence of sodium azide, which inhibits mitochondrial respiration and can trigger the hypoxic response in mitotic <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Pandey1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, causes localization of GFP-Mps1 to the filaments. <italic>In vitro</italic> incubation of oocytes in 0.03&#x00025; sodium azide resulted in 92&#x00025; (34/37) of fixed GFP-Mps1 oocytes displaying filaments, compared to 3&#x00025; (1/33) of incubation-only control oocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007544.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Third, heat-shocking GFP-Mps1 or GFP-Polo oocytes by incubating them under normoxic conditions at 37&#x000b0;C did not induce localization of GFP to filaments even after 18 minutes of heat shock. This lack of localization was not due to an inability of heat-shocked oocytes to carry out the localization, as subsequent exposure of those same oocytes to CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000b0;C led to GFP filament localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007544.s003">Movie S2</xref>). These experiments demonstrate that localization of GFP-Polo and GFP-Mps1 to filaments is a specific response to hypoxia that does not occur in response to other forms of cellular stress, such as CO<sub>2</sub> acidification or heat shock. We furthermore conclude, as the GFP-decorated filaments reappear in the same locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007544-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), that Mps1 and Polo must localize to static scaffolds that are still present under normoxic conditions. According to this view, Mps1 and Polo are not structural components of the filaments, but instead are transiently sequestered to the filaments during the hypoxic response.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Characterization of filaments by immunogold electron microscopy</title><p>To better characterize the structural nature of these filaments, we set out to examine GFP-Mps1 decorated filaments by electron microscopy. We incubated GFP-Mps1 oocytes under conditions that were known to produce robust Mps1-bearing filaments. Oocytes were then fixed and those with strong GFP filaments were selected for postfixation, cryosectioning and labeling with anti-GFP antibody followed by visualization with gold-conjugated secondary antibody. The immunogold label was found to be associated with long protein-dense fibers of approximately 150 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007544-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These fibers are entirely consistent with those observed by fluorescent cytology, as this diameter would be well below the half-wavelength resolution limit of the light microscope and consistent with their appearance as thin fibers. In both cross sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007544-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and transverse sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007544-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) of the fibers, the immunogold label is associated in rows along the surface of the fibers, which appears in a multiply helical configuration.

This is not an artifact caused by the GFP tag, as filaments were first identified by antibodies against the native proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Gilliland3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This dependency on hypoxia explains the observations in our previous study of Mps1 and Polo localization to the filaments, as groups of flies were anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub> prior to dissection. This was done on a time scale (no more than 15 minutes from initial CO<sub>2</sub> exposure to addition of the fixation buffer) that was very close to the filament transition time. This was a serendipitous coincidence; if the transition time was on the order of 1 minute, the proteins would have had time to dissociate from the filaments between removal from the CO<sub>2</sub> plate and fixation, while if the transition time was on the order of 20 minutes or longer, they would not have had time to complete their initial association with the filaments prior to fixation. In either situation, we would have never observed the filaments. This type of localization also explains a number of other features of the filaments; for instance, some fixed oocytes have filaments with higher or lower contrast to the ooplasmic background, which can be explained by those oocytes having a higher or lower proportion of the available protein sequestered to the filaments at the moment of fixation.</p><p>The structural proteins underlying the filaments also appear to remain during normoxic conditions and only become identifiable when the Mps1 and Polo proteins are localized to them. This conclusion is supported by three observations. First, during the initial appearance of filaments during NEB, they appear to be polymerizing linearly, in a wave that propagates from the posterior end of the oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007544-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Gilliland3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. If the filaments were not forming at NEB and were instead forming at the point hypoxia was applied, then we would expect to find filaments that had been fixed in mid-growth during other stages of oogenesis. However, filaments that appear to still be in the process of growing (based on their short and relatively uniform lengths) have never been observed in oocytes that have clearly progressed into prometaphase. Second, during localization of GFP-Mps1 or GFP-Polo to filaments in live oocytes, the filaments light up and fade out all along their lengths instead of growing from one end (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007544.s002">Movie S1</xref>). Third, after restoration of normoxia, a subsequent return to hypoxia causes the filaments to reappear in the same places (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007544-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). This pattern is consistent with the sequestration of proteins to an underlying filament that remains present through normoxia. Taken together these observations also appear to indicate that the underlying filaments have fully formed prior to the initial entry into hypoxia. An analogy that closely reflects this type of structure would be a flock of birds landing on a thin wire. While the birds are in flight, the wire is still present but cannot be seen. However, once the birds come to roost, the location of the wire is easily inferred, and when the flock takes flight again the wire is still present.</p><p>The EM images also reveal that the localization of Mps1 to filaments is in well-structured rows that only occupy a small proportion of the available surface of the much larger filaments. However, what proportion of the electron-dense structure highlighted by immuno-EM is the underlying structural proteins versus other proteins that are transiently sequestered to it is not yet known. The triple-helical appearance of the immunogold label, and the sensitivity of the Mps1 and Polo localization to collagenase, are consistent with the underlying protein scaffold being a collagen-like protein. However, we note that the genome of <italic>Drosophila</italic> only has three identified collagen genes, and entirely lacks a canonical Type I collagen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Hynes1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, which is the type known to form long linear triple-helical filaments. We have been able to test <italic>vkg</italic> and <italic>CG42543</italic> (one with Vkg-GFP, the other with anti-Mps1 antibody in a <italic>CG42543<sup>f07253</sup></italic> homozygote, both data not shown) neither of which appeared to affect the filaments. While it is possible that Dcg1 is part of the filament backbone, the typical net-like structure of Type IV collagens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Blumberg1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> does not appear consistent with the filaments highlighted by Mps1 and Polo. Furthermore, there are reasons to expect that there are other collagen-like genes in the genome that have not been annotated. One study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-LeParco1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> screened a <italic>Drosophila</italic> library for clones that hybridized to a chicken collagen sequence. They then localized those clones through <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, and identified 10 putative collagen-like loci across the fly genome. Two of these corresponded to <italic>Dcg1</italic> and <italic>vkg</italic>, but the remaining eight loci identified in that study have never been cloned. Furthermore, <italic>CG42543</italic> did not map to any of the loci identified by hybridization (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flybase.org">www.flybase.org</ext-link>). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that there are a non-trivial number of potential collagen-like genes that could be examined in an exhaustive candidate-based approach.</p><p>We also cannot rule out the possibility that collagenase is cleaving one or more proteins that are required for the localization of Mps1 to the filament, rather than the structural proteins in the filament itself. The recognition site for the collagenase enzyme is Pro-X-Gly-Pro, where X is usually a neutral residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-1993Worthington1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. While eGFP, Mps1 or Polo do not contain any such recognition sites, searching all annotated protein sequences in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome for that sequence identifies 915 genes that contain one or more potential cleavage sites, including the three annotated collagen genes mentioned above. One possible approach to identifying the structural components of the filaments would be to immunoprecipitate Mps1 or Polo under hypoxic and normoxic conditions and use proteomics to identify those proteins that only precipitate under hypoxic conditions. We have attempted this approach, and while we have been successful in getting Mps1 and Polo to co-IP under hypoxic conditions (WDG, NMS and RSH, unpublished data), attempts to wash the precipitates sufficiently for proteomic analysis were unsuccessful. We believe that this is either due to the transient nature of the association of Mps1/Polo with the filaments being too tenuous to pull down the very large filament backbones, or the association between the targeted protein and the backbone becoming released in the washing buffer. Future attempts that chemically crosslink the proteins to the filaments may prove successful.</p><p>We also report that hypoxia induces a change in the localization of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Polo during mitosis. There have been recent studies showing a role for Polo-like kinases in the hypoxic response in other organisms; a microarray study in rats identified Polo-like kinases being upregulated in a hypoxic tumor model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Bonde1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, while in mice Plk3 was found to act as a regulator of hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#x003b1; under hypoxic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Yang1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that the relocalization of Polo in response to hypoxia may be evolutionarily conserved, and opens up the powerful <italic>Drosophila</italic> system for studying the role of Polo in hypoxia. Interestingly, while GFP-Mps1 only localizes to the mitotic kinetochores under hypoxia, and is not normally detectable on chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Pandey1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007544-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), our data show that during mitosis GFP-Polo is localized to the spindle, centrosomes and kinetochores during the normoxic cell cycle and that the localization to kinetochores and centrosomes becomes more intense under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007544-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The patterns of Polo and Mps1 localization in mitosis are different than in female meiosis, where the two proteins appear to localize together at kinetochores and filaments.</p><p>What is the function that requires the sequestration of these proteins to filaments? The cell must expend considerable energy assembling these filaments at NEB, in addition to the costs incurred in transiently sequestering proteins to them. As localization to the filaments has not been observed in mitotic cells and the filaments appear to be disassembled soon after fertilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Gilliland3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Pandey1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, they do not seem to be needed during mitosis. What is so different about the oocyte that would require constructing these extensive structures during prometaphase? While speculative, one possibility is that the hypoxic signal may be needed throughout the ooplasm, but that signal (analogously to other intracellular signals such as the spindle assembly checkpoint signal generated at kinetochores that are not under tension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Abrieu1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Howell1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>) can only be generated by proteins at kinetochores. Generating a signal at kinetochores and distributing it throughout the very large oocyte (either by diffusion or active transport) may be impractical for a signal that needs to propagate on a short time scale. Perhaps the sequestration of these proteins to filaments brings them together in the proper orientation to allow the generation of the hypoxic signal. In other words, the filaments could be serving as surrogate kinetochores, enabling the generation of the signal simultaneously at many places throughout the oocyte. This hypothesis would suggest the filaments form at NEB because this mechanism is not needed in the presence of an intact nuclear envelope, while the filaments can be disassembled after fertilization because the rapidly increasing number of mitotic nuclei would make such surrogate kinetochores unnecessary. Consistent with this interpretation, the very similar-appearing filaments identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic> during prometaphase I in female meiosis also localize several outer kinetochore proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Monen1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, although we are unaware of any studies that have examined whether the localization of these proteins to filaments in nematodes is sensitive to hypoxia. Alternatively, the function of these filaments may be to sequester these proteins, either to attenuate their activity or to protect them from depletion during hypoxia. Answering this question will ultimately require the identification of the structural proteins that make up the filaments, so that the consequences of knocking them out can be studied.</p><p>Finally, this study should serve as a cautionary tale for the use of fixed imaging to study dynamic processes. Even routine laboratory procedures (such as CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia) can inadvertently introduce dramatic differences in the system under study. While it is tempting to dismiss such things as being incompletely penetrant or just variable phenotypes, careful control of the experimental conditions can lead to novel discoveries. It also emphasizes the advantages of doing live imaging in parallel with fixed imaging. Not only did we benefit from the stark differences between the fixed and live samples, we would certainly never have been able to demonstrate that the GFP filaments are reappearing in the same places without live imaging data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly Stocks</title><p>All flies were aged for 3&#x02013;5 days with males and fresh yeast paste prior to imaging.

Images were deconvolved, projected and manually aligned as layers in Photoshop, using GFP filaments and follicle cell nuclei in overlapping regions to guide alignment. The rectangular region was then copied, individual layers were composited using layer masks, adjusted with the Layers function, and then merged; the slight variation in brightness across the background is due to slight differences across the five original images. The region around the oocyte nucleus is a 2 &#x000b5;m subset of the full Z stack, to make the nuclear envelope easier to see. No GFP filaments were observed in the full Z stack for this region of the image. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007544-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, the before-and-after images (2B and 2D, respectively) were placed as Photoshop layers in the same file. Because the cell and stage had drifted slightly over the intervening 30 minutes, the features in the center of each image were manually aligned. The Before layer was put on top, colored green (by setting the red and blue RGB channels to black) and that layer's blending mode was set to Screen. The After layer was colored red (by setting the green and blue RGB channels to black). Both layers were then adjusted using the Levels function to emphasize the filaments, minimize background, and to make both layers appear approximately equally bright.

GFP-Mps1 oocytes were incubated under different conditions prior to fixation, and stage 13 oocytes were examined for localization to filaments. Oocytes fixed while normoxic (where fixation occurs so quickly after initial CO2 exposure that the GFP-Mps1 has not had time to be sequestered to the filaments) never showed localization to filaments. The exposure of oocytes to sodium azide for 10 minutes causes a significant increase in the number of oocytes that show GFP localization to filaments, when compared to incubation alone (Fisher's Exact Test, P&#x0003c;0.0001). Sodium azide inhibits mitochondrial respiration and can induce the hypoxic response in mitotic Drosophila cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Pandey1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The exceptional oocytes in each treatment are also consistent with localization being controlled by hypoxia, as all three sodium azide-treated oocytes without filaments had fully mature dorsal appendages, while the single control oocyte with filaments was an early stage 13 oocyte with poorly developed dorsal appendages. The dorsal appendages are gill-like structures used by the oocyte for respiration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007544-Hinton1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, having poorly developed dorsal appendages would be expected to predispose the oocyte to hypoxia due to incubation alone, while mature dorsal appendages would be expected to provide better baseline oxygenation, which would be expected to make sodium azide take longer to trigger the hypoxic response. Finally, all oocytes fixed while hypoxic (after a 30 minute incubation in a sealed eppendorf tube) had GFP-Mps1 localized to filaments.</p><p>(0.80 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007544.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007544.s002"><label>Movie S1</label><caption><p>A live GFP-Mps1 oocyte shows GFP localization to filaments in response to hypoxia.
