However, in muscle, other proteins may collaborate with CPT1. Fatty acid translocase/CD36 (FAT/CD36) may interact with CPT1 and contribute to fatty acid import into mitochondria in muscle. Here, we demonstrate that another membrane-bound fatty acid binding protein, fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1), collaborates with CPT1 for fatty acid import into mitochondria. Overexpression of FATP1 using adenovirus in L6E9 myotubes increased both fatty acid oxidation and palmitate esterification into triacylglycerides. Moreover, immunocytochemistry assays in transfected L6E9 myotubes showed that FATP1 was present in mitochondria and coimmunoprecipitated with CPT1 in L6E9 myotubes and rat skeletal muscle in vivo. The cooverexpression of FATP1 and CPT1 also enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, similar to the cooverexpression of FAT/CD36 and CPT1. However, etomoxir, an irreversible inhibitor of CPT1, blocked all these effects. These data reveal that FATP1, like FAT/CD36, is associated with mitochondria and has a role in mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1</kwd><kwd>malonyl-CoA</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>FAT/CD36</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Fatty acids are a major energy source for skeletal muscle. They are transported into the cell via a protein-mediated mechanism, involving fatty acid translocase/CD36 (FAT/CD36), plasma-membrane-associated fatty acid binding protein, and fatty acid transport protein (FATP1-6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Once inside the cell, fatty acids can be esterified, metabolized to lipid second messengers, such as leukotrienes and eicosanoids, or &#x003b2;-oxidized in the mitochondrion. The first step of the oxidative pathway is the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix. This step is controlled by the carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) system, consisting of CPT1, acylcarnitine translocase, and CPT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>).</p><p>CPT1 catalyzes the conversion of long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs to acylcarnitines in the presence of <sc>l</sc>-carnitine and is the rate-limiting step in the transport of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix, where they undergo &#x003b2;-oxidation. CPT1 is tightly regulated by its physiological inhibitor malonyl-CoA. This regulation allows CPT1 to signal the availability of lipid and carbohydrate fuels to the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Mammalian tissues express three isoforms: CPT1A (liver), CPT1B (muscle and heart), and CPT1C (brain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>Owing to the metabolic peculiarities of muscle, the regulation of CPT1B by malonyl-CoA is more complex than that of CPT1A in liver. The regulation of muscle CPT1 by malonyl-CoA cannot fully explain changes in mitochondrial fatty acid import. Thus, malonyl-CoA is not responsible for the increase in fatty acid oxidation during the transition from low to moderate aerobic exercise or for the decrease in fatty acid oxidation during more strenuous exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Moreover, concentrations of malonyl-CoA measured in muscle (1&#x02013;4 &#x000b5;M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) should inhibit CPT1 activity at any time, since the IC<sub>50</sub> of CPT1B for malonyl-CoA is much lower than this concentration (&#x0223c;0.03 &#x000b5;M). Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain this discordance between malonyl-CoA levels, CPT1 regulation, and LCFA oxidation in muscle. Thus, alteration in compartmentalization/cellular distribution of malonyl-CoA may be involved in the control of CPT1 activity. It has been proposed that the malonyl-CoA involved in CPT1 regulation is that synthesized by acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2, which resides in the vicinity of CPT1 in the outer mitochondrial membrane and modulates CPT1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Moreover, other proteins could also be involved in the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria. Thus, Bonen and coworkers demonstrated that exercise induces the translocation of FAT/CD36 to mitochondria, thus increasing muscle fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>FATPs are a family of membrane-bound proteins that catalyze the ATP-dependent esterification of LCFA and very-LCFA to their acyl-CoA derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Mammals express six different forms of FATP (FATP1-6) with tissue-specific expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). FATP1 is a 63 kDa protein that is expressed in cells and tissues with high levels of fatty acid uptake for metabolism or storage, such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). The regulatory role of FATP1 in metabolism has been partially elucidated by gene manipulation. Overexpression of FATP1 in cultured fibroblasts increases fatty acid uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Cardiac-specific overexpression of FATP1 in transgenic mice increases myocardial fatty acid uptake and free FA accumulation, but not triacylglyceride (TG) levels, and enhances palmitate oxidation leading to a lipotoxic cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). In contrast, when overexpressed in cultured human skeletal myotubes, FATP1 stimulates FA uptake and storage as TG, but not oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Deletion of FATP1 protects mice from fatty-acid-induced insulin resistance and intramuscular accumulation of fatty acyl-CoAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Furthermore, FATP1 is involved in hormonal regulation of fatty acid uptake, translocating to the plasma membrane in response to insulin in adipocytes and primary skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).</p><p>We have recently shown that overexpression of CPT1A in L6E9 myotubes enhanced CPT1 activity up to 15-fold, whereas fatty acid oxidation did not increase more than 2-fold, even when a mutant form of CPT1 insensitive to malonyl-CoA was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). These data indicate that other factors independent of CPT1/malonyl-CoA interaction could be involved in the control of fatty acid oxidation in these cells. In the search for a novel regulator of fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle, we examined the effect of FATP1 overexpression on fatty acid oxidation in L6E9 muscle cells. We show that FATP1 localized in mitochondria and coimmunoprecipitated with CPT1. Moreover, FATP1 overexpression enhanced mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids. We also observed all these effects in cells overexpressing FAT/CD36, which may have a role in this process in muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). These data reveal a new protein involved in &#x003b2;-oxidation and could help us to understand its complex regulation in skeletal muscle.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title>Materials and reagents</title><p>Protran&#x000ae; nitrocellulose membranes for protein analysis were from Scheicher and Schuell (Keene, NH).

The light source was an argon/krypton laser (75 mW), with which optical sections (0.1 &#x000b5;m) were obtained. Qualitative analyses of colocalization were assessed using the plugin RGB Profiler from the WCIF ImageJ software. A line was drawn arbitrarily over an area of interest and the plot presented the overlap of the staining of each laser (from distinct labeled proteins). Quantitative analyses were performed by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient and Mander's overlap coefficient, which are both described in the online manual for the WCIF ImageJ collection. In many forms of correlation analysis, the value for Pearson's range from 1 to &#x02212;1. A value close to 1 does indicates reliable colocalization. The Mander's overlap coefficient ranges from 1 to 0, with 1 being high colocalization and 0 being low. Having defined and eliminated the background noise from the original picture, we used the plugin Intensity Correlation Analysis from WCIF ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>Mitochondrial fractions were obtained by differential centrifugation of muscle cell homogenates.

In a recent study, we showed that overexpression of CPT1A in L6E9 myotubes enhanced CPT1 activity up to 15-fold, whereas fatty acid oxidation did not increase more than 2-fold, even when a mutant form of CPT1A insensitive to malonyl-CoA was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). These data indicate that other factors independent of the CPT1/malonyl-CoA interaction could be involved in the control of fatty acid oxidation in muscle. Furthermore, proteins other than CPT1 have recently been implicated in fatty acid import into mitochondria in muscle, such as FAT/CD36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) and UCP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). FAT/CD36 translocates to the mitochondria during muscle contraction, increasing fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, a null mutation in skeletal muscle FAT/CD36 reveals that palmitate metabolism is markedly downregulated under insulin- and AICAR-stimulated conditions. This indicates its critical role in fatty acid esterification and oxidation and points to another level of regulation in fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). In these FAT/CD36 KO mice, there was an upregulation of FATP1 and FATP4 in the soleus muscle. This upregulation failed to normalize fatty acid oxidation, but it indicates that other proteins like FATP1 could collaborate in the maintenance of fatty acid metabolism. In search for a novel regulator of fatty acid metabolism in muscle, in this study, we demonstrate for the first time that FATP1, a fatty acid transport protein, is involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.</p><p>Overexpression of FATP1 in L6E9 myotubes using adenovirus increased acyl-CoA synthetase activity and fatty acid incorporation into TGs, but not into other lipid species such as PL, DAG, or NEPalm. These results are consistent with other in vitro studies in 293 cells showing that fatty acids taken up by FATP1 are preferentially channeled into TG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Moreover, FATP1 overexpression increased fatty acid oxidation in intact myotubes. This result contrasts with the effect of FATP1 overexpression in human skeletal muscle cells, where palmitate incorporation into TG, but not fatty acid oxidation, was also increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). This discrepancy could be due to differences in the model studied and the method used: in this study, palmitate oxidation was measured in the presence of 2.5 mM glucose, whereas in the previous study, palmitate oxidation was measured in human skeletal muscle cells and in the absence of glucose. The increase in fatty acid oxidation in FATP1-overexpressing L6E9 myotubes in our study is consistent with the increase shown for transgenic mice overexpressing FATP1 in heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). However, the TG levels were not increased in the heart of transgenic mice.</p><p>To assess whether the increase in fatty acid oxidation is a result of an increase in fatty acid uptake at the plasma membrane or due to a mitochondrial role of FATP1, we isolated mitochondrial-enriched fractions and measured palmitate oxidation. We found that FATP1 overexpression increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, as did the overexpression of CPT1A, the endogenous CPT1 isoform expressed in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Importantly, the overexpression of both proteins together produced an additive effect, indicating that FATP1 and CPT1 collaborate in these cells for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. It has been suggested than when the rate of mitochondrial &#x003b2;-oxidation is increased and exceeds flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain, incomplete fatty acid oxidation occurs, leading to intramitochondrial metabolite accumulation, mitochondrial stress, and cellular insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). In our study, FATP1 overexpression produced a higher increase in complete than in incomplete fatty acid oxidation, indicating that the effect of this protein on fatty acid oxidation does not involve the accumulation of intermediary species of fatty acid oxidation. Hence, FATP1 overexpression increased the efficiency of the mitochondria to oxidize fatty acids, as indicated by the diminished ratio incomplete/complete fatty acid oxidation. This effect was also seen in cells overexpressing CPT1A, especially when both FATP1 and CPT1A were cooverexpressed, showing a higher coupling of mitochondrial fatty acid uptake and oxidation. Interestingly, the use of etomoxir showed that the control of mitochondrial fatty acid uptake was dominated by CPT1, and the overexpression of FATP1 had no effect when CPT1 was inhibited. This indicates that FATP1 contributes to fatty acid oxidation by collaborating with CPT1, but not by controlling the entry of fatty acids to the mitochondria.</p><p>If FATP1 has a role in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, it might be localized in mitochondria. To examine this possibility, we used different techniques. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the protein was present in mitochondrial fractions but not in cytosolic fractions. Moreover, using immunocytochemistry, we showed both qualitatively and quantitatively that FATP1-GFP protein localized partially in structures that were also positive for the mitochondrial protein COI, indicating that FATP1 is partially localized in mitochondria in L6E9 myotubes. We used GFP fluorescence since the FATP1 antibodies were unsuitable for immunocytochemistry studies. Although the fusion with GFP could affect the localization of the protein, we do not believe this is the case. In the Western blot experiments, the FATP1-GFP and the endogenous protein showed the same distribution pattern of localization after the cellular fractionation, and another report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>) showed that the N-terminal GFP-tagged FATP1 protein retained the ability to bind to membranes. In our study, not all the FATP1 colocalized with the mitochondrial marker COI. It has been described that FATP1 can also localize in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Given the reticular pattern of GFP fluorescence that we observed in L6E9 cells, we cannot rule out the possibility that a portion of FATP1-GFP could also localize in the ER. Furthermore, in a previous study in human myotubes, overexpressed FATP1-GFP also showed a cytosolic reticular pattern, but colocalization studies with a mitochondrial or ER marker were not performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Moreover, recent data from our group demonstrated that FATP1 also localizes in mitochondria in human and C2C12 muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), and in adipocytes, 70% of FATP1 localizes in cell membrane fraction and approximately 10% in the nuclear-mitochondrial fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>The additive effect of FATP1 and CPT1 overexpression in fatty acid oxidation and the mitochondrial localization of both proteins indicate that these two proteins may interact in the mitochondrion. We show that both proteins coimmunoprecipitated both in total extracts and in mitochondrial extracts, strongly supporting the hypothesis that FATP1 and CPT1 interact in mitochondria. Importantly, using rat skeletal muscle, we also showed that FATP1 and CPT1 coimmunoprecipitated both in total extracts and in mitochondria-enriched fractions, indicating that the interaction between FATP1 and CPT1 also occurs in skeletal muscle in vivo. Moreover, this coimmunoprecipitation was higher in soleus than in gastrocnemius muscle. This indicates that in oxidative muscle, which uses primary fatty acids as an energy source, the interaction between FATP1 and CPT1 could be higher than in glycolytic muscles. Furthermore, FATP1 expression in rat oxidative muscle (soleus) is approximately twice that in glycolytic (gastrocnemius) muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Our immunoprecipitation assays in L6E9 myotubes and rat skeletal muscle show that FATP1 and CPT1 interact in basal conditions, suggesting that FATP1 could be constitutively present in mitochondria. However, some hormonal or physiological factors that induce fatty acid oxidation, such as exercise, could also induce the presence of FATP1 in mitochondria. Future studies are needed to examine this possibility.</p><p>FATP1 is an integral membrane protein with at least one transmembrane and multiple membrane-associated domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). It contains an AMP-binding motif that is essential for transport function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). FATP1 has acyl-CoA synthetase activity, suggesting that fatty acid uptake catalyzed by FATP1 is linked to the esterification of these fatty acids with CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Moreover, FATP1 was shown to heterooligomerize with the LCFA-CoA syntethase ACSL1 in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Given all the above observations, it could be hypothesized that FATP1 could act as a long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase in mitochondria to activate LCFAs, which CPT1 can then use as a substrate. However, interestingly, although acyl-CoA synthetase activity is increased in mitochondrial fractions from FATP1-overexpressing L6E9 myotubes, we show that mitochondrial palmitoyl-CoA oxidation to CO<sub>2</sub> is also increased in these fractions, as is the oxidation of palmitate, suggesting a role for FATP1 in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation independent of its acyl-CoA synthetase activity.</p><p>In this study, we have also analyzed the effect of overexpression of FAT/CD36 in L6E9 myotubes. This has been described as a new protein involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation under stimulated conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Thus, the presence of FAT/CD36 in mitochondria is induced by exercise or contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). However, FAT/CD36 KO mice have normal basal mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation despite the absence of FAT/CD36 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). These results suggest that FAT/CD36 could have a role in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation only under certain conditions of increased requirements for fatty acid oxidation, such as during exercise or muscle contraction. Moreover, FAT/CD36 has been shown to translocate from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). In this study, we have demonstrated that overexpression of FAT/CD36 enhances fatty acid oxidation, in agreement with the increase in fatty acid oxidation shown in contracting muscle in transgenic mice overexpressing FAT/CD36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). Furthermore, FAT/CD36 coimmunoprecipitated with CPT1 in L6E9 myotubes, and its overexpression increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation efficiency, showing an additive effect when cooverexpressed with CPT1. It has already been shown that FAT/CD36 translocates to the mitochondrial membrane in response to exercise, increasing the ability of mitochondria to oxidize palmitate, both in rats and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Moreover, FAT/CD36 coimmunoprecipitates with CPT1, and this correlates with the level of fat oxidation in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Thus, our results in L6E9 myotubes are in agreement with these previous data and validate our model of study. Therefore, according to our data, FATP1 enhances fatty acid oxidation similar to FAT/CD36, suggesting that such effect may be due to fatty acid recruitment at mitochondria by either fatty acid binding protein. However, in a recent study, we have shown that FATP1, unlike FAT/CD36, stimulates the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity and glucose oxidation in cultured myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), indicating that FATP1 exerts differential effects on mitochondrial metabolism.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that FATP1 has a role in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in collaboration with CPT1. The exact mechanism of this interaction and its regulation remain to be resolved. However, the data presented here reveal a new protein involved in mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids and could help us to understand the complex regulation of fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Prip-Buus and Dr. Zammit for supplying anti-rat liver CPT1 antibody and anti-rat muscle CPT1 antibody respectively.
