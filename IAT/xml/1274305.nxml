The remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is dependent on actin binding proteins, which organize actin filaments into specific structures that allow them to perform various specialized functions.

We also found that Eps8 recruits Dishevelled to the plasma membrane and actin filaments suggesting that Eps8 might participate in non-canonical Wnt/Polarity signaling.

Actin filament architecture is regulated by a large group of actin binding proteins that modulate actin assembly, disassembly, branching, and bundling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Actin organization is also regulated by growth factor signals that stimulate the activity of Rho family GTPases, which mediate actin remodeling and formation of stress fibers, filopodia, and membrane ruffles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although much has been learned about the general properties of actin binding proteins, the mechanisms by which these proteins control actin architecture in vivo are poorly understood.</p><p>Eps8 (EGF receptor pathway substrate 8) was originally identified as a substrate of the EGF receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and is the founding member of a multigene family of Eps8-like proteins named Eps8L1, Eps8L2, and Eps8L3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Eps8 is thought to transduce growth factor signals by acting as a scaffold protein to support the formation of multi-protein signaling complexes that promote the activation of Rho family GTPases. Consistent with this model, studies in Eps8 null fibroblasts showed that Eps8 is required for growth factor-induced Rac activation as well as Rac-dependent actin remodeling and membrane ruffling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Eps8 is a critical component of a complex that contains the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Abi1, and Sos1, which acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Eps8 interacts directly with Abi1 through its SH3 domain, which possesses a novel peptide binding specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and this binding is thought to relieve auto-inhibition of Eps8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Eps8 also directly binds actin, suggesting that it may function by localizing Rac to sites of actin remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Eps8 binds actin through its C-terminal effector domain and expression of the effector region in serum-starved cells elicits Rac-dependent actin remodeling and membrane ruffling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Studies using deletion mutants of Eps8 show that the C-terminal effector domain is required for localizing Eps8 to membrane ruffles and the transduction of signals to Rac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A recent study revealed that C-terminal fragments of Eps8 also possess actin barbed-end capping activity in vitro and can substitute for capping protein in actin-based motility assays, suggesting a mechanism by which Eps8 might regulate actin filament dynamics in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Interestingly, full-length Eps8 on its own lacks capping activity in vitro, but can block actin polymerization in the presence of Abi1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The capping activity of Eps8 does not require Rac indicating that Eps8 can modulate actin dynamics through Rac-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Together, these data implicate Eps8 as a key regulator of actin filament dynamics and suggest that its activity is modulated through association with distinct sets of interacting regulatory proteins.</p><p>Eps8 has also been shown to bind Dishevelled (Dsh) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], a key regulator of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Dsh is required for the establishment of cell polarity and directed migration during gastrulation in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The mechanism by which Dsh controls cell polarity and migration is unclear, but is hypothesized to involve the modulation of actin dynamics through activation of RhoA and Rac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The ability of Eps8 to bind both Dsh and actin and stimulate Rac activation suggests that Eps8 may play an important role in regulating Dsh function during gastrulation, but this possibility has not been investigated.</p><p>In this study, we utilized cultured mammalian cells and <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos as model systems to investigate the mechanism by which Eps8 regulates actin filament architecture in vivo. Our results provide evidence that Eps8 can stimulate the assembly of distinct types of actin-based structures in cells and that the morphology of the actin structures induced by Eps8 is dependent on its interactions with Abi1. In addition, we show that Eps8 can recruit actin regulatory proteins, such as N-WASP and Dsh, to actin filaments and that mis-expression of Eps8 impairs cell movements during gastrulation in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos. Together, these data suggest that the role of Eps8 in modulating actin organization is multifaceted and is dependent on its participation in several potentially distinct multi-protein actin regulatory complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Enhanced formation of filopodia-like structures in cells expressing Eps8</title><p>To gain insights into the role Eps8 plays in regulating actin filament architecture, we examined the effect of increasing Eps8 levels on actin remodeling in mammalian cultured cells. For these studies, we utilized the mouse melanoma cell line B16F1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and the MDA-MB231BO cell line, which is a highly metastatic, bone seeking clone of the parental line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These cells were chosen because they are highly motile and express a variety of cellular protrusions including lamellipodia and filopodia. Control B16F1, MDA-MB231, and MDA-231BO cells stained for actin are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. We found that expression of a <italic>c-myc </italic>epitope tagged version of mouse Eps8 (Eps8-myc) in B16F1 cells elicited the formation of filopodia-like structures, which stained brightly with phalloidin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D&#x02013;I</xref>). The filopodia-like structures extended from lateral and dorsal regions of the cell and Eps8 localized along the length of these protrusions and was enriched at their tips (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>, inset). Similar results were seen in MDA-MB231 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J&#x02013;L</xref>) and MDA-MB231BO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1M&#x02013;O</xref>) breast cancer cells. More than 90% of the transfected cells displayed the actin phenotype shown. We also observed the formation of long, snake-like actin cables in approximately 50% of the MDA-MB231BO cells, which were typically not seen in either B16F1 cells or the parental MDA-MB231 cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Eps8 induced actin remodeling in cultured cells</bold>.

Similar to data reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], simultaneous expression of Eps8-myc and Abi1-GFP in B16F1, MDA-MB231, and MDA-MB231BO cells resulted in remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton characterized by formation of cable-like actin bundles within the cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;I</xref>). The actin cables were typically found at the ventral surface of the cell and displayed few branches. Eps8 and Abi1 co-localized along the length of the actin cables. Interestingly, Abi1 was not enriched with Eps8 in filopodia-like structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, arrowheads in A-C), suggesting that Abi1 may not contribute to Eps8-function at the plasma membrane.

Animal caps explants are dissected from blastula stage embryos and consist of an outer polarized epithelium and 2&#x02013;3 layers of non-epithelial deep cells. We found that expression of Eps8 has different effects on actin organization in superficial epithelial cells versus deep cells. In control explants, actin filaments are enriched at apical cell-cell junctions in superficial epithelial cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) and at the cortex of deep cells facing the blastocoel (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). In superficial epithelial cells, Eps8 expression caused an accumulation of actin filaments at sites of cell-cell contact in apparent association with adherens junctions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B&#x02013;D</xref>, arrowheads). In contrast, Eps8 expression induced the formation of cable-like actin structures within the cytoplasm of deep cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F&#x02013;H</xref>, arrows) and modified the morphology of actin filaments at the cell cortex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F&#x02013;H</xref>, arrowheads). The morphology and length of the actin structures in deep cells was variable; long, unbranched filaments were observed in cortical regions in association with the free membrane domain that faces the blastocoel, whereas thick actin bundles were often seen throughout the cytoplasm. Staining of animal caps with anti-<italic>myc </italic>antibodies showed that Eps8-myc localized along the length of actin filaments in both deep and superficial cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D,H</xref>; co-localization appears yellow). Thus, Eps8 associates with actin filaments and can dramatically affect the organization of actin in <italic>Xenopus </italic>animal cap cells as it does in cultured cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Eps8-induced actin remodeling in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos</bold>.

We found that when expressed alone, Abi1-GFP localized to small aggregates found throughout the cytoplasm and did not affect actin organization (data not shown). In contrast, simultaneous expression of Eps8-myc and Abi1-GFP induced the formation of star-like actin structures in superficial epithelial cells of the animal cap (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;C</xref>). Actin stars were found at the apical surface and consisted of actin-containing spikes radiating from a central actin foci or short bundle. The actin stars did not appear to protrude from the apical surface and Eps8 and Abi1 co-localized with actin in the stars. Since Eps8 and Abi1 facilitate signaling through Rac in cultured cells we tested whether actin star formation was dependent on Rac. In control animal caps, endogenous Rac was enriched at the cell cortex in association with cell-cell junctions (data not shown). In animal caps expressing Eps8 and Abi1, Rac was not recruited to the actin stars (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D&#x02013;F</xref>) suggesting that Rac activity is not required for actin star formation. In agreement with this idea, expression of dominant negative Rac (RacN17) failed to inhibit Eps8/Abi1-induced actin star formation (data not shown).

To test this idea, we analyzed whether expression of capping protein induced similar changes in actin organization. Capping protein (CP) is an &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimer that is thought to provide the major barbed-end capping activity in eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In these experiments, animal caps expressing both the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits of CP were examined for changes in actin filament distribution. In addition, since both the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits were GFP-tagged, their expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-GFP antibodies (data not shown). We found that expression of CP had no effect on actin organization in animal cap cells (data not shown). In addition, we found that expression of capping protein did not block the formation of Eps8/Abi1-induced actin stars, although low levels of capping protein were found to co-localize with the actin stars (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;D</xref>, arrowhead). Thus, the formation of actin stars does not directly correlate with enhanced capping protein activity nor does enhanced capping protein activity affect Eps8/Abi1-induced remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Regulation of Eps8/Abi1-induced actin remodeling in <italic>Xenopus</italic></bold>.

To test whether the formation of actin stars involves recruitment of WASP proteins we analyzed the distribution of N-WASP-GFP in animal cap cells expressing Eps8 and Abi1. N-WASP co-localized with Eps8 and actin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E&#x02013;H</xref>), indicating that WASP proteins are recruited to Eps8/Abi1-induced actin structures. We also tested whether N-WASP activity is required for Eps8/Abi1-induced actin star formation by co-expressing Eps8, Abi1 and a dominant negative form of N-WASP (N-WASP-CA). We found that N-WASP-CA expression did not significantly alter the actin structures induced by Eps8 and Abi1 (data not shown). These data suggest that Eps8 and Abi1 can recruit actin nucleators to specific sites in the cell, although N-WASP function may not be strictly required for Eps8/Abi1-induced actin remodeling.</p><p>Members of the Ena/VASP family are critical regulators of actin filament dynamics and are thought to antagonize actin filament capping at the leading edge of migrating cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

In superficial epithelial cells, Dsh was recruited to cell-cell junctions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B,C</xref>; arrow) and in deep cells Dsh was recruited to cytoplasmic actin cables (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D&#x02013;F</xref>; arrow) and the cell cortex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D&#x02013;F</xref>; arrowhead). Furthermore, we found that epitope-tagged forms of Dsh, Eps8, and Abi1 co-localize in animal cap cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G&#x02013;I</xref>) suggesting that they can form a tri-complex in vivo. These data provide evidence that Eps8 interacts with and may regulate the distribution and/or function of Dsh through recruitment of Dsh to the membrane and actin filaments.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Dsh is recruited to the plasma membrane and actin filaments in response to Eps8 expression</bold>.

To begin to address the role of Eps8 during embryonic development, we performed in silico analyses to identify the <italic>Xenopus </italic>ortholog of <italic>Eps8</italic>. Searches of the TIGR (TC263683) and NCBI (MGC81285; Image 6631907) databases led to the identification of cDNAs that encode <italic>Xenopus Eps8 </italic>(<italic>XEps8</italic>). The predicted XEps8 protein shows a high degree of sequence identity with both mouse and human Eps8 and contains the conserved PTB, SH3, and C-terminal effector domains. The developmental expression of <italic>XEps8 </italic>transcripts was determined by RT-PCR. We found that <italic>XEps8 </italic>transcripts are provided maternally and are present throughout development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). We also found that <italic>XEps8 </italic>is expressed in isolated dorsal and ventral marginal zone tissue of gastrula stage embryos and that levels of <italic>XEps8 </italic>are higher in dorsal marginal regions compared to ventral regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Finally, we probed blots of embryonic lysates with anti-XEps8 polyclonal antibodies and found that XEps8 protein appears as a doublet and is present in unfertilized eggs, gastrula, and neurula stage embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). These analyses show that <italic>XEps8 </italic>is expressed at the relevant time and place to regulate cell movements during gastrulation.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Mis-expression of Eps8 results in gastrulation defects</bold>.

We found that the XEps8 MO could specifically block the expression of a myc-tagged version of XEps8, but injection of the XEps8 MO into 4-cell stage embryos resulted in embryos with no apparent phenotype (data not shown). The lack of a knockdown phenotype is not surprising since <italic>Eps8</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice also displayed no obvious phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Since Eps8 is a member of a multi-gene family, we searched TIGR and NCBI databases for additional <italic>Xenopus </italic>Eps8 genes and found evidence for a second <italic>XEps8 </italic>gene as well as three <italic>XEps8-like </italic>genes. Therefore, the lack of a phenotype in XEps8 knockdown embryos is likely due to the expression of multiple <italic>XEps8 </italic>family members, including <italic>XEps8L1</italic>, <italic>XEps8L2</italic>, and <italic>XEps8L3</italic>, during early development (Roffers-Agarwal and Miller, unpublished results). Thus, assessing the role of Eps8 proteins in <italic>Xenopus </italic>will require novel knockdown techniques capable of simultaneously and specifically inhibiting the activity of multiple gene products during early development.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of Eps8 disrupts cell movements during gastrulation</title><p>Since knockdown experiments produced negative results, we performed mis-expression experiments to test whether altering Eps8 activity would affect cell movements during gastrulation. Synthetic mRNA encoding mouse Eps8-myc or GFP as a control was injected into the equatorial region of both dorsal blastomeres at the 4-cell stage and resulting embryos were then examined for developmental abnormalities. Defects in Eps8-injected embryos were first apparent at stage 10.5 (early gastrula). At this stage, control embryos formed a well-defined dorsal lip indicative of the onset of gastrulation movements and involution of dorsal mesoderm. In contrast, Eps8-injected embryos showed a delay in the formation of the dorsal lip and when observed, the lip was disorganized (data not shown). By stage 12, Eps8-injected embryos displayed a severe delay in blastopore closure and buckling of tissue above the blastopore (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). Eps8-injected embryos eventually complete gastrulation and tadpoles displayed a phenotype including a shortened and arched anterior-posterior axis and head defects (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref>). The defects caused by Eps8 are dose dependent; low doses (50 pg) of Eps8 result in cyclopia and a shortened A-P axis, moderate doses (200 pg) show varying degrees of cyclopia, microcephaly, and shortening and arching of the A-P axis, and high doses (1 ng) result in varying degrees of anencephaly, shortening and arching of the A-P axis, and spina bifida. Control, GFP-injected embryos appeared normal at all stages examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C,E</xref>). These data are consistent with the idea that Eps8-induced actin re-organization leads to defects in cell movements during gastrulation in <italic>Xenopus</italic>.</p><p>The gross morphological defects caused by dorsal expression of Eps8 could be the result of defects in convergent extension or inhibition of mesoderm development, both of which would give superficially similar phenotypes. In order to distinguish between these two possibilities we performed histological analysis on injected embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7G,H</xref>). Histological sections of Eps8-injected embryos demonstrated that notochord, somites, and neural tissue are all present, showing that expression of Eps8 does not globally perturb specification of mesodermal or neural cell fates. Instead, expression of Eps8 resulted in broadening of the notochord along the mediolateral axis and morphological defects in the neural tube and somites. The widening of the notochord is consistent with the idea that expression of Eps8 impairs convergent extension movements of the axial mesoderm.</p><p>Analysis of activin-induced elongation of animal cap explants provides a powerful assay for studying the cell movements associated with gastrulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In these experiments, the animal pole region of an embryo is removed at the blastula stage and placed in culture. Untreated animal cap explants and caps expressing Eps8 differentiate into atypical epidermis and remain rounded (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A,B</xref>) whereas addition of recombinant activin induces mesodermal differentiation, convergent extension movements, and elongation of uninjected explants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>). We found that expression of Eps8 inhibits activin-induced elongation of animal cap explants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>). The failure of activin-induced animal caps to elongate was not caused by a block in mesoderm induction since both Xbra (pan-mesoderm) and XmyoD (paraxial mesoderm) were expressed in control and Eps8-injected animal caps following activin treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Eps8 blocks elongation of activin treated animal caps</bold>.

Our results, together with previous studies, provide evidence that Eps8 plays multiple roles in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and that these functions are influenced by the participation of Eps8 in multi-protein actin regulatory complexes.</p><p>Based on in vitro studies, Eps8 is hypothesized to promote capping of actin barbed-ends in an Abi1-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Our findings suggest that in addition to its proposed role as a barbed end capping protein, Eps8 might play additional roles in regulating actin organization in vivo. This idea is supported by the observation that Eps8 expression resulted in enhanced formation of actin-rich filopodia-like structures in cultured cells and enhanced formation of actin bundles and accumulation of actin at cell-cell junctions in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos. The presence of the filopodia-like structures on the dorsal surface of cells suggests that they are protrusive in nature and do not represent retraction structures, which are typically associated with sites of cell adhesion. Additional studies examining the dynamics of these Eps8-induced structures will help clarify the origin and nature of these structures. In addition, we found that Abi1 modulated Eps8 activity, promoting the formation of actin cables in cultured cells and actin stars in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, suggesting that Eps8 can regulate actin dynamics through Abi1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Consistent with this idea, Abi1 did not co-localize with Eps8 at the tips of the filopodia-like structures in cultured cells suggesting that additional regulators of Eps8 remain to be identified.</p><p>The correlation between Eps8 expression and enhanced formation of filopodia-like structures and actin cables is consistent with the idea that Eps8 may regulate actin filament elongation in vivo. Regulation of barbed-end elongation and filopodia formation is thought to involve a balance between barbed-end capping and anti-capping activities. Proteins such as CP are hypothesized to block elongation and favor formation of a dendritic network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], whereas proteins including Ena/VASP proteins, which antagonize capping, are hypothesized to promote actin filament elongation and filopodia formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Our work examining the regulation of Eps8 activity by CP, N-WASP, and Ena/VASP in <italic>Xenopus </italic>yielded largely negative results, however, making it difficult to discern the relative contribution of Eps8 capping activity versus other potential modes of activity in the regulation of actin architecture. Further biochemical analyses will help elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which Eps8 regulates actin dynamics in vivo.</p><p>Previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and our results show that the ability of Eps8 to modulate actin organization is regulated by its interaction with distinct binding partners such as Abi1. We found that Abi1 can modulate Eps8 activity in cultured cells and <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos. Abi1 binds to the SH3 domain of Eps8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and it has been proposed that this binding may alter the conformation or activity of the adjacent actin-binding domain of Eps8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The mechanism by which Abi1 might regulate Eps8 activity remains unclear, but may involve recruitment of additional regulatory factors such as Dsh, Sos1, and Rac to the Eps8/Abi1 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In addition, our work shows that N-WASP is recruited to Eps8/Abi1-induced actin stars suggesting that the Eps8/Abi1 complex interacts either directly or indirectly with actin nucleating factors. This idea is supported by the observation that Eps8 can facilitate actin-based motility of N-WASP-coated beads in vitro in the presence of Arp2/3, ADF/cofilin, and profilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Further studies will be required to examine how Abi1 modulates Eps8 activity and how Eps8 works with Abi1 and other regulatory factors to control actin organization in vivo.</p><p>Eps8 has been shown to bind Dsh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], a component of the Wnt signaling pathway that is required for transduction of canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin and non-canonical signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Here, we have shown that Eps8 expression recruits Dsh to actin filaments and the cell membrane in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. These data are significant because the role of Dsh in non-canonical Wnt/Polarity signaling is thought to be dependent on its localization to the membrane and its ability to affect cell polarity and migration through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Dsh activity during gastrulation is dependent on both RhoA and Rac, and the formin homology protein DAAM1 is required for Dsh-mediated activation of RhoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, a link between Dsh and Rac has not been identified. The Eps8/Abi1/Sos1 complex is required for growth factor stimulated activation of Rac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], suggesting that Eps8 might provide an important link between Dsh, Rac, and the actin cytoskeleton during development. Consistent with this idea, expression of Eps8 impaired cell movements during gastrulation and Eps8, Abi1, and Dsh co-localize in <italic>Xenopus </italic>suggesting that these proteins can form a tri-complex in vivo. Interestingly, we did not observe an effect of Eps8 on Dsh-mediated induction of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin target genes (<italic>siamois </italic>and <italic>Xnr3</italic>, JRA and JRM unpublished results) indicating that Eps8 does not participate in canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling. Unfortunately, our attempts to analyze the requirement for Eps8 in <italic>Xenopus </italic>were unsuccessful due to the expression of multiple Eps8 family members during early development. Thus, additional studies are necessary to determine the potential role of Eps8 in the transduction of non-canonical Wnt signals and the potential role of Eps8 family members during gastrulation in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>How might Eps8 regulate the actin cytoskeleton in vivo? Our findings together with data from previous studies support the idea that Eps8 might regulate actin architecture in multiple ways. Eps8 can bind to both barbed ends and the sides of actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and it is possible that these different modes of actin binding mediate distinct effects on actin architecture in cells. Barbed-end capping activity might regulate actin filament dynamics and stabilize existing filaments whereas an alternative activity might promote the formation and maintenance of actin arrays required for protrusive force generation and cellular structures such as microvilli and filopodia. This idea is consistent with our observation that Eps8 is enriched at the tips of filopodia-like structures and localizes along the length of the filopodia-like structures and actin cables. This model is also in agreement with the observation that Eps8 localizes to microvilli in the intestinal epithelium of <italic>C. elegans </italic>and knockdown of Eps8 is associated with defects in microvilli formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The formation of actin cables in cells expressing Eps8 and Abi1 and actin clusters in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos suggests that Abi1 is a critical modulator of Eps8's activity as an actin regulatory protein. The finding that Eps8 expression impairs cell movements during gastrulation provides further support for this view and underscores the idea that the proper balance of actin assembly, disassembly, and organization is essential for controlling morphogenetic movements during development. Thus, Eps8 has emerged as a critical regulator of actin filament dynamics and further analysis of Eps8 and its binding partners will help shed light on the mechanisms that mediate actin-based motility in vivo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Expression constructs, antibodies, and cells</title><p>Constructs used were: mouse Eps8-myc pCS2+ (Eps8 cDNA provided by Dr. P.P.
