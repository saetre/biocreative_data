Another group of aryl sulfotransferases catalyzing O-sulfation of carcinogenic N-hydroxyarylamines was separated from livers of rats and humans. These sulfotransferases have been shown to possess similar functional properties and also to relate immunochemically with each other. Current understanding on the primary structure of these sulfotransferases also is discussed.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 2.</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00402-0092-a" xlink:role="100"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="envhper00402-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="99" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00402-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="100" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00402-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="101" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00402-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="102" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00402-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="103" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
