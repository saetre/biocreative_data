Ohno's theory hypothesizes that duplicates are mostly silenced by degenerative mutations following duplication due to a redundancy in function. Although probabilities of duplicates acquiring novel and beneficial functions is lower than duplicates being silenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], the classical model of the fates of duplicate genes proposed by Ohno is coming under increasing scrutiny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Preservation of duplicate genes is believed to be a common fate, particularly for genes that contain multiple regulatory regions, and thereby multiple copies of genes are maintained in the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Duplicated proteins evolve for some time under relaxed functional constraints, after which functional divergence occurs when formerly neutral substitutions convey a selective advantage in a novel environment or genetic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Gene duplication is often followed by an elevated mutation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Rapid duplicate gene evolution is caused by positive Darwinian selection or relaxation of the functional constraints in the redundant gene. Continuation of gene duplication leads to the formation of gene groups with high similarities in nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The majority of genes in higher organisms are members of multigene families or subfamilies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Three potential evolutionary fates of duplicated genes have been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]: (A) Duplicated genes may be inactivated by the degenerative mutations and become nonfunctional (i.e., defunctionalization). (B) A duplicated gene may diverge to acquire a new function (i.e., neofunctionalization). (C) Degenerative mutations occur in each copy after duplication. Both genes may be altered in such a way that the combined activity of the two genes together fulfills the task of the ancestral gene in a complementary fashion (i.e., subfunctionalization) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p><italic>CBF </italic>gene family, belongs to AP2/ERF (ethylene-responsive element-binding protein) superfamily, is considered as a result of gene duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Functional redundancy and differentiation have been reported, however, evolutional aspect of this small gene family has not been investigated. The AP2/ERF superfamily is a large gene family of transcription factors and is defined by the AP2/ERF domain, which consists of 60~70 amino acids involved in DNA binding. <italic>CBF1/DREB1B</italic>, <italic>CBF3/DREB1A</italic>, and <italic>CBF2/DREB1C </italic>are located in a tandem array within a region of 8.7 kb on chromosome 4 [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>] in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>and were categorized into group IIIc in the ERF family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The functions of <italic>CBF1, -2, and -3</italic>, which are induced by cold, have been shown to play crucial roles in the process of cold acclimation in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>including low temperature-, and/or drought-stress-responsive gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. CBF binds a DNA regulatory element, the C-repeat (CRT) dehydration-responsive element (DRE), which has a conserved core sequence of CCGAC, which imparts responsiveness to low temperatures and dehydration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Comparisons of the transcriptomes indicated that 12% of the cold-responsive genes are confirmed members of the CBF regulon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. <italic>CBF4</italic>, which is located in chromosome 5, is involved in the dehydration response rather than to cold, and is less closely related to <italic>CBF1</italic>, -<italic>2</italic>, and -<italic>3 </italic>in phylogeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The amino acid sequences of the CBF1, -2, and -3 proteins are highly similar, with approximately 88% identities and 91% similarities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. But do they have redundant functions? By comparing the effects of the overexpression of each <italic>CBF </italic>gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, it was determined that, in fact, they induce expression of similar gene sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, other molecular or physiological studies have indicated functional divergence among <italic>CBF </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Genomic map and orientation of <italic>CBF's </italic>(A), and gene structures and polymorphism illustrations of <italic>CBF1 </italic>(B), <italic>CBF2 </italic>(C) and <italic>CBF3 </italic>(D).</bold> (A): Promoter regions are represented by horizontal lines and transcriptional units (TUs) are indicated by boxes.

Seven nonsynonymous substitutions were in the N-terminal region where the function is unknown. No amino acid replacement was observed in the NLS. Twenty-eight nonsynonymous substitutions existed in transcriptional activation domains which were responsible for activation of <italic>CBF </italic>regulon genes.

Thus, the functional dissection of this domain from CBF1 might also be the case in CBF2 and -3.</p><p>The non-overlapping sliding window of K<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>s </sub>suggests that two possible regions were favored by positive selection after gene duplication (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These two regions are not located in the hydrophobic clusters 2, 3, and 4 which Wang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] considered to have been the most critical motifs in transactivation. In these two regions, four of six residues substituted by alanine led to substantial changes in reporter enzyme activities (139T &#x02192; A, 162P &#x02192; A, 165S &#x02192; A, and 169F &#x02192; A, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). It was interesting to note that the activity increase of 162P &#x02192; A was the highest among substitutions, and 169F &#x02192; A was also the greatest among those that led to activity decreases.</p><p>We want to see whether the positive selection site in the sequence agrees with the two regions mentioned above. With the site models of the codeml program, two positively selected amino acids were identified in the transcriptional activation domain as expected but not locate in the two regions identified by the sliding window of K<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>s </sub>method.</p><p>A decrease of 26% of reporter enzyme activity was observed when alanine was substituted for 181 T of CBF1, and in CBF3, 152E is in hydrophobic cluster 1. When the same site in CBF1 was substituted by alanine (152E &#x02192; A), a 63% increase in reporter activity was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>Hydrophobic residues within the functionally critical HC2, -3, and -4 of <italic>CBF</italic>s were found to be conserved among different ecotypes. Most positively selected regions of the activation domain identified in this paper are located outside of critical motifs. This difference is because the meaning of K<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>s </sub>is different from that of hydrophobic cluster, the former emphasizes variation in amino acid replacement and the latter in no or low variation. It implies that the hydrophobic cluster is critical in the interaction with other activator and the two regions found in this study might involve in tuning the transcriptional activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ecotypes from lower latitude may accumulate mutations that reduce <italic>CBF</italic>s expressions</title><p>Some variations we found for specific nucleotides of the promoters of <italic>CBF1 </italic>and <italic>-3 </italic>were probably responsible for the low level of gene expression. <italic>CBF1 </italic>of Cvi-0 has four nucleotides which are unique among the ecotypes (nos. 1, 249, 469, and 541, see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), while Can-0 has two unique nucleotides (nos. 57 and 469). <italic>CBF3 </italic>of Cvi-0 of has four nucleotides which are unique among the ecotypes (nos. 338, 1017, 1167, and 1284 in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).

Moreover, in contrast to CBF2, CBF1 and CBF3 positively regulate cold acclimation by activating the same subset of CBF-target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. These studies indicated functional changes have occurred at the level of CBF proteins.</p><p>Ecotype Kas-2 carries a <italic>CBF3 </italic>knockout allele and a null allele <italic>CBF2 </italic>gene due to a single insertion in the coding region. At first, we predicted that <italic>CBF1</italic>, which is the only functional <italic>CBF </italic>induced by cold, in this ecotype would be highly expressed to compensate for the double-mutant effect. However, this prediction was not correct. This is also evidence that CBF1, -2, and -3 are not strictly functional equivalents.</p><p>Evolutionarily important changes have also occurred at the level of gene regulation in <italic>CBF1, -2</italic>, and <italic>-3 </italic>in addition to protein function. Chinnusamy <italic>et al</italic>.

After <italic>CBF </italic>duplication, <italic>CBF2 </italic>experienced selective sweeps in the promoter and coding regions, and this may have resulted in its unique functional divergence which differs from those of <italic>CBF1 </italic>and <italic>-3</italic>. The promoter of <italic>CBF1 </italic>has a signature of balancing selection, while <italic>CBF3 </italic>did not deviate from neutrality. <italic>CBF </italic>promoters share less similarity than do the coding regions, indicating they are differentially regulated or have been shaped by different evolutionary forces. There is evidence of positive selection in both the <italic>CBF1 </italic>and -<italic>3</italic>' transcriptional activation domains within each domain and between them. <italic>CBF1 </italic>and -<italic>3 </italic>were shown to activate same regulons but need to work cooperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], and they are regulated by different upstream factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].
