Osteoprogenitors are considered to be committed to an osteochondral lineage once they express the key transcription factor <italic>Runx2/Cbfa1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. As osteogenic differentiation proceeds, other markers of bone differentiation such as <italic>osterix</italic>, <italic>alkaline phosphatase (AP)</italic>, <italic>bone sialoprotein</italic>, and <italic>osteocalcin (OCN) </italic>are sequentially expressed.</p><p>The processes of osteoprogenitor commitment and osteoblast differentiation are both facilitated by members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. BMP homodimers and heterodimers bind to BMP receptors (BMPRs) on the cell surface that can transduce the concentrations of extracellular BMPs into specific changes in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. BMPR-IA and BMPR-II are reported to be ubiquitously expressed, whereas BMPR-IB is tissue specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. While the expression of BMPs in bone development and repair are well described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], the potential for lineage-specific control of BMP signaling by regulating BMPR expression levels has not been explored in detail.</p><p>Committed osteoprogenitors are traditionally considered to arise from progenitors within the periosteum (a thin cellular layer covering bone surfaces) and within the bone marrow. In the bone marrow, the bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) encompass a heterogeneous population of highly plastic cells that not only support the haematopoietic progenitors, but also contribute to endosteal bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. MSCs are multipotent and can be stimulated to differentiate into cells of the osteoblastic, chondrogenic, myogenic, and adipogenic lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. By necessity, BMSCs must maintain themselves in a relatively undifferentiated state within the bone compartment. Although BMSCs generally remain in the marrow space, osteoprogenitors likely to have originated from the marrow have also been detected in the circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and it has been suggested that these circulating cells may also contribute to bone formation and repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>We have speculated that other cell types arising from the soft tissues adjacent to bone may also be able to contribute to bone formation and repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This would presumably occur via transdifferentiation, a process where non-osseous progenitors could be reprogrammed to an osteogenic lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Muscle progenitors are an appealing candidate for osteogenic transdifferentiation, as cultured myoblasts readily adopt a bone cell phenotype upon treatment with the osteogenic BMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>There are multiple indirect observations that suggest stem cells situated within muscle can participate in bone formation and repair. Muscle is found adjacent to most bones and can be exposed to bone signals upon injury. Disease states can also alter bone signaling resulting in ossification within muscle tissue, such as in <italic>myositis ossificans </italic>or in the genetic disease <italic>fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva </italic>(FOP)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, recent evidence would suggest that inhibition of BMP type 1 receptor signaling may be effective in the treatment of FOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. During recalcitrant bone repair, new bone formation is most commonly seen at the muscle-bone interface. Although this implies the presence of osteoprogenitor cells within muscle, it is unclear whether the cells that contribute to the bone healing process arise from muscle progenitors (satellite cells), are associated with the vasculature (pericytes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], exist as a small sub-population of multipotent stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], or migrate from the circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Numerous <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>experiments have induced osteogenesis in skeletal myoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] however, their sensitivity to osteogenic signals relative to other cell types remains unclear. In a paper by Komaki and colleagues, forced expression of the muscle master transcription factor MyoD in mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 progenitors led to an enhancement of BMP-7 induced osteogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. While MyoD has been shown to stimulate the pro-osteogenic transcription factor Osx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], forced MyoD expression alone is insufficient to promote osteogenic differentiation. We therefore hypothesized that MyoD may potentiate BMP signaling via BMP receptor expression. Myoblasts robustly express BMPR-IA and BMPRII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and this may underlie their sensitivity to bone signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>In this study we report a detailed comparison of the response of different mesenchymal progenitors to BMP treatment. Specifically, pre-osteoblasts, BMSCs, skeletal myoblasts, and fibroblasts were examined in a head-to-head fashion, including a combination of cell lines and primary murine cells. This study also aimed to address whether the capacity of progenitors for osteogenic conversion correlates with the expression of BMPRs, and if forced myogenesis could affect BMPR expression and BMP sensitivity in fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in DMEM containing 20% FBS while NIH/3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS.

Analysis was performed using MatInspector, a software package that identifies transcriptional binding sites which uses advanced filtering to generate high-quality matches. A number of high-confidence myogenic factor binding sites were identified in mouse and human <italic>Bmpr-1a/BMPR-1A </italic>promoter regions. In the mouse, this corresponded to one MyoD and two MEF2 sites, and in the human this corresponded to three MyoD and two MEF2 sites (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The expected number of occurrences due to chance alone over a 2 kb region was 0.26 and 0.06 for the MyoD and MEF2 motifs in both mouse and human, respectively. Thus the observed number of occurrence(s) for each motif was always greater than the expected species-specific occurrence value, denoting that sufficiently stringent criteria were employed to identify putative transcription factor binding sites. Several Smad-binding consensus sequences were also detected (data not shown), indicating the potential involvement of alternative non-myogenic regulatory elements.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of the human and murine BMPR-1A/<italic>Bmpr-1a </italic>promoter region</bold>.

To determine whether myogenic factors were important for modulating Bmpr-1a expression, we forced fibroblasts to differentiate down the myogenic lineage using a MyoD-expressing lentiviral vector (LV-MyoD). To account for any adverse effects on cell signaling mediated by lentiviral transduction, an equivalent eGFP lentiviral vector (LV-eGFP) was included as a control.

While prior studies have illustrated that BMP-2 can induce an osteogenic phenotype in myogenic cells, we have addressed the relative BMP-2 sensitivity of myoblasts relative to fibroblasts and osteoprogenitors. We hypothesized that myoblasts would show a strong osteogenic response, particularly when compared to fibroblasts. Considering the pathological complications associated with fibrosis in orthopaedic repair, the sensitivity of fibroblasts to osteogenic stimulation is highly relevant.</p><p>Our data clearly confirms the body of literature showing that BMP-2 treatment readily induces osteogenic differentiation in myoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Consistent with prior studies, we observed an associated reduction in myogenic markers in myoblasts undergoing osteogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Our findings support our initial hypothesis that the osteogenic potential of myoblasts when exposed to osteogenic signaling is comparable to that of standard osteoprogenitors and far exceeds that of fibroblasts. Finally, we speculated that the sensitivity of cells to BMP-2 may reflect the expression of BMPRs on the cell surface. Previous reports have shown that BMPR-IA but not BMPR-1B is robustly expressed in C2C12 myoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Transfection of a dominant-negative BMPR-1A into BMP-2 treated C2C12 cells inhibited AP expression. This was partially rescued by the transfection of wild-type BMPR-1A into C2C12 cells over-expressing the truncated BMPR-1A mutant. In contrast, truncated BMPR-IB had no effect on BMP-2 signaling in C2C12 cells. More recently, a siRNA knockdown of BMPR-1A has been shown to inhibit BMP-2 mediated osteogenic differentiation in human mesenchymal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>We observed strong <italic>Bmpr-1a </italic>expression in myoblasts and osteoprogenitors that could be enhanced by BMP-2 treatment, while fibroblasts failed to express robust levels of <italic>Bmpr-1a</italic>. In addition, fibroblasts transduced with the myogenic transcription factor MyoD upregulated their <italic>Bmpr-1a </italic>expression. Although these data represent a strong correlation between <italic>Bmpr-1a </italic>expression and BMP sensitivity, the mechanism underlying the varying osteogenic potential of different cell lineages may be more complex. Forced osteogenesis experiments using Runx2 expression constructs revealed that fibroblasts have a reduced capacity for mineralization that is likely to be independent of extracellular BMP signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>While we have observed a consistent upregulation of osteogenic markers, our data does not fully resolve whether genuine transdifferentiation has taken place. While myogenic cells treated with BMP-2 progressed from expressing early differentiation markers (<italic>Ap</italic>/AP expression) to late markers (<italic>Ocn </italic>expression, matrix mineralization), osteogenic stimulation was maintained during this time. When Katagiri <italic>et al</italic>. treated C2C12 cells for 6 days with BMP-2 stimulation and then reverted to a myogenic growth media, cells were found to revert to a myogenic profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This would suggest that <italic>bone fide </italic>transdifferentiation did not occur, and that muscle progenitors retained a "memory" of their original myogenic lineage. However, it is unclear if cells are treated with BMP for longer, whether a myogenic memory would remain. Moreover, it is possible that returning cells to a myogenic media preferentially selected for the adherence, survival, and proliferation of cells that had not yet committed to an osteogenic status. Finally, the myogenic reversion of BMP-2 treated cells <italic>in vitro </italic>poorly models the <italic>in vivo </italic>situation where a muscle progenitor may become exposed to persistent osteogenic signals in a bone environment.</p><p>Although our results suggest that muscle progenitors have a high responsiveness to BMP signaling, it does not rule out the possibility that alternative cell populations may contribute to bone formation in muscle. This includes circulating osteoprogenitors originating from the bone compartment, as irradiation of the bone marrow compartment can attenuate ectopic bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. However, irradiation of progenitors in the soft tissues was found to be equally effective, suggesting that local progenitor cells are also of importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Vascular mesoangioblasts and pericytes have been a focus of recent interest due to their potential for muscle cell therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. While mesoangioblasts are of an endothelial lineage, pericytes have been shown to not express vascular markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Although pericytes have been recently shown to be a sub-population of progenitors with significant myogenic potential, they do not express MyoD when freshly isolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Thus between multi-lineage progenitor cells such as mesoangioblasts, side-population cells and muscle-derived stem cells, pericytes, and classical satellite cells, the milieu of progenitor cells found in muscle tissue is complex and ever expanding. The relative capacity of these different subpopulations of myogenic progenitors to respond to osteogenic stimulation has yet to be explored, however we hypothesize that assaying for BMPR expression will be an effective predictive measure. Based on the presence of multiple myogenic-responsive elements in the <italic>Bmpr-1a/BMPR-1A </italic>promoter sequences, we anticipate that all of these cell types will robustly express <italic>Bmpr-1a</italic>.</p><p>There remains a possibility that other related receptors may also be involved. In the genetic disease FOP, the ectopic ossification of soft tissues in patients is the result of a dominant mutation in ACVR1/ALK2, a type 1 BMP receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Based on molecular modeling, it was hypothesized that this mutation led to destabilization of a region used for binding negative regulators of R-Smad signaling; thus the mutant receptor may be promiscuously activated. Nevertheless, there are no other indications that ACVR1/ALK2 has a normal physiological role in osteogenesis outside of the pathology of FOP. It has also been recently demonstrated that BMP-6 and BMP-7 primarily signal via the ACVR1/ALK2 receptor, while BMP-2 and BMP-4 favor the BMPR-1A receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this study characterizes the osteogenic differentiation profile of committed osteoprogenitors, myogenic cells, and non-myogenic mesenchymal cells both with and without BMP-2 treatment. Consistent with previous reports, myogenic cells readily establish an osteoblastic phenotype and we found this to be concomitant with an upregulation of BMPR expression. Future work will be required to explore whether endogenous myogenic cells are capable of making an <italic>in vivo </italic>contribution to bone formation in situations of ectopic bone formation and bone repair.</p><p>We also observed distinct patterns of <italic>Bmpr-1a </italic>expression in response to osteogenic stimulation, which may have physiological significance. <italic>Bmpr-1a </italic>levels also strongly correlated with responsiveness to BMP-2, and thus <italic>Bmpr-1a </italic>expression may be an alternative indicator for a cell's osteogenic potential. This could have practical applications for the bone tissue engineering field where researchers are looking to isolate highly osteogenic cell populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AS, RL, and DGL participated in the design of the study, interpretation of the data and drafted the manuscript.
