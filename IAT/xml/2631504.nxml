The mitochondria of contemporary organisms contain considerably fewer genes than the ancestral bacteria are predicted to have contained. Thousand or more mitochondrial proteins are predicted to be encoded in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Such the nucleus-encoded genes are transcribed from eukaryotic promoters, followed by translation into proteins by cytosolic ribosomes. In many cases, the proteins are synthesized as precursors having N-terminal extensions (presequences), which act as mitochondrial targeting signals. Most of these genes would have been transferred from the mitochondrion to the nucleus at some stage of evolution although some genes may have been recruited from other sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The transferred mitochondrial genes must have acquired cis-regulatory elements compatible with eukaryotic gene expression (e.g., promoters, enhancers, poly (A) signals and sequences for mitochondrial targeting signals) because mitochondrial gene expression is mainly prokaryotic. However, most of the processes for the gene activation remain unknown.</p><p>Mitochondrial gene content is highly variable depending on the taxa studied. The mammalian mitochondrial genome is conserved and constant all over the groups, whereas within Tracheophyta (higher plants), the genomes exhibit differential gene losses, indicating that gene transfer to the nucleus is an ongoing process during the evolution of Magnoliophyta (angiosperms) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Typical such cases are the ribosomal protein genes, showing more frequent gene-loss than other types of mitochondrial gene in many angiosperm species. For example, a sequence homologous to the ribosomal protein L6 gene (<italic>rpl6</italic>) is absent from all known angiosperm mitochondrial genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], whereas the corresponding sequence is encoded in the mitochondrial genomes of lower plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The sequences of the nucleus-encoded <italic>rpl6 </italic>gene have recently been identified in the complete <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>nuclear genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and the draft rice nuclear genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, detailed analysis has not yet been performed. We previously reported the loss or dysfunction of several ribosomal protein genes in the complete rice mitochondrial genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We have also isolated several genes that had been transferred from the mitochondrion to the nucleus in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Previous studies, including ours, have revealed frequencies of gene transfer events, the origins of sequence elements, and a few possible mechanisms involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For examples, the <italic>rps10 </italic>gene has undergone numerous independent gene transfer events during recent angiosperm evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Presequences for rice <italic>rps11-1</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis sdh3 </italic>and carrot <italic>rps10 </italic>genes seem to have been copied from those for the <italic>atp2, hsp70 </italic>and <italic>hsp22 </italic>genes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Common use of a presequence in different proteins via alternative splicing has also been found in maize and rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Chromosomal recombinations would have been involved in the gain of a promoter for rice <italic>rpl27 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Genes are sometimes divided into pieces or functionally replaced: a coding region of <italic>rpl2 </italic>gene has been divided into 5'- and 3'-parts in dicots, either or both of which have been transferred to the nucleus in some species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]; mitochondrial <italic>rps13 </italic>and <italic>rps8 </italic>genes have been replaced by duplicated copies of chloroplast (<italic>rps13</italic>) and cytosolic counterparts (<italic>rps15A</italic>), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, despite these examples, it is mostly unclear how the sequence elements compatible with eukaryotic expression were successfully moved and then joined with the transferred mitochondrial genes.</p><p>In this study, we identified and characterized the rice <italic>rpl6 </italic>gene. The release of the complete nuclear sequence of rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and its fine genome annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] enabled us to survey the genes and their genomic environment in detail. Based on this information, two copies of rice <italic>rpl6 </italic>gene (<italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>and <italic>OsRpl6-2</italic>) were identified in the rice genome. Sequence comparison of the two <italic>rpl6 </italic>genes strongly suggests a duplication of the <italic>rpl6 </italic>gene via genomic DNA rather than two separate gene transfer events. Although the sequences of the two <italic>rpl6 </italic>copies are homologous within the coding regions and have similar mitochondrial targeting properties, <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>was expressed to a greater extent than <italic>OsRpl6-2</italic>. A region around the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>is conserved in several other rice sequences. Interestingly, this conserved region has characteristics similar to those of class II transposable elements (TEs). It is well established that numerous TEs are present in eukaryotic nuclear genomes and that some of them affect genomic rearrangement and gene expression via translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The TE within <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>would have been involved in the acquisition of the 5'-UTR, which may be responsible for the difference in the amount of transcripts produced by the two <italic>rpl6 </italic>genes. The significance of TEs for the activation of transferred mitochondrial sequence and the evolution of such processes are discussed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of two copies of the mitochondrial rpl6 gene in the rice genome</title><p>A BLAST search of the complete rice nuclear sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] identified two <italic>rpl6 </italic>sequences, <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>and <italic>OsRpl6-2 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>is a newly described rice <italic>rpl6 </italic>gene, whereas the sequence of <italic>OsRpl6-2 </italic>corresponds to that of a previously reported one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].

Each of the <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>and <italic>OsRpl6-2 </italic>genes is transcribed because cDNA sequence corresponding to each gene is found in the database [representative GenBank accession nos. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AK119694">AK119694</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CI260120">CI260120</ext-link> for <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>and <italic>OsRpl6-2</italic>, respectively] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, thick pink arrow joined with thin pink broken line). Each gene has an intron in an identical position within the 5'-UTR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), as is the case for <italic>Arabidopsis rpl6 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The coding regions of the two rice <italic>rpl6 </italic>genes, each of which is predicted to encode a protein consisting of 103 amino acids, have 92% nucleotide sequence identity. Because the 3'-terminal regions of the intron showed 65% identity in the two rice <italic>rpl6 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, shaded region), they were probably generated by a duplication event via genomic DNA after gene transfer to the nucleus, rather than by two separate transfer events.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of the rice mitochondrial <italic>rpl6 </italic>genes, <italic>OsRpl6-1 and OsRpl6-2</italic></bold>.

We examined the subcellular localization of RPL6 using green fluorescent protein (GFP). A construct, in which the N-terminal coding region of <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>was fused to synthetic GFP cDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], exhibited fluorescence in particles of about 1 &#x003bc;m in diameter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, left panel). These particles coincided with the fluorescence of a mitochondrial-specific dye, MitoTracker Red (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, center and right panels), indicating that the protein was imported into the mitochondria. A construct containing the N-terminal coding region of <italic>OsRpl6-2 </italic>gave similar results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In contrast, a construct containing the C-terminal coding region of <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>did not localize proteins to the mitochondria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). These results indicate that the mature N-terminal coding regions of rice RPL6 proteins are important for mitochondrial localization.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localization of GFP fusion proteins in tobacco BY-2 cells</bold>.

Sequence alignment and analysis of the two conserved segments revealed the following. (1) The segments have a common terminal inverted repeat (TIR) composed of a 15-bp consensus sequence, GGCCTTGTTCGGTTG (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, thick yellow arrows). (2) A potential 3-bp direct repeat occurs just outside of the TIR (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, small green arrows). Although not all direct repeats were perfectly conserved between the ends of the sequences, they could represent target-site duplications (TSDs), which are generally caused by TE insertions. (3) A database search using the sequences flanking the conserved segments detected two putative <italic>r</italic>elated-to-<italic>e</italic>mpty-<italic>sites </italic>(RESites). The RESites are sequences that are homologous to TE-bearing sequences but lack the TE insertion, which indicates the past movement of TEs and their TSD sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In one instance, the sequence flanking Chr 2b was nearly identical to that of its RESite (Fig. S1A in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). In the second instance, high homology was evident between Chr 9c and its RESite, although a few indels were observed (Fig. S1B in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the two conserved segments were moved as a single TE because the insertion of two such segments in such close proximity and in the same direction by two separate events is highly unlikely.</p></sec><sec><title>Classification of TEs associated with the 5'-UTR of OsRpl6-1 as a member of the PIF/Harbinger superfamily</title><p>Among the putative TEs re-characterized in this study, proteins predicted from the internal regions of Chrs 2c, 5c and 9b had 78%&#x02013;88% similarity to a transposase from <italic>Os-PIF1 </italic>(data not shown). The <italic>Os-PIF1 </italic>is a rice homologue of maize <italic>P </italic>instability factor alpha (<italic>PIFa</italic>), an active class II DNA transposon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The <italic>PIF </italic>family has recently been associated with the nonautonomous miniature inverted transposable element (MITE), <italic>Tourist </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In fact, the consensus TIR sequence of the putative TEs observed in our study (GGCCTTGTTCGGTTG) (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) was similar to that of <italic>Tourist</italic>-like MITEs in maize, barley and <italic>Sorghum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and <italic>OsPIF </italic>families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These results indicate that the conserved sequence segments associated with the 5'-UTR of <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>are a single TE belonging to the <italic>PIF/</italic>Harbinger superfamily. Of these TEs, Chr 2c seems to encode an entire transposase, whereas Chr 5c and 9b may be pseudogenes because of lacking the complete coding region for transposase. The others, including one within <italic>OsRpl6-1</italic>, are probably nonautonomous elements because they did not contain ORFs nor did their predicted proteins have significant homologies to any characterized proteins in the given direction (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Based on the results of this study, we propose a model for the gene transfer and subsequent events of rice <italic>rpl6 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>A proposed model for the gene transfer and activation of rice <italic>rpl6</italic></bold>.

Gene transfer of rpl6 from the mitochondrion to the nucleus</title><p>It has been proposed that a mitochondrially encoded <italic>rpl6 </italic>gene had been transferred to the nucleus prior to the emergence of angiosperms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. We assume that the transfer already occurred in the common ancestor of seed plants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, step 1) because the <italic>rpl6 </italic>gene is absent from the mitochondrial genome of a gymnosperm, <italic>Cycas taitungensis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, <italic>rpl6 </italic>cDNAs are found from gymnosperms <italic>Cryptomeria japonica, Cycas rumphii, Pinus pinaster, Pseudotsuga menziesii </italic>and <italic>Zamia vazquezii </italic>in the database [their representative accession nos. are <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BY896644">BY896644</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CB092074">CB092074</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BX248809">BX248809</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CN638760">CN638760</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FD772805">FD772805</ext-link>, respectively], although the presence of <italic>rpl6 </italic>cDNAs does not readily indicate the nuclear localization of genes. This situation differs from the evolution of other ribosomal protein genes, which underwent recent gene transfer events during the course of angiosperm evolution (e.g., <italic>rps10 </italic>gene) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>2. Gain of a mitochondrial targeting sequence and an intron</title><p>Since neither of the proteins predicted from the two rice <italic>rpl6 </italic>genes contained an apparent N-terminal extension for a presequence, the targeting signal seems to have been derived from sequence alterations within the mature N-terminal coding region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, step 2), as with the case of rice <italic>rps10 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The presence of an embedded targeting signal here was indicated by the results of GFP assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). During the GFP analysis, small aggregations were occasionally observed (data not shown). We speculate that the efficiency of mitochondrial targeting varies according to cellular or physiological conditions. Incomplete or slow protein targeting has been observed in the sweet potato ATPase &#x003b4;-subunit with an atypical mitochondrial targeting signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. At any rate, the acquisition of the targeting signal would have occurred prior to the duplication event because both rice RPL6 proteins have similar mitochondrial targeting abilities. This step may predate the common ancestor of seed plants because seed plants RPL6 proteins seem to lack a presequence as described. The 3'-part of an intron would also have been acquired during this step, based on the fact that both of the <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>and <italic>OsRpl6-2 </italic>sequences share a similarity in the 3'-terminal region of the intron (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, shaded region).</p></sec><sec><title>3. Duplication of the nuclear rpl6 gene</title><p>The <italic>rpl6 </italic>gene would have been duplicated via genomic DNA, resulting in two <italic>rpl6 </italic>copies (<italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>and <italic>OsRpl6-2</italic>) on different chromosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, step 3). Although we did not conduct Southern blot analysis to determine their copy numbers, the presence of the two <italic>rpl6 </italic>copies in the rice nucleus is probable because of the accuracy of rice genome sequence data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and similarity to numerous <italic>rpl6 </italic>cDNA sequences in the database (data not shown). The duplication event seems to have occurred after the split of the genus <italic>Oryza </italic>from the other monocots, followed by the occurrence of <italic>japonica </italic>and <italic>indica </italic>subspecies, because cDNA sequences corresponding to <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>and <italic>OsRpl6-2 </italic>are also present in the <italic>indica </italic>cultivar [their representative GenBank accession nos. are <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CX108080">CX108080</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CT862828">CT862828</ext-link>, respectively] but not in other monocots (data not shown). This assumption is supported by a maximum likelihood (ML) tree based on the 59 nonredundant <italic>rpl6 </italic>cDNAs from 24 angiosperm genera (data not shown). This ML tree also suggests relatively recent duplications in <italic>Glycine, Hordeum, Ipomoea, Petunia </italic>and <italic>Triticum</italic>. Therefore, it is likely that multiple duplication events occurred during angiosperm evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>4. Acquisition of the 5'-UTR of OsRpl6-1 via a TE</title><p>Despite their coding similarity, transcripts of <italic>OsRpl6-2 </italic>were much less abundant than those of <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The difference in the quantity of transcripts produced by the <italic>rpl6 </italic>genes might be caused by differences in promoter regions because their 5'-noncoding regions differ from a point near the center of the intron (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The most striking findings of this study were that numerous sequences homologous to the region around the 5'-UTR of <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>were detected in the rice genome and that they presumably belong to a TE family. One can raise a question why numerous putative introns linked to the TEs are spread in the rice genome. One speculation could be that a TE was selected as part of the intron of a cellular gene because it contained a functional element such as a promoter or an enhancer, followed by amplification in the rice genome via transpositions. Alternatively, a TE might have selfishly been spread in the rice genome after capture of the 5'-part of intron from an unknown gene source. The evolutionary relationships of these TEs are unclear because the presence of a number of indels in the sequence alignment (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) precludes fine phylogenetic analysis. These TEs might have been transposed at a relatively early evolutionary stage because most of their RESites are missing. This assumption does not contradict the notion of ancient transfer of the <italic>rpl6 </italic>gene to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, the TE within <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>should have been integrated after the duplication event of the rice <italic>rpl6 </italic>gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, step 4) because the <italic>OsRpl6-2 </italic>and <italic>Arabidopsis rpl6 </italic>genes lack such a sequence. The origin and mode of acquisition of the <italic>OsRpl6-2 </italic>5'-UTR is unknown. There is a <italic>Mutator</italic>-like element (MULE) within the 5'-nontranscribed spacer region of <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>(Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, open triangle). This element seems to have been acquired posteriorly. Such nested TE insertions are characteristic of many kinds of TEs. We infer that this MULE has a minor effect on the expression of <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>because it is not conserved among the contemporary transcribed TEs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, asterisks in sequence names). Alternatively, the MULE might act as an enhancer.</p><p>The 5'-UTR and intron within the 5'-UTR are generally thought to contain cis-elements that regulate expression at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels: the former involves promoter and enhancer activities and the latter confers translational efficiency and mRNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The evolutionary origins of noncoding regions (e.g., 5'- and 3'-UTRs, promoters and introns) are mostly unknown, as are those of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes. Recently, topoisomerase I-mediated homologous recombination has been proposed as a mechanism by which the 5'-UTR was acquired in rice <italic>rpl27 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the present report, we describe a novel mechanism for the acquisition of a 5'-UTR via a TE. TEs sometimes transpose in the vicinity of host genes, generating new coding regions and changing gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Among the TEs, MITEs may be sources of cis-acting regulatory elements because of their specific properties. First, MITEs are much more prevalent than other types of TEs in plant genomes. Second, they preferentially insert into genic regions. Finally, MITEs might contain cis-acting elements. Although most of such putative elements have not been demonstrated experimentally, a MITE family that had provided a poly (A) signal has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In addition, it is noteworthy that insertions of a member of the MITE family, <italic>mPing</italic>, may have caused the up- and down-regulation of adjacent genes in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We have not determined which cis-acting element causes differences in the amount of transcripts between the two rice <italic>rpl6 </italic>genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). However, many reports have already established that the 5'-UTR and intron within the 5'-UTR have promoter and enhancer activity. As an alternative hypothesis, it is also possible to assume that the rice <italic>rpl6 </italic>gene gained basal transcriptional machinery prior to the gene duplication event (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, step 2) because both of the rice <italic>rpl6 </italic>copies are transcribed. In this case, the TE within <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>might act as an enhancer.</p><p>Despite some functional ambiguity, judging from the lines of evidence presented here, our results constitute a plausible explanation for the origin and acquisition of the 5'-noncoding region. The generality of the acquisition of a 5'-UTR via a TE is unclear because of the paucity of genomic information on <italic>rpl6 </italic>genes in other monocots and because many TEs are often poorly conserved except for TIRs and TSDs. In fact, we examined the structure of the TEs that retain the entire TIR and are transcribed (Chrs 2a, 2b, 7a, 8b, 9a, 9c and 10), but failed to find any analogous case of <italic>OsRpl6-1</italic>. Their transcripts ended within a region between the TIR (data not shown) and no association with any other proximal genes was predicted. Therefore, to our knowledge, the <italic>OsRpl6-1 </italic>is presently the only example. Additional genomic data on other plant species and further systematic searches may reveal analogous cases of other transferred mitochondrial genes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have demonstrated the evolutionary origin and acquisition mechanism of the 5'-UTR of a transferred mitochondrial gene. We conclude that the 5'-UTR of the transferred <italic>rpl6 </italic>gene was acquired via a TE.
