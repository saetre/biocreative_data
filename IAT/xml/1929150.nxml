Although much progress has been made in addressing this challenge, large gaps remain in our understanding of the function and 'purpose' of many genes in even the most well studied model organisms. For instance, only 54% of <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>genes have currently been functionally characterized based on experimental evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The fraction of genes that have well understood functions is even smaller for less 'popular' experimental models.</p><p>Assessing the contribution of a particular gene product to the welfare of the cell is an intrinsically difficult task to perform on a genome-wide scale. The process can be greatly expedited by employing two key experimental resources: first, comprehensive collections of knockout mutants; and second, a rapid and accurate means to determine the fitness of all mutants in parallel under given experimental conditions. Since the introduction of global transposon mutagenesis and gene replacement techniques, gene knockout mutant collections for a variety of micro-organisms have been generated, and many more are in progress. However, robust methods to monitor the fitness of mutants in mixed populations have been elusive; although selecting for enrichment of mutants is relatively easy, it is much more difficult to identify 'unfit' mutants that become depleted after selection.</p><p>To address this problem, we developed a simple and robust method, named MGK (Monitoring of Gene Knockouts), for the rapid identification of genes that contribute to bacterial fitness in various selective conditions. MGK uses flanking sequences of inserted antibiotic cassette (used for inactivation of a gene) as identifiers of mutants and allows simultaneous monitoring of thousands of mutants in a mixed library. In a model MGK screen, we successfully identified all 13 known genes whose inactivation confers aromatic amino acid auxotrophy on <italic>E. coli</italic>. The utility of MGK was further verified by identifying genes whose disruption resulted in bacterial cell death in the presence of the bacteriostatic antibiotic chloramphenicol. The versatility of MGK was demonstrated by applying it to two principally different gene knockout libraries: random transposon insertion library and genetic replacement library.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Principle of MGK</title><p>MGK simultaneously tracks the relative abundance of individual mutants in gene inactivation libraries grown in a reference and experimental condition. This is achieved by hybridizing polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified flanks of the inactivated genes to specifically designed DNA microarrays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The approach utilizes random or defined gene knockout libraries, in which individual genes are inactivated by either transposon insertion or gene replacement (kanamycin resistance [Km<sup>r</sup>] cassette in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of MGK. <bold>(a) </bold>Mixed library is grown in a reference and selective condition, and genomic DNA is isolated from each population. <bold>(b) </bold>Using genomic DNA as template, single-stranded DNA flanks are generated by linear extension of outward-facing insertion cassette-specific biotinylated primers (blue arrows). <bold>(c) </bold>The biotinylated flanks are separated from the template using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, and polyadenylated at the 3'-ends using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in the presence of dATP. <bold>(d) </bold>Microarray targets are PCR-amplified using an oligo d(T) primer (red arrows) and a nested Km<sup>r</sup>-specific primer (black arrows).

Genomic DNA isolated from each population serves as a template in a primer extension reaction. The chromosomal regions flanking the gene replacement cassette or sites of the transposon insertion are linearly amplified by repeated rounds of time-controlled extension of biotinylated primers specific for the Km<sup>r </sup>cassette (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The yield of amplified flanks of the Km<sup>r </sup>cassette corresponds to the relative abundance of individual gene knockout mutants in the population. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads are used to isolate the biotinylated flanks, which are polyadenylated at the 3'-ends using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The flanks are then exponentially PCR amplified using a nested Km<sup>r </sup>cassette-specific primer and an oligo-dT primer, yielding 'MGK targets'. At this step, amino-allyl modified dUTP is incorporated into the MGK targets and subsequently conjugated with fluorescent dyes. A mixture of labeled targets is then hybridized to a custom designed oligonucleotide microarray, and the relative abundance of individual mutants present in the library after growth in the reference and selective conditions is assessed. Once a preliminary list of conditionally essential genes is generated, the phenotypes of individual mutants (either picked from the arrayed gene inactivation defined libraries or engineered <italic>de novo </italic>in the case of random transposon insertion libraries) is verified.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Primers used in this study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Primer name</td><td align="left">Sequence</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">For defined library</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Up-BIO</td><td align="left">5'-biotin-GAACTTCGAACTGCAGGTCGAC-3'</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Dn-BIO</td><td align="left">5'-biotin-GTATAGGAACTTCGAAGCAGCTC-3'</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Up-Cy3</td><td align="left">5'-GGTC<bold>G</bold>ACGGA<bold>C</bold>CCCCG-3'</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Up-Cy5</td><td align="left">5'-GGTC<bold>A</bold>ACGGA<bold>T</bold>CCCCG-3'</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Dn-Cy3</td><td align="left">5'-AAGCAG<bold>T</bold>TCCAG<bold>C</bold>CTACA-3'</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Dn-Cy5</td><td align="left">5'-AAGCAG<bold>C</bold>TCCAG<bold>T</bold>CTACA-3'</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">For random library</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Tn10OE-BIO</td><td align="left">5'-biotin-CAAGATGTGTATCCACCTTAACTTAA-3'</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Tn10OE OUT-Cy3</td><td align="left">5'-ACCAA<bold>T</bold>ATCAT<bold>T</bold>AGGGGAT-3'</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Tn10OE OUT-Cy5</td><td align="left">5'-ACCAA<bold>A</bold>ATCAT<bold>A</bold>AGGGGAT-3'</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">Common for both libraries</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;TATV-3 or Oligo(dT<sub>9 </sub>AT<sub>15</sub>V)</td><td align="left">5'-T<sub>9 </sub>AT<sub>15</sub>V-3'</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;TATV-5 or Oligo(dT<sub>15 </sub>AT<sub>9</sub>V)</td><td align="left">5'-T<sub>15 </sub>AT<sub>9</sub>V-3'</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Mismatched nucleotides are in bold.

For the <italic>E. coli </italic>defined deletion mutant library, 34-mer oligonucleotide sequences were selected from a region about 100 bp upstream and 100 bp downstream of each gene, so that each knockout was represented by two flanking probes. For clarity, the random transposon library and defined deletion library used in this study are referred to as 'random library' and 'defined library', respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>MGK readily identifies genes of a known biochemical pathway</title><p>The aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathway has been well characterized in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Decades of painstaking experiments have identified 18 genes that are involved in the production of aromatic amino acids when they are not readily available in the environment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Thirteen genes belonging to this pathway encode nonredundant enzymes and are expected to be essential for cell growth in medium lacking phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. To evaluate the applicability of MGK for identification of conditionally essential genes, we used MGK to identify mutants (in both a random and a defined library) that are unable to grow in medium lacking aromatic amino acids. The <italic>E. coli </italic>random library of about 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>mutants was generated using random mini-Tn10 transposon mutagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The defined library consisted of 3,985 <italic>E. coli </italic>gene replacement mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]; mutants in this library were mixed at equal ratio (see Materials and methods, below). In addition to demonstrating the flexibility of the method, the use of two types of libraries provided an opportunity to test the versatility of MGK and assess the extent to which mutant representation affected the sensitivity of the MGK screen.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Genes identified by MGK as essential for cell growth in the absence of aromatic amino acids. <bold>(a) </bold>Biosynthetic pathway of aromatic amino acids in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

The disruption of <italic>epd </italic>and <italic>pdxA</italic>, found in the defined library, did cause a growth defect in medium lacking aromatic amino acids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). The encoded enzymes are involved in biosynthesis of pyridoxine (vitamin B<sub>6</sub>), which is an essential co-factor of transaminase steps in the aromatic biosynthesis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Finding these genes in our MGK screen was not surprising because the defined medium used in this study lacks vitamin B<sub>6</sub>. Indeed, growth of the <italic>epd </italic>and <italic>pdxA </italic>mutants was restored to wild-type levels in the medium supplemented with vitamin B<sub>6 </sub>(data not shown). Three other mutants, namely <italic>tktA </italic>identified in the random library, and <italic>rpe </italic>and <italic>ygdD </italic>found in the defined library, also exhibited reduced growth in medium lacking aromatic amino acids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). The encoded enzymes TktA (transketolase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and Rpe (ribulose phosphate 3-epimerase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] are both involved in sugar phosphate interconversion in the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway; the function of YgdD is unknown. Although it is not clear why disruption of these genes reduces cell growth in the absence of aromatic amino acids, the phenotypes of these mutants confirm that they were legitimately identified by MGK. Disruption of the rest of the genes recovered in MGK screens (one from the random library and 20 from the defined library) caused no growth defect in the absence of aromatic amino acids, suggesting that either they were false-positive hits or that our conditions for testing individual mutants did not adequately reproduce the selection pressure experienced by mutants in the mixed library culture.</p><p>The results of this model MGK screen demonstrate that the method is well suited to genome-wide identification of conditionally essential genes. In addition, the comparison of results obtained from two libraries shows that the use of a defined library in which mutants are well represented increases the sensitivity of MGK screen.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of genes whose disruption leads to cell death upon exposure to a bacteriostatic antibiotic</title><p>Bacteriostatic antibiotics inhibit cell growth but they do not significantly decrease the number of viable cells. Proteins whose genetic knockout leads to bacterial cell death upon treatment with bacteriostatic antibiotics may serve as new targets for drug potentiators and may provide important insights into mechanisms of bacterial response to antibiotic stress. Identification of such mutations generally requires the near impossible task of plating thousands of mutant cultures onto multiple plates after exposing them to bacteriostatic antibiotics.</p><p>MGK provides a much better way to identify such mutants. As a proof of concept, we used MGK to identify genes required for survival of <italic>E. coli </italic>during challenge with chloramphenicol, which is a classic bacteriostatic antibiotic that prevents bacterial growth by interfering with the activity of the ribosomal peptidyl transferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The pooled defined library was exposed for two consecutive rounds of 18-hour incubations in the presence of chloramphenicol (80 &#x003bc;g/ml, which is ten times the minimum inhibitory concentration). MGK targets prepared from libraries with or without chloramphenicol selection were hybridized to the microarray. (For entire set of microarray raw data and intensity ratios, see Additional data file 3.)</p><p>We identified 35 genes that exhibited at least threefold reduced signal intensity after cells were exposed to chloramphenicol (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Some of the identified genes were known to be co-transcribed within an operon (<italic>pstC </italic>and <italic>pstS</italic>; <italic>ptsH </italic>and <italic>ptsI</italic>; <italic>sufB </italic>and <italic>sufD</italic>; and <italic>tolQ</italic>, <italic>tolR</italic>, and <italic>tolA</italic>), or their gene products constituted a functional pair (<italic>arcA </italic>and <italic>arcB</italic>). We verified the phenotypes by testing survival of 29 individual mutants upon chloramphenicol treatment (among these 29 mutants, each of the aforementioned operons were represented by one mutant). Of these, 12 mutants exhibited more than fivefold reduced number of viable cells after exposure to chloramphenicol, and therefore they carried deletions of genes that are critical for survival of bacteria upon treatment with a bacteriostatic antibiotic.

The principle of MGK, namely using amplified flanks of the inactivated genes as identifiers of mutants, is shared with previously described techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, MGK has the valuable advantages of high robustness and a streamlined procedure that eliminates the need for <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription, ligation, and multiple PCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Importantly, the method does not rely upon the presence of any specific element in the gene-inactivation cassette such as a T7 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] or molecular bar probes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]; it requires only the synthesis of an insert-specific biotinylated DNA primer. Therefore, it can be applied to any existing gene knockout library (including such species as <italic>Bacillus anthracis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], <italic>Bacillus subtilis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], <italic>Mycobacterium paratuberculosis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], <italic>Neisseria meningitidis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], for which defined libraries are already available).</p><p>As proof of the concept, we demonstrated the ability of MGK to identify accurately the <italic>E. coli </italic>genes that are required for growth in the absence of aromatic amino acids. Employing the defined library, all of the 13 genes whose disruption is expected to cause auxotrophy were identified. Only five of these genes were identified when a random transposon knock-out library was used. The incomplete gene identification using the random library probably arose from a biased transposon distribution along the <italic>E. coli </italic>chromosome. We have evidence that, in our library, the frequency of transposon insertion was skewed in favor of chromosomal regions close to the origin of replication (Additional data files 4 and 5). Thus, although MGK can be applied to both random and defined gene-inactivation libraries, the selection carried out with the defined library provides a more comprehensive list of mutants with the desired phenotype.</p><p>Several additional factors make a defined gene-inactivation library a more favorable starting material for the MGK selection. In a defined library each gene is targeted individually for mutagenesis, which allows better representation of knockout mutants within a collection comprised of a limited number of strains (3,985 mutants in the Keio collection). With a random knockout library, even of a high complexity (1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>in our random gene knockout library), the inactivation of every nonessential gene is never certain. In addition to uncertainty of saturation, that transposon insertion in a gene does not always result in functional inactivation complicates the analysis of random transposon mutants in a pool. Furthermore, the opportunity to use a collection with a smaller number of mutants without sacrificing comprehensiveness is advantageous for <italic>in vivo </italic>selections in which the size of the inoculum is limited. Another important benefit of utilizing defined collections of mutants for MGK studies is the ease of testing phenotypes of individual strains. Unlike random libraries, in which mutant strains are generated as a mixture, necessitating the re-engineering of each strain of interest, defined collections consist of strains that have already been individually archived.</p><p>We further verified the power of the MGK technique by identifying <italic>E. coli </italic>genes that are critical for bacterial survival during exposure to a bacteriostatic antibiotic chloramphenicol. Applying MGK, we identified 12 genes (<italic>ahpC</italic>, <italic>apaH</italic>, <italic>arcA</italic>, <italic>clpA</italic>, <italic>dgkA</italic>, <italic>lpp</italic>, <italic>mdh</italic>, <italic>ompA</italic>, <italic>prc</italic>, <italic>tolQ</italic>, <italic>ybeX</italic>, and <italic>yjjY</italic>), whose disruption was shown to cause cell death in the presence of chloramphenicol. The functions of several genes from this set are related to biosynthesis or structure of the bacterial envelope. These include <italic>dgkA</italic>, which encodes diacylglycerol kinase (involved in phospholipid turnover) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; <italic>ompA</italic>, which encodes an outer membrane porin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; <italic>lpp</italic>, which encodes an outer membrane protein anchoring the outer membrane to the peptidoglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]; and <italic>prc</italic>, which encodes a periplasmic protease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It is possible that the inhibition of protein synthesis by chloramphenicol weakens the cell envelope because of difference in stability between biosynthetic and metabolizing enzymes, and that this process is exacerbated in these mutants, which leads to cell death upon treatment with a protein synthesis inhibitor. We also found that disruption of <italic>arcA </italic>and <italic>arcB</italic>, which comprise the ArcAB two-component signal transduction system that is involved in regulation of aerobic respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], as well as disruption of the gene <italic>ahpC</italic>, which encodes a subunit of alkylhydroperoxide reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], led to cell death upon treatment with chloramphenicol. This finding may indicate that the ability to cope efficiently with oxidative stress is critical to bacterial survival upon cessation of translation. Analysis of these and other genes identified in the MGK screen is currently in progress. Products encoded in some of the identified genes may provide new insights into the mechanism of antibiotic action and interesting venues for developing antibiotic potentiators.</p><p>The results presented in this study clearly support the utility of MGK for simultaneous analysis of the relative fitness of a large number of mutants in a mixed culture, and therefore for identifying conditionally essential genes. However, like other genome-wide approaches, MGK is expected to yield a certain fraction of false positive hits. The direct testing of phenotypes of individual mutants appears to indicate that approximately half of the mutants we identified using the cut-off criteria described in the Materials and methods section (see below) were false positive. It should be noted, however, that when tested in monoculture, a mutant may exhibit growth characteristics different from those when it is grown in competition with other mutants. In general, the number of false-positive mutants can be further reduced by increasing the number of independent experiments, or using a more stringent cut-off value for the hybridization signal intensity ratio. However, if the list of identified genes is relatively small, then it is easy to test individual strains to confirm or refute predicted phenotypes when access to individual mutants is readily available (as in the defined libraries).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this paper we have described a new technique, MGK, which employs DNA microarrays to assess simultaneously the relative fitness of gene-inactivation mutants grown under selective conditions. As proof of principle, we have demonstrated the ability of MGK by identifying all 13 <italic>E. coli </italic>genes that are known to be required for growth in medium lacking aromatic amino acids. In addition, we applied MGK to identify genes that are critical for survival during treatment with a bacteriostatic antibiotic, namely chloramphenicol. Furthermore, we showed that although MGK can be applied to analysis of different types of inactivation libraries, the sensitivity of the screen improves with the comprehensiveness of mutant representation (as shown by comparison of the results of the screens performed with the defined and random libraries). The results presented in this study clearly demonstrate that MGK provides a rapid and accurate means to identify conditionally essential genes by simultaneously assessing the relative fitness of gene inactivation mutants in a complex collection.</p><p>The spectrum of possible applications of MGK is very broad. As a functional genomics tool, the method can facilitate characterization of genes with unknown functions, and may reveal new tasks of previously characterized genes. MGK can be applied to the identification of drug targets and can be employed to search for virulence factors in bacterial pathogens. Furthermore, MGK is not limited to assessing the fitness contributions of protein-encoding genes; the methodology can easily be adapted to study the effects of different chromosomal alterations, including inactivation of noncoding RNAs and gene-controlling elements. Overall, MGK can serve as a powerful experimental tool for any micro-organism in which global mutagenesis can be performed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of microarray targets</title><p>MGK microarray target preparation includes six steps: preparation of genomic DNA, linear amplification of single-stranded DNA flanking the gene-inactivation cassette, separation of single-stranded flanks from genomic DNA, polyadenylation of the 3'-ends of single-stranded flanks, PCR amplification of the DNA flanks, and fluorescent dye conjugation.

After growing to OD<sub>600 </sub>0.4, the culture was diluted to OD<sub>600 </sub>0.1 and grown to OD<sub>600 </sub>3, at which point cells were harvested for genomic DNA isolation. For phenotype verification, individual mutants from the defined library were grown to OD<sub>600 </sub>0.2, at which point chloramphenicol was added at 80 &#x003bc;g/ml and incubated for 18 hours. The number of viable cells was determined at zero time point and after chloramphenicol treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Additional data files</title><p>The following additional data files are available with the online version of this paper.
