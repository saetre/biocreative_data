One possible strategy used by ticks to evade the host immune response is to produce proteins that selectively bind and neutralize the chemokines that normally recruit cells of the innate immune system that protect the host from parasites. We have identified distinct cDNAs encoding novel chemokine binding proteins (CHPBs), which we have termed Evasins, using an expression cloning approach. These CHBPs have unusually stringent chemokine selectivity, differentiating them from broader spectrum viral CHBPs. Evasin-1 binds to CCL3, CCL4, and CCL18; Evasin-3 binds to CXCL8 and CXCL1; and Evasin-4 binds to CCL5 and CCL11. We report the characterization of Evasin-1 and -3, which are unrelated in primary sequence and tertiary structure, and reveal novel folds. Administration of recombinant Evasin-1 and -3 in animal models of disease demonstrates that they have potent antiinflammatory properties. These novel CHBPs designed by nature are even smaller than the recently described single-domain antibodies (Hollinger, P., and P.J. Hudson. 2005. <italic>Nat. Biotechnol</italic>. 23:1126&#x02013;1136), and may be therapeutically useful as novel antiinflammatory agents in the future.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: CHPB, chemokine binding protein; mBSA, methylated BSA; SELDI, surface enhanced laser desorption ionization; SPR, surface plasmon resonance.</p></fn><fn><p>A.

Inhibitory binding proteins for proinflammatory cytokines, including TBP, IFNAR, and IL-18 BP, have also been described in humans, but no secreted chemokine binding proteins (CHPBs) have so far been identified in vertebrates. However, internal and external parasites have evolved chemokine neutralization strategies that allow them to productively suppress the mammalian immune response to prolong survival on their host. Ticks are bloodsucking parasites whose role in the transmission of pathogens such as <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, which causes Lyme disease, has been the subject of intensive research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Ticks feed on their hosts for relatively long periods of time, ranging from several days to weeks, and provided that they do not carry infectious agents, can remain essentially undetected by their hosts. To achieve this, they have evolved an arsenal of antiinflammatory, anticoagulant, and analgesic agents that are used to render the ticks invisible to the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Little is known about the molecular nature of such agents, but the cloning and characterization of these factors may shed light on the immunoevasion mechanisms used by these organisms, as well as yield novel proteins of potential therapeutic use in human inflammatory pathologies.</p><p>Successful prevention of the activity of families of small chemoattractant proteins called chemokines has been shown for several viral CHBPs (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>]), and, more recently, by a CHBP isolated from the parasitic worm <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Deletion of the gene encoding the broad spectrum CHPB T1 from the rabbit poxvirus myxoma virus resulted in extensive leukocyte infiltration in the dermis of the infected animal, which was absent upon infection by the wild-type virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). This study clearly demonstrated that the virus had evolved a mechanism that prevented the recruitment of leukocytes to the site of infection.</p><p>Recently, the presence of antichemokine activities has been reported in tick saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Tick salivary gland extracts were shown to contain an activity that neutralized CXCL8, and in a later study, neutralization of other chemokines was also demonstrated. Our own analyses of tick saliva harvested during feeding also demonstrated the presence of molecules that bound to CXCL8, CCL3, and CCL5. Using an expression cloning strategy to identify the protein(s) in tick saliva that bind to chemokines, we cloned a CHPB, which we called Evasin-1, that specifically binds to the CC chemokines CCL3, CCL4, and CCL18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). We also cloned a second protein of similar size, Evasin-2, for which the ligand remains to be elucidated. Subsequent rescreening of the tick salivary gland cDNA library with a selection of chemokines and cytokines enabled us to identify two further CHBPs. In this study, we report the cloning of a CXC CHPB named Evasin-3 and a second CC CHPB, distinct from Evasin-1, named Evasin-4. Interestingly, Evasin-3 bears no sequence homology to Evasin-1 and -4, which appear to belong to the same structural family. The three proteins are all surprisingly small compared with other chemokine and cytokine binding proteins described to date. Evasin-1 and -3 were crystallized, and their three-dimensional structures have been solved, revealing novel folds with binding modes distinct from that of viral CHBPs. Investigations of their specificity in vitro and their efficacy in vivo in animal models of chronic inflammatory diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, arthritis, and psoriasis have demonstrated that the Evasins have potent antiinflammatory activities, providing tantalizing new insights into scaffolds evolved by nature to inhibit inflammation.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Evidence for the presence of CHPBs in tick saliva and their expression cloning</title><p>We analyzed the ability of saliva from <italic>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</italic> (common brown dog tick) to inhibit the binding of the I<sup>125</sup>-labeled chemokines CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL8, as well as CCL3, to their respective receptors using a scintillation proximity assay. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>, inhibition of binding was achieved for CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL8, with the most potent effect on CCL3. No inhibition was observed for CCL2 although saliva harvested from another tick species, <italic>Amblyomma cajennense</italic>, appeared to have anti-CCL2 activity (unpublished data). The possibility that the inhibition was caused by degradation of the radiolabeled chemokines by a proteolytic activity in the saliva was addressed by incubation of the radiolabeled chemokines in saliva for 4 h. Subsequent analysis by SDS-PAGE revealed that no degradation of the chemokine had occurred (unpublished data). We next addressed the question of whether there was more than one binding protein present in the saliva by testing whether an excess of CXCL8 was able to block the activity of the CCL3 binding protein. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>, a 500-fold excess of CXCL8 had no effect on the ability of the saliva to inhibit CCL3 binding to CCR5, therefore suggesting the presence of at least two binding proteins.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Chemokine binding activity in tick saliva.</bold> (a) Tick saliva inhibits the binding of CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL8 to their cognate receptors. Radiolabeled chemokines were incubated with CHO cell membranes expressing CCR1 for CCL3 and CCL5, and CXCR2 for CXCL8, in the presence of 1 &#x003bc;l, 10 &#x003bc;l, or in the absence of tick saliva. The antichemokine activity is caused by the presence of more than one binding protein because an excess of CXCL8 did not abolish the inhibition of CCL3 binding. Error bars represent the mean &#x000b1; SEM. (b) Detection of CHPBs in tick saliva by SPR. Sensograms demonstrated binding to CCL5(E66A) and CCL3 immobilized on a CM4 chip. (c) Detection of distinct CHPBs to CCL5 and CXCL8 by Retentate chromatography SELDI of flight mass spectrometry (RC-SELDI-TOF-MS). Tick saliva was incubated on a PS-20 Proteinchip array coated with either CCL5 (bottom), CXCL8 (middle), or the control protein equine myoglobin (top). Specific peaks, indicated by arrows, corresponding to a protein with a mass of 11,052 Daltons binding to CCL5 and of 7,133 Daltons for the binding to CXCL8 were observed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052019f01"></graphic></fig><p>Incubation of <sup>125</sup>I-CCL3 with tick saliva, followed by chemical cross-linking, produces a clear band shift when the reaction products were analyzed on SDS PAGE, and this method was adopted as a screening assay in our attempts to clone the tick CHBPs. We therefore used the band shift assay to screen supernatants from HEK293 cells transfected with a tick salivary gland cDNA library, to identify a cDNA encoding Evasin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) performed with immobilized CCL3 and CCL5 demonstrated the presence of binding proteins for these two chemokines in tick saliva (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref>), and surface enhanced laser desorption ionization (SELDI) identified peaks that bound to immobilized CXCL8 and CCL5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref>), but surprisingly, no peak was observed for CCL3 (not depicted). The masses identified by SELDI indicated very small proteins with a mass of 7,133 Daltons binding to CXCL8 and a mass of 11,052 Daltons binding to CCL5; these masses are very close to those of the predicted protein cores, as discussed in the following section.</p><p>We therefore rescreened the cDNA library using a cocktail of chemokines and cytokines, containing iodinated CXCL8, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-2. IL-2 was included because an anti-IL-2 activity has previously been reported in tick salivary gland extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). In the first round of screening, we identified a band shift in one pool of 270 clones. After deconvolution of the positive pool, and cross-linking to the individual iodinated proteins present in the cocktail, we identified a cDNA encoding a CXCL8 binding protein. As we had previously identified a putative CHBP that we named Evasin-2, the function of which remains to be elucidated, we called the CXCL8 binding protein Evasin-3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>, lane 3). Competition experiments using a panel of chemokines (CCL3, CXCL1, CXCL4, CXCL7, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL12, and CXCL13) indicated that only CXCL1 and CXCL8 were able to compete with radiolabeled CXCL8 for binding to Evasin-3 (unpublished data). We then screened the expression library with a second cocktail consisting of iodinated CCL5, CCL11, and CXCL10. Upon analysis of supernatants from HEK cells transfected with the pools of clones from the cDNA expression library, we observed a band shift migrating at &#x0223c;50 kD in several pools. This band was almost masked by a nonspecific band migrating at &#x0223c;60 kD detected in all experiments. Deconvolution of the positive pools revealed a cDNA clone that was able to mediate cross-linking to both CCL5 and CCL11 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>, lanes 4 and 5), but not CXCL10 when tested in HEK293 cells. The CCL5 and CCL11 binding protein was named Evasin-4.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of Evasin-3 and -4.</bold> (a) Identification of Evasin-3 and -4 by cross-linking to radiolabeled chemokine in supernatants from transfected HEK293 cells.

The cDNA for Evasin-4 encoded an ORF of 117 amino acids. Cleavage of the signal peptide sequence predicted that using the Signal P algorithm would generate a mature protein of 110 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 12,032 Daltons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 b</xref>). Analyses of the amino acid sequences of Evasin-3 and -4 revealed that Evasin-3 was unrelated to Evasin-1, whereas the Cys residues of the mature Evasin-4 sequence demonstrated an almost perfect alignment with those of Evasin-1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 b</xref>). This indicates an identical disulfide topology, suggesting that these two proteins are structurally related, despite their relatively low level of identity at the amino acid level (27% identity over 91 amino acids). Conservation of a homologous fold, despite a low level of identity at the primary sequence level, is well known in protein families such as cytokines and chemokines.</p><p>Transient expression of C-terminal 6His tagged Evasin-3 and -4 in HEK293 cells revealed that unlike Evasin-1, these two proteins were poorly secreted. We were able to obtain a small amount of purified Evasin-3 (150 &#x003bc;g), which was extensively glycosylated for in vitro characterization. SPR analysis revealed that Evasin-3, similar to Evasin-1, is a highly selective CHPB in that it was only able to bind to CXCL1 and CXCL8 and their murine counterparts, KC and MIP-2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 c</xref>). The kinetic parameters, as determined by SPR, are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>. It has proven difficult to produce recombinant 6His-tagged Evasin-4 in HEK293 cells, thus the identification of the N terminus of the mature protein has not yet been experimentally verified. Using the Signal P program to predict the cleavage site of the putative signal peptide sequence indicates that the mature protein sequence would commence with WLSTKC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 b</xref>). However, secondary structure predictions show that these amino acids are contained in a helix, suggesting that signal peptide cleavage may in fact be after Cys23, yielding an N terminus of EVPQM, as predicted by the latest version of Signal P. Nevertheless, alignment of the amino acid sequences of Evasin-4 and -1 still shows that Evasin-4 has an extended N terminus compared with Evasin-1, which may be an important determinant of ligand binding specificity. We are currently testing different expression strategies to obtain sufficient Evasin-4 for N-terminal sequence verification and for in vitro and in vivo studies.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table I.</label><caption><p>Binding characteristics of Evasin-1 and -3 as determined by SPR</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="bottom">CKBP <hr/></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="bottom">Chemokine <hr/></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="bottom">k<sub>a</sub> &#x000d7;

Indeed, there are currently many intense drug discovery programs in this area. Yet, although there are numerous reports of the efficacy of small molecule antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), and other antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) in animal models of disease, it has proven to be more of a challenge to translate these molecules into medicines in the clinic. Although many molecules are currently progressing into late-stage clinical trials, it is possible that alternative approaches may be needed to successfully target the chemokine&#x02013;chemokine receptor interaction. Ticks have evolved natural antichemokine strategies in the guise of CHPBs, which are able to counter the host defense systems against parasites. Unraveling the molecular nature of these CHBPs may produce novel insights into the design of therapeutically useful chemokine blocking agents.</p><p>In this study, we describe the cloning and characterization of a family of CHPBs from tick saliva. In vitro characterization of the family members identified to date indicates that these CHBPs are considerably different from the known viral CHPBs in terms of chemokine selectivity. Many of the viral CHBPs such as myxoma virus M-T7 and murine gammaherpes virus 68 M3 and the recently identified <italic>S. mansoni</italic> (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>]) tend toward broad selectivity, binding both CC and CXC chemokines; the Evasins described here have restricted selectivity. In the studies presented here, we have shown that Evasins are able to bind and inhibit specific chemokines in vitro, and inhibit leukocyte recruitment induced by their respective ligands in simple models of leukocyte recruitment in mice. Furthermore, the antiinflammatory properties of Evasins were confirmed mechanistically by intravital microscopy where their administration both in naive and inflamed mice abrogated leukocyte adhesion to, and transmigration across, the endothelium. Together, these experiments clearly demonstrated the potential of Evasins to prevent leukocyte recruitment.</p><p>We evaluated the Evasins in more complex animal models of human disease. Evasin-1, which is highly selective for CCL3 and CCL4, reduced symptoms in a murine model of skin inflammation that resembles psoriasis in humans, in which several CC chemokines are implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Because both Evasin-1 and -3 were shown to prevent neutrophil influx, they were subsequently tested in disease models in which neutrophils have previously been shown to play an important role. Thus, in the CCL3-dependent bleomycin-induced lung injury, Evasin-1 reduced leukocyte influx, fibrosis, and lethality, an effect qualitatively and quantitatively similar to experiments in CCL3-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Blockade of CXCR2 has been reported to prevent leukocyte influx and joint damage in several models of experimental arthritis in rats and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Evasin-3, which binds to both human and murine CXCR2 ligands, prevented neutrophil influx into the joint in a model of antigen-induced arthritis. Interestingly, this treatment also prevented the local production of TNF-&#x003b1;, a cytokine that has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of arthritis, and which is associated with hypernociception or inflammatory pain in experimental animals. Indeed, blockade of TNF-&#x003b1; with biologicals has been successful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatologic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>).</p><p>Our initial expectation was that identification of CHBPs in primitive eukaryotic species such as ticks may allow us to identify orthologues in mammalian genomes, based on either primary sequence or on the three-dimensional folds of the CHBPs. However, extensive searching of public databases at both the amino acid and nucleotide sequence level have indicated that there are no human or mammalian orthologues or structural counterparts to the Evasins. On the other hand, by blast analysis of the available tick sequences, we were able to identify an EST in the cattle tick <italic>Boophilus microplus</italic> that may encode a potential orthologue of Evasin-1 (30% identity over 95 amino acids). Although the level of identity is low, it is comparable to that seen between Evasin-1 and -4. We are now in the process of producing the <italic>Boophilus microplus</italic> protein to verify if it is indeed a CHPB. It is likely that additional CHPBs from other species of tick will be identified in due course through homology searching, as the number of tick EST sequences appearing in public databases increases from tick salivary gland transcriptome sequencing projects.</p><p>Thus, it appears that ticks have specifically developed novel protective CKBPs as they adapted to their chemokine-producing vertebrate hosts. Although mammals do have molecules that can bind and block chemokine function, they are molecularly and structurally distinct from the Evasins. For example, the atypical chemokine receptors such as D6, CCX-CKR, and Duffy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>) are nonsignaling GPCRs that appear to be able to function as mammalian equivalents of the soluble CKBPs expressed by pathogens and parasitic worms. This suggests that, contrary to viral chemokines and chemokine receptors that have been hijacked from the mammalian genome, pathogens have evolved CKBPs through a &#x0201c;convergent&#x0201d; evolution mechanism.</p><p>The leukocytes involved in the first line of defense against pathogens and parasites are neutrophils and eosinophils. The CHBPs described here specifically inhibit the chemokines that recruit these cell types; Evasin-1 (in rodents) and Evasin-3 prevent neutrophil accumulation, and preliminary results indicate that Evasin-4 binds the eosinophil-recruiting chemokines CCL5 and CCL11. Moreover, their selectivity profiles highlight the issue of species specificity in the chemokine system. The common brown dog tick feeds on dogs and other domestic animals, as well as rodents, deer, and humans; thus, in spite of chemokine selectivity, one would expect species cross-reactivity. We have performed our studies using human chemokines, and in some cases, their murine counterparts, and have shown that the Evasins are able to bind to chemokines in both species. The cross species reactivity may be an advantage in the development of these molecules as potential therapeutic agents, as one of the pitfalls in the development of small molecule antagonists of human chemokine receptors has been their lack of cross-reactivity with rodent chemokine receptors, which has hampered testing in animal models of disease, PK/PD, and toxicological studies. However, results obtained from in vivo testing of Evasins still needs to be interpreted with caution, as there are known differences in specific chemokine receptor expression on immune cells between the human and murine system, particularly on neutrophils. In humans, the principal mediators of neutrophil recruitment are CXC chemokines 1&#x02013;8, acting through CXCR2, and CXCL8, which acts on both CXCR1 and CXCR2. On the contrary, recruitment of murine neutrophils is mediated by both CCR1 and CXCR2, and perhaps also the recently identified murine CXCR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), although little is known about the role of the latter in vivo. However, CCR1 is not normally expressed on human neutrophils, although it can be induced by IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Interestingly, CCL3 has been shown to recruit neutrophils when injected into human skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Thus, Evasin-1 shows activity against CCL3-mediated neutrophil recruitment rather than monocyte recruitment in the mouse, whereas the ability of Evasin-3 to recruit neutrophils is predictable from its binding profile. It should also be noted that although Evasin-1 has a higher affinity for its ligands than Evasin-3, the latter is more efficacious in the murine models we have tested.</p><p>Saliva from ticks harvested at different times during their feeding periods has differential chemokine inhibitory activity, suggesting that different CHPBs are produced at different times during feeding, with the aim of selectively inhibiting specific cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). It is possible that the most potent inhibitor of neutrophil recruitment produced by the tick is Evasin-3, whereas Evasin-1 may be produced to inhibit (later) monocyte recruitment in nonrodent hosts, as well as T lymphocytes, as was observed in the bleomycin lung inflammation model. Unfortunately, the expression profile of chemokine receptors on leukocytes in the dog, which although its name implies is the preferred host, may simply be the most easily available food source, is unknown and hence we cannot substantiate this hypothesis. Lastly, the availability of recombinant Evasin-4 will enable us to address the ability of this CHBP to modulate eosinophil trafficking because both CCL5 and CCL11 have been extensively described to recruit this cell type.</p><p>A striking feature of these proteins is their small size. Both viral and mammalian chemokine and cytokine binding proteins have been shown to be much larger, generally &#x0223c;30&#x02013;40 kD. On the other hand, <italic>R. sanguineus</italic> has developed very small, highly selective CHBPs. Interestingly, these proteins are similar in size, if not smaller, than the naturally occurring single chain antibodies such as shark V-NAR domains (15 kD) or camelid VhH domains (15 kD). Large efforts are currently being undertaken to produce small proteins known as nanobodies, minibodies, or microproteins, created by rational design in silico, which will mimic the binding properties of natural single-domain antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). The two proteins described here represent highly potent, miniaturized scaffolds that have evolved to selectively bind certain proteins, pivotal to the immune response, and which could be useful in the creation of new scaffolds, paving the way for development of these molecules as novel antiinflammatory agents.</p><p>One of the important issues surrounding the use of any protein as a potential therapeutic agent concerns immunogenicity, which could be particularly pertinent for nonhuman proteins. There are already examples of xenoproteins in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>) and others are entering clinical trials. However, as these proteins are generally administered in a single dose for acute indications, potential immunogenicity is not a major concern. However, treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases with therapeutic proteins such as IFN-&#x003b2; or antibodies, e.g., Raptiva and Etanercept, requires chronic administration, and even fully human proteins can elicit an antibody response that may reduce the efficacy of the treatment. By their very nature, antiinflammatory proteins in tick saliva do not appear to be immunogenic. It is still unclear if this is entirely caused by the inhibition of immune cell recruitment to the attachment site, or indeed whether the protein structure itself or through glycosylation minimizes exposure of antigenic epitopes. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of T cell epitopes on Evasins using software developed by Biovation (EMD Serono) revealed that the tick Evasins have relatively few potential immunogenic epitopes compared with other therapeutic proteins currently in the clinic, such as IFN-&#x003b2;. It is also interesting to note that only 1 mouse out of 6 treated for 25 d had an IgG response to Evasin-1 (unpublished data). So although immunogenicity in the murine system will not predict the outcome in humans, further evaluation of Evasins in preclinical models is warranted for their development as potential protein therapeutic agents.</p><p>Lastly, the mining of the salivary transcriptomes of the numerous species of ticks will provide a wealth of potential immunomodulatory molecules, and other pharmacologically relevant proteins, which will provide novel molecular entities to enrich the current repertoire of biotherapeutics in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Biochemical analysis of antichemokine activity in saliva.</title><p>Collection of <italic>R. sanguineus</italic> saliva, inhibition of receptor binding and the cross-linking assay were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>).

The sensograms were analyzed using BIAcore 3000 evaluation software after subtraction of nonspecific binding to the control protein. Retentate chromatography SELDI mass spectrometry (RC-SELDI-TOF-MS) was used to detect distinct CHPBs in the tick saliva.
