Fifty-one of 54 GST family members were transcribed and 41 found to express as functional glutathione-dependent enzymes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Functional redundancy was observed and in particular three theta (T) class GSTs showed conserved activities as hydroperoxide-reducing glutathione peroxidases (GPOXs). When expressed in tobacco as GFP fusions, all three GSTTs localized to the peroxisome, where their GPOX activity could prevent membrane damage arising from fatty acid oxidation. Through alternative splicing, two of these GSTTs form fusions with Myb transcription factor-like domains. Examination of one of these variants showed discrete localization within the nucleus, possibly serving a role in reducing nucleic acid hydroperoxides or in signalling. Based on this unexpected differential sub-cellular localization, 15 other GST family members were expressed as GFP fusions in tobacco. Most accumulated in the cytosol, but GSTU12 localized to the nucleus, a family member resembling a bacterial tetrachlorohydroquinone dehalogenase selectively associated with the plasma membrane, and a lambda GSTL2 was partially directed to the peroxisome after removal of a putative chloroplast transit peptide. Based on the results obtained with the GSTTs, it was concluded that these proteins can exert identical protective functions in differing subcellular compartments.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>confocal microscopy</kwd><kwd>glutathione peroxidase</kwd><kwd>green fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>lipid hydroperoxides</kwd><kwd><italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic></kwd><kwd>peroxisome</kwd><kwd><italic>Strep</italic> tag</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glutathione transferases (GSTs; EC 2.5.1.18) in plants are a superfamily of proteins which can be clustered into six groupings based on similarities in sequence and gene organization, namely the phi (F), tau (U), theta (T), zeta (Z), lambda (L), and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<italic>b</italic></xref>). Recent informatic studies in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (L.) Heynh have also revealed a further single representative of an additional type of GST which most closely resembles the bacterial tetrachlorohydroquinone dehalogenase (TCHQD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edwards and Dixon, 2005</xref>). Recently progress has been made in defining the function of some of the smaller groups of plant GSTs. Thus GSTZs appear to function as glutathione (GSH)-dependent isomerases in tyrosine catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dixon and Edwards, 2006</xref>), while the DHARs are active in ascorbic acid recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<italic>a</italic></xref>). By contrast, the functions of the majority of plant GSTs remain unknown. Using <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> as an example, individual GSTs have been shown to be involved in flavonoid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kitamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), with many studies also implicating them in a wide range of responses to stress, infection, and plant hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moons, 2005</xref>). An underlying problem in studying the functions of these proteins by classical molecular genetic methods is that multiple members of this large gene family can have identical roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfenito <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), with this redundancy concealing function on gene disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouch&#x000e9; and Bouchez, 2001</xref>).</p><p>As an alternative to genetic studies, it has been of interest to use a combination of biochemical and histochemical methods to investigate the functions of individual GSTs from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. As a first step, the members of this superfamily of genes encoding functional GSH-dependent transferases and peroxidases needed to be identified. At the next level of enquiry, it was then helpful to know where individual GSTs are expressed in the plant cell, as that could focus the future search for likely physiologically relevant substrates or binding partners. The importance of understanding the sub-cellular localization of GSTs when defining the function of these proteins has recently been demonstrated. Thus, when maize tau class GSTs were expressed in bacteria they were found to interact with porphyrinogen intermediates of haem biosynthesis, catalysing their GSH conjugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Similarly, the transplastomic expression of these proteins in tobacco caused similar changes in porphyrin metabolism. However, despite the apparent selectivity of these GSTs for binding and conjugation of porphyrin intermediates, this does not appear to be their function <italic>in planta</italic> due to their exclusive expression in the cytosol where they are physically separated from mainstream tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in the chloroplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tanaka and Tanaka, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Relatively little attention has been paid to the cellular localization of plant GSTs, as the majority lack obvious sub-cellular targeting sequences and are therefore predicted to accumulate in the cytosol. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, exceptions to this are seen with members of the DHAR (e.g. DHAR3) and lambda (GSTL2) classes where unambiguous N-terminal targeting peptides direct these proteins to the plastid/mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<italic>a</italic></xref>). The phi class GSTF8 also contains a chloroplast-targeting peptide, though differential mRNA splicing leads to the majority of the derived transcripts lacking this signal, giving cytosolic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thatcher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Despite their predicted cytosolic localization, several proteomic studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and other plants have consistently shown that various organellar preparations contain high titres of specific GSTs. For example, comprehensive proteomic analyses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have identified GSTs F2, F8, F9, F10, U19, U20, L2, and DHAR3 in the chloroplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zybailov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), GSTF5 and GSTF6 in the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heazlewood <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and GSTs F2, F6, F7, F9, and F10 in the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Earlier studies in other plants have also reported specific GSTs accumulating in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takahashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>) and apoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flury <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). The presence of these GSTs in organelles may in part be due to cross-contamination from the cytosol, where these hydrophobic proteins can be present at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sappl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Alternatively, it is also possible that these GSTs associate with different sub-cellular fractions as a consequence of their association with other proteins or substrates/ligands and as such an understanding of their sub-cellular localization could be very important in unravelling their endogenous function.</p><p>Reported here are the cloning and expression of the GST superfamily from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and the functional screening of the recombinant proteins of currently unknown function for GSH-dependent enzyme activities. The subcellular localization of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GST family members which lack obvious plastidic/mitochondrial targeting sequences has been examined by generating N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions and determining their localization using confocal microscopy after transiently expressing the fusions in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. A total of 18 family members were selected based on (i) a careful examination of the respective sequences of these proteins to look for C-terminal targeting domains and (ii) proteomics literature suggesting that &#x02018;cytosolic&#x02019; <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GSTs, or orthologues in other plants, were associated with specific organelles. In each case, a library of GSTs cloned into a custom <italic>Strep</italic>-tagged bacterial pET-derived expression plasmid was used, which allowed for the straightforward sub-cloning of sequences into the plant transformation binary vector.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Vectors</title><p>The expression vectors pET-STRP3 and BIN-STRP3 were synthesized as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern365/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> available at <italic>JXB</italic> online).

The cloning and characterization of the GSTZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dixon and Edwards, 2006</xref>), DHARs, and GSTLs from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<italic>a</italic></xref>) has been reported previously. Their further analysis was restricted to their amplification and cloning into the new expression vectors to study their subsequent sub-cellular localization <italic>in planta</italic>. GSTZ1, GSTL1, GSTL2, GSTL3, and DHARs 1&#x02013;3 were successfully amplified, all without any N-terminal targeting peptides. In the case of DHAR4 and GSTZ2, no amplification products were obtained and, since there is no evidence of transcripts for these genes, it was concluded that they were probably pseudogenes.</p><p>cDNAs encoding all 28 GSTUs and 12 of the GSTFs were amplified from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Of the products obtained, GSTF8 was cloned as the splice variant without a plastidic targeting peptide, since this has been shown to be the major form <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thatcher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). GSTF13 could not be amplified and no attempt was made to clone GSTF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartling <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>), which is not encoded within the sequenced <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wagner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The polypeptide sequences of the cloned GSTs matched those predicted from the TAIR 8 genome annotation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.arabidopsis.org">www.arabidopsis.org</ext-link>, April 2008 release), with two exceptions. GSTU17 had a frame-shift, but was identical to EMBL cDNA sequence AF288191, while GSTU21 had a 6 bp downstream shift in the start of the second exon. Thus, <italic>gstf13</italic> was the only possible pseudogene of those tested.</p><p>For the theta GSTs, three genes lie adjacent to one another on chromosome 5 (<italic>GSTT1</italic>=At5g51210; <italic>GSTT2</italic>=At5g41240; <italic>GSTT3</italic>=At5g41220). <italic>GSTT2</italic> and <italic>GSTT3</italic> are unusual in being annotated as GSTs with a C-terminal Myb-like DNA-binding protein fusion (TAIR release 8). An examination of the C-terminal sequences of the three previously identified <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GSTTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wagner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) identified C-terminal SKM or SKI motifs, which would be anticipated to target these proteins to the peroxisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reumann, 2004</xref>). However, with the <italic>GSTT2</italic> and <italic>GSTT3</italic> genes the C-terminal Myb-like extensions masked the putative peroxisome targeting signal. PCR-based cloning successfully amplified the short forms of all three genes, with <italic>GSTT3</italic> amplified by mis-priming with <italic>GSTT2</italic> primers, which introduced an additional methionine at the N-terminus but did not alter the C-terminus. The resulting amplification products encoded the 28 kDa proteins GSTT1, GSTT2, and GSTT3, respectively (for sequences, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern365/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> available at <italic>JXB</italic> online). A long splice variant of <italic>GSTT3</italic> could also be amplified, encoding the 68 kDa GST&#x02013;Myb fusion GSTT3L. Although not isolated, splice variants of <italic>GSTT2</italic> encoding the GST&#x02013;Myb fusion GSTT2L have also been reported in the DNA databases.</p><p>In total, 51 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GSTs were found to be transcribed, with the respective coding sequences recovered by PCR amplification.

Using this vector, all cloned GSTs were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Focusing on the phi, tau, and theta class enzymes, a total of 41 GSTs could be purified as soluble proteins using <italic>Strep</italic>-Tactin affinity chromatography (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern365/DC1">Figs S1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern365/DC1">S2</ext-link> in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern365/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> available at <italic>JXB</italic> online). Only GSTF11 and GSTF12 were undetectable in the soluble fraction.

Notably, GSTU12, GSTT1, and GSTT2 were found to co-purify ribosomal proteins, and GSTF5 co-purified the chaperone GroEL. A number of preparations contained a 70 kDa polypeptide identified as the E1 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase, which was therefore presumed to be a non-specific contaminant. For the theta class GSTs, ethidium bromide counterstaining of SDS&#x02013;PAGE gels showed that GSTT1, GSTT2, and GSTT3L contained nucleic acids, while GSTT3 showed only minor contamination (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern365/DC1">Fig. S2B</ext-link>).</p><p>To test for functionality, recombinant phi, tau, and theta class GSTs were assayed for activity toward typical GST substrates. GSH-conjugating activity was assessed using the model xenobiotic substrate CDNB as well as BITC, the latter being a potential natural GST substrate in cruciferous plants derived from the degradation of glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gil and MacLeod, 1980</xref>). GSH-dependent peroxidase (GPOX) activity was routinely determined with cumene hydroperoxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edwards and Dixon, 2005</xref>). To examine the linkage between enzyme activity and relatedness, the results of these assays are represented with the GSTs clustered on the basis of their polypeptide sequence similarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Several of the 41 GSTFs and GSTUs could not be assayed. GSTF11, GSTF12, and GSTF13 could not be cloned, or only expressed as insoluble proteins, while GSTF4, GSTF10, and GSTU15 were only obtained in very low yields. Of the remaining 35 recombinant proteins, 32 showed GSH-dependent enzyme activity, with only GSTF5, GSTF14, and GSTU11 being inactive toward the three substrates tested. Closely related GSTs showed a similar spectrum of enzyme activities, although absolute values for specific activities between enzymes varied. The conjugation of CDNB was the most commonly observed enzyme activity, though it varied over three orders of magnitude within the superfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). BITC was a more discriminating GST substrate, being acted on by most tau class enzymes but rarely by the GSTFs. The majority of the GSTs also had some GPOX activity, with GSTU25 having particularly high activity. When the three GSTTs were assayed, these enzymes were shown to be highly active as GPOXs. To explore these activities in greater detail, two fatty acid hydroperoxides were prepared and found to be excellent GPOX substrates. This was in contrast to GSTU25 which, although showing high GPOX activity towards cumene hydroperoxide, showed little activity toward the fatty acid hydroperoxides that are likely substrates of GPOXs <italic>in planta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartling <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic tree and enzyme activities of bacterially expressed recombinant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> phi (F) and tau (U) class GSTs assayed with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), and cumene hydroperoxide (cumene-OOH).

Examining the functional activities of GSTs and the potential for differential sub-cellular localization, it was apparent that the GSTTs represented a class of proteins which had conserved enzyme activities and the potential for targeting to different subcellular organelles. Thus, GSTs T1, T2, and T3 contained C-terminal domains corresponding to likely peroxisomal targeting motifs (C-terminal SKI, SKM, and SKM motifs, respectively), whereas GSTT2L and GSTT3L contained polypeptide extensions resembling Myb transcription factors which were more likely to direct the fusion proteins to the nucleus. To investigate their sub-cellular localization, GFP fusions of GSTT1, GSTT2, GSTT3 (short form), and GSTT3L (transcription factor fusion) were transiently expressed in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>, and their localization then monitored by laser scanning confocal microscopy.

In each case, these GSTs lacked characterized C-terminal targeting motifs, and the N-terminal transit peptide of GSTF8 was removed prior to testing. GFP&#x02013;GST fusions of all the GSTFs and GSTs U2, U7, U9, U11, U19, and U28 all localized to the cytosol. In most cases GFP fusions were also found at low levels in the nucleus, presumably due to passive diffusion, as illustrated by GFP&#x02013;GSTF2 and GFP&#x02013;GSTU19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>), with both of these GSTs being described as abundantly expressed proteins in proteomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sappl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).

As compared with related GSTs, examination of the GSTU12 polypeptide sequence revealed an N-terminal extension of 25 amino acid residues containing a putative nuclear localization signal (KKRKK), although it is beyond the scope of this work to test whether this signal is necessary and sufficient for nuclear import. Sub-cellular localization studies were then extended to other GSTs containing unusual sequence motifs. The lambda protein GSTL2 (without its N-terminal signal peptide) was selected since it has a potential peroxisomal targeting sequence (ARL) at its C-terminus. GFP&#x02013;GSTL2 was found to localize to both the cytosol and peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>), confirming the presence of a peroxisomal targeting signal.

Of these 51 are transcribed and at least 41 encode functional GSH-dependent enzymes when assayed as GSTs or GPOXs (GSTFs, GSTUs, GSTTs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) thioltransferases or reductases (DHARs and GSTLs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<italic>a</italic></xref>) or isomerases (GSTZs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dixon and Edwards, 2006</xref>). Among the GSTFs, GSTUs, and GSTTs it was clear from the enzyme screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) that family members of related sequence have a broadly similar spectrum of activities as GSTs and GPOXs when assayed with model substrates. While it is conceivable that each enzyme has highly selective activities directed toward a well-defined group of natural substrates, the present results would suggest that it is more likely that there is a substantial overlap of activities and functional redundancy within the superfamily. Expression of particular GST isoenzymes in different plant organs and tissues and in response to different stimuli (e.g. constitutive Vs stress-inducible) have been proposed as reasons to explain this apparent redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Edwards <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frova, 2003</xref>). The results presented here suggest that there is an additional reason for apparent functional redundancy within the family; namely, multiple GSTs with similar activities may be required to perform similar functions in different subcellular compartments. In this respect, the GSTTs serve as an excellent example.</p><p>The three GSTTs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have clearly arisen through gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cannon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), with the enzymes showing conservation in both sequence and enzyme activity. Thus, all three GSTTs were highly active as GPOXs when assayed with organic hydroperoxides. The GFP&#x02013;fusion protein expression studies <italic>in planta</italic> showed that, whereas GSTT1 and the short splice variants of GSTT2 and GSTT3 would express their GPOX activity in the peroxisomes, GSTT3L, with its C-terminal Myb-like extension, was directed to the nucleus where it accumulated in distinct nuclear substructures to give a punctate appearance. This distribution closely resembles that of nuclear speckles, thought to be storage sites for pre-mRNA splicing-related proteins and also other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shaw and Brown, 2004</xref>). Although theta class GSTs have been described in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jowsey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), these enzymes have not attracted the same level of attention as other GST classes. Mammalian GSTTs characteristically exhibit dehalogenase activity, are highly active GPOXs, and show low affinity binding of GSH and little transferase activity toward CDNB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Landi, 2000</xref>). Similarly, plant GSTTs are also highly active as GPOXs, while showing limited GST activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). However, whereas GSTTs in animals are stress responsive proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Landi, 2000</xref>), the respective genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were unresponsive to chemical and abiotic stress treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wagner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the GSTTs were expressly targeted to either the peroxisomes or the nucleus. The expression of GPOX-active GSTTs in peroxisomes presumably reflects the oxidative environment within this compartment which leads to the generation of phytotoxic fatty acid hydroperoxides, which are substrates of these enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, the peroxisomal localization of GSTT1, GSTT2, and GSTT3 would most likely be associated with a protective function in maintaining the integrity of the peroxisomal membranes. Theta class GSTs in other plants also have C-terminal motifs that are likely to result in peroxisomal targeting, including GSTT proteins from rice (GenBank AAK98534), soybean (GenBank AAG34813), and <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> (GenBank ABE92134). However, GSTTs in animals and fungi have no such obvious targeting sequences and have not been reported to be associated with peroxisomes. This is in contrast to other classes of GSTs, such as the kappa class proteins in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and omega-class GSTs in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barreto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), which are known to be targeted to the peroxisomes. This suggests that, despite their sequence and apparent functional conservation across the phyla, GSTTs in plants have been recruited to perform unique roles in peroxisomal metabolism.</p><p>The accumulation of GSTTs in the nucleus is less easy to rationalize. The localization of GSTT3L to this organelle is clearly determined by the presence of the unusual C-terminal extension which resembles a Myb DNA-binding protein. GSTTs have previously been reported in the nucleus in animal cells. Thus, in hepatocytes, GSTTs are expressed evenly in both the cytosol and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liteplo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sherratt <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), with one report of preferential nuclear expression in specialized murine tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Quondamatteo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). This suggests that GSTTs may have originally evolved functions which are required both in the cytosol and in the nucleus. In plants, the latent ability of GSTTs to bind to nucleic acids may offer a clue as to the functional significance of the selective localization of GSTT isoforms. When affinity purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>, both GSTT1 and GSTT2 preparations were heavily contaminated with nucleic acid and ribosomal polypeptide components (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern365/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link> in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern365/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> available at <italic>JXB</italic> online). It is likely that the RNA-binding properties of these proteins are due to their basic nature (calculated pI of pH 9.50 and pH 9.32 for GSTT1 and GSTT2, respectively) giving rise to non-specific interactions with nucleic acids. The short splice variant of GSTT3 did not bind nucleic acids when expressed in bacteria, presumably due to its less basic nature (pI 8.89), whereas GSTT3L with its C-terminal extension showed obvious nucleic acid contamination. These results clearly demonstrate that GSTT3L binds nucleic acids as a consequence of its transcription factor-like domain (although this is unlikely to be as clear-cut for GSTT2L since GSTT2 retains RNA binding). This may suggest that for GSTT3L to exhibit a selective function in the nucleus there has been selective pressure to decrease the non-specific binding of nucleic acid to the GSTT domain, as achieved through the replacement of basic residues. Instead, the ability to selectively bind to nucleic acids has been introduced through the fusion with the Myb-like domain. While the function of GSTT3L is yet to be determined, it is speculated that these proteins either play a redox-sensitive role in controlling transcription, or are involved in specialized nucleic acid repair. With respect to the latter hypothesis, it is known that mammalian GSTTs reduce DNA hydroperoxides formed <italic>in vitro</italic> through X-ray radiation damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>). It is therefore possible that targeted by the C-terminal Myb-like domain, the function of GSTT3L is to repair actively transcribed DNA segments which are subject to elevated levels of oxidative damage. Examination of other plant GSTT sequences failed to identify similar fusions in other species, so the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GSTT fusions may have a very specialized role that most plants either do not require or have an alternative system in place.</p></sec><sec><title>Localization of other GSTs</title><p>Most of the GSTs tested accumulated in the cytosol, as expected based on their lack of any obvious targeting sequences. This does suggest that members of this cytosolic group of GSTs which are reported to associate with mitochondrial, chloroplastic, and vacuolar proteomes do so as a result of contamination of these organelles with these relatively abundant and hydrophobic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heazlewood <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zybailov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Similar conclusions have been made regarding GSTA1-1 in rats, which though known to be expressed in the cytosol accumulate to high levels in the outer nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stella <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). While this may explain the presence of relatively abundant cytosolic GSTs as proteome components of organelles in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, it is also possible that family members which are present in lower abundance in the cell are carried into organelles through interactions with explicitly targeted proteins. Intriguingly, some, but not all of the predominantly cytosolic GFP&#x02013;GST fusions were also present at low levels in the nucleus, consistent with their import by passive diffusion. It is possible that the GFP&#x02013;GSTUs which solely localized to the cytosol did so as a consequence of the size of the fusion protein precluding nuclear import, with the smaller native GSTs more likely to enter the pores. Certainly the GFP&#x02013;GST fusions appeared to be processed as fully functional polypeptides which, in view of their stability and yield, were most likely expressed as homodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). In any event, the ability of several of the GSTs to move between the nucleus and cytosol should be taken into account when considering their potential ligands and roles in inter-compartmental transport and signalling.</p><p>The present studies have shown that several GSTs previously assumed to be cytosolic are targeted elsewhere. GSTU12 was clearly nuclear-localized and, to date, the only other known tau class GST known to accumulate in this compartment is ParA from tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takahashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). Unlike GSTU12, ParA has no obvious localization signal and the functional significance of this nuclear targeting is unknown. The roles for GSTU12 being directed to the nucleus must be distinct from that inferred for GSTT3L. Unlike GSTT3, GSTU12 has no activity as a GPOX and therefore would be unlikely to be involved in reducing either DNA- or lipid-derived hydroperoxides. This GST may instead function to regulate the activity of transcriptional regulators within the nucleus, with a precedent being the interaction of human GSTP1-1 with c-Jun N-terminal kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The other intriguing subcellular localization of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GST family members was seen in the selective accumulation of TCHQD at the plasma membrane. Previously, only GSTF2 has been reported to associate with the plasma membrane in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), though in the present study this localization was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). This difference has not been investigated further but could be due to the lack of appropriate hydrophobic GSTF2 ligands in tobacco leaves that promote membrane association in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots. The functional significance of membrane-localized TCHQD is unclear, not least because the respective recombinant enzyme had no activity as a GST or GPOX. This GST family member showed similarity (25% identity) to the TCHQD identified in <italic>Sphingobium chlorophenolicum</italic>, an enzyme which catalyses the reductive dehalogenation of TCHQ and trichlorohydroquinone, which are key steps in the degradation of the pesticide pentachlorophenol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Warner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The endogenous functions of this enzyme in bacteria are unknown, but its evolutionary origins and enzymic mechanism are related to the GSTZ isomerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anandarajah <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). In bacteria, TCHQDs are soluble proteins, and it is most likely that the membrane-associated orthologue in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has been recruited for quite different functions.
