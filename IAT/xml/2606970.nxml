The translocator assembly and maintenance protein 41 (Tam41/mitochondrial matrix protein 37) was identified as a new member of the mitochondrial protein translocator systems by its role in maintaining the integrity and activity of the presequence translocase of the inner membrane (TIM23 complex). Here we demonstrate that the assembly of proteins imported by the carrier translocase, TIM22 complex, is even more strongly affected by the lack of Tam41. Moreover, respiratory chain supercomplexes and the inner membrane potential are impaired by lack of Tam41. The phenotype of Tam41-deficient mitochondria thus resembles that of mitochondria lacking cardiolipin. Indeed, we found that Tam41 is required for the biosynthesis of the dimeric phospholipid cardiolipin. The pleiotropic effects of the translocator maintenance protein on preprotein import and respiratory chain can be attributed to its role in biosynthesis of mitochondrial cardiolipin.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>S.

About 1,000 different proteins are imported into mitochondria. The translocase of the outer membrane (TOM complex) functions as general import gate for precursor proteins. Subsequently, the import pathways diverge. Most proteins are transported into or across the inner membrane by using either the presequence pathway or the carrier pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jensen and Johnson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Endo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koehler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oka and Mihara, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dolezal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kutik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</xref>). The carrier translocase of the inner membrane (TIM22 complex) directs polytopic proteins with internal targeting signals into the inner membrane, using the membrane potential &#x00394;&#x003c8; as driving force.</p><p>The presequence translocase (TIM23 complex) recognizes the preproteins with cleavable N-terminal presequences and inserts them into the Tim23 import channel in a &#x00394;&#x003c8;-dependent manner. Preproteins carrying a hydrophobic sorting signal are laterally released into the inner membrane, whereas the majority of cleavable preproteins are completely translocated into the matrix. Reconstitution experiments with proteoliposomes revealed that the TIM23 complex and an energized cardiolipin-rich membrane represented a minimal system for membrane integration of cleavable preproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van der Laan et al., 2007</xref>). In organello, however, the TIM23 complex dynamically interacts with several further protein machineries: the translocase of the outer membrane for preprotein transfer from the outer to the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chacinska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mokranjac et al., 2005</xref>), complexes III and IV of the respiratory chain to stimulate the &#x00394;&#x003c8;-driven membrane insertion of preproteins with sorting signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">van der Laan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wiedemann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saddar et al., 2008</xref>), and the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) with the heat shock protein 70 that drives protein transport into the matrix at the expense of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kutik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">D'Silva et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The TIM23 complex is a multistep machine and its assembly and mode of cooperation with the motor PAM are only partially understood. Two recent studies identified a mitochondrial protein, which is peripherally attached to the inner membrane from the matrix side and involved in the assembly and maintenance of the activity of the TIM23 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tamura et al., 2006</xref>). The protein was termed translocator assembly and maintenance protein 41 (Tam41) or mitochondrial matrix protein 37 (Mmp37). Yeast cells lacking Tam41/Mmp37 show a temperature-sensitive growth defect, and the import of presequence-carrying mitochondrial preproteins is impaired at elevated temperature in vivo and in organello. Tam41 does not stably bind to the TIM23 complex, yet its absence influences the integrity of the TIM23 complex and the cooperation with the motor PAM. It was thus concluded that Tam41 is not a structural subunit of the TIM23 complex but a new member of the mitochondrial translocator systems required to maintain the proper assembly state and activity of the TIM23 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tamura et al., 2006</xref>). Although both studies agreed well on the effects of Tam41/Mmp37 on the presequence pathway, different findings were reported on the second protein import pathway to the inner membrane, the carrier pathway. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallas et al. (2006)</xref> reported that <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> mitochondria were impaired in the import of a noncleavable carrier precursor, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tamura et al. (2006)</xref> did not observe a defect in the translocation of carrier precursors to a protease-protected location. The molecular function of Tam41 remained open.</p><p>We used a native assembly assay to characterize the biogenesis of noncleavable carrier proteins in mitochondria lacking Tam41. Surprisingly, we observed a strong defect in carrier assembly even at low temperature, suggesting that the defect of <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> mitochondria may be more pronounced in the biogenesis of carrier proteins than in the presequence pathway. The subsequent analysis revealed pleiotropic effects of Tam41 on the mitochondrial membrane potential and the assembly state of respiratory chain supercomplexes. We report that these seemingly nonrelated effects are caused by the involvement of Tam41 in the biosynthesis of cardiolipin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Mitochondria lacking Tam41 are blocked in the assembly of carrier proteins</title><p>We generated a yeast strain lacking the <italic>TAM41</italic> gene. As <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> cells are temperature sensitive for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tamura et al., 2006</xref>), the cells were grown at low temperature to minimize indirect effects. Mitochondria were isolated and subjected to a short heat shock. The steady-state levels of proteins from the four mitochondrial compartments were comparable for <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> and wild-type mitochondria, whereas the import of presequence-carrying preproteins was impaired in the mutant mitochondria (unpublished data), in agreement with the reported defect of <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> mitochondria in the presequence pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tamura et al., 2006</xref>). These two studies reported different observations for the import of noncleavable carrier proteins as analyzed by protease protection assays. Carrier proteins are imported in a multistep process (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and thus precursors accumulated at stage III on the intermembrane space side can be protected against externally added protease when low to moderate concentrations of protease are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pfanner and Neupert, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ryan et al., 1999</xref>). Importantly, mitochondria with a defect of &#x00394;&#x003c8; or the TIM22 complex can efficiently accumulate carrier proteins at stage III and, thus, depending on the strength of the protease treatment and the stability of the outer membrane, protease protection of carrier precursors can be observed despite an inner membrane import defect. To directly monitor the assembly stages of mitochondrial carrier proteins, we used a blue native gel assay, which separates stage III (intermediate in intermembrane space) from stage V (mature assembled carrier) upon lysis of mitochondria with a mild detergent such as digitonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ryan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dyall et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rehling et al., 2003</xref>). Surprisingly, the &#x00394;&#x003c8;-dependent formation of stage V carrier was blocked in <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> mitochondria, as analyzed by importing the <sup>35</sup>S-labeled precursors of the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) and dicarboxylate carrier (DIC; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Instead a smaller form (AAC&#x0002a; and DIC&#x0002a;) was observed, migrating above the stage III intermediate. The formation of AAC&#x0002a; and DIC&#x0002a; was inhibited by dissipation of &#x00394;&#x003c8; in contrast to the stage III intermediate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), demonstrating that the generation of AAC&#x0002a; and DIC&#x0002a; depended on the activity of the inner membrane. Even without heat shock treatment, carrier assembly to the oligomeric form (stage V) was completely blocked into <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> mitochondria (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). AAC imported into <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> mitochondria was resistant to extraction at pH 11.5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Together with the &#x00394;&#x003c8; dependence of import, this indicates that the carrier was inserted into the lipid phase of the inner membrane. Thus <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> mitochondria are defective in carrier assembly, suggesting that the function of Tam41 extends beyond the maintenance of the TIM23 complex.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Protein import and assembly defects in <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> mitochondria.</bold> (A) Biogenesis stages I&#x02013;V of mitochondrial carrier proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ryan et al., 1999</xref>).

Although the import into the mutant mitochondria was impaired after the heat shock, it was only moderately affected at low temperature (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>). We assessed the &#x00394;&#x003c8; of <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> mitochondria by fluorescence quenching. When the yeast cells were grown at low temperature, the fluorescence decrease of <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> mitochondria was close to that of wild-type mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), indicating no major alteration of &#x00394;&#x003c8;. When the cells were grown at elevated temperature, however, a strong decrease of the &#x00394;&#x003c8; of <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> mitochondria was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). For in vitro protein import experiments, the mitochondria were isolated from cells grown at low temperature and subjected to a short heat shock. This in vitro heat shock led to a reduction of the fluorescence quenching, i.e., a reduction of &#x00394;&#x003c8; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Thus, both protein import via the presequence pathway and the inner membrane potential are impaired in <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> mitochondria in a temperature-sensitive manner. In contrast, the assembly of carrier proteins is also blocked at low temperature. Because under these conditions the &#x00394;&#x003c8; of the mutant mitochondria is close to that of wild-type mitochondria, &#x00394;&#x003c8; cannot be the critical determinant for the lack of carrier assembly in <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> mitochondria.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Temperature sensitivity of &#x00394;&#x003c8; generation in <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> mitochondria.</bold> (A) Yeast cells were grown in YPLac at low temperature (21&#x000b0;C) and shifted to 30 or 37&#x000b0;C for 8 h in vivo before isolation of mitochondria. &#x00394;&#x003c8; was assessed at 25&#x000b0;C by fluorescence quenching.

Cells lacking Tam41 were shown to accumulate mitochondrial precursor proteins in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tamura et al., 2006</xref>).

Thus the lack of cardiolipin leads to similar effects on TIM complexes and preprotein accumulation as the lack of Tam41. To exclude that the lack of Tam41 led to a loss of Crd1 or Pgs1, we determined the steady-state levels of the proteins and did not observe a difference between wild-type and <italic>tam41&#x00394;</italic> mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>).</p><p>Cardiolipin stabilizes supercomplexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, in particular complexes up to 1 Md formed by complexes III and IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sch&#x000e4;gger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pfeiffer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhong et al., 2004</xref>).

Mitochondria lacking Tam41 revealed various, at first glance pleiotropic, defects, and the analysis of the mutant mitochondria led to several surprising twists. First, we confirmed the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallas et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tamura et al. (2006)</xref>, who identified Tam41 based on its influence on the assembly and maintenance of the presequence pathway (TIM23 complex). Second, <italic>tam41</italic>&#x00394; mitochondria showed a reduced &#x00394;&#x003c8; and a defect in the assembly of carrier proteins, which are imported via the TIM22 complex. Importantly, at low temperature, <italic>tam41</italic>&#x00394; mitochondria were still strongly impaired in carrier assembly, whereas &#x00394;&#x003c8; and presequence pathway were not or only moderately affected, suggesting that the presequence pathway was not the primary site of action of Tam41.</p><p>Third, various inner membrane protein complexes, including supercomplexes of the respiratory chain, carrier complexes, and TIM translocases, were altered in <italic>tam41</italic>&#x00394; mitochondria, resembling the broad spectrum of defects observed in mitochondria lacking cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sch&#x000e4;gger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pfeiffer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nury et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van der Laan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Claypool et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, a detailed analysis by mass spectrometry and in vivo radiolabeling of lipids proved that the levels of cardiolipin, as well as of PG, were significantly reduced in <italic>tam41</italic>&#x00394; mitochondria. The sequence of cardiolipin synthesis in yeast is PA to CDP-diacylglycerol to PGP to PG to cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mileykovskaya et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2007</xref>). We did not observe an accumulation of PGP, but a significant accumulation of PA in <italic>tam41</italic>&#x00394; mitochondria. In contrast, mitochondria lacking Crd1 accumulate large amounts of PG but not PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tuller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>; this study), demonstrating that Tam41 acts upstream of Crd1. Moreover, <italic>tam41</italic>&#x00394; mitochondria contain wild-type levels of Crd1 and Pgs1. The accumulation of the early metabolite PA thus suggests that Tam41 is required at an early stage of cardiolipin biosynthesis.</p><p>In summary, the available results indicate that Tam41 is required for the biosynthetic pathway of cardiolipin or the regulation of the pathway. This dimeric mitochondrial phospholipid exerts a broad influence on numerous functions of the inner membrane, including the assembly states of the respiratory chain, metabolite carriers, and the TIM23 complex. The apparently pleiotropic effects of Tam41 can thus be explained by its involvement in lipid biosynthesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains</title><p>YPH499 and BY4741 were used as wild-type <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains. <italic>tam41</italic>&#x00394; (<italic>fomp7&#x00394;-A</italic>; YBG-0800-A) was generated by plasmid shuffling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chacinska et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>pgs1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>taz1</italic>&#x00394;, and <italic>crd1</italic>&#x00394; strains have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brandner et al., 2005</xref>; Euroscarf).
