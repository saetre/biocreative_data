PE genes are particularly abundant within the genomes of pathogenic mycobacteria where they seem to have expanded as a result of gene duplication events.

In comparison to the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>reference strain H37Rv, the variation (named the 12/40 polymorphism) consists of an in-frame 12-bp insertion invariably accompanied by a set of 40 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that occurs either in PE_PGRS17 or in both genes. Sequence analysis of the paralogous genes in a representative set of worldwide distributed tubercle bacilli isolates revealed data which supported previously proposed evolutionary scenarios for the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>complex (MTBC) and confirmed the very ancient origin of "<italic>M. canettii</italic>" and other smooth tubercle bacilli. Strikingly, the identified polymorphism appears to be coincident with the emergence of the post-bottleneck successful clone from which the MTBC expanded. Furthermore, the findings provide direct and clear evidence for the natural occurrence of gene conversion in mycobacteria, which appears to be restricted to modern <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>strains.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides a new perspective to explore the molecular events that accompanied the evolution, clonal expansion, and recent diversification of tubercle bacilli.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </italic>complex strains (MTBC) are the causative agents of tuberculosis (TB), a disease that has a considerable detrimental impact on human and animal health worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This group of slow growing pathogens includes the classical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>M. bovis</italic>, <italic>M. africanum</italic>, <italic>M. microti</italic>, as well as the newly recognized MTBC members, <italic>M. pinnipedii </italic>and <italic>M. caprae </italic>species. <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>remains one of the most successful and adaptable pathogens known to mankind despite the availability of a vaccine and effective antimicrobial agents. This adaptability certainly reflects a very ancient and prolific evolutionary history.</p><p>With the availability of complete mycobacterial genome sequences, whole-genome comparative sequence analyses were possible and resulted in the identification of sequence polymorphisms, that greatly inform our understanding of the evolutionary process of the MTBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It is now assumed that <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>(the major etiological agent of human TB) and <italic>M. bovis </italic>(having a wide host range) both arose from a common ancestor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It has also become apparent that the <italic>M. africanum</italic>-<italic>M. microti </italic>lineage represents a phylogenetic bridge between <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>and <italic>M. bovis</italic>, whereas "<italic>M. canettii</italic>", a rare phenotypically unusual tubercle bacillus, appears to be closest to the common progenitor of the MTBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Recent studies confirmed that "<italic>M. canettii</italic>" and other smooth tubercle bacilli are representatives of pre-bottleneck lineages and that the progenitor species (the so-called <italic>M. prototuberculosis</italic>), from which the MTBC emerged, might have coexisted with early hominids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Completion of the genome sequence of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>strain H37Rv [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], revealed that a major source of genetic variation in this species could be associated with two large gene families encoding acidic, asparagine- or glycine-rich proteins referred to as PE (n = 99) and PPE (n = 68). These multigene families represent approximately 10% of the coding capacity of the genome and are characterized by their high GC content and extensive repetitive structure. Both families have been divided into subgroups, of which the PE_PGRS subfamily (n = 61) of the PE family is particularly polymorphic and found to be enriched in essential genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although the function of the members of this gene subfamily is currently unknown, the PE_PGRS genes are strongly suspected to be associated with antigenic and genetic variability as well as virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It is thought that members of the PE/PPE multigene families might frequently undergo genetic remodelling by gene duplication, recombination, and/or strand slippage mechanisms because of the presence of a large number of repeat sequences within these genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the current study, we focused on a prominent polymorphism motif that occurs within two adjacent PE_PGRS genes, and provide evidence for its association with both early and recent evolutionary events leading to a new PE_PGRS-based perspective to dissect the evolution of tubercle bacilli.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Comparative sequence analysis of contiguous PE genes</title><p>Since the large number of homologous <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>PE genes seem to have arisen by multiple gene duplication events, it is very difficult to determine duplication history. We thus focussed our comparative sequence analysis on PE genes that are situated adjacent to each other in the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>H37Rv genome, as these tandem duplications (those where the two copies of the duplicated region are immediately adjacent to one another in the same orientation), could signify real duplicates. Fourteen neighbouring PE genes (11 apparent duplicates and 3 apparent triplicates) were identified throughout the H37Rv genome. About half of the contiguous PE sequences display more than 30% overall amino acid sequence similarity with their neighbouring PE gene member (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). As expected, a higher degree of similarity was associated with the conserved N-terminal PE region of the gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>), as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Genes with low amino acid similarity were excluded from further analyses due to an uncertainty concerning their origin.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Pairwise amino acid similarity of contiguous PE genes of the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>strain H37Rv. The percent amino acid similarity values were calculated using the BioEdit program [52].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2148-6-107-1"/></fig><p>Further scrutiny of the nucleotide and amino acid alignments, showed that the PE_PGRS17 (Rv0978c) and PE_PGRS18 (Rv0980c) genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) shared the highest identity, indicating that they may represent a true duplication event. Within these two genes, we could identify 2 major alignable coding regions of 168 (MAR1) and 162 (MAR2) amino acids, with a similarity of 98% and 90%, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). These genes thus fulfilled the criteria used previously to define the bacterial paranome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and should be regarded as a typical tandem duplicate in spite of being separated by two overlapping, non-associated, non-PE genes (Rv0979c &#x02013; encoding a hypothetical protein of unknown function and Rv0979A &#x02013; encoding a probable 50S ribosomal protein L32 rpmF). The first alignable coding region starts at the first codon and extends beyond the PE region, while the second maps to the highly repetitive and GC rich (and usually very variable) PGRS C-terminal extension. PE_PGRS18 is larger than PE_PGRS17 essentially because of the presence of two extra in-frame nucleotide stretches, the first (222 nt) is located between the two major alignable coding regions and, the second (168 nt) represents an extra C-terminal extension (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Further inspection of the upstream non coding region of both genes revealed a nearly perfect homology starting at the nucleotide position -235. Furthermore, a BLASTN search performed against the whole genome of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>H37Rv identified another PE_PGRS gene, PE_PGRS45 (Rv2615c), sharing 98% identity through nucleotides -235 to 506 with PE_PGRS17 and 98% identity through -235 to 595 with PE_PGRS18. PE_PGRS45, which is located approximately 2.6 MB distal in the genome, is thus clearly a paralog of PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18, and is either the progenitor of these two genes or was duplicated from one of them. In a recent study, the 3 PE_PGRS orthologs were shown to share 5 nts at polymorphic positions lying upstream of their coding sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], thus confirming their evolutionary link. Sequence analyses of the genome sequence of the phylogenetically closest non-tuberculous mycobacterial species, <italic>M. marinum</italic>, showed that its genome was devoid of both the PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 orthologs (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional file 3</xref>), as well as lacking the orthologue for PE_PGRS45 (data not shown). As these genes were also found to be absent from other species of mycobacteria (e.g. <italic>M. leprae</italic>, <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>, and <italic>M. avium paratuberculosis</italic>-see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional file 3</xref>), the duplication of these three PE_PGRS genes thus seems to have taken place only after the divergence of the tubercle bacilli.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Genomic context and homology of the PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 genes.

In comparison to the genome of the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>reference strain H37Rv, this genetic variation (termed the 12/40 polymorphism) consisted of a 12-nucleotide in-frame insertion accompanied by 40 SNPs dispersed along a DNA stretch of 135 nucleotides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), encompassing the junction between the PE and PGRS regions of the gene sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

For this purpose, the DNA sequence encompassing nucleotides 31 to 712 (numbering according to the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>H37Rv sequence) for both PE_PGRS17 and PE_GRS18 was determined in all these tubercle bacilli strains. The multiple sequence alignment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) showed the absence, in both genes, of the 12/40 polymorphism in <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>H37Ra, the two "<italic>M. canettii</italic>" strains and in one smooth tubercle bacillus isolate. For the second smooth tubercle bacillus isolate, we have been able to amplify only PE_PGRS18 which was found to be devoid of such a polymorphism. Strikingly, all strains of the <italic>M. africanum</italic>-<italic>M. microti</italic>-<italic>M. caprae</italic>-<italic>M. pinnipedii</italic>-<italic>M. bovis </italic>lineage (including <italic>M. bovis </italic>BCG), as well as the ancestral (TbD1+) and PGG1 strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, harbor the 12/40 polymorphism in only their PE_PGRS17 gene sequence and not in PE_PGRS18.

This consists of two biotinylated PCR products, encompassing the 12/40 polymophism, each specific to the PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 sequences from each sample. The labeled amplicons were allowed to react independently with a 5' aminated 24-mer oligonucleotide probe, representing the 12 nt insertion and the 12 downstream nucleotides of the 12/40 polymorphism. Using this assay, we determined the distribution pattern of the 12/40 polymorphism within additional tubercle bacilli strains, known to have a critical position in the evolutionary history of this group of pathogens ("<italic>M. canettii</italic>" and ancestral <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>strains), and in a larger collection of strains representing the 3 PGG groups recovered from Africa, Europe, North- and South-America.

As mentioned earlier, the 12/40 polymorphism is highly conserved, as the same insertion and the 40 accompanying SNPs are observed for both genes irrespective of the MTBC subspecies. In no case, have we noticed a missing SNP or a variation for the 12-nt insertion and its associated 40 SNPs. However, aside from the 12/40 polymorphism, we observed along the partial sequence of both genes, a total of 30 MTBC-associated polymorphic sites (14 sSNPs, 15 nsSNPs and a 114-nt in-frame <italic>M. microti</italic>-specific deletion) (See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).

In both "<italic>M. canettii" </italic>and the two other smooth tubercle bacilli strains, PE_PGRS18 is frame-shifted (a 1-nt insertion immediately after position 270) and this gene appears to be much more variable than its paralog.</p><p>Further inspection of the nucleotide substitutions revealed that nucleotide changes in both paralogs tend to occur within the same nucleotide positions, irrespective of the evolutionary status of the species.

Thus, certain positions appear to be prone to genetic variation although evolving differently within different species. Strikingly, in all but one variable position (position 119), the mutations in one paralog are permuted comparatively to the other. Consequently, where the mutation is non synonymous (nucleotide positions 129, 217, 247, and 508) the phenotypic change for both paralogs is limited to two amino acids throughout all the species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>Because PE_PGRS genes are GC-rich sequences, we looked at the occurrence of the mutation with respect to the codon position.

However, although mutations occurred more frequently at the third codon position (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001 for both ANOVA and Tukey's test) in PE_PGRS18, no such association could be observed for PE_PGRS17. Thus, a mutational bias might have operated for the diversification of PE_PGRS18.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous studies involving comparative genomics and explorative genome-wide multilocus analysis conclusively showed that the present MTBC strains appear as a genetically homogeneous clonal pool, since they display a highly significant linkage disequilibrium and an exceptionally low rate of silent nucleotide substitutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. This picture contrasts with the situation that seems to have prevailed in the very early history of the tubercle bacillus in which a significant rate of DNA exchanges were allowed, most likely through intragenomic recombination and horizontal gene transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Compelling evidence suggest that members of the MTBC arose from a single successful ancestor, resulting from a recent evolutionary bottleneck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The identity of such a parental strain has not been defined, though some genetic markers (polymorphisms located in codon 463 of the <italic>katG </italic>gene and codon 95 of the <italic>gyrA </italic>sequence, an SNP in the promoter region of the <italic>narGHJI </italic>gene complex, and the TbD1 deletion) help to distinguish between ancestral and modern MTBC strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The findings from this study provide additional evidence for the concept that the present clonal MTBC strains are the progeny of a single successful ancestor. Indeed, the identified PE_PGRS-associated 12/40 polymorphism could represent a genetic marker for the most successful post-bottleneck-derived clone from which the MTBC strains expanded. Based on this polymorphism, we showed that all MTBC strains could be assigned to three new PE_PGRS-based genotypic groups (PGRST1 to 3). Strikingly, PGRST1 was found to be predominant in all three <italic>katG</italic>-<italic>gyrA </italic>defined PGG groups irrespective of their geographic origin and evolutionary status (ancestral or modern). Because all ancestral (TbD1+) strains, including the <italic>M. africanum</italic>-<italic>M. microti</italic>-<italic>M. bovis </italic>lineage, belong to PGRST1, one can argue that acquisition of the 12/40 polymorphism is coincident with the emergence of the most successful MTBC parental strain. Consistently, the 12/40 polymorphism was absent from both PE_PGRS genes in 6 "<italic>M. canettii</italic>" strains and one other smooth tubercle bacillus analyzed, which are believed to represent the very early pre-bottleneck MTBC progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>From the overall distribution pattern of the 12/40 polymorphism, a general evolutionary picture emerges (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) which conforms to, and confirms, previously published evolutionary scenarios for the tubercle bacillus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. As PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 showed the highest degree of homology and represent a typical tandem duplicate, one can deduce the molecular events which took place in the most ancestral tubercle bacillus strain. Such a strain would be TbD1+ and harbor a single copy of a gene genetically very close to PE_PGRS17 or PE_PGRS18 (the PE_PGRS17/18 common ancestor). After duplication of this ancestral gene copy, further gene evolution led to the "<italic>M. canettii</italic>"-associated genetic configuration in which both genes lack the 12/40 polymorphism, but have separately undergone isolated single nucleotide changes. During the adaptive period of the progenitor species, additional genetic changes took place, including the occurrence of the 12/40 polymorphism in the one paralog (PE_PGRS17). The fact that the GC content of the 12/40 polymorphism is in the range of that of the mycobacterial host genome, may have ensured its maintenance throughout the clonal expansion of the MTBC progenitor. The data suggest that the polymorphism has remained stable throughout the expansion into the <italic>M. africanum</italic>-<italic>M. microti</italic>-<italic>M. bovis </italic>lineage and within the ancestral <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>strains, and only with the emergence of modern TB has this variation been able to be transmitted (in its entirety) into the other paralog or deleted from PE_PGRS17. Such a genetic rearrangement occurred exclusively in PGG2 and PGG3 groups leading to the emergence of the two aforementioned disproportionately less frequent PGRST2 and PGRST3 subpopulations.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the proposed evolutionary history of the tubercle bacilli according to the presence and absence of the 12/40 polymorphism.

The sequence environment (close proximity and high sequence identity) appears to be optimal for such a mechanism to take place, although it only seems to occur in the modern <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>strains. It has already been shown, through <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments, that initiation of homologous recombination occurs in mycobacteria provided that sequence heterology does not exceed 10&#x02013;12% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Such a requirement is largely fulfilled in the case of PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18, but may eventually restrict homologous recombination events between other PE_PGRS paralogs that have undergone substantial levels of sequence divergence (up to 12%).</p><p>Transfer of the 12/40 polymorphism from the PE_PGRS17 to its neighboring paralog, or its reversion (loss from PE_PGRS17 sequence) in modern <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, is typical of a homologous recombination process called "gene conversion". Such a gene replacement event is frequently observed among members of multigene families in bacterial genomes and contributes to both the maintenance of genetic information and creation of genetic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. It is very unlikely that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) may have contributed to generate the two modern PGRS types of populations (PGRST2 and PGRST3). Indeed, random acquisition of the 12/40 polymorphism through HGT would have generated an additional PGRS type population, harboring the polymorphism uniquely in its PE_PGRS18 sequence (a putative "-/+" population).</p><p>The recent generation of PGRST2 and PGRST3 subpopulations from the predominant PGRST1 accommodates either the double-strand break repair (DSBR) or the synthesis-dependent strand annealing models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] as the molecular basis for this gene conversion event. It seems that the pre-synaptic double-strand breaks that initiate the homologous recombination event in the PGRST1 population occurred more frequently in PE_PGRS18 than in PE_PGRS17, so that PGRST2 emerges more frequently than PGRST3. Under such circumstances, the DNA polymerase will use the 12/40 polymorphism-containing PE_PGRS17 sequence as homologous template to fill-in the broken PE_PGRS18 gene sequence, resulting in the PGRST2-associated genotype.</p><p>The distribution of the polymorphism types when informed by PGG and sSNP clusters strongly indicates that gene conversion events (followed by clonal expansion) occurred independently multiple times (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Indeed, all the PGG2 sSNP clusters each possess both PGRST1 and PGRST2 despite existing over clearly divergent evolutionary tracts. Based upon the data set presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, conversion has occurred at least four times and reversion at least once (or twice if one considers the PGG2 PGRST3 strains not included in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Overall, the results clearly indicate that PGRST2 and PGRST3 subpopulations are modern <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>lineages and emerged separately from PGRST1 strains through multiple gene conversion events. It is also interesting to note that two of the 6 strains identified with PGRST3 were laboratory strains (H37Rv and H37Ra), which have undergone significant <italic>in vitro </italic>culturing over decades, so that this conversion may not really occur or be tolerated well only under <italic>in vivo </italic>infection conditions.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Distribution of the three PGRS types through sSNP-based genetic clusters and PGG groups.

The 36 sSNP-based phylogenetic tree was constructed as described by Gutacker <italic>et al</italic>. [33].

As far as could be ascertained, this study provides the first concrete example and the most direct evidence for the natural occurrence of gene conversion events in mycobacteria. However, Gutacker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] have previously suspected recombination when addressing the distribution pattern of 5 polymorphic nucleotides within the Rv0980c-Rv0981 intergenic region (Rv0980c-Rv0981 iSNPs). This finding raises the question whether the complicated pattern of the Rv0980c-Rv0981 iSNPs would be linked to the 12/40 polymorphism-associated gene conversion event. Indeed, if gene conversion extends to the homologous intergenic sequences of PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18, the distribution profile of the iSNPs must be identical for both genes, as a result of gene replacement. The data show, that for both H37Rv and CDC1551, whose PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 genes have undergone gene conversion, the iSNPs distribution patterns of the two genes are quite different. Thus, unless the 5 polymorphic nucleotide positions are exceptionally unstable, the complicated pattern of this intergenic polymorphism does not seem to be associated with the gene conversion event described in the present paper.</p><p>It is well assumed that gene duplication and subsequent functional divergence are crucial for bacterial evolution as they play a major role in gene innovation and adaptation to changing environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In this context, it is worth mentioning that although PE_PGRS genes are restricted to mycobacterial species, they have preferentially expanded within the genomes of pathogenic mycobacteria, most likely through extensive gene duplication events coupled to genetic divergence during their adaptation to the very hostile intra-macrophagic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We hypothesize that gene conversion may have contributed to the evolution of members of the PE_PGRS subfamily and may have participated in the generation of antigenic variation in their members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It is striking that this type of recombination does not seem to occur in the MTBC members other than modern <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and one wonders whether this is a mechanism that is specific to, or that may occur at greater frequency in modern <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Recently, Lui <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], extending Gutacker's analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], identified a mosaic polymorphic pattern (the IRMT0105 locus) associated with a PPE gene (MT0105). The authors hypothesize that small-scale gene conversion or recombination at hotspots near PE or PPE gene families has been an important mechanism for <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>to escape immune surveillance.</p><p>As far as could be ascertained, the functions(s) of PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 are unknown and, as yet, there is no indication whether they are essential or not. According to the present study, it could be assumed that both PE_PGRS genes may be dispensable for normal <italic>in vivo </italic>growth under certain conditions as they are absent from the genome of <italic>M. leprae</italic>, and PE_PGRS18 was frame-shifted in the two "<italic>M. canettii</italic>" and two other smooth tubercle bacilli strains analysed. By contrast, no such frame shift mutations were observed in the worldwide sequenced collection of MTBC strains, indicating that they may have evolved to assume an essential role in these particular widespread species. Consistently, PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 belong to the so-called <italic>iVEGI </italic>(<italic>in vivo</italic>-expressed genomic island), a cluster of 49 <italic>in vivo</italic>-expressed genes, thought to encode cell wall components and participate in lipid metabolism required for mycobacterial survival <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Within this island, PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 account among the 21 genes that display higher expression levels in mice samples compared to <italic>in vitro </italic>cultures. The <italic>iVEGI </italic>locus harbors at least three genes (Rv0981, Rv0986, and Rv0987), whose products were shown to be required in early interactions with the host cell as well as in persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Furthermore, genes playing critical roles in bacterial survival and fitness generally display higher acquisition rates for sSNP (Ks) in comparison to nsSNP (Ka). We found that both PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 are under purifying selection as the majority of disadvantageous phenotypic changes would have been eliminated during evolution. We consistently found that, irrespective of the species, only particular non-synonymous changes are tolerated within certain nucleotide positions of both genes. These findings, and the fact that these genes appear to be preferentially expressed <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], argue for a potential role in host-pathogen interactions.</p><p>Finally, the question comes to mind whether the occurrence of the 12/40 polymorphism could have enabled PE_PGRS17 to acquire a new or altered function that positively influenced the evolution of the MTBC. If so, it is also interesting to speculate whether the recent change from the PGRST1 to PGRST2 genotype in <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>would further increase its fitness and/or adaptability. Indeed, as with PGG2 isolates, PGRST2 appears to be frequently associated with outbreak strains and clustered cases, although not exclusively. By contrast, as mentioned earlier, the PGRST3 genotype is very rare among TB cases, and two of the four strains found to contain the genotype are in fact laboratory strains (H37Rv and H37Ra), thus seeming less prone to expansion and/or to have occurred as a more recent reversion event. Although it is hard to believe that a single polymorphism in one or two genes would have dramatically impacted the evolution of the tubercle mycobacterial species, further experiments based on gene replacement and/or inactivation of the different forms of both PE_PGRS genes are needed to clarify this issue. It is worth mentioning that the 12/40 polymorphism lies within a region of the protein, which according to the domain organization proposed by Brenan <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], may represent a transmembrane helix. This location may be critical for the protein function inasmuch as PE/PPE protein complexes are strongly suspected to be involved in signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Deciphering the evolution of bacterial populations is crucial to better understand the genetic traits behind the emergence of biomedically relevant strains.

The amplification reaction mixture contained 2 &#x003bc;l of template genomic DNA (about 20 ng), 10 &#x003bc;l of 10&#x000d7; buffer (Qiagen), 10 &#x003bc;l DMSO, 2 &#x003bc;l of 10 mM nucleotide mix (Amersham Biosciences), 2 &#x003bc;l of each primer (20 &#x003bc;M stock), 0,25 &#x003bc;l (1.25 U) of HotStart <italic>Taq </italic>DNA polymerase (Qiagen) and sterile nuclease-free water (Amersham Biosciences) to 100 &#x003bc;l total reaction volume. Cycling was carried out in a PTC 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) with an initial denaturation step of 10 min at 96&#x000b0;C followed by 35 cycles consisting of 1 min at 95&#x000b0;C, 1 min at 60&#x000b0;C and 2 min at 72&#x000b0;C. The amplification ended with a final elongation step of 7 min at 72&#x000b0;C. PCR products were purified using the GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Partial DNA sequencing (nucleotides 31 to 712) was performed using the sense primers 7880S (see above) and PEGA.S (5'-CAAGCGATCAGCGCGCAGG-3', 184&#x02013;202) for both genes. Sequencing on the reverse strand involved the internal primers 0978R2 (5'-CGCTTGGACCGTTGCCGATGG-3', 770&#x02013;790) and 0980R2 (5'-GAGGCTGACCGCGCCGCCGGT-3', 730&#x02013;750) for PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18, respectively. Determination of the nucleotide sequence was performed with the Prism Ready Reaction Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing Kit on an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was sequenced from two independent PCR amplification reactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>The sequence data was edited and aligned using the software programs BioEdit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and ClustalW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Both the PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18 genes were either analysed individually or upon concatenation. The software programs Arlequin v.2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] and DNASP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] were used to obtain summary statistics of genetic diversity. To test for adaptive selection, we determined the nucleotide substitution changes and the ratio of synonymous (Ks) and nonsynonymous (Ka) substitutions per site. For this purpose, we used the analysis developed by Nei-Gojobori [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] as implemented in the DNASP package. A statistical analysis of ANOVA and a Tukey's test were performed to test for significant difference of GC content and substitution rates between PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18.</p></sec><sec><title>Set up of a reverse hybridization dot blot assay for rapid PE_PGRS-based grouping (PEGAssay) of MTBC strains</title><p>Biotinylated PCR products encompassing the 12/40 polymorphism were obtained using the common sense primer PEGA.S and the biotinylated member specific reverse primers PEGA78.R (5'-bGACACCGTGCCGCTGCCGAAA-3', 705&#x02013;725) and PEGA80.R (5'-bCCGTTGCCGAACAGCCATCC-3', 568&#x02013;587) for PE_PGRS17 and PE_PGRS18, respectively. The amplification conditions were the same as mentioned above. Ten microliters of the biotinylated and heat denatured PCR product (diluted to a total volume of 150 &#x003bc;l with 2 &#x000d7; SSPE-0.1% SDS) was further hybridized with a 24-mer 5' amino-linked oligonucleotide probe (5'-GATCGAGCAGGCCCTGTTGGGGGT-3'). The latter represents the 12-nucleotide insertion and the immediate downstream 12 nucleotides of the 12/40 polymorphism and was synthesized according to the PE_PGRS17 sequence of strain CDC1551. The probe was diluted in 150 &#x003bc;l of 0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>(final concentration of 3 ng/&#x003bc;l) and covalently bound to a Biodyne C membrane (Pall Biosupport, Portsmouth, United Kingdom) using standard protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Briefly, after activation of the membrane, 150 &#x003bc;l of the diluted probe was applied in wells of a 96-well dot blot apparatus (BioRad) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Following inactivation and washing steps, biotinylated PCR products were added to the wells and the entire apparatus was then incubated at stringent hybridization conditions (65&#x000b0;C for 1 h). The samples were removed by vacuum aspiration and the membrane was washed three times with 50 ml of 2 &#x000d7; SSPE-0.5% SDS for 10 min at 57&#x000b0;C. After incubation for 45 min at 42&#x000b0;C with 10 U of streptavidin-POD (Amersham Biosciences) diluted in 20 ml of 2 &#x000d7; SSPE-0.5% SDS, the membrane was washed twice with 50 ml of 2 &#x000d7; SSPE-0.5% SDS for 10 min at 42&#x000b0;C and then once with 25 ml of 2 &#x000d7; SSPE for 10 min at room temperature. ECL chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were added according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the membrane was exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences) for 5 min. To allow for repeated use (up to 10 times), the membrane was stripped during a 1 h incubation in 1% SDS at 90&#x000b0;C, after which it was incubated in 20 mM EDTA for 20 min at room temperature and stored at 4&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Typing assays</title><p>Spoligotyping, assignment of isolates to PGG, and detection of the TbD1 region, were performed according to previously described protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Associations were evaluated for statistical significance using the &#x003c7;2 or Fisher's Exact Test implemented in GrapPad Prism v.4.
