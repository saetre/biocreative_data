We have previously presented a cryoelectron microscopic tomogram (cryoET) of the Env spikes on SIV virions. Several structural features were noted in the gp120 head and gp41 stalk regions. Perhaps most notable was the presence of three splayed legs projecting obliquely from the base of the spike head toward the viral membrane. Subsequently, a second 3D image of SIV spikes, also obtained by cryoET, was published by another group which featured a compact vertical stalk. We now report the cryoET analysis of HIV-1 virion-associated Env spikes using enhanced analytical cryoET procedures. More than 2,000 Env spike volumes were initially selected, aligned, and sorted into structural classes using algorithms that compensate for the &#x0201c;missing wedge&#x0201d; and do not impose any symmetry. The results show varying morphologies between structural classes: some classes showed trimers in the head domains; nearly all showed two or three legs, though unambiguous three-fold symmetry was not observed either in the heads or the legs. Subsequently, clearer evidence of trimeric head domains and three splayed legs emerged when head and leg volumes were independently aligned and classified. These data show that HIV-1, like SIV, also displays the tripod-like leg configuration, and, unexpectedly, shows considerable gp41 leg flexibility/heteromorphology. The tripod-like model for gp41 is consistent with, and helps explain, many of the unique biophysical and immunological features of this region.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The envelope (Env) spikes on the surface of HIV-1 and SIV virions facilitate target cell tropism, binding, and entry, and serve as the sole targets of humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity. X-ray crystallography has previously revealed the atomic structures of key core domains and peptides of the gp120 and gp41 Env spike subunits, but the manner by which these components are arranged in the Env spike is still speculative. Cryoelectron tomography (cryoET) affords a view of the entire Env spike in the context of the intact virion. We have previously published a cryoET model of the SIV Env spike which showed a unique tripod-like leg configuration for the solvent-exposed (external) gp41 stalk region. This model is consistent with, and helps explain, many of the unique biophysical and immunological features of this region. Subsequently another group using similar technology and virions reported a spike model displaying a compact gp41 stalk inconsistent with our splayed-leg spike model. In this report, we apply enhanced analytical cryoET procedures to show that HIV-1 also displays the tripod-like leg configuration, and shows considerable gp41 leg flexibility/heteromorphology. These results have implications for the design of effective vaccines targeting this region and may provide new insights into Env spike function.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>HIV-1 and the closely related SIV envelope (Env) spikes are composed of a trimer of heterodimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Center1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Zhu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The base of the Env spike is comprised of three gp41 subunits, each of which possesses, from N-terminal to C-terminal, a fusion peptide, N-terminal heptad repeat, disulfide loop, C-terminal heptad repeat, membrane proximal external region (MPER), transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic tail (CT).

A substantial fraction of purified spikes from HIV-1 and SIV were shown to display 3-fold symmetry though other forms were observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Center1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Center2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. By negative stain electron tomography, clear evidence for 3-fold symmetry was observed for a mutant form of SIV exhibiting Env with a truncated cytoplasmic tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Zhu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The picture for HIV-1 is less clear in that the presumptive Env spikes appeared to display structural heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Zhu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and unpublished data).

Because of the potential for morphological artifacts resulting from the use of the negative staining EM technique, including the attachment to a carbon substrate, pH changes, and drying, definitive analyses of the spike architecture could not be performed by this method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Zhu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>More recently, we have further investigated the overall configuration of the SIV Env spike using cryoEM tomography (cryoET) wherein samples are preserved in a frozen hydrated state, free of the potential staining and drying artifacts common to negative staining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Zhu2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Advantage was taken of the high level of Env spike incorporation and expression on the short-tailed mutants (SIVmac239/251 tail CEMx 174) (&#x0223c;70 spikes/virion vs. &#x0223c;7&#x02013;10 for wtSIV and wtHIV-1) thus aiding in data collection for the cryoET studies. HIV-1 variants with comparably high levels of Env spike expression are not available. The results from the SIV mutant show an Env spike in which each protomer of the presumptive trimeric gp120 head displays several morphological features and the solvent-accessible portion of gp41 forms a tripod-like set of legs. We were able to provide a tentative fit for the unliganded SIV gp120 core atomic structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Chen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> within the cryoET density volume and suggested that regions of unoccupied volume represented the masses of the V1/V2 and V3 loops missing from the atomic structure.</p><p>In an effort to determine the degree of structural heterogeneity within the spike population, the individual spike volumes were subjected to classification analysis in which the spikes were sorted into groups according to structural similarity. The results showed that most of the spikes were similar in form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Zhu2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Subsequently, Zanetti et al. published a cryoET study showing an SIV Env spike average which differed from Zhu et al. in several important aspects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Zanetti1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, each gp120 subunit consisted of a simple globular mass adequate in volume to accommodate the atomic model of the core structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Chen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> but not large enough for the considerable mass of the V1/V2 and V3 loops. They also reported that the gp41 ectodomain formed a compact stalk rather than the flared tripod configuration that we observed. These differences are not easily reconciled since both groups took advantage of similar SIV short-tailed mutant virus.</p><p>In this report we have extend our cryoET analysis of the Env spike structure to include native (unmutated) Env spikes on wtHIV-1 and have now applied enhanced data collection and analysis techniques to generate 3D models. The data reveal that, as with our model of the short tailed SIV Env spike mutant, the wtHIV-1 displays tripod-like gp41 &#x0201c;legs&#x0201d;, at least in a significant percentage of the spikes. However, application of new approaches to search for structurally distinct morphological variations (i.e., a new classification algorithm) within the data suggests considerable conformational variability which likely reflects a more flexible structure than previously described.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Viruses</title><p>The highly purified virus (HIV-1 BaL / SUPT1-CCR5 CL.30, lot p3955) used in this study was produced and provided by the AIDS Vaccine Program, SAIC Frederick, Inc., NCI, Frederick, MD.

Additionally, neither the spike volume nor the references were subject to any symmetry imposition during the alignment.</p><p>The center of each virus particle and the positions of each Env spike were manually determined by visual inspection, and a volume (64&#x000d7;64&#x000d7;64 pixels) encompassing each spike and associated viral membrane were windowed for analysis. We intentionally selected spikes from the entire surface of the virus including the tops and bottoms as well as the sides of the virions. We judge that the spikes selected from the tops/bottoms give better views of the oligomeric structure of the spikes even though in this orientation, the membrane is not visible. Spikes selected from the sides provide the information on the membrane position with respect to the heads.</p><p>The initial spike orientations (spike axes) were calculated as follows. First, the equation of an ellipsoid was derived from the coordinates of the picked spikes by a least squares fit. Then the normal vectors on the surface of the ellipsoid were computed at the spike positions. These normal vectors were used as the initial estimate for the spike axis, thereby minimizing the angular range that must be searched for refined alignment. Each spike volume was then transformed based on these vectors so that they and their associated membranes were roughly aligned. A global average (without imposed symmetry) was generated and used as an initial reference to align the raw spike volumes. Because spikes are distributed over the entire surface of virions and are randomly oriented with respect to each other in the specimen, the initial average had no regions that are data poor due to the missing wedge. To align the direction of the spike axes more accurately, a rotational orientation search was carried out within a cone of half-width 15&#x000b0; and using a step size of 2&#x000b0;. In the initial cycle, no rotational alignment about the spike axis was included in the search. In subsequent cycles, the half-width was reduced to 4&#x000b0; and then 2&#x000b0; in the directional search, and an additional rotational search about the spike axis was introduced, which used a step size in the range from 6&#x000b0; to 3&#x000b0;. The aligned volumes were then classified into &#x0223c;10&#x02013;20 classes using hierarchical ascendant methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Winkler2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Class averages were generated and were used as the multiple references for subsequent alignment cycles. All spike volumes were subjected to repeated cycles of multi-reference alignment and classification, until the appearance of the classes no longer changed. In the final cycle, spike volumes were classified into eight classes and their density averages generated. During the alignment step, some density due to the membrane is included within the windowed region.

The alignment scheme in method (3) was different in that the alignment was used as a refinement subsequent to the alignment based on a whole spike, only one alignment cycle was carried out, only the change in the polar angle was used and the membrane densities were windowed out in the alignment.

The latter point is probably not as great an issue as implied since data collected separately from the spikes projecting from the sides of the virions and from spikes projecting from the tops and bottoms of the virions gave similar results; any missing wedge effects would have been expected to differentially distort the images along different axes in the two sets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Zhu2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To address these concerns, we have now used a missing wedge compensated multi-reference alignment and averaging scheme &#x0005b;Winkler et al., <italic>J.

Subsequently, the spikes were sorted into eight classes based on multivariate data analysis and the class members in each were aligned and averaged. The surface distribution of the selected spikes in the entire set as well as in each of the eight classes suggests that the sampling was random and that the classification scheme did not result in the biased clustering of positionally discrete subpopulations (e.g., top/bottom- or side-arrayed) as might be expected with inadequate missing wedge compensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g001">Figure 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g003">Figure 3A</xref> shows cross-sections through the broadest portion of the head (H), the leg region (L) just above the membrane (see boxed insert for illustration), and a side view (S) of a section parallel to the axial plane with the membrane at the bottom of each of the eight classes.

The real strength of the approach is that it facilitates a determination as to whether subsets (classes) of objects comprise the larger population. Relatively rigid, structurally distinct subpopulations, if present and significantly different from one another, should sort into distinct classes when subjected to multivariate data analysis. Even an inherently flexible structure displaying more random movement over significant distances would be expected to sort into separate classes although the result would tend to be blurred compared to the result expected in the case of structurally discrete states. Conformational variability <italic>within</italic> individual Env subunits (i.e., gp120 protomers) would not be detectable at the current resolution limits of this technique. Evidence of inter-subunit conformational variability should be most easily discerned by examining the spikes down the polar axis, i.e., screening for symmetry by viewing from above or below.</p><p>Even greater modes of flexibility might be manifested as twisting and/or rocking motion of gp120 and gp41 with respect to one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Because the alignment algorithms assess voxel density (signal intensity), the entire mass of the spike contributes to the placement of any given spike density within the average. Because the gp120 head is of greater mass than the solvent exposed regions of gp41, i.e., the MPER, the head would be expected to have a proportionally greater influence on the average. As a consequence, if the gp41 legs are in a tripod-like configuration but some were twisted, for example, with respect to the gp120 heads, the gp41 signals would be blurred to yield a cone of weak density rather than discrete, dense tripod-like legs in the averaged models. Similarly, the gp41 and membrane density might also impede alignment of the gp120 heads should the head and legs be twisted or bent with respect to one another. This is, in fact, what we observed for the MPER when the various classes, representing all of the classified Env spikes, were averaged together (data not shown).</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we reasoned that if the gp41 leg/membrane regions and gp120 head regions were independently aligned and/or classified, the weighting effect of one region upon the other would be eliminated and structural subregion classes with more discrete structural characteristics might emerge. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g002">Figure 2B&#x02013;2D</xref> depicts the various head and leg subvolume alignment and classification schemes used to address this issue. For simplicity, the membrane is not depicted in the diagram. Alignments and, independently, classifications were based on the density data within either the whole spike, head, or leg/membrane regions.</p><p>Overall, the data show that subunit alignment and classification enhanced the symmetry of the targeted subregion and conversely, had the predictable effect of blurring the detail of the subregion excluded from the classification. For example, when the gp120 head was excluded, allowing the leg densities to drive the classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), the gp41 leg region showed 3 of 8 classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g003">Figure 3C, L4, 6, 8</xref>) (representing 38&#x00025; of total spikes) with three more-or-less distinct densities (judged subjectively) with a tendency toward 3-fold symmetry, a pattern that was less obvious following alignment and classification of the whole spike where only 1 of 8 classes (11&#x00025; of total spikes) showed this pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g003">Figure 3A, L1</xref>). Surprisingly, when both alignment and classification were driven by the leg densities, one class showed clear 3-fold leg symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g003">Figure 3E, L6</xref>, 12&#x00025;) though all the others showed multi-leg asymmetry. In some classes where two legs are obvious, one of the legs appears extra thick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g003">Figure 3C, L1, 2, 3; 3E, L 4, 7</xref>) possibly indicating a (transient?) association of two of the three legs.</p><p>When the gp41 leg region was excluded from classification, 5 of 8 classes (representing 63&#x00025; of total spikes) had gp120 head regions that displayed a tendency toward 3-fold symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g003">Figure 3B, H1, 3, 5, 6, 8</xref>) compared to 4 of 8 classes (51&#x00025; of total spikes) for whole spike alignment and classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g003">Figure 3A, H5&#x02013;8</xref>). This trend was more pronounced when both alignment and classification were performed using just the head volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) wherein 6 of 8 classes (75&#x00025;) were trimer-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g003">Figure 3D</xref> 3&#x02013;8). Thus, even though there was clearly a tendency toward symmetry within the spikes, it was less evident following whole spike averaging, even when whole spike classification (into 8 classes) was applied. Interestingly, subvolume classification appeared about as effective in enhancing applicable head or tail images irrespective of whether the alignment was based on the whole spike or the targeted subvolume of the spike (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g003">Figure 3B to 3D and 3C to 3E</xref>). Stated another way, the use of subvolume <italic>alignment</italic> appeared less important to the final outcome than the application of subvolume <italic>classification</italic>. The reason for the less dominant effect in enhancing substructures could be attributed to the fact that selective alignment based on head or leg regions was carried out as a refinement of the already aligned whole spikes. Thus, the applied incremental changes do not appear as significant as the structural differences obtained by classification.</p><p>A significant percentage of the classified spikes and spike components deviated considerably from 3-fold symmetry. The reasons for this are unclear but include bona fide segmental flexibility/heteromorphology, and &#x0201c;noisy&#x0201d; data, a general characteristic of cryoEM data where contrast is inherently low. It is worth noting that in neither SIV nor HIV-1 did we observe any evidence of conserved structural features immediately below the membrane as would have been expected if the CT of Env were rigid or associated with a geometrically arrayed submembrane matrix layer.</p><p>In order to construct a single volume rendering of an &#x0201c;idealized&#x0201d; HIV spike, we selected the spike subregion classes showing the most symmetric features and averaged them together as single classes. These averaged classes were then displayed as surface renderings as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g004">Figure 4</xref>. For example, the head-aligned/head-classified classes represented by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g003">Figure 3D</xref> (3&#x02013;8) were averaged as a single class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) and, in the final step, 3-fold symmetrized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The best leg-aligned/leg-classified classes (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g003">Figure 3E, 3, 6, 7</xref>) were similarly combined, aligned, and averaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g004">Figure 4E and F</xref>). The optimized heads from the first set of models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>) were then grafted onto the legs of the second set of models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g004">Figure 4E and 4F</xref>) to yield the composite HIV-1 spikes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000203-g004">Figure 4G and 4H</xref>.

Consequently, the details of the respective density maps and fitting of the atomic core structures in those reports should be considered as provisional.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Significance of tripod-like legs</title><p>There is a general view that one of the main reasons no suitable Env-based vaccine for the induction of effective humoral protection has been developed relates to the difficulty in engineering soluble versions that faithfully mimic the viral spike surface configuration (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Srivastava1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Pantophlet1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>). Early monomeric constructs largely failed due to the exposure of immunodominant epitopes on the non-neutralizing face, a region believed buried in the gp120 subunit interface in the oligomer. Consequently, numerous attempts have been made at generating trimeric soluble constructs. However, many such constructs have proven inherently unstable with unacceptably high levels of subunit dissociation and/or aggregation. Strategies to circumvent this obstacle include mutational disruption of the protease cleavage sites between gp120 and gp41, inter-subunit disulfide bonding and other stabilization enhancing point mutations, and the addition of trimerization motifs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Srivastava1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Pantophlet1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>). These approaches have had varying degrees of success at stabilizing the trimer and occluding the non-neutralizing face but have yet to faithfully mimic the antigenic profile of authentic membrane-associated trimers.</p><p>Our initial observation that the MPER of Env gp41 appeared to be in an open tripod-like conformation rather than in the traditionally-depicted compact stalk configuration provided a plausible explanation for the failure of at least some engineered version of Env trimers to adopt the native configuration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Zhu2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically, the trimerization motifs used to date, which bunched the C termini of the MPER tightly together, might force the MPERs into an unnatural configuration, perhaps altering and/or weakening the already inherently unstable interactions between the rest of the tripartite subunits. The resultant constructs may thus behave more like three tethered monomers rather than true trimers. On the other hand, if, as our data indicates, the Env spike is, to a degree, polymorphic and/or displays considerable component flexibility, a fully rigidified recombinant Env spike may not mimic the structure of virion-associated Env either. However, it may well turn out that rigid constructs, even if they don't fully mimic natural virus-associated Env might nevertheless serve as more effective vaccines. The production of a crystal structure of an Env trimer in its (near) native configuration would significantly advance our understanding of these and other issues relating to Env, however the prospects of success are diminished if the variations in form we observe are the result of segmental flexibility.</p><p>Several reasons for moving cautiously in fully embracing the tripod-legged paradigm have been put forth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Roux1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Subramaniam1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. First, the original modeled cryoET Env spike was derived from 3D tomograms of SIV rather than HIV-1. Although the structure of the Env spikes on the two AIDS viruses have been assumed to be structurally similar and the atomic structures of the gp120 of the unliganded HIV-1 and liganded SIV core proteins have been extensively compared <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Chen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Kwong3">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Douek1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, true similarity at the atomic level has yet to be formally demonstrated. Indeed, our previous negative stain EM tomogram studies have found HIV-1 spikes to be less uniformly configured than those on SIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Zhu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and unreported data). Other data indicate that the degree of compactness and subunit accessibility to ligand binding varies significantly between SIV and HIV-1 and even between different strains of each <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Kwong2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Pantophlet1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Yuan1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Srivastava2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, the cryoET-modeled SIV Env spike derives from a mutated version of SIV displaying a truncated CT. While this feature enhanced the expression of Env spikes on virions, thus facilitating data collection, it could be argued that the loss of a considerable segment of CT might well influence Env spike structure, especially in the most closely associated MPER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Taylor1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Wyss1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

More importantly, this feature is now extended to include Env spikes from non-mutated wtHIV-1. To allay concerns about artificially enhanced symmetry, no symmetric references were utilized nor was enforcement of three-fold symmetry applied in the alignment or classification schemes used to generate the eight classes. Yet evidence pointing to a tendency toward 3-fold symmetry both in the gp120 head region and in the gp41 MPER emerged, at least in some of the class averages. Even in those classes without three leg masses, typically two masses are present as is diffuse additional density, a pattern more consistent with a three flexible leg model than a compact stalk model.

This region may also be fairly flexible. For example, the segment encompassed by the 4F10, Z13e1 and 2F5 epitopes may transition between alpha-helical and alternative motifs to allow exposure of key residues that would otherwise be on opposite sides of the presumed alpha helical structure of this region.

Liu et al. report a compact stalk for gp41 and a Z-axis-elongated structure for gp120 in which the monomeric subunits make minimal contact with each other. Their unliganded gp120 structure could not readily accommodate the unliganded core structure of Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Chen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> but was fitted instead with the CD4 liganded core structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Kwong1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Huang1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. After evidence of symmetry became apparent in the early rounds of alignment, symmetry was imposed on subsequent rounds and spike densities not fitting this pattern were discarded. We suspect that this model, like those of Zhu et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000203-Zhu2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and Zanetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr"
