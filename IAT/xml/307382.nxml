We have determined that the coding sequence of RNase 4 resides on a single exon found on human chromosome 14. The mRNA encoding RNase 4 was detected by Northern analysis in a number of human somatic tissues, including pancreas, lung, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney and placenta, but not brain; liver represents the most abundant source. Interestingly, the mRNA encoding RNase 4 is approximately 2 kb in length, which is approximately twice as large as the mRNAs encoding other members of this gene family. A larger (approximately 2.4 kb), second transcript was detected in hepatic, pancreatic and renal tissues. The approximately 2 kb RNase 4 mRNA was detected in cells of the human promyelocytic leukemia line, HL-60, that had been treated with dibutyryl-cAMP to promote neutrophilic differentiation. In contrast, no mRNA encoding RNase 4 could be detected in cells treated with phorbol myristic acid (PMA), an agent promoting differentiation toward monocyte/macrophages, suggesting the existence of elements regulating tissue specific expression of this gene.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00021-0075-a" xlink:role="4293"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00021-0075-b" xlink:role="4293"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00021-0076-a" xlink:role="4294"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00021-0072.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4290"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00021-0073.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4291"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00021-0074.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4292"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00021-0075.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4293"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00021-0076.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4294"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00021-0077.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4295"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
