The PLS-DA model built using unprocessed datasets showed a complete separation between the two groups. Caution should be exercised to avoid potential overfitting of PLS-DA models for finding separation between different groups. Some concerns related to possible overfitting of PLS-DA models when using datasets, which have the number of variables higher than the number of observations, have been published in recent years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007551-Rubingh1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007551-Westerhuis1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we pre-processed our datasets using Student's t-test (<italic>p</italic> value cutoff set at &#x0003c;0.01) followed by the area under the ROC curve (cutoff set at &#x0003e;0.8).Subjects in each group were randomly divided into training and test sets (&#x0223c;2/3 and &#x0223c;1/3 of all subjects in a given subgroup, respectively). This procedure was carried out four times with different subjects included in the test set each time, 12 analytes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007551-t003">Table 3</xref>) were used to build the models. A representative PLS-DA separation plot is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007551-g003">Figure 3</xref>; the individual prediction plots for all four analyses are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007551-g004">Figure 4</xref> (panels A to D). Sensitivity and specificity of this approach were found to be 87.5&#x000b1;7.2 and 97.7&#x000b1;2.3 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4, mean&#x000b1;SEM), respectively. There were significant age differences between <italic>LRRK2</italic> and idiopathic PD patients participating in this study; <italic>LRRK2</italic> patients were older than the idiopathic PD patients (72.8&#x000b1;11.2 vs. 64.8&#x000b1;8.4 years old, respectively, mean&#x000b1;SD, p&#x0003c;0.02). Therefore, it is possible that the observed separation between metabolomic profiles of <italic>LRRK2</italic> and idiopathic PD patients may be attributed to the age differences. To address this possibility we separated idiopathic PD patients into older and younger groups, with age of the older group matching the age of <italic>LRRK2</italic> patients (71.4&#x000b1;3.3 and 72.8&#x000b1;11.2 years old, respectively, mean&#x000b1;SD). No separation between the older and the younger groups of idiopathic PD patients was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007551-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

Although these may account for a relatively small percentage of all PD cases, analysis of the pathogenetic mechanisms involving these mutations may provide insights into the pathogenesis of idiopathic PD, it is also possible that different mutations could cause PD via different mechanisms. The autosomal dominant 6055G&#x0003e;A mutation in the <italic>LRRK2</italic> gene, which causes a <italic>G2019S</italic> substitution, is one of the most frequent mutations in familial PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007551-Healy1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>LRRK2</italic> PD patients are indistinguishable from idiopathic PD, both clinically and in their response to medication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007551-Aasly1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007551-Goldwurm1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007551-Khan1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In central Norway about 3&#x00025; of PD cases have been found to carry the <italic>G2019S</italic> substitution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007551-Aasly1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study we used metabolomic profiling to determine if there are specific metabolomic signatures associated with <italic>LRRK2</italic> PD, compared to idiopathic PD. We also addressed the question whether the asymptomatic <italic>G2019S</italic> mutation carriers could be distinguished by metabolomic analysis from control subjects.</p><p>Similar to our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007551-Bogdanov1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, we found that metabolomic profiles of idiopathic PD are different from those of age matched control subjects. In this study we demonstrated that PD patients with <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutations are also different from the control subjects. The separation between PD patients and controls raised the question of whether PD medications caused the distinction. Both idiopathic and <italic>LRRK2</italic> PD subjects involved in this study were taking antiparkinsonian medications, and no samples from the unmedicated patients were available. Therefore, it is possible that the observed separation could be related to drug effects, which could involve unknown drug metabolites and drug-induced changes in metabolism. However, we previously demonstrated that metabolomic profiles can differentiate between the medicated PD patients and controls, and this separation is not attributable to drug effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007551-Bogdanov1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Additional studies involving a larger population of both medicated and unmedicated <italic>LRRK2</italic> PD patients are necessary to address these issues.</p><p>We also found that the genetically determined groups could be separated from the non-genetic groups. There was a clear separation between metabolomic profiles of idiopathic and <italic>LRRK2</italic> PD patients, and this separation was not attributed to the age differences. Based on the limited number of analytes from plasma we were able to predict whether the patients were from idiopathic PD or from <italic>LRRK2</italic> PD groups. PLS-DA models for prediction of the class membership (<italic>LRRK2</italic> PD vs. idiopathic PD) were built four times with different subjects from the groups randomly selected for training and prediction sets each time. Although the number of subjects involved in the study was small, the PLS-DA models were able to accurately predict the class membership. Nevertheless, additional experiments with a larger study size are necessary to confirm these findings.</p><p>Analysis of metabolomic profiles of the subjects harboring <italic>LRRK2 G2019S</italic> showed that there were differences dependent on the clinical phenotype: <italic>LRRK2</italic> PD patients were partially separated from their healthy family members carrying the mutation. The observation that there is some overlap between the subjects carrying the mutation with <italic>LRRK2</italic> PD patients suggests the possibility of developing predictive biomarkers for this group, i.e., who amongst the mutation carriers will develop PD in the future. Longitudinal studies should provide more evidence for this possibility.</p><p>The majority of the analytes driving separations between the groups were not known. However, the results on known compounds strongly suggest that abnormalities in the purine pathway may be implicated in PD. Similar to the previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007551-Bogdanov1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007551-Annanmaki1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007551-deLau1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, UA levels were found to be decreased in plasma of PD patients. Several studies provide evidence that UA is involved in the development and progression of PD. Prospective epidemiological studies showed that healthy individuals with higher blood UA levels are at reduced risk for developing PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007551-Ascherio1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. A lower risk of PD has been reported among individuals consuming diets that increase serum UA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007551-Gao1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Higher blood levels of UA in patients recently diagnosed with PD predict a slower rate of disease progression, assessed by both clinical and neuroimaging measures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007551-Schwarzschild1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanisms leading to decreased UA in PD are not known. UA is a major antioxidant, and in humans is the final product of purine metabolism. It is possible that aberrations in the purine pathway in PD could occur upstream from UA. The results of this study support this hypothesis. We found for the first time significant changes in major metabolites of the purine pathway in plasma of PD patients. Notably, hypoxanthine levels were significantly decreased in unmedicated PD patients, as well as in asymptomatic <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutation carriers, compared to controls. Xanthine levels were lower in <italic>LRRK2</italic> PD patients (but not in IPD patients) as compared to controls. These findings suggest a potential role of the purine pathway in the pathogenesis of PD.</p><p>In this study LCECA was used for metabolomic profiling. We are currently working on the structural elucidation of unknown biomarkers using different mass spectrometry (MS) approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007551-Gamache1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Identification of the individual analytes (potential biomarkers) is crucial since they may play a central role in pathogenesis of the disease. The <italic>G2019S</italic> substitution in <italic>LRRK2</italic> may lead to biochemical changes that are common to PD pathophysiology irrespective of etiology.</p><p>An important aspect of this study was to distinguish asymptomatic <italic>G2019S</italic> carriers, representing a group at risk to develop PD, from controls. Obviously, a genetic test provides complete separation of the mutation carriers from non-carriers. The results of this study do not provide direct evidence for the subsets among the <italic>G2019S</italic> mutation carriers. Whether metabolomics approach could be used to predict development of PD in a subset of the <italic>G2019S</italic> carriers remains to be determined. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether one can predict disease penetrance in these subjects. The ability to recognize this group prior to onset of disease indicates the possibility of developing an early diagnostic tool using metabolomics. One could then screen individuals with increased risk of PD including first degree relatives, patients with hyposmia and patients carrying genetic risk factors. Metabolomic profiles could be screened to warn of impending PD symptom onset, and thus allow earlier institution of neuroprotective therapy in presymptomatic patients to slow or prevent nigral cell loss before PD symptomatology becomes evident. Although the present results are promising, this study needs to be repeated in a larger population due to our limitation of a low numbers of cases.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0007551-Hardy1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
