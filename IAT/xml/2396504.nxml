We addressed causative links between the biochemical, pathological and inflammatory disorders in a mouse model of this disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In cell culture, heparan sulfate oligosaccharides activated microglial cells by signaling through the Toll-like receptor 4 and the adaptor protein MyD88. CD11b positive microglial cells and three-fold increased expression of mRNAs coding for the chemokine MIP1&#x003b1; were observed at 10 days in the brain cortex of MPSIIIB mice, but not in MPSIIIB mice deleted for the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 or the adaptor protein MyD88, indicating early priming of microglial cells by heparan sulfate oligosaccharides in the MPSIIIB mouse brain. Whereas the onset of brain inflammation was delayed for several months in doubly mutant versus MPSIIIB mice, the onset of disease markers expression was unchanged, indicating similar progression of the neurodegenerative process in the absence of microglial cell priming by heparan sulfate oligosaccharides. In contrast to younger mice, inflammation in aged MPSIIIB mice was not affected by TLR4/MyD88 deficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These results indicate priming of microglia by HS oligosaccharides through the TLR4/MyD88 pathway. Although intrinsic to the disease, this phenomenon is not a major determinant of the neurodegenerative process. Inflammation may still contribute to neurodegeneration in late stages of the disease, albeit independent of TLR4/MyD88. The results support the view that neurodegeneration is primarily cell autonomous in this pediatric disease.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Divergent events such as deposition of A&#x000df; in Alzheimer disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Bamberger1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, &#x003b1;-synuclein or neuromelanin in Parkinson disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Zhang1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Wilms1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, disease-associated PrP<sup>sc</sup> protein in prion disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Cunningham1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, mutants SOD1 protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Moisse1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, viral proteins in human immunodeficiency infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Sheng1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> or mutant huntingtin in Huntington disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Sapp1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> initiate involvement of the immune system, which in turn interacts with the nervous system and set the pace of progressive neurodegeneration. Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by both local activation of resident microglia and astrocytes and infiltration of leucocytes from the periphery. Immune reaction can be toxic for neurons through the local production of the inflammatory cytokines TNF&#x003b1;, IL-1 and IL-6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Block1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Zipp1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Inflammatory chemokines, especially the macrophage inflammatory protein 1&#x003b1; (MIP1&#x003b1;), are also produced, stimulating microglial activation and attracting peripheral inflammatory cells to the brain parenchyma. Suppressing inflammation is regarded as a potential therapeutic approach against the development of neurodegeneration in AD and PD, especially with regard to the relative protection conferred by the long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Etminan1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Chen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Whereas the association of chronic neurodegeneration and inflammation is well established, the causative links between these events is debated.

In mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPSIII), the unique event responsible for both cell pathology and brain inflammation is the production and accumulation of partially digested, possibly abnormally sulfated or acetylated oligosaccharide fragments of heparan sulfate (HS), a specific type of glycosaminoglycan (GAG). Interruption of HS oligosaccharide degradation is the consequence of a defect in one of the four exoglycanases required for the removal of the &#x003b1;-linked N-acetylglucosamine at the non-reducing end of the saccharide chain. The production of HS oligosaccharides is associated to the secondary accumulation of GM2 and GM3 gangliosides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Constantopoulos1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Walkley1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, to the formation of large cytoplasmic inclusions in various brain cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Li1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, to the accumulation of subunit C of the mitochondrial ATP synthase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Ryazantsev1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, and to the dysregulation of GAP43 mRNA expression in brain tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Li2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

Heard, unpublished) models of MPSIII subtype B (MPSIIIB), a deficiency of &#x003b1;-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NaGlu), showed that delivery of the missing enzyme to the brain prevented pathology and clinical manifestations. Here, we provide evidence that microglial cell activation is primed by HS oligosaccharides at very early stage of the disease, although suppression of microglial cell priming by HS oligosaccharides does not modify the course of the neurodegenerative process.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>HS oligosaccharides activate microglial cells</title><p>We examined whether microglial cell activation could be induced by HS oligosaccharides. For that purpose, HS oligosaccharides were purified from the urines of two MPSIIIB patients (HS1 and HS2, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">materials and methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002296.s002">figure S1</xref>). Tandem mass spectrometry analysis identified HS oligosaccharide species previously detected in MPSIIIB patient urines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Fuller1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> and in the brain of MPSIIIB dogs (M. Fuller, M. Elinwood and J. Hopwood, unpublished). It is therefore presumable that these molecules also accumulate in the brain of MPSIIIB mice. Normal mouse microglia cultures incubated with purified HS oligosaccharides released TNF&#x003b1; in culture supernatant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002296-t001">table 1</xref>) and showed morphological changes typical of cell activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002296.s003">figure S2</xref>). This phenotype was similar to that induced by LPS. Morphological changes and release of TNF&#x003b1; in response to the stimulation by HS oligosaccharides were however not suppressed by polymixin B, a reagent that specifically inhibits LPS and other endotoxin action (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002296-t001">table 1</xref>). Microglial cell activation induced by HS1 or HS2 led to increased detection of TNF&#x003b1;, IL1&#x000df; and MIP1&#x003b1; mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002296-g001">figure 1</xref>). Compared to LPS, HS oligosaccharides induced lower expression of TNF&#x003b1; mRNAs but equivalent levels of IL1&#x000df; and MIP1&#x003b1; mRNAs. Synthetic heparin, purified bovine HS and GAGs purified from normal individual urine did not activate microglial cultures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002296-t001">table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002296-g001">fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002296.s003">figure S2</xref>). Microglial cell activation was much less intense when microglial cell cultures were derived from mice deficient for the expression of the innate immune response receptor Toll Like Receptor (TLR) 4 or the TLR adaptor protein MyD88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002296-g001">figure 1</xref>). These results indicate that HS oligosaccharides produced by NaGlu deficient organisms stimulated microglial cell activation through the TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway. Interestingly, higher amounts of IL1&#x000df; and MIP1&#x003b1; mRNAs were produced by microglial cells isolated from MPSIIIB mice in response to both LPS and HS oligosaccharides compared to wild type mouse microglia, suggesting higher susceptibility to innate immune stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002296-g001">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0002296-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002296.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Heparan sulfate oligosaccharides activate mouse microglial cells in vitro.</title><p>Microglial cell cultures were established from wild type (white bars), MPSIIIB (red bars), TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (yellow bars), or MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (green bars) mice.

The aim of the present study was to examine causative links between HS oligosaccharide accumulation, inflammation and disease markers in the cortex of MPSIIIB mice. Our approach associated microglial cell cultures, modulation of brain inflammation in cross-bred mice and disease correction by gene therapy. Results provided evidence that HS oligosaccharides primed microglial activation through TLR4 and MyD88 both in vitro and in the MPSIIIB mouse brain. However, suppression of microglial priming in MPSIIIB mice deleted for TLR4 and MyD88 showed dissociation between inflammation, which was absent or drastically reduced in young animals (10 days and 3 months), and expression of disease markers, which was unchanged. We conclude that neurodegeneration progresses independently of the stimulation of the innate response by HS. Nevertheless, injuries subsequent to the degenerative process progressively created a chronic inflammatory state in the brain of ageing MPSIIIB mice (8 months), which was independent of TLR4 and MyD88, and which in turn may have exacerbated pathology. Injuries that possibly stimulated chronic inflammation in ageing MPSIIIB mice are the alteration of the blood-brain barrier, as documented in mice with GM1 or GM2 gangliosidosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Jeyakumar1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, the secondary accumulation of GM2 and GM3 ganglisosides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Jou1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and the cell death.</p><p>Microglial activation by HS oligosaccharides is consistent with a previous report showing that these molecules activate dendritic cells through TLR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Johnson1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Our experimental controls indicated that only HS oligosaccharides, and not non-fragmented HS or chondroitin sulfate activated microglia in vitro. HS oligosaccharide fragments are produced in early endosomes by heparinases and thereafter transferred to lysosomes for further digestion by exoglycanases. The size of abnormal undigested oligosaccharides accumulating in exoglycanase deficient cells, such as oligosaccharides with terminal &#x003b1;-linked N-acetylglucosamine in MPSIIIB, ranges from single to multiple repeats of disaccharides. Further studies will specify the structure, sulfation and acetylation of HS oligosaccharide species responsible for priming microglial activation.</p><p>In vitro assays showed a moderate effect of HS oligosaccharides with respect to TNF&#x003b1; mRNA production and a much more robust effect on MIP1&#x003b1; and IL1&#x003b2; mRNA expression. We therefore focused in vivo studies on the latter two factors. They are principally produced in the brain by activated microglia and/or astrocytes. In 10-days-old MPSIIIB mice, we observed increased CD11b staining and normal GFAP staining, suggesting that MIP1&#x003b1; and IL1&#x003b2; mRNAs were produced by activated microglia. Although GAG concentration in brain extracts was still in the normal range at this stage, abnormal HS oligosaccharides were already produced because of the enzyme defect, and therefore possibly triggered microglial cell priming. Other stimuli that could trigger microglial cell priming, like cell vacuolation and death and/or secondary accumulation of GM2 and GM3 gangliosides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Zhou1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, were absent at this stage. Consistently with the stimulation of microglial cell priming by HS oligosaccharides in the brain, deletion of the innate immune response mediators TLR4 or MyD88 in MPSIIIB mice showed substantial reduction of CD11b staining and of the expression level of IL1&#x003b2; and MIP1&#x003b1; mRNAs at 10 days and 3 months, as observed in vitro.</p><p>Early MIP1&#x003b1; production in the MPSIIIB mouse brain is reminiscent of the implication of this chemokine in the neurodegenerative process associated with Sandhoff disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Wu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

This hypothesis is supported by the observation that microglial cells isolated from MPSIIIB mice produced higher amounts of MIP1&#x003b1; and IL1&#x000df; mRNAs in vitro in response to LPS or HS oligosaccharides than wild type mouse microglia. A further investigation of this issue in MPSIIIB mice is worthwhile, since it may be relevant to the outcome of treatments in children.</p><p>Our results indicate that inflammation may have different causes and consequences depending on disease progression in the brain of MPSIIIB mice. Priming of microglial activation by HS oligosaccharides occurs at very early stage of the disease, whereas pathology is still very mild. Activated microglia are thought to act as effector cells in the degeneration of neural cells in the central nervous system. Soluble factors released by activated microglia are capable of inducing intracellular swelled vesicles (beads) in neuron dendrites and axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Stagi1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Takeuchi1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. However, although this mechanism might be relevant to the development of vacuolation and ScMAS accumulation in MPSIIIB neuron, it is presumably not involved in MPSIIIB since the appearance of these disease markers was not delayed when microglial activation by HS oligosaccharides was reduced in young doubly mutant mice. It is therefore likely that at early stage of the disease pathology developing in the MPSIIIB central nervous system is cell-autonomous rather than environmental. Observation made in 8-months-old MPSIIIB and doubly mutant mice suggest that the situation may be different at later stage of the disease, when additional stimuli of innate immunity subsequent to pathology development are likely predominant. Responses to these stimuli is independent of TLR4 and MyD88 but may be exacerbated by the permanent stimulation of microglia by HS oligosaccharides. They presumably induce a self-sustained chronic inflammation that is potentially harmful to the central nervous system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Media, fetal calf serum and antibiotics were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, California).

Quantitative PCR was performed in a Model 7000 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with 100 ng of cDNA and the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (according to Applied Biosystems procedures). Amplification parameters: 50&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes, 95&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes, 95&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds, 60&#x000b0;C for 1 minute. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Negative controls included omission of reverse transcriptase at the cDNA synthesis step and omission of the template at the PCR step. Additional controls performed for each cDNA amplification included optimization of primer concentration, assessment of amplification efficiency and detection of possible primer dimerization through analysis of dissociation curves. Ct (Cycle threshold) values were determined as the numbers of PCR cycles at which specific amplification of the target sequence occurred. Ct superior to 38 were considered as background signal. cDNA amounts were expressed as 2exp(Ct1&#x02013;Ct2), in which Ct1 is a reference Ct measured for the amplification of ARPO (Acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein) cDNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002296-Simpson1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref> and Ct2 is the Ct measured for the amplification of the examined cDNA.
