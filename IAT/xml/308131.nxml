We have detected increases in the DNA binding activity and mRNA level of HNF-3 alpha. Both are reflections of the actual activation mechanism at the level of transcriptional initiation, which we showed with the help of HNF-3 alpha promoter constructs. Time course studies clearly show that HNF-3 alpha activation is a transient event. Employing Northern blots, HNF-3 alpha mRNA can be detected between 16 and 24 hours post-differentiation, reaches its zenith at approximately 1 day, and then declines to virtually undetectable levels. F9 cells can give rise to three distinct differentiated cell types; visceral endoderm, parietal endoderm, and primitive endoderm. We have clearly shown that HNF-3 alpha stimulation occurs upon primitive endoderm formation. In addition, the transcription factor is also activated during the induction of cell lineages that give rise to parietal and visceral endoderm. HNF-3 alpha stimulation upon visceral endoderm differentiation is accompanied by the activation of HNF-3 target genes such as transthyretin, suggesting that HNF-3 alpha is involved in the developmental activation of this gene. In contrast, HNF-3 alpha target genes in parietal and primitive endoderm have yet to be identified. However, the stimulation of HNF-3 alpha during primitive endoderm formation, which is an extremely early event during murine embryogenesis, points towards a role for the factor in crucial determination processes that occur early during development.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0207-a" xlink:role="2129"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0207-b" xlink:role="2129"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0207-c" xlink:role="2129"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0208-a" xlink:role="2130"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0209-a" xlink:role="2131"/></fig><fig id="F6"><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0210-a" xlink:role="2132"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0204.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2126"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0205.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2127"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0206.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2128"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0207.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2129"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0208.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2130"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0209.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2131"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0210.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2132"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0211.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2133"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
