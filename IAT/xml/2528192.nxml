A comprehensive description of the assembly process is still lacking. To obtain data on the timing and order of association of the different pre-ribosomal factors, a strategy consists in the use of pre-ribsomal particles isolated from mutants that block ribosome formation at different steps. Immunoblots, inherently limited to only a few factors, have been applied to evaluate the accumulation or decrease of pre-ribosomal intermediates under mutant conditions. For a global protein-level description of different 60S ribosomal subunit maturation intermediates in yeast, we have adapted a method of <italic>in vivo</italic> isotopic labelling and mass spectrometry to study pre-60S complexes isolated from strains in which rRNA processing was affected by individual depletion of five factors: Ebp2, Nog1, Nsa2, Nog2 or Pop3. We obtained quantitative data for 45 distinct pre-60S proteins and detected coordinated changes for over 30 pre-60S factors in the analysed mutants. These results led to the characterisation of the composition of early, intermediate and late pre-ribosomal complexes, specific for crucial maturation steps during 60S assembly in eukaryotes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis is a complex cellular pathway, which requires a large number of proteins, stably or transiently associated to many macromolecular complexes. This pathway results in the production of mature ribosomal subunits, the small one (40S), composed in yeast of 33 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) and assembled with the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the large one (60S) containing 48 r-proteins and the 25S, 5.8S and 5S rRNAs. The RNA component of the ribosomes is synthesized in the nucleolus as the 35S and 5S rRNA precursors. A large number of proteins and snoRNA associate co- or post-transcriptionally to the large 35S RNA and form, in association with U3 snoRNA, large particles known as 90S, or the SSU-processome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Pre-60S and pre-40S particles, formed from the initial large precursors, follow two distinct maturation pathways in the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The pre-rRNAs are gradually modified and processed, and the subunits achieve their structure and translating capacity.</p><p>More than 300 proteins have been characterised or predicted to assist the pre-ribosomal particles during their maturation. Many of these factors are transiently associated with the 90S, pre-60S and pre-40S particles and are known as pre-ribosomal proteins. Functional studies on pre-ribosomal factors could be undertaken once the composition of pre-ribosomal complexes had been determined by affinity purification experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). Such experiments gave limited information on the positioning of the identified proteins in the pathway. Affinity purifications of pre-ribosomal factors and their associated complexes result in the isolation of heterogeneous mixtures of intermediate particles because some factors associate very transiently with the pre-ribosomal particles, whereas others follow the process from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm. To isolate and characterise discrete intermediates in ribosome biogenesis, the purification of enriched complexes involved in a given step was performed in mutant strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9">6&#x02013;9</xref>). These intermediates were also analysed by testing the presence of known pre-rRNAs enriched in association with different pre-ribosomal or r-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). When antibodies are available, the presence of specific factors in the purified complexes under native and mutant conditions can be tested. The obtained results provide valuable, but limited information about the order of sequential association or dissociation of a number of factors during the assembly of 60S or 40S particles.</p><p>An alternative to the antibodies-based detection of proteins in the isolated complexes is quantitative mass spectrometry. One of its versions, using isotopically labelled peptides, the iTRAQ methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), was used to compare the composition of complexes associated with Nop7-TAP under wild-type conditions and when the GTPase Nog1 was mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Only modest differences were observed, emphasizing the importance of the chosen mutant for this type of analysis. However, the results demonstrated that mass spectrometry is a suitable method for the quantitative analysis of the composition of pre-ribosomal complexes.</p><p>The present work aimed at establishing the assembly order of pre-60S factors during ribosome biogenesis, which would allow the composition of intermediate complexes at given steps to be defined. To this end, we analysed mutants that specifically accumulate different pre-rRNAs, and thus affect the pathway at early, intermediate or late steps, before the export of pre-60S particles to the cytoplasm. We compared the composition of the purified complexes under native or mutant conditions by semi-quantitative mass spectrometry, using a method derived from SILAC (Stable Isotope Labelling with Amino-acids in Cell culture) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The obtained results were in excellent correlation both with previously published data on specific factors and with the overall topology of the large-scale network of affinity-purification interactions, validating the approach. Moreover, we could define groups of early, intermediate and late associating proteins that accurately describe pre-60S assembly dynamics in yeast.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains</title><p>Yeast strains used in this work are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn469/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>.

Taken individually, each pre-60S factor that was used as a bait, co-purified with a number of other proteins, providing a profile of the factors that can be concomitantly found on pre-60S particles. To assign these factors to groups, we used the data to build a matrix of physical interactions, constituted of 49 tagged proteins, in rows, and 63 distinct associated proteins, in columns (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn469/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). We expected proteins involved in the same pre-60S precursors to be grouped together and, as a result, to gain insights into the timing of association and dissociation of different pre-60S factors. Even though this kind of analysis proved previously to be efficient to distinguish 90S, pre-60S and pre-40S particles when using a large number of pre-ribosomal proteins and their associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), the obtained cluster of pre-60S factors was unable to further refine the involvement of many of the proteins at specific steps in the pathway.</p><p>To get a detailed description of the composition of pre-60S complexes along the pathway, other methods had to be set up. One such method uses quantitative mass-spectrometry to compare the composition of purified pre-ribosomal particles from mutant strains affected for 60S biogenesis. For this type of study, both the choice of mutants and tagged proteins used for the purification of the complexes were important. We chose 5 pre-60S factors (Ebp2, Nog1, Nsa2, Pop3 and Nog2) to block the biogenesis of the large ribosomal subunit at specific steps, defined by the accumulation of distinct pre-rRNA intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23 B24">21&#x02013;24</xref>). As these factors are essential for cell viability, we generated strains where the genes encoding these factors were under the control of a glucose-repressed promoter (<italic>GAL1-10</italic>). All these strains showed a progressive growth defect when cultivated in glucose-containing medium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn469/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). The growth defect was associated with changes in the levels of different rRNA maturation intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), tested by primer extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) and northern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). As expected from previous reports on the role of these factors, we observed different effects of the proteins depletion on the steady-state levels of the pre-60S RNA components. Like the <italic>ebp2-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), the repression of <italic>EBP2</italic> led to early defects in the 60S maturation pathway, with a 27SA<sub>2</sub> increase and a decrease in 27SB and 7S pre-rRNA levels. Repression of <italic>POP3</italic> expression induced changes in the 27SB<sub>L</sub>/27SB<sub>S</sub>, 7S<sub>L</sub>/7S<sub>S</sub> and 5.8S<sub>L</sub>/5.8S<sub>S</sub> ratios, which have been previously attributed to the role of the RNase MRP (Pop3 being one of its subunits) in the RNA cleavage at site A<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), the repression of either <italic>NOG1</italic> or <italic>NSA2</italic> expression affected the cleavage of 27SB precursors at site C<sub>2</sub>, hence preventing the formation of 7S. Nog2 depletion had a different effect on 60S biogenesis at a late nuclear step with the accumulation of both 27SB and 7S species, as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Thus, using these five mutants, the 60S biogenesis could be blocked at early, intermediate or late nuclear steps.</p><p>We combined the glucose-repressible strains with genomic TAP-tagging of Rlp24, a factor that associates with pre-60S particles both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), allowing the isolation of blocked complexes in the different mutants. We still needed a robust method for quantitative comparisons of the protein composition of these isolated complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Adaptation of SILAC to the analysis of TAP complexes</title><p>Several methods of quantitative mass spectrometry, based on isotopic labelling of proteins or peptides have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). To monitor the relative amounts of each purified protein in wild type and mutant samples, we chose SILAC, as a robust method of <italic>in vivo</italic> labelling that could be adapted to the quantification of simple MS spectra obtained with a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer.</p><p>SILAC is based on the differential labelling of two cultures before the analysis, for example, a wild type and a mutant strain. Proteins from one of the samples incorporate a deuterated amino acid, leucine with 3 deuterium atoms in our case, which leads to a shift in the m/z for all the peptides coming from that sample, when compared with a sample coming from a culture grown with non-deuterated leucine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). For each single-charged peptide containing a leucine, this results in a shift of 3 Da in the mass spectrum. Assignment of the peptide peaks to identified proteins and measurement of the pairs (deuterated/non-deuterated) peak heights in the MALDI-TOF spectra provide a relative quantitative measure for the initial content of the protein in the two samples. To limit the analysis to the changes in composition of specific complexes, an additional TAP purification step was required; the whole procedure is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A. The results obtained for different proteins can be explained by following the example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B. Proteins that are no longer co-purified with the tagged protein in the mutant strain generate spectra profiles resembling that shown for the protein marked &#x02018;W&#x02019;. In contrast, proteins that are enriched in the mutant complexes result in peptide profiles like the one shown as example &#x02018;Z&#x02019;. Both shown peptides have a single charge and contain 2 leucines, resulting in a 6 Da shift in the detected m/z.</p><p>Since our method only relies on the identification of proteins by their peptide mass fingerprint, we tested the reproducibility and precision of quantitative measures that are based on MALDI-TOF MS spectra. We mixed in different proportions total protein extracts from strains grown with deuterated or non-deuterated leucine and obtained an excellent correlation between our measures and the expected fraction of deuterated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>Defining the association of proteins to early or late 60S precursors</title><p>The depletion of many pre-60S factors results in a relative 27SB pre-rRNA accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). To assign these different proteins to groups that would predict their early or late association to the ribosome precursors, we first tested the effects of Nog1 depletion on the composition of Rlp24-TAP associated complexes. Our previous data, based on immunoblots, indicated that under these conditions several important changes in the composition of the purified complexes occur, like the accumulation of Mak11 or the depletion of Nog2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Characterisation of Mak11 and Nog2 confirmed their involvement in early or late steps of nuclear 60S maturation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). We thus began our investigation of the order of assembly of 60S ribosomal subunits with an analysis of the changes in the composition of Rlp24-TAP-associated complexes when Nog1 was depleted.</p><p>In addition to large subunit r-proteins and usual contaminants (Ssb, translation elongation factors or small subunit r-proteins), we identified and quantified the relative abundance of 28 pre-60S factors in the purified complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B). As expected, one of the proteins showing the largest decrease in the particles isolated from the mutant strain, was the depleted protein Nog1. Other factors, like Nog2 or Nug1 showed a similar behaviour, in good correlation with previous descriptions of the late association of these factors to pre-60S complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Conversely, proteins like Ssf1, described as acting early in the 60S biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), were enriched in the complexes isolated under mutant conditions. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Rlp24-TAP combined with Nog1 depletion defines classes of pre-60S factors.

Both the eluate from the first purification step on IgG-sepharose (TEV) and the final eluate (TAP) were analysed (left and right panels, respectively).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn469f3"/></fig></p><p>Many quantified pre-60S factors (located in the grey area on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B) were decreased when compared to the levels of Rlp24-TAP, the protein used for the isolation of the particles, but were enriched in the complexes, when compared to the average level of the quantified ribosomal proteins (indicated by dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). In the absence of an absolute standard, we arbitrarily fixed the measured ratio for Rlp24-TAP to 1 and reported the results for the other proteins accordingly. If we assume that the ribosomal proteins decreased under mutant conditions in the complexes isolated in association with Rlp24-TAP, a straightforward explanation would be that a fraction of the Rlp24-TAP bait was no longer associated with large complexes when ribosome biogenesis was blocked. While changing the reference has an impact on what can be considered as an increase or a decrease in protein amounts, it does not modify the classification of the ratios for the different pre-60S factors.</p><p>To validate the results of mass spectrometry quantifications we performed immunoblots on TEV and TAP purifications, using antibodies that recognise specifically Rlp24, Mak11, Nop7, Nog1, Nog2 or Arx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). The results were in good agreement with the mass-spectrometry-based measurements, hence validating the SILAC analysis.</p><p>To confirm and reinforce the data from our first experiments, we used another mutant having a similar pre-rRNA phenotype and another protein as bait. We chose Nsa2 depletion as mutant condition since it led to the same pre-rRNA species accumulation as the depletion of Nog1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). In addition, Nsa2 was the protein showing the strongest decrease in the Rlp24-TAP complexes when Nog1 was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B), an effect explained by the observation of Nsa2 destabilisation under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Nog1-associated proteins are very similar to those found in association with Rlp24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). We obtained quantitative data, by TAP-SILAC for Nog1-TAP under wild type or Nsa2 depletion conditions for 30 pre-60S factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and B). Twenty-three proteins were quantified in both Rlp24-TAP, Nog1 depletion and Nog1-TAP, Nsa2 depletion experiments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn469/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>), with a very good Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient (<italic>t</italic> = 0.727) of the observed changes (<italic>p</italic> = 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> that the values are not correlated). The results obtained in two independent experiments with different mutants and different TAP-tagged proteins allowed the definition of two groups of pre-60S factors. An early one is composed by proteins that are likely to be present on pre-60S particles before the step blocked in the absence of either Nog1 or Nsa2, and is composed of at least 20 different proteins, including factors like Ssf1 or Mak11. Proteins that showed reproducibly diminished levels in the complexes under mutant conditions (Nop53, Nog2, Nug1 or Rsa4) are likely to associate to the 60S precursors at a later stage. The different abundance of proteins in the early and late group of pre-60S factors is correlated with the progressive simplification of pre-60S particles during their maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Nog1-TAP combined with the depletion of Nsa2 defines C2-specific 60S precursors.

No protein could be observed accumulating in association with Rlp24 under Ebp2 mutant conditions, when compared with the wild type (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn469/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4A</ext-link> and B). These results suggest that Ebp2 action precedes the association of Rlp24 to the pre-60S particles and that an earlier protein should be used to isolate the complexes that accumulate in the absence of Ebp2. As we have previously shown that Mak11 might already be present on the complexes at a moment preceding Rlp24 association to pre-60S particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), we tested the influence of Ebp2 depletion on Mak11-TAP-associated complexes composition. A number of proteins, and especially Noc2, Nop4 and Rrp5, where present in higher amounts in the Mak11-associated complexes in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B), in good agreement with the function of these proteins early in the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). On the contrary, some of the proteins that were classified as &#x02018;early&#x02019; in respect with Nog1 or Nsa2 function were lost when Ebp2 was depleted, for example Nop16, Erb1 or Nop7. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Early 60S precursors, isolated in association with Mak11-TAP are enriched after Ebp2 depletion.

Among the different proteins that we defined as late-associating, we chose Nog2 depletion as the mutant condition coupled with the isolation of pre-60S complexes in association with Rlp24-TAP for further experiments. Unlike Arx1 or Tif6, Nog2 is strictly nuclear and its depletion leads to the accumulation of the last nuclear pre-rRNA intermediate, 7S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) and also blocks the export of the 60S precursors to the cytoplasm.</p><p>Little change was observed in Rlp24-TAP-associated complexes between the wild-type conditions and the depletion of Nog2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). The fact that both 7S and 27S species are accumulated in Nog2-depleted cells might provide an explanation for the lack of amplitude of the observed effects. Still, Rsa4 and Arx1 levels decreased in these complexes, suggesting that their association to late pre-60S depends on Nog2 presence. Rsa4 was previously described as a factor required for late pre-60S biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), but its precise binding step had not been specifically addressed. Recently, Arx1 was described as a nuclear export receptor for the 60S precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>); its decrease in the Nog2 mutant is thus in good agreement with a late role of Arx1 in 60S biogenesis. Changes in the composition of 60S particles, detected by quantitative mass spectrometry, can be thus useful to orient further functional characterisation of specific pre-60S factors. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Modest changes in the composition of late nuclear pre-60S complexes are induced by Nog2 depletion.

We wondered whether protein composition may have an influence on the pre-rRNA processing and if particles of similar pre-rRNA components may contain different protein sets. To this end, we explored the effects of an RNase MRP mutant on Rlp24-TAP-associated complexes composition. After A<sub>2</sub> cleavage that leads to the 27SA<sub>2</sub> precursor, processing of 27S species can follow two distinct routes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A): the major one involves a cleavage at site A<sub>3</sub> by RNase MRP; the minor one consists of a 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; exonucleolytic trimming by a yet unidentified ribonuclease, and leads to the production of 5&#x02032;-extended species (27SB<sub>L</sub>, 7S<sub>L</sub> precursors and 5.8S<sub>L</sub> rRNA). The repression of <italic>POP3</italic> impairs RNase MRP function, leading to a complete redistribution of the processing towards the minor pathway. The analysis of Rlp24-TAP complexes in the presence or absence of Pop3 revealed hardly any change in protein composition (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn469/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4C</ext-link> and D), despite a clear change in the ratio of the large and short form of the 5.8S rRNA levels (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn469/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>), suggesting that except for 27SA<sub>3</sub> processing, both the major and the minor processing pathways involve the same set of pre-60S factors.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes involves a large number of factors, many of them identified during recent large-scale co-purification studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>). While these results were crucial to define the number of different proteins involved in this conserved pathway, they are not suitable for a detailed characterisation of the different intermediate ribosome precursors. Novel approaches are needed to address this question and one of them is the study of changes in the protein composition of the intermediate particles under mutant conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). We show here that coupling TAP purifications with carefully chosen mutants and novel methods of quantitative mass-spectrometry like SILAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) allows the description of groups of pre-ribosomal factors that are likely to be functionally related. The definition of such groups may lead to oriented experiments that would help the comprehension of the involved molecular mechanisms.</p><p>We integrated our results about the assembly of pre-ribosomal factors on pre-60S particles in a simple schematic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Several groups of pre-60S factors could be defined, on the basis of the three analysed mutant effects. The earliest group of pre-60S factors is defined by the proteins that accumulate during Ebp2 depletion. Since this mutant accumulates 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNA, the first form of RNA that is specific to the 60S assembly pathway and signals the separation from pre-40S particles, proteins of this group are likely to be already present on the earliest nascent 60S precursors. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>SILAC-based definition of pre-60S sub-complexes. (<bold>A</bold>) Based on the results of our analysis we deduced possible association and dissociation steps that define several groups of pre-60S factors, relative to the involvement of Ebp2, Nog1/Nsa2 and Nog2 in the rRNA maturation pathway. (<bold>B, C, D</bold>) The results of the SILAC quantifications were colour-coded and superposed on a Cytoscape representation of pre-60S proteins, showing identified bait&#x02013;prey interactions from published affinity purification experiments. We first extracted a 60S-specific sub-network from the larger pre-ribosomal interactions network. The network layout was obtained by applying the yFiles organic algorithm in Cytoscape. The represented experiments are (B) Mak11-TAP, depletion of Ebp2, (C) Rlp24-TAP, depletion of Nog1 and (D) Nog1-TAP, depletion of Nsa2. The bait is framed by a blue line, and the depleted factor in a white disk dashed in red. Factors which were enriched in complexes isolated from the mutant strain at least by a factor of 2 are shown in orange, factors which were decreased by &#x0003e;50% are in cyan, factors of unchanged levels are in dark grey disks. Light grey disks indicate factors that we identified in at least one of our experiments. Light yellow disks correspond to known pre-60S factors which were not identified in the SILAC experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn469f7"/></fig></p><p>One of the most interesting findings of this study was that some pre-60S factors, like Nop16, decreased in the purified complexes when Ebp2 was depleted while they accumulated under Nog1 or Nsa2 depletion, whatever the protein used for the precursors purification. The simplest explanation for this behaviour is that proteins from this intermediate group associate to the 60S precursors at a step that precedes the one blocked by the absence of Nog1 or Nsa2, and follows the one blocked by Ebp2 absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). The proteins that, like Mrt4, associate to the nuclear pre-60S particles at late steps depending on the action of Nog1 and Nsa2 can be further classified in two sub-groups, including in the latest one the factors that also depend on Nog2 for association to the pre-60S particles (for instance, Rsa4).</p><p>Our data cannot indicate with precision the moment of dissociation for most of the identified proteins because the lack of identification of a protein in a given complex is not an absolute proof for its absence from that complex. However, when a protein could be identified under some conditions in a complex but was absent from similar complexes purified with another bait protein, such information was pragmatically used to differentiate subgroups of pre-60S factors. With the above limitations in mind, we distinguished the proteins that looked specific to the early Mak11-associated complexes (for instance Dbp7) from those that were also present on later Rlp24 or Nog1-associated pre-60S particles (for instance Mak5). Except for known shuttling factors that are exported to the cytoplasm, the estimation of the point where other factors leave the particles would need further validation by specific experiments.</p><p>Our analysis provides new insights into the assembly scenario for the eukaryotic large ribosomal subunit in yeast, by describing the protein composition of distinct assembly intermediates along the pathway. The results were in excellent correlation with the topology of the network of physical association of pre-60S factors. Proteins that were enriched or decreased in precursor particles under mutant conditions were clustered in specific regions of the graph, depending on the analysed protein depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, C and D). Our results are also in agreement with previously published data about the pre-60S factors function or association to the pre-ribosomal complexes. For instance, Dbp7, Dbp9, Nop4, Noc2, Rpf2, Ebp2, Rrp1 and Ssf1 were known for their participation in early steps of the large ribosomal subunit biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38 B39 B40 B41 B42">38&#x02013;42</xref>), and Rrp5 is a component of the SSU-processome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Nug1 was characterised for its functions in the late steps of biogenesis, at the same time as Nog2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and Arx1 are both involved in the export of pre-60S particles from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of the analysis of three distinct 60S biogenesis steps (depending on Ebp2, Nog1/Nsa2 and Nog2) we were thus able to obtain an unbiased panorama of the association timing for 30 pre-60S factors during ribosome biogenesis. These results, integrated into the physical association map for all the previously identified pre-60S proteins, and combined with data about the molecular function of each pre-60S factor in the biogenesis, are useful to build a view of protein dynamics in the ribosome biogenesis pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn469/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkn469_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkn469_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkn469_2.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkn469_3.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkn469_4.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkn469_5.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkn469_6.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to Fran&#x000e7;oise Stutz (Centre M&#x000e9;dical Universitaire, Gen&#x000e8;ve, Switzerland) for the pFA6a-TAP-Tag-His3MX6 vector.
