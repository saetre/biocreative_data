In the budding yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content>, the transcription factor Ace2 accumulates specifically in the daughter cell nucleus, where it drives transcription of genes that are not expressed in the mother cell. The NDR/LATS family protein kinase Cbk1 is required for Ace2 segregation and function. Using peptide scanning arrays, we determined Cbk1&#x02032;s phosphorylation consensus motif, the first such unbiased approach for an enzyme of this family, showing that it is a basophilic kinase with an unusual preference for histidine &#x02212;5 to the phosphorylation site. We found that Cbk1 phosphorylates such sites in Ace2, and that these modifications are critical for Ace2&#x02032;s partitioning and function. Using proteins marked with GFP variants, we found that Ace2 moves from isotropic distribution to the daughter cell nuclear localization, well before cytokinesis, and that the nucleus must enter the daughter cell for Ace2 accumulation to occur. We found that Cbk1, unlike Ace2, is restricted to the daughter cell. Using both in vivo and in vitro assays, we found that two critical Cbk1 phosphorylations block Ace2&#x02032;s interaction with nuclear export machinery, while a third distal modification most likely acts to increase the transcription factor's activity. Our findings show that Cbk1 directly controls Ace2, regulating the transcription factor's activity and interaction with nuclear export machinery through three phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, Cbk1 exhibits a novel specificity that is likely conserved among related kinases from yeast to metazoans. Cbk1 is functionally restricted to the daughter cell, and cannot diffuse from the daughter to the mother. In addition to providing a mechanism for Ace2 segregation, these findings show that an isotropically distributed cell fate determinant can be asymmetrically partitioned in cytoplasmically contiguous cells through spatial segregation of a regulating protein kinase.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Cells can differentiate by segregating molecules that direct expression of specific sets of genes to one of the two cells produced by division. This generally occurs by direct mechanical movement or asymmetric anchoring of these molecules, which act after division to influence gene expression. In this study, we define a different mechanism by which the budding yeast transcription regulator Ace2 is asymmetrically partitioned. We show that Ace2 moves from uniform distribution to strong accumulation in the daughter nucleus while mother and daughter cells are still connected, and that the enzyme Cbk1 directly controls this segregation by attaching phosphate to specific sites on Ace2. We also demonstrate that Cbk1 is restricted to the daughter cell. Using both biochemical and live-cell experiments, we show that the Cbk1-mediated modifications activate Ace2 and block its interaction with nuclear export machinery, trapping it in the daughter cell nucleus. In addition to demonstrating Cbk1&#x02032;s remarkable biochemical similarity to related enzymes in multicellular organisms, our analysis shows that a uniformly distributed regulator of gene expression can be made asymmetrically active in connected cells through the direct action of a localized modifying enzyme.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A conserved protein kinase, Cbk-1, produces different gene expression programs in cytoplasmically connected cells by directly blocking nuclear export of the transcription factor Ace2.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Mazanka E, Alexander J, Yeh BJ, Charoenpong P, Lowery DM, et al.

In the next cell cycle, Prospero translocates to the GMC nucleus, where it regulates transcription of GMC-specific genes. In budding yeast, daughter cells are prevented from switching mating types by the asymmetrically segregated transcriptional repressor Ash1. This partitioning also depends on the actin cytoskeleton: <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA is transported by a class V myosin to the bud tip during mitosis and tethered to the daughter cell cortex.

Destruction of this septum occurs from the daughter side. This asymmetry is due to a daughter-specific transcriptional program driven by the transcriptional activator Ace2, which accumulates specifically in the daughter cell nucleus and induces expression of enzymes involved in septum degradation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b013">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

The transcription factor first localizes faintly to both mother and daughter nuclei, then accumulates to high levels exclusively in the daughter nucleus at the end of mitosis. The timing of this accumulation relative to cytokinesis is uncertain. Ace2&#x02032;s nuclear import is likely blocked by mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation of sites near its nuclear localization sequence (NLS) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;: this inhibition is presumably reversed when CDK phosphorylations are removed by the phosphatase Cdc14 during mitotic exit.

Loss of nuclear export results in symmetric Ace2 accumulation in both mother and daughter nuclei, indicating that the transcription factor is isotropically distributed in mother and daughter cells and that its asymmetry is probably not due to selective import in the daughter cell nucleus or degradation in the mother cell nucleus.</p><p>Ace2 is controlled by a conserved signaling pathway termed the Regulation of Ace2 and Morphogenesis (RAM) network &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Cells lacking RAM network function fail to separate, growing as large clusters of cells connected by the primary septum between mother and daughter cells. This separation defect is the result of failure to segregate and activate Ace2 in daughter cells and thus a lack of expression of the Ace2 target genes required for septum destruction. It is unclear how the RAM network promotes the daughter-specific segregation and activation of Ace2.</p><p>Cbk1, a protein kinase of the broadly conserved NDR/LATS family &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, is a critical component of the RAM network.

However, the identity and functional significance of Cbk1 phosphorylation sites within Ace2 are unknown.</p><p>In this study, we sought to understand how Cbk1 controls Ace2. We used an unbiased approach to elucidate the kinase's phosphorylation consensus motif and find a distinctive specificity that is likely conserved in related kinases across large evolutionary distances. This motif identified three Cbk1 phosphorylation sites within Ace2 that are crucial for the transcription factor's asymmetric distribution and function. Our in vivo and in vitro analyses of the functional significance of these sites indicate that Cbk1 phosphorylation controls Ace2 in two distinct ways: by directly blocking its interaction with nuclear export machinery and by enhancing its activity as a transcription factor. We also found that Cbk1 promotes Ace2 segregation well before cytokinesis and that the kinase is functionally partitioned to the daughter cell, allowing it to phosphorylate Ace2 and generate asymmetry from an initially isotropically distributed pool of the transcription factor.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ace2 Shifts from Isotropic to Asymmetric Distribution Prior to Cell Division; Nuclei Must Enter the Daughter Cell for Accumulation to Occur</title><p>Ace2 is initially cytoplasmically distributed in both mother and daughter cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, and it is therefore possible that its partitioning reflects specific regulation of the transcription factor in the daughter cell following cytokinesis. We determined whether Ace2 accumulates in the daughter cell nucleus before or after cytoplasmic separation of the dividing cells by time-lapse microscopy, comparing localization of Ace2 and the actomyosin ring component Myo1 tagged with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins.

Remarkably, we found that Ace2 localizes to daughter cell nuclei significantly prior to cytokinesis, as determined by the disappearance of Myo1 from the bud neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060203-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).

Therefore, the dividing nucleus must enter the daughter cell for nuclear retention of Ace2 to occur, and the form of Ace2 that localizes to the nucleus cannot diffuse from daughter to mother cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ace2 Retention in Daughter Nuclei Does Not Require DNA Binding</title><p>Ace2 accumulates strongly and equally in both mother and daughter nuclei when nuclear export is globally blocked &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

These findings show that Ace2 is initially isotropically distributed in the mother and daughter cells and that elevating its intranuclear concentration increases expression of Ace2 target genes; they suggest that the transcription factor might be regulated through control of its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.</p><p>Our results illuminate the mechanism by which Cbk1 controls Ace2&#x02032;s activity and asymmetric localization. Early in the cell cycle, Cbk1 accumulates at the cortex of the daughter cell, where it participates in bud morphogenesis. Upon mitotic exit, the kinase is then enabled to interact with and phosphorylate Ace2 in the daughter cell. We found that Cbk1 phosphorylates Ace2 at three functionally important sites, producing two distinct regulatory effects on the transcription factor. Phosphorylation of amino acids within the Ace2 NES (S122 and S137) block its interaction with the exportin Crm1 and promote its retention in the daughter nucleus; our in vitro studies exclude the possibility that phosphorylation promotes recruitment of an accessory factor or distal inhibitory domain of Ace2. This direct control of NES function is likely a general mechanism for regulation of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling: although not determined with fully purified components, phosphorylation of sites in the cyclin B1 NES likely blocks exportin binding &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Modification of an additional site proximal to the DNA-binding domain (S436) may play a role in enhancing transcriptional activity.</p><p>These distinct regulatory inputs appear to act in parallel to produce a more sharply defined gene expression response. Phosphorylation of Ace2&#x02032;s NES allows it to accumulate to high levels in the daughter cell nucleus. These NES modifications are required for Ace2 partitioning, but they are not fully necessary for induction of Ace2-responsive genes. The <italic>ace2-2A</italic> allele lacking these phosphorylation sites retains the ability to induce target genes due to the presence of the S436 phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060203-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Similarly, the S436 site is not necessary for Ace2 function when the NES phosphorylation sites are present, as seen in the <italic>ace2-S436A</italic> allele, indicating that accumulation of large amounts of Ace2 in the nucleus can still drive expression of target genes, albeit at a reduced level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060203-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Conversely, nuclear localization is not sufficient for full function: cell separation and activation of <italic>DSE1</italic> transcription remain partially compromised in a mutant that accumulates in both mother and daughter nuclei, but cannot be phosphorylated at S436 (<italic>ace2-F127V-3A</italic>). Thus, both regulatory inputs by Cbk1 phosphorylation are important for Ace2 distribution and function.</p><p>Remarkably, Cbk1-mediated accumulation of Ace2 in the daughter cell nucleus occurs significantly before cytokinesis. This regulation exemplifies a distinct system for partitioning an otherwise isotropically distributed transcription factor in cells that remain cytoplasmically contiguous. Nuclear localization of Cbk1 requires Ace2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;; therefore, we propose that Cbk1 phosphorylates Ace2 in the daughter cell cytoplasm, and the proteins enter the nucleus as a complex. The mechanism that restricts activation of Ace2 by Cbk1 to the daughter cell remains unclear. We propose two plausible models. One possibility is that a barrier at the bud neck restricts diffusion of cytoplasmic proteins between mother and daughter cells: although GFP exchanges rapidly between mother and daughter cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, the mobility of larger complexes has not been investigated. Therefore, Ace2 might diffuse freely between mother and daughter cells, whereas the Ace2-Cbk1 complex that forms in the daughter cell might not pass through the bud neck. Alternatively, regulatory proteins that antagonize the Ace2-Cbk1 interaction could be localized at or near the bud neck, establishing a steep activation gradient between mother and daughter cells. We previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of Cbk1&#x02032;s CT motif following mitosis is not necessary for its kinase activity, but is critical for its ability to regulate Ace2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, and reversal of this modification by phosphatases concentrated near the bud neck could allow for spatial control of Cbk1 function. A similar effect may be achieved by dephosphorylation of Ace2 at the bud neck.</p><p>Our findings also reveal a remarkable evolutionary conservation of substrate specificity in NDR/LATS family kinases: basic phosphorylation motifs with a marked preference for His at the &#x02212;5 position. Using this motif, we were able to identify critical Cbk1 phosphorylation sites in Ace2 and demonstrated that Cbk1 can phosphorylate sites in which either Lys or Arg are present at the &#x02212;3 or &#x02212;2 positions. The Cbk1-related <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinase Warts/Lats has recently been shown to phosphorylate the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki) at sequences that match the Cbk1 consensus motif to regulate nuclear localization &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, human LATS1 phosphorylates the mammalian Yki ortholog YAP at these consensus sequences &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. In Ace2, modification directly blocks interaction with the exportin Crm1, while phosphorylation of Yki recruits a 14-3-3 protein that antagonizes nuclear import &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060203-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the yeast and metazoan kinases have inverse functional output: Cbk1 promotes nuclear accumulation of a transcription factor, whereas Warts/LATS acts to suppress it. Despite this difference, regulation of Ace2 by Cbk1 should provide important insight into regulation by this highly conserved family of protein kinases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains and plasmids.</title><p>All strains generated and used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060203-t001">Table 1</xref>.
