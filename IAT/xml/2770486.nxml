We propose that canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways have complementary roles in HCC, where the canonical signaling contributes to tumor initiation, and noncanonical signaling to tumor progression.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an epithelial cancer that originates from hepatocytes or their progenitors. It is the fifth most frequent neoplasm worldwide (&#x0003e;500,000 deaths/year), and its incidence is steadily increasing in the West [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Hepatocellular carcinoma is graded into four stages as well-differentiated, moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated and undifferentiated tumors, respectively. HCC arises as a very well differentiated cancer and proliferates with a stepwise process of dedifferentiation. Indeed, well-differentiated histology is exclusively seen in early stage and is rare in advanced HCC. Well-differentiated and moderately differentiated HCC cells are morphologically similar to hepatocytes, and are distinguished only by their smaller size and architectural organization as irregular trabecular or pseudoglandular patterns. In contrast, poorly differentiated and undifferentiated HCC cells are characterized with scanty cytoplasms and pleomorphism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Like in other epithelial tumors, in HCC the progenitors evolve during tumor progression and become more and more autonomous. In this process, the tumor cells change their morphology and behavior; they loose cuboidal shape and polarity, and become more independent from neighboring tissues. Finally, they acquire the capacity to invade the underlying tissue and form distant metastases. These morphological changes are usually associated with progressive loss of biochemical and morphological features of hepatocytes, hence the process is qualified as "dedifferentiation" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Portal venous invasion is significantly associated with poorly differentiated and undifferentiated HCCs and the tumor invasiveness is the most crucial factor in determining the long-term outcome for the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Molecular changes involved in HCC dedifferentiation and invasiveness are known only partially. Epithelial markers such as hepatocyte nuclear factors and E-cadherin were reported to be down-regulated in HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and their loss is closely related to tumor invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In contrast, mesenchymal cell markers such as snail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], twist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and vimentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] display positive correlation with HCC invasiveness and/or metastasis. These changes have been considered to represent the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC, based on in vitro studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4&#x003b1; (Hnf-4&#x003b1;) is essential for morphological and functional differentiation of hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and its expression is downregulated during HCC progression in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. HCC dedifferentiation process is associated with a progressive accumulation of genomic changes including chromosomal gains and losses, as well as p53 mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. A rare exception to this picture is the status of the <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>gene that encodes &#x003b2;-catenin, a key component of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin (canonical Wnt) signaling pathway.</p><p>Independent studies showed that &#x003b2;-catenin mutations are associated with a subset of low grade (well-differentiated) HCCs with a favorable prognosis and chromosome stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Among 366 unifocal HCCs studied by Hsu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], &#x003b2;-catenin mutations were associated with grade I histogoly. Another study with similarly high number of tumors (n = 372) also indicated that mutant nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin correlated positively with non-invasive tumor and inversely with portal vein tumor thrombi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, &#x003b2;-catenin mutations were associated with significantly better 5-year patient survival in these large cohorts. Direct study of canonical Wnt signaling activity in primary tumors is not possible. However, this can be studied indirectly by using target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Using glutamine synthetase (encoded by canonical Wnt signaling target <italic>GLUL </italic>gene) as a sensitive and specific marker, Audard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] showed that 36% HCCs displayed canonical Wnt activation. These tumors exhibited significant features associated with well-differentiated morphology. The association of &#x003b2;-catenin mutation and nuclear translocation with well-differentiated tumor grade was also reported during hepatocellular carcinogenesis, using several transgenic mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Activation of &#x003b2;-catenin was most frequent in liver tumors from c-myc and c-myc/TGF-&#x003b2;1 transgenic mice. However, it was very rare in faster growing and histologically more aggressive HCCs developed in c-myc/TGF-&#x003b1; mice. Taken together, these studies suggest that nuclear translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin and activation of canonical Wnt signaling are early events in liver carcinogenesis, mostly affecting well-differentiated HCCs.</p><p>Mutations of &#x003b2;-catenin gene initially identified in colorectal cancers, cause constitutive activation of canonical Wnt signaling, as a result of aberrant &#x003b2;-catenin protein accumulation. Inactivating mutations of APC gene in colorectal cancer and AXIN1 in HCC also activate canonical Wnt signaling by the same mechanism. Therefore, tumors displaying &#x003b2;-catenin, APC or AXIN1 mutation are considered to display active or constitutive canonical Wnt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] Activation of canonical Wnt signaling appears to be a common event for colorectal cancer, as opposed to HCC with mutations limited to a subset of these cancers. Interestingly, transgenic mice expressing oncogenic &#x003b2;-catenin in hepatocytes develop only hepatomegaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], in contrast to intestinal polyposis and microadenoma when expressed in intestinal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, published data indicate that Wnt pathway and &#x003b2;-catenin mutations may play a complex role in HCC. Close association of &#x003b2;-catenin mutation with low tumor grade suggests that canonical Wnt signaling has a dual role in HCC cells, depending on their differentiation state. As an initial attempt to characterize differentiation-dependent functions of Wnt pathway and canonical Wnt signaling in HCC, we used a panel of HCC-derived cell lines. We first performed gene expression and in vitro cell migration analyses to classify HCC cell lines into two distinct subtypes. The first subtype that we named here as "well-differentiated" was formed by epithelial cell lines with limited motility and invasiveness. Mesenchymal-like cell lines that have lost their epithelial-, hepatocyte-like features clustered into a second subtype named as "poorly differentiated". Next, we compared these two subtypes for the expression of 45 Wnt pathway genes, as well as for the activity of canonical Wnt signaling. Our findings provided evidence for the constitutive activation of canonical Wnt signaling in well-differentiated, but not in poorly differentiated cell lines. We also report the upregulation canonical Wnt3 ligand in the majority of HCC cell lines. Canonical Wnt8b was selectively expressed in well-differentiated cell lines. In contrast, noncanonical Wnt4, Wnt5a, Wnt5b and Wnt7b ligands were expressed selectively in poorly differentiated HCC cell lines. In addition, ectopic expression of noncanonical Wnt5a inhibited canonical Wnt signaling in two different cell lines. Our findings support the differential involvement of canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling in HCC, depending on tumor cell differentiation state.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Classification of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines into "well-differentiated" and "poorly differentiated" subtypes</title><p>Fuchs et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] have recently classified HCC cell lines into "epithelial" and "mesenchymal" types based on E-cadherin and vimentin expression. We performed a similar analysis using our cell line panel. Initially, we analyzed 15 cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The expression of &#x003b1;-fetoprotein (AFP) was limited to six cell lines (Huh7, Hep40, HepG2, Hep3B, Hep3B-TR, PLC/PRF/5); the other cell lines being either not expressing (SNU182, SNU387, SNU398, SNU423, SNU449, SK-Hep1, Mahlavu, FOCUS) or weakly expressing (SNU475). All AFP-positive (AFP+) cell lines also expressed E-cadherin, whereas only 3/9 (33%) of AFP- cell lines expressed this epithelial marker. Mesenchymal cell markers including vimentin, slug, snail, twist-1 and twist-2 were also positive in most AFP- cell lines. These markers also displayed weakly positive expression in some AFP+ cell lines. For confirmation, we performed immunocytochemical analysis of vimentin protein expression in five AFP+ and five AFP- cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We observed strong and homogenous immunostaining with all five AFP- cell lines. In contrast AFP+ cell lines were either negative or displayed heterogeneously positive immunoreactivity. These findings suggested that all AFP+ HCC cell lines were epithelial-like based on E-cadherin expression, but they also expressed some mesenchymal cell markers at variable degrees. In contrast, AFP- cell lines were usually negative for E-cadherin, and most of them were strongly positive for mesenchymal cell markers. The expression patterns of these mesenchymal markers showed marked heterogeneity. For example, SNU182 was positive for all five markers tested, whereas FOCUS was positive only for vimentin expression.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression analysis of a-fetoprotein (AFP), E-cadherin and five mesenchymal cell markers in HCC cell lines</bold>.

HNF-4&#x003b1; and its downstream target HNF-1&#x003b1; are best known hepatocyte-associated epithelial cell markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These two genes that are involved in liver development and hepatocyte specification have previously been identified as specific markers for HCC cells with well-differentiated function and morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The expression of these HNFs displayed perfect correlation with the expression of AFP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>): four AFP+ cell lines (Huh7, Hep3B, HepG2, Hep40) were also highly positive for both HNF-4&#x003b1; and HNF-1&#x003b1;. In contrast, seven AFP- cell lines (SNU398, SNU475, SNU449, SNU387, FOCUS, Mahlavu, SNU182) did not express these factors. SNU449, another AFP- cell line displayed only weak HNF-4&#x003b1; expression. Epithelial cells including hepatocytes show low motility, in contrast to mesenchymal cells that display high motility and invasive behavior. To test whether epithelial and mesenchymal gene expression patterns of HCC cells correlated with their in vitro motility, we used wound-healing assay. After 24 hours of wounding, AFP- HCC cells (Mahlavu, SNU449, SNU475, SNU182) moved through the wound, whereas AFP+ HCC cells (Huh7, Hep3B, Hep G2, Hep40) cells did not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>; Hep40 and SNU182 data not shown).

We qualified the remaining seven cell lines (SNU398, SNU475, SNU449, SNU387, FOCUS, Mahlavu, SNU182) as "poorly-differentiated" HCC cell lines, based on the lack of expression of both hepatocyte lineage and epithelial cell markers analyzed here. In addition, these poorly differentiated cell lines shared many features with mesenchymal cells including the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, slug, snail, twist-1, and twist-2), high motility and invasiveness.

From the group of eight known canonical Wnt ligands, only Wnt3 was strongly and uniformly expressed in all cell lines tested.

First, with the exception of Wnt ligands, most of the major components of Wnt signaling pathway were expressed redundantly in HCC cell lines, independent of their differentiation status. In contrast, Wnt ligand expression displayed two types of selectivity. First, out of eight known canonical only Wnt3 and Wnt10b displayed strong expression in most cell lines, independent of differentiation status. Second, out of seven noncanonical Wnt ligands, four were expressed in HCC cell lines with a high selectivity for poorly differentiated ones. Well-diffferentiated cell lines displayed selective expression of Wnt8b. These findings may have several implications. Most, in not all HCC cell lines were equipped with an autocrine/paracrine canonical Wnt signaling system, as reported previously for breast and ovarian cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In contrast, because of selective expression of noncanonical Wnt ligands, only poorly differentiated cell lines could serve from an autrocrine noncanonical Wnt signaling system. In addition, poorly differentiated HCC cells could also provide noncanonical Wnt signals to other cells by a paracrine mechanism. Finally, noncanonical Wnt ligands such as Wnt5a might inhibit canonical Wnt signaling in HCC cells, as previously reported in other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Autocrine canonical Wnt signaling in well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines</title><p>Canonical Wnt signaling activates TCF/LEF-dependent transcription, which can be monitored by reporters containing TCF/LEF-responsive elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. We surveyed canonical Wnt signaling in HCC cell lines using TCF/LEF reporter pGL3-OT plasmid, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].

This data supports the hypothesis that well-differentiated HCC cells display an autocrine/paracrine canonical Wnt signaling, probably because they co-express Wnt3 and several canonical Frizzled receptors.

Alternatively, canonical Wnt signaling could be repressed in these cell lines. A number of proteins downstream to &#x003b2;-catenin such as Axin2, HTLE family, hAES, Chibby, CTBP and ICAT are known to display inhibitory activity on canonical Wnt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].

Transfection with S33Y-&#x003b2;-catenin resulted in an increase in total &#x003b2;-catenin protein in Huh7 and SNU449. This increase was less evident in SNU182 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10a</xref>). Well-differentiated Huh7 cells responded to S33Y-&#x003b2;-catenin expression by a strong activation of TCF/LEF reporter (130 folds). Under the same experimental conditions, the response of SNU449 cells was minimal (5 folds). More importantly, SNU182 cells were totally unresponsive (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10b</xref>). These important differences between well-differentiated Huh7 and two different poorly differentiated cell lines (SNU449 and SNU182) are apparently not due to differences in transient transfection efficiencies, since the measured activities have been corrected for such differences (see material and methods section).</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p><bold>Ectopic expression of mutant &#x003b2;-catenin induces high canonical Wnt activity in well-differentiated, but not in poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma cells</bold>.

N-terminally truncated &#x003b2;-catenin forms are frequently detected in cancer cells including HCC cells. They lack Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites (aa Ser23, Ser29, Ser33, Ser37, Thr41, Ser45) that are critically involved in its ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and they accumulate in the cell nucleus leading to oncogenic activation canonical Wnt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11a</xref>, SNU449-cl8 cells expressed only wild-type &#x003b2;-catenin in the presence of tetracycline (Tet-on conditions), while expressing both wild-type and truncated &#x003b2;-catenin at comparable levels in Tet-off conditions. The induced expression of truncated &#x003b2;-catenin resulted in only a weak activation (3-4 fold) of TCF reporter activity, similar to data obtained by transient transfection experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11b</xref>). This low level of activation was similar to that seen in well-differentiated HCC cells in the absence of &#x003b2;-catenin or Axin-1 mutation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8b</xref>), and strongly suggests that canonical Wnt signaling is actively repressed in this poorly differentiated HCC cell line. For comparison, well-differentiated HepG2 cells expressing wild-type and a similar N-terminally truncated &#x003b2;-catenin (&#x00394;25-140 aa) activated TCF reporter gene by more than 60-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a</xref>). In other words, although both Tet-off SNU449-cl8 and HepG2 cells displayed a heterozygous truncating &#x003b2;-catenin mutation, TCF activation was 15-fold less in poorly differentiated SNU449 background. To test whether this repression was related to cellular localization of &#x003b2;-catenin, we performed immunofluorescence detection using confocal microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11c</xref>). Wild-type &#x003b2;-catenin was localized at the cell membrane with weak nuclear localization. The induction of truncated &#x003b2;-catenin in Tet-off SNU449-cl8 cells did not change this distribution significantly. We observed only weak cytoplasmic accumulation, with slight increases in both membrane and nuclear localization.

Therefore, we tested the effect of ectopic Wnt5a expression on mutant-&#x003b2;-catenin-induced TCF activity in Huh7 cell line.

A large set of Wnt ligands and a large array of receptors are implicated in different cell processes by initiating canonical, but also noncanonical Wnt signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The antagonism between canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Thus, both &#x003b2;-catenin and Wnt signaling are involved in highly complex cellular events of which only some are mediated by canonical Wnt pathway. This complexity is also observed during liver development and as well as in adult liver homeostatic events. Canonical Wnt signaling contributes to liver growth and regeneration, but also to liver "zonation" by controlling some liver-specific metabolic programs. ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]). In addition, it contributes to the activation of liver stem or progenitor cells, as well as HCC-initiating cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>Mutational activation of canonical Wnt signaling is not a frequent event in HCC, in contrast to hepatoblastoma displaying very high rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Mutations of &#x003b2;-catenin were restricted to a group of HCCs associated with low p53 mutation rate, negative HBV status and chromosomal stability, as stated earlier. These mutations were also associated with lower histological grade and better patient survival. Unexpectedly, &#x003b2;-catenin mutations are rare in more advanced and poorly differentiated HCCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, although considered to play an active role in HCC malignancy, the activation of canonical Wnt signaling may not be necessary for, or even repressed in advanced HCCs. Thus, &#x003b2;-catenin mutation and constitutive activation of canonical Wnt signaling may be differentiation-dependent events with mechanistic implications in HCC initiation and progression. We attempted to address this issue by using HCC-derived cell lines.</p><p>We first classified 11 HCC cell lines into "well-differentiated" and "poorly differentiated" subtypes using hepatocyte lineage, epithelial and mesenchymal cell markers, and in vitro migration assays. Well-differentiated HCC cell lines shared many features with hepatocytes such as expression of HNF-1&#x003b1;, HNF-4&#x003b1;, and E-cadherin, and epithelial morphology. Poorly differentiated cell lines were usually deficient in the expression of hepatocyte lineage and epithelial markers, but they expressed different mesenchymal markers strongly. These two types of HCC cell lines were also distinguished from each other by their in vitro behaviors. Poorly differentiated cell lines were usually more motile and more invasive than well-differentiated cell lines (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). A global expression profiling study classified HCC cell lines in Group I and Group II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Our well-differentiated and poorly differentiated cell line subtypes showed perfect correlation with Group I and Group II, respectively. Well-differentiated Group I was characterized by the activation of oncofetal promoters leading to increased expression of AFP and IGF-II, whereas poorly differentiated Group II was characterized by overexpression of genes involved in metastasis and invasion. Our well-differentiated and poorly differentiated subtypes were also in perfect correlation with respectively epithelial and mesenchymal HCC cell line types that have been identified very recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Mesenchymal cancer cells are considered as the products of EMT that is believed to be a key mechanism for the acquisition of invasive and metastatic capabilities by tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Higher motility of poorly differentiated HCC cell lines reported here is in line with this concept. Thus, our two classes of cell lines share many similarities with well-differentiated and poorly differentiated HCC tumors. We used this model to compare the status of Wnt pathway according to HCC differentiation status.</p><p>A comprehensive analysis of Wnt signaling components in liver or hepatocytes is lacking. However, the expression of Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptors in mouse hepatocytes has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Mouse hepatocytes expressed canonical receptors Fzd7 and Fzd9, as well as noncanonical Fzd2, Fzd3, Fzd4 and Fzd6. We observed highly similar pattern of expression in HCC cell lines with the exception of Fzd9 that showed weak expression. In addition, we detected increased expression of canonical Fzd1 and Fzd5 in most HCC cell lines. The expression frequency of these receptors was not associated with HCC cell differentiation status. Mouse hepatocytes expressed canonical Wnt1 and Wnt2, and noncanonical Wnt4, Wnt5a, Wnt5b and Wnt11. All or most HCC cell lines have lost the expression of canonical Wnt1 and Wnt2, but they displayed increased expression of canonical Wnt3 and Wnt10b ligands. Another canonical ligand, Wnt8b was expressed selectively in well-differentiated cell lines. In contrast, noncanonical Wnt4, Wnt5a and Wnt5b ligands were expressed in the majority of poorly differentiated cell lines, but not in most of well-differentiated cell lines. In addition, most HCC cell lines (poorly differentiated cell lines in particular) also displayed increased expression of noncanonical Wnt7b. Among Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptors that we found to be expressed or upregulated in HCC cell lines, Wnt3, Wnt4, Wnt5a, Fzd3, Fzd6 and Fzd7 have been previously reported to be overexpressed also in primary HCC tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Overexpression of Wnt10b was also reported in HCC cels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Increased levels of Wnt5a transcripts were detected in chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. A C-terminally mutated HBV X protein was shown to upregulate Wnt5a expression in HCC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Thus, Wnt5a upregulation observed in clinical samples might be related to HBV at least in HBV-related liver diseases. Based on our observations that associate noncanonical Wnt ligand expression to poorly differentiated HCC cell lines, it will be interesting to test the predictive value of noncanonical Wnt expression for HCC prognosis.</p><p>Another important finding of this study is the differential activity of canonical Wnt signaling in different HCC subtypes. Well-differentiated cell lines displayed active canonical Wnt signaling at variable degrees. In addition to strong signaling activity associated to &#x003b2;-catenin and Axin1 mutations in two well differentiated cell lines, we also observed autocrine canonical Wnt signaling in two other well differentiated cell lines, as reported for some other cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The functional significance of autocrine canonical Wnt signaling in these cell lines is not known.</p><p>However, small molecule antagonists of Tcf4/beta-catenin complex were shown to inhibit TCF reporter activity and down-regulate the endogenous Tcf4/&#x003b2;-catenin target genes c-Myc, cyclin D1, and survivin in Huh7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. This observation strongly suggests that the autocrine canonical Wnt signaling is functional in well-differentiated HCC cell lines. Canonical Wnt signaling has been linked to both stem cell and cancer cell self-renewal in other cancer types. It was proposed that some adult cancers derive from stem/progenitor cells and that canonical Wnt signaling in stem and progenitor cells can be subverted in cancer cells to allow malignant proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Indeed, well-differentiated-HCC cell lines identified here such as HepG2, Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 have been reported to harbor HCC stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]</p><p>Our third noteworthy observation was the lack of detectable canonical Wnt signaling activity in six out of seven poorly differentiated cell lines. Even a poorly differentiated cell line with a deleterious Axin1 mutation (SNU475) lacked detectable signaling activity. Thus, most probably, the canonical Wnt signaling was not only inactive, but also repressed in poorly differentiated HCC cell lines. In confirmation of this expectation, transient or Tet-regulated expression of mutant &#x003b2;-catenin failed to generate significant canonical Wnt signaling activity in two different poorly differentiated cell lines. Furthermore, we linked this weak activity to poor nuclear accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin protein in SNU449.cl8 cell line. Thus, unlike well-differentiated cell lines, poorly differentiated HCC cells displayed strong resistance to canonical Wnt signal activation.</p><p>The mechanisms of resistance to canonical Wnt signal activation in poorly differentiated HCC cells are presently unknown. We provide here one potential mechanism. Wnt5a has been previously implicated in canonical Wnt signaling as an antagonist and regulator of &#x003b2;-catenin levels in other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Using both ectopic and endogenous mutant &#x003b2;-catenin expression systems in two different cell lines, we demonstrated that co-transfections with Wnt5a-expressing plasmid can significantly inhibit canonical Wnt signaling in HCC cells. The mechanism of Wnt5a antagonism on canonical Wnt signaling in HCC cells is not known. In breast cancer cells, the loss of Wnt5a signaling resulted in stabilization of nuclear beta-catenin and expression of Wnt/beta-catenin target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. However, both ectopically and endogenously expressed mutant &#x003b2;-catenins used in our experiments were N-terminally truncated devoid of their Ser/Thr phosphorylation motifs. Thus, Wnt5a appears to inhibit canonical Wnt signaling in HCC cells, downstream to &#x003b2;-catenin, independent of its glycogen synthase 3-&#x003b2;- and bTrCO-dependent degradation. Wnt5a has been shown to inhibit canonical Wnt signaling either by bTrCP-independent proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], or, by downregulating &#x003b2;-catenin-induced reporter gene expression without influencing &#x003b2;-catenin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] in kidney epithelial cells. Wnt5a may use similar mechanisms in Huh7 and HepG2 cells. Further studies with downregulation of noncanonical Wnt ligands in poorly differentiated HCC cell lines may help to better define the implications of such ligands in liver cancer biology.</p><p>The role of Wnt5a in cancer is complex. It may play tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressing functions depending on cellular context. Wnt5a has been described as a tumor promoter in melanoma, gastric, pancreas, prostate cancer, but as a tumor suppressor in HCC, neuroblastoma, leukemia, colon, and thyroid cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The inability of Wnt5a to transform cells or signal through the canonical &#x003b2;-catenin pathway pointed that it cannot promote tumorigenesis by upregulation of canonical Wnt signaling, unlike canonical Wnt ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Our results suggest that Wnt5a, upregulated in poorly differentiated highly motile mesenchymal-like HCC cells may play a role in tumor progression by inducing EMT. Upregulation of Wnt5a expression during EMT has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Furthermore, the Wnt5A/Protein kinase C pathway was shown to mediate motility in melanoma cells via of an EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Similarly, CUTL1-upregulated Wnt5a significantly enhanced migration, proliferation and invasiveness in pancreas cancer cellls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. These effects were accompanied by a marked modulation of marker genes associated with EMT. Wnt5a may promote EMT in HCC cells by a similar mechanism.</p><p>The expression status of Wnt5a in HCC is not well known. To our knowledge, only one report addressed this issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Compared to normal tissue, Wnt5a mRNA expression was strongly induced in HCC, as well as in chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. However, immunostaining of Wnt5a protein showed a bell-shaped pattern: low to undetectable levels were present in normal tissue and in tumor samples, whereas strong immunostaining was seen in chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and dysplastic liver cells. The reasons of the discrepancy between transcript and protein expression in HCC tissues are not known presently. However, it appears that peritumoral liver tissues express high levels of Wnt5a protein that could trigger noncanonical Wnt signaling in adjacent tumor cells. It will be important to further investigate the role of Wnt5a in HCC tumor progression.</p><p>Taken together, our studies demonstrate that canonical Wnt activity is active in well-differentiated, but repressed in poorly differentiated HCC cell lines. This correlates with in vivo tumor studies indicating that &#x003b2;-catenin mutations are prevelant in well-differentiated, but not in poorly differentiated tumors. In addition, we showed that poorly differentiated cell lines express noncanonical Wnt ligands such as Wnt5a acting as an antagonist of canonical Wnt signaling. Thus, it appears that HCC cells may activate or repress their canonical Wnt signaling, using autocrine/paracrine systems based on selective use of canonical and noncanonical Wnt ligands.</p><p>We hypothesize that the active canonical Wnt signaling observed in well-differentiated HCC cells contributes to tumor initiation, but not necessarily to tumor progression. Instead, noncanonical Wnt signaling may be used by poorly differentiated HCC tumors to promote cell motility and invasion. Selective use of canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling at different stages may be a key mechanism involved in hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Recent studies showed that canonical Wnt signaling contributes to the self-renewal and expansion of HCC-initiating cells with stem/progenitor cell features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. However, the lack of HCC development in &#x003b2;-catenin transgenic mice strongly suggests that canonical Wnt signaling activation has limited tumorigenic potential in liver tissue. Indeed, recent studies showed that canonical Wnt signaling plays a major role in the specification of mature hepatocytes for perivenous-specific gene expression ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Such a hepatocyte differentiation function of canonical Wnt signaling may not be compatible with cellular dedifferentiation that goes along with HCC development. Therefore, alternative pathways such as Wnt5a-mediated noncanonical Wnt signaling may be necessary for sustained growth and progression of HCC tumors. Melanoma may serve as a demonstrated model to our hypothesis. Similar to HCC, canonical Wnt signaling activation is an early event and nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation is associated with better patient survival in melanoma. Nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin is lost in more aggressive melanomas that express Wnt5a that promotes EMT, cell motility and metastasis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Chien et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>] have recently demonstrated that canonical Wnt signaling induces growth inhibition and differentiation in melanoma cells, whereas Wnt5a can antagonize some of these effects. These findings clearly establish a dual function of Wnt signaling in melanoma. In light of these recent developments, our findings call for further investigations on respective roles of canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling in HCC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our observations support the hypothesis that Wnt pathway is selectively activated or repressed depending on differentiation status of HCC cells. We propose that canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways have complementary roles in HCC, where the canonical signaling contributes to tumor initiation, and noncanonical signaling to tumor progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines Huh7, Hep40, Hep3B, Hep3B-TR, FOCUS, Mahlavu, SNU182, SNU 387, SNU 398, SNU423, SNU 449, SNU 475, PLC/PRF/5, SK-Hep-1, hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 and colorectal cancer cell line SW480 were cultivated as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis</title><p>Total RNAs were extracted from cultured cells using NucleoSpin RNA II Kit (MN Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
