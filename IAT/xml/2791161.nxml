Proteins with HECT domains have been described to function as ubiquitin ligases, and those that contain RCC1-like domains have been reported to function as GTPases regulators. These two activities are essential in a number of important cellular processes such as cell cycle, cell signaling, and membrane trafficking. Mutations affecting these domains have been found associated with retinitis pigmentosa, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and cancer. In humans, six <italic>HERC</italic> genes have been reported which encode two subgroups of HERC proteins: large (HERC1-2) and small (HERC3-6). The giant HERC1 protein was the first to be identified. It has been involved in membrane trafficking and cell proliferation/growth through its interactions with clathrin, M2-pyruvate kinase, and TSC2 proteins. Mutations affecting other members of the HERC family have been found to be associated with sterility and growth retardation. Here, we report the characterization of a recessive mutation named <italic>tambaleante</italic>, which causes progressive Purkinje cell degeneration leading to severe ataxia with reduced growth and lifespan in homozygous mice aged over two months. We mapped this mutation in mouse chromosome 9 and then performed positional cloning. We found a G&#x021d4;A transition at position 1448, causing a Gly to Glu substitution (Gly483Glu) in the highly conserved N-terminal RCC1-like domain of the HERC1 protein. Successful transgenic rescue, with either a mouse BAC containing the normal copy of <italic>Herc1</italic> or with the human <italic>HERC1</italic> cDNA, validated our findings. Histological and biochemical studies revealed extensive autophagy associated with an increase of the mutant protein level and a decrease of mTOR activity. Our observations concerning this first mutation in the <italic>Herc1</italic> gene contribute to the functional annotation of the encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase and underline the crucial and unexpected role of this protein in Purkinje cell physiology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The cerebellum is a coordination center whose function is to fine-tune vertebrates' gait and balance; and for this reason, alterations or damage affecting this structure result in a complex syndrome, called ataxia, with neurological signs that are easily recognized. In the mouse, many mutations producing ataxia have been identified and characterized. They have contributed to a better understanding of the genetics of cerebellum development, physiology, and pathology. The present study identifies the recessive allele responsible for the progressive and massive degeneration of the Purkinje cells observed in mutant mice previously named <italic>tambaleante</italic>. The mutation leads to a single amino acid substitution in a highly conserved domain (RCC1-like) of the giant protein HERC1. This protein belongs to the families HECT (E3 ubiquitin ligases) and RCC1 (GTPases regulators). While a variety of mutations have been reported in several members of these families, leading to sterility, growth retardation, retinitis pigmentosa, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or cancer, no mutation had ever been reported so far in the mouse <italic>Herc1</italic> gene. This report demonstrates the crucial and unexpected role of HERC1 in Purkinje cell physiology that could be considered helpful in the development of new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cerebellum plays the role of a coordination centre, integrating peripheral sensory information on movement and position of the body parts to fine-tune gait and balance. Structural or functional alterations of this part of the central nervous system result in a complex syndrome, called ataxia, which is characterized by neurological signs that are clinically obvious in most species including the mouse. Many such mutations, either of spontaneous origin or resulting from strategies of genetic engineering performed <italic>in vitro</italic>, have been studied in detail in this species that, synergistically with human studies, have allowed advancement of our understanding of the developmental mechanisms generating the uniquely complex mature cerebellum.</p><p>In this publication, we report the positional cloning of an autosomal recessive mouse mutation, called <italic>tambaleante</italic> (symbol <italic>tbl</italic>; meaning staggering in Spanish), which is precisely characterized by a severe ataxic syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000784-Wassef1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000784-Rossi1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Mice homozygous for this mutation (<italic>tbl/tbl</italic>) exhibit an unstable gait, abnormal hindlimb posture and tremor. All these phenotypic characteristics correlate with a progressive degeneration of Purkinje cells (PCs) starting by two months of age. <italic>tbl</italic> mice thus represent a model of recessively inherited ataxia with progressive neurodegeneration of PCs. Using a combination of genetic, histological and biochemical approaches, we have been able to characterize the pathology of this mutation that we could relate to a mutation in the gene encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC1.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Characterization of the <italic>tambaleante</italic> mutation</title><p>The <italic>tambaleante</italic> (<italic>tbl</italic>) mutation arose spontaneously in the DW/JPas inbred substrain, at the Institut Pasteur, and appeared to be inherited as an autosomal recessive condition with complete penetrance. The most remarkable phenotypic feature of homozygous (<italic>tbl/tbl</italic>) mice was an unstable gait, with abnormal hind limb-clasping reflex, which became really obvious from two months of age and worsened with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000784-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000784.s003">Video S1</xref>).

RCC1-like domains (RLD) seem more versatile and may have a role in guanine nucleotide exchange on small GTP-binding proteins, in enzyme inhibition and in interaction with proteins and lipids. Proteins containing some of these domains are important regulators of cellular processes such as cell cycle, cell signalling and membrane trafficking. HERC1 protein was the first protein of this family to be identified.

With this guess in mind, we first analyzed whether the levels of the TSC1-TSC2 complex and mTOR protein were modified in the brain of <italic>Herc1<sup>tbl</sup>/Herc1<sup>tbl</sup></italic> mice. We found that the levels of these proteins remained normal in these animals suggesting that the mutant HERC1 protein does not affect their stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000784-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). We then checked whether the mTOR activity was modified, and to achieve this, we analyzed the phosphorylation of a substrate of the mTORC1 activity, the ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). We observed a decrease of the phosphorylation of S6K1 at threonine 389 (P-T389-S6K1) in brain of <italic>Herc1<sup>tbl</sup>/Herc1<sup>tbl</sup></italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000784-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).

Altogether these data suggest that autophagy is induced in <italic>tbl/tbl</italic> mice. An attractive hypothesis would be that this activation is the cause of PC death in the <italic>tambaleante</italic> mice. This however is difficult to ascertain because an increase in autophagy is also a protective mechanism for cells in response to stressing stimuli. To determine whether this was the case or not, we analyzed the occurrence of autophagy at an earlier phase of the PC degeneration; in 2-month-old <italic>Herc1<sup>tbl</sup>/Herc1<sup>tbl</sup></italic> cerebellum. Double labeling with antibodies against anti-calbindin D28-k and lysosome-associated membrane protein LAMP-1 allowed us to identify lysosomes with large cytoplasmic accumulations in dendrites and somata being particularly numerous in regions of the cerebellar cortex which had lost the calbindin D28-k expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000784-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). Electron microscopy also performed on 2-month-old mice showed that PC bodies contained numerous autophagosomes (vacuoles with double membrane and filled with cytoplasmic organelles) and autolysosomes (vacuoles with a single membrane and filled with larger inclusions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000784-g007">Figure 7F&#x02013;7H</xref>). Altogether these data show that activation of autophagy in <italic>Herc1<sup>tbl</sup>/Herc1<sup>tbl</sup></italic> mutant mice is indeed the earliest pathological process that seems to be involved in the degeneration and death of PCs. This high degree of autophagy is unique to the <italic>Herc1<sup>tbl</sup></italic> mutation and has never been reported before for any other cerebellar mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000784-Dusart1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Genes of the <italic>Herc/HERC</italic> family are absent in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes such as fungi and plants.

The HERC1 giant protein, which was the first to be identified in a screening looking for human oncogenes, contains several domains (one HECT, two RLDs, seven WD40 repeats and one SPRY) involved in protein ubiquitilation, guanine nucleotide exchange and protein-protein or protein-lipid interaction. This structure probably reflects the multiple interactions of this protein with other cellular proteins. HERC1 interacts with phosphoinositides and with several other proteins such as clathrin, ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), M2-pyruvate kinase and TSC2 and, through these interactions it has been involved in membrane trafficking, cell growth and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000784-Rosa1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000784-GarciaGonzalo1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000784-Rotin1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The Gly483Glu substitution that we found in <italic>tambaleante</italic> mice, which is located within the highly conserved RLD1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000784-g003">Figure 3D&#x02013;3E</xref>), presumably alters the structure of the HERC1 protein and very likely impairs its functions as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000784-GarciaGonzalo1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000784-Hadjebi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Impairment of HERC1 function through the mTOR pathway could explain the neuronal degeneration and the smaller size observed in <italic>tambaleante</italic> mice. Since mTOR has been reported to be a negative regulator of autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000784-Inoki1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, a decrease of its activity would indeed correlate with an increase of autophagy observed in the PCs of <italic>tambaleante</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000784-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Although future studies are required to understand the precise role of HERC1, we can however conclude that HERC1 has a profound impact in the animal growth and the maintenance of the cerebellum structure.</p><p>A consensus is emerging among molecular geneticists stressing that a missense mutation, affecting only one site of a multidomain protein, is sometimes of better value for gene annotation than a knockout allele that, in general, suppresses at once the protein. In the case of <italic>Herc1<sup>tbl</sup></italic> the situation may be more complex. If the Gly483Glu amino acid substitution has an effect on the protein structure, then one may expect heterozygous mice to be affected to some extent. This however does not seem to be the case since, as far as we could observe from those <italic>Herc1<sup>tbl</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic> breeders that we kept for more than one year, we never noticed any symptoms in their gait or behaviour that would have been evocative of a pathology of the central nervous system (CNS). We did not conduct any observation at the histological level on these mice but it is not sure that this would have been of great value if we consider that a decrease in PCs number seems to be a common observation in mice heterozygous for most mutations affecting the cerebellum (<italic>nr</italic>, <italic>Rora<sup>sg</sup></italic>, <italic>Agtpbp1<sup>pcd</sup></italic> and <italic>Reln<sup>rl</sup></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000784-Dusart1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Testing began at 4 weeks of age and was conducted until week 12 to follow the progression on each phenotype. In brief, animals were trained a constant speed (16 rpm) for 60 s. The animals were put on the rotarod until the latency to fall off reached the total time of 60 s. Each mouse was placed on the rotarod with its head in the direction of rotation and so had to turn to the opposite direction. We performed three trials per day with 2&#x02013;6 min intervals, on three consecutive days. During the pauses between the turns, mice were allowed to rest in their home cages. After training, mice were evaluated once at 6, 8 and 12 weeks of age at a constant speed of 12 rpm until the latency of fall reached 1 min. The percentage (&#x00025;) of animals that stayed for 60s is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000784-g005">Figure 5</xref>. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000784-g001">Figure 1</xref>, each mouse had three trials per test with an intertrial interval of 5 minutes. Mice (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4 to 9) were placed on the rotating drum at 20 rpm and the time the animal stayed on the rotarod without falling off was measured.
