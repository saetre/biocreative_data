Soluble complement inhibitors such as factor H (fH) also recognize apoptotic cells to minimize the pro-inflammatory effects of downstream complement activation. We used four radiolabeled protein constructs that span different regions of the 20 complement control protein (CCP) modules that make up fH and found that fragments comprising CCPs 6&#x02013;8, CCPs 8&#x02013;15, and CCPs 19&#x02013;20 but not CCPs 1&#x02013;4, bound to apoptotic Jurkat T cells. There are four possible ligand types on apoptotic cells that could recruit fH: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and DNA. We found that CCPs 6&#x02013;8 of fH bind to annexin-II, a trypsin-insensitive protein that becomes exposed on surfaces of apoptotic cells. The second ligand of fH, which interacts with CCPs 6&#x02013;8 and 19&#x02013;20, is DNA. Confocal microscopy showed co-localization of fH with antibodies specific for DNA. fH also binds to histones devoid of DNA, and CCPs 1&#x02013;4, 6&#x02013;8, and 8&#x02013;15 mediate this interaction. Treatment of apoptotic cells with neuraminidase, chondroitinase, heparitinase, and heparinase did not change fH binding. Treatment of apoptotic cells with phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> dramatically increased both binding of fH and cell-surface DNA. We also excluded the possibility that fH interacts with lysophospholipids using surface plasmon resonance and flow cytometry with lipid-coated beads. Identification of annexin-II as one of the fH ligands on apoptotic cells together with the fact that autoantibodies against annexin-II are found in systemic lupus erythematosus provides further insight into understanding the pathogenesis of this disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Apoptosis</kwd><kwd>DNA</kwd><kwd>Histones</kwd><kwd>Immunology/Innate Immunity</kwd><kwd>Annexin-II</kwd><kwd>Complement</kwd><kwd>Factor H</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is an essential constituent of immune system homeostasis assuring &#x0201c;silent&#x0201d; and non-inflammatory clearance of cells. It is characterized by cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic and nuclear chromatin condensation, intranucleosomal &#x0201c;ladder-type&#x0201d; DNA fragmentation, and membrane blebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Furthermore the asymmetric distribution of membrane lipids changes: phosphatidylserine (PS)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> that is normally exclusively present in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane translocates to the outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and cardiolipin, which is mostly confined to the mitochondrial membrane, appears on the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide in the plasma membrane also accompanies apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). During apoptosis the profile of cell-surface molecules changes in that molecules normally absent on the cell surface become exposed, whereas others disappear. Some of these changes induce phagocytosis of apoptotic cells either directly or via extracellular bridging molecules.</p><p>Complement is a central part of the innate immune system. Besides its classic functions such as opsonization of pathogens, generation of inflammatory mediators, and cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), its role in the recognition and removal of apoptotic and necrotic cells is of significant importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). C1q, the initiator molecule of the classic complement pathway, and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) that activates the lectin pathway, both bind to dying (apoptotic and necrotic) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Binding of C1q and MBL leads to opsonization and facilitation of phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The alternative complement pathway is activated directly by properdin bound to dying cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), and it also acts as the amplification loop for the classic and lectin pathways. A balance between activation and inhibition of complement is essential, because both erroneous/excessive as well as missing/decreased complement activation contribute significantly to the pathology of many diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Therefore, it is no surprise that a whole set of fluid-phase and membrane-bound inhibitors exist that tightly regulate the system. We showed previously that both major fluid-phase complement inhibitors, factor H (fH) of the alternative pathway and C4b-binding protein (C4BP) of the classic and lectin pathways, bind to apoptotic and necrotic cells, and limit complement activation by these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This allows the binding of C1q/MBL and a certain degree of complement activation but prevents overt inflammation. C4BP binds to dying cells mainly via protein S with which it forms a tight complex and thus binds to the PS that appears on the surface of dying cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The one or more ligands for fH on apoptotic cells on the other hand are, as yet, unknown.</p><p>fH, a 155-kDa glycoprotein, is one of the most abundant human plasma proteins (&#x0223c;550 &#x003bc;g/ml). It is composed of 20 complement control protein (CCP) domains, of which the four N-terminal CCPs contain the complement regulatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and the C-terminal two CCPs mediate surface binding and target recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The facts that fH does not bind to live Jurkat T cells and its binding increases with the degree of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) indicate that the fH ligand becomes exposed on the cell surface during the apoptotic process. Apoptotic cells that are not removed efficiently undergo secondary necrosis, a pro-inflammatory and pro-immunogenic event that can lead to the development of autoimmune diseases. It is therefore of great importance to understand which surface changes result in fH binding with the concomitant prevention of the generation of anaphylatoxins and membrane attack complexes but retention of opsonization and phagocytosis.</p><p>In this study we searched for fH ligands on apoptotic cells. We found at least three ligands for fH on apoptotic cells: DNA, histones, and the phospholipid-binding protein annexin-II, which has recently been suggested as a fH-binding partner in a mouse ischemia/reperfusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Cells and Induction of Cell Death</title><p>Jurkat T cells (ATCC) were grown in RPMI media containing glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (all from Invitrogen).

To analyze whether the additional ligands are proteins, we treated cells with trypsin. Trypsin cleaves peptide chains at the carboxyl side of the amino acid residues lysine and arginine, but these are not accessible in all surface proteins. Hence some proteins are not removed from the plasma membrane after trypsinization.

Neither BEL (an inhibitor of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent type VI PLA<sub>2</sub>, iPLA<sub>2</sub>), nor MAFP (a general PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor) significantly decreased the binding of fH to apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> we show that fH interacts with DNA on the apoptotic cell surface. Therefore, we investigated whether PLA<sub>2</sub> treatment renders more DNA-positive cells by staining for surface DNA with an antibody against dsDNA. A dramatic increase of DNA-positive cells was observed after the PLA<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>D</italic>).</p><p>To also explore the putative interaction of fH and lysophospholipids, we used liposome-coated Dynabeads, flow cytometry, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR, Biacore). For both methods liposomes containing distinctive compositions of phospholipids and/or lysophospholipids were analyzed (100% PC, 10% PS, 10% LysoPS, and 3, 10, and 20% LysoPC), and no binding of fH to any of the tested liposomes was detected, using neither liposome-coated Dynabeads in flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>) nor SPR (data not shown). For the SPR experiments an L1 chip was coated with PC-based liposomes of varying composition (100% PC, 10% PE, 10% PS, 30% PE and PS, 3&#x02013;60% LysoPC, 60% LysoPE, and 10&#x02013;60% LysoPS), and fH was injected over the lipid surface as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Under the same conditions C4BP bound strongly to a chip surface containing 10% PS (data not shown). By flow cytometry we also investigated binding of fH to PC liposomes containing 10% (data not shown) and 30% ceramide, sphingomyelin, and cardiolipin without detecting any interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>B</italic>). A liposome was constructed to resemble a plasma membrane of apoptotic neutrophils (24:27:13:20:8:8 molar ratio of PC/PE/PS/sphingomyelin/ceramide/cardiolipin), with small adjustments from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), but fH binding was not detected. The slight increase in fH binding to all tested compositions of liposome-coated Dynabeads was caused by the use of strongly labeled fH. When the liposome resembling apoptotic neutrophils was preincubated with annexin-II or histones, a clear binding of fH could be detected to the liposome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). Taken together, these data suggest that sPLA<sub>2</sub> causes changes in membrane structure or morphology resulting in an increased number of DNA-expressing cells. This resulted in an increased fH binding; furthermore this binding did not seem to be mediated by lysophospholipids. Addition of annexin-II or histones was, however, enough to associate fH to an apoptotic plasma membrane-like liposome.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8.</label><caption><p><bold>fH only binds to liposomes in the presence of annexin-II or histones.</bold><italic>A</italic>, AF488-labeled fH was incubated for 30 min at 37 &#x000b0;C with liposome-coated Dynabeads containing distinctive compositions of phospho- and/or lysophospholipids; the binding was analyzed using flow cytometry gating on the bead population (DPH<sup>+</sup>). <italic>B</italic>, binding of AF488-labeled fH to ceramide (<italic>Cer</italic>), sphingomyelin (<italic>Sph</italic>), cardiolipin (<italic>Card</italic>), and liposomes intended to resemble an apoptotic neutrophil plasma membrane (with some modifications) with the molar ratio of 24:27:13:20:8:8 for PC/PE/PS/sphingomyelin/ceramide/cardiolipin (<italic>Apo</italic>). <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>, the liposome resembling an apoptotic neutrophil (<italic>Apo</italic>) was incubated with annexin-II (<italic>C</italic>) or histones (<italic>D</italic>) followed by AF488-labeled fH.

We showed previously that fH, one of the main fluid-phase complement inhibitors, binds to apoptotic cells to protect them from excessive complement activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Blocking of fH binding to apoptotic cells resulted in increased opsonization with C3b and C9 as well as an increase in lysis by human serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), suggesting that fH retains its complement inhibitory activity when bound to apoptotic cells. Interactions between fH and C3b, heparin, C-reactive protein, cell surface glycosaminoglycans, and microbial virulence factors have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), but the ligand for fH on the surface of apoptotic cells has not yet been discovered. Here we further characterize the binding of fH to apoptotic cells and describe for the first time three of the ligands expressed on the surface of dying cells that interact with fH.</p><p>We first investigated which of the 20 CCP domains of fH are involved in the interaction with apoptotic cells. CCPs 1&#x02013;4 are known to contain the site responsible for both decay acceleration and factor I cofactor activities. CCPs 1&#x02013;4 also contain one of the major binding sites for C3b, the other being located in CCPs 19 and 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). We revealed that CCPs 1&#x02013;4 do not mediate binding to apoptotic cells, which is in agreement with our previous observation that fH binds equally well to apoptotic cells in the presence and absence of serum and hence is not C3b-mediated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). We found that CCPs 6&#x02013;8, 8&#x02013;15, and 19&#x02013;20 of fH all contain sites involved in interaction with apoptotic cells, suggesting that more than one cell-surface ligand is involved. Interestingly we found that sites within CCPs 6&#x02013;8 and 19&#x02013;20 are also involved in binding of fH to necrotic cells, whereas CCPs 8&#x02013;15 do not appear to participate in this interaction. Therefore it seems that the ligand on apoptotic cells recognized by a site within CCPs 8&#x02013;15 is either absent or obscured on the surface of necrotic cells. In general, we found binding of fH to necrotic cells is stronger than to apoptotic cells, as has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). We used double staining with AV and Via-probe to discriminate between apoptotic cells (AV<sup>+</sup> Via-probe<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and those entering post-apoptotic necrosis (AV<sup>+</sup> Via-probe<sup>+</sup>) to exclude the possibility that the binding observed in a heterogeneous apoptotic cell population is mediated exclusively through the small population of late apoptotic/necrotic cells (data no shown).</p><p>We found that the calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein annexin-II is one of the fH ligands on apoptotic cells. Annexin-II is expressed in many different cell types and exists both in the cytosol and in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Annexin-II is responsible for communication between cellular membranes and the cytoplasmic environment. It also plays a role in membrane trafficking and remodeling of the membrane cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). The serum protein, &#x003b2;2 globulin, has been proposed to bind endothelial cells through annexin-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Like apoptotic cells, mature macrophages also express PS on their surface, which is a prerequisite for adequate phagocytosis. Interestingly, annexins I and II are thought to function as bridging molecules serving both as ligands and receptors in promoting phagocytosis through their interactions with PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). The relevance of the role of annexin-II in pathology is unclear, but autoantibodies against annexin-II have been found in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Annexin-II has recently been identified as an fH binding partner in a mouse ischemia/reperfusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The authors hypothesized that annexin-II directs fH to ischemic renal cells and mediates their protection. In ischemia/reperfusion many cells die, and therefore this study is in good accordance with our observation that annexin-II becomes expressed on the surface of human apoptotic cells and functions there as a ligand for fH. We established that annexin-II is translocated to the surface of Jurkat T cells upon induction of apoptosis. We also showed that annexin-II is insensitive to digestion of cells with trypsin, which is in accordance with our current observation that incubation of apoptotic cells with trypsin does not affect binding of fH. We also revealed that annexin-II alone is capable of recruiting fH to an apoptotic plasma membrane-like structure. Thus, annexin-II appears to be an important fH ligand on surfaces of apoptotic cells due in part to its interaction with a binding site within CCPs 6&#x02013;8. CCP 7 harbors the common single-nucleotide polymorphism Y402H, which affected the affinity of CCPs 6&#x02013;8 for annexin-II. Because the binding of CCPs 6&#x02013;8 to annexin-II was lower than that of full length fH, it remains possible that there are additional binding sites for annexin-II in fH that are not covered by the recombinant fragments tested in the current study.</p><p>The site of interaction with annexin-II lies within CCPs 6&#x02013;8 of fH, and therefore we searched for additional ligands that could bind to sites within CCPs 15&#x02013;18 and 19 and 20. Glycosaminoglycans, represented by heparin, are known to bind several of the fH CCPs that we identified as interacting with dying cells in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). On the other hand, we found that digestion of apoptotic cells with specific enzymes that degrade various classes of GAGs or remove sialic acid had no effect on binding of fH even though we could detect a 70% decrease of sialic acid recognized by <italic>S. nigra</italic> lectin. Moreover the removal of GAGs and sialic acid did not seem to affect complement activity on the apoptotic cells. Interestingly, heparan sulfate has been reported to be down-regulated during the course of apoptosis in Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), which supports the hypothesis that heparan sulfate is unlikely to be an fH ligand on apoptotic cells. This does not, however, contradict the important role played by fH interactions with negatively charged carbohydrates on living, normal cells that do not display the high affinity surface ligands found on apoptotic cells.</p><p>We have observed previously that CCPs 6&#x02013;8 of fH interact with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In the current study we confirmed this result and extended it with the observation that DNA also binds to CCPs 19 and 20. Surprisingly, CCPs 1&#x02013;4, which bind C3b, did not interact with DNA despite the fact that they display a large patch of positively charged amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). The fH DNA interaction could also be detected in the presence of NHS. In a hemolytic assay adopted from J&#x000f3;zsi <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), we did not observe any effect of DNA at physiological concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>) on fH regulatory functions or binding of fH to sheep erythrocytes while these cells were lysed in the presence of CCPs 19 and 20 (which competes with full-length fH) as expected (data not shown). Apoptotic cells paradoxically expressed stronger binding of fH after treatment with DNase. This could imply that DNase treatment does not in fact remove DNA molecules from the surface of apoptotic cells but rather makes the DNA more accessible, perhaps by exposing more DNA fragments through their partial release from histones. This is supported by the observation that DNase treatment also enhances binding of anti-DNA antibodies. Confocal microscopy provided evidence for co-localization of fH and DNA on apoptotic cells. It appears that DNA translocated to the surface of apoptotic cells is still wound around nucleosomes on the basis that DNA, individual core histones, histone-DNA complexes, and the native nucleosome core particles can all be detected on the surface of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Therefore we also hypothesized that the increased fH binding that we observed upon DNase treatment could be due in part to interaction of fH with histones. In support of this, we showed that DNA-free histones isolated from Jurkat cells bound fH. Interestingly, all fH ligands identified on apoptotic cells so far, annexin-II, DNA, and histones bind with differential affinities to two common polymorphic variants of fH (Tyr-402 and His-402) located in CCPs 6&#x02013;8 and associated with a propensity to develop age-related macular degeneration.</p><p>Phospholipids, particularly those found specifically on apoptotic cells, represented another potential ligand class for fH. Treatment of cells with PLA<sub>2</sub> caused a significant increase of fH binding, implying that lysophospholipids may bind fH. A similar observation was previously reported for IgM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), but, in that case, the binding was also sensitive to treatment with PLD, which was not observed in the case of fH. We used two different methods to investigate whether there is direct interaction between fH and lysophospholipids: liposome-coated beads from sonicated liposomes for flow cytometric analysis and sensor-chip L1 covered with extruded liposomes for SPR analysis. In both systems we found no significant interaction of fH with PS, PC, and PE or with their lysophospholipid form in various combinations and concentrations. We used both synthetic lipids as well as those isolated from natural sources with the same negative results. If lysophospholipids were involved in binding of fH to apoptotic cells, binding should be decreased by treatment with the intracellular phospholipase inhibitors MAFP and BEL. These inhibitors also have pro-apoptotic properties. We analyzed cells in which apoptosis had been induced in the presence of MAFP, and BEL, but detected no significantly reduced fH binding. Therefore, we suggest that lysophospholipids are not involved in binding of fH. The great increase in fH binding caused by PLA<sub>2</sub> could be explained by the increase in DNA-expressing cells after such treatment. Creation of lysophospholipids also disrupts the membrane. This may give the cell a more necrotic profile, which might explain the increase of cell-surface DNA.</p><p>Oxidation of liposomes with myeloperoxidase in SPR did not result in binding to any of the tested phospholipids and lysophospholipids (data not shown). General oxidation of apoptotic cell surfaces has been reported as an important step for recognition by phagocytes. However, no increase in fH binding could be observed after oxidation of live and apoptotic cells with myeloperoxidase (data not shown). Finally, we could not detect any interaction of fH with cardiolipin, sphingomyelin, and ceramide that are known to be exposed on apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Despite the extensive repertoire of lipids used in this study, we cannot completely rule out all phospholipids or lysophospholipids as potential ligands to fH. However, the evidence so far suggests that lipids are unlikely to be ligands for fH on apoptotic cells.</p><p>Taken together, we have identified annexin-II, DNA, and histones as three fH ligands found on cell surfaces during the course of apoptosis. Additional fH ligands may exist on apoptotic cells, but it is unlikely that these are lipids, trypsin-sensitive proteins, or GAGs. Furthermore, involvement of fH and annexin-II in the clearance of apoptotic cells and their role in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus should be a subject of further studies.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research, the Foundations of &#x000d6;sterlund, Kock, King Gustav V's 80th Anniversary, Knut and Alice Wallenberg, and Inga-Britt and Arne Lundberg, and research grants from the University Hospital in Malm&#x000f6;.
