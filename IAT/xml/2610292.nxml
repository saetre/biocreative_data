Therefore, understanding the role of molecular chaperones in facilitating rod opsin biogenesis and the response to mutant rod opsin is important for retinal disease and fundamental retinal cell biology. A recent report has shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> rhodopsin Rh1 requires calnexin (Cnx) for its maturation and correct localization to R1&#x02013;6 rhabdomeres. In this report, we investigate the role of Cnx in the processing of wild-type and mutant mammalian rod opsin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from control mice (WT) and mice that express a truncated dysfunctional version of Cnx (sCnx) were used to assess the role of Cnx in the biogenesis, maturation, degradation, and aggregation of mutant and wild-type rod opsin. The mutant P23H rod opsin was used as a prototypical class II misfolding mutant as it is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is either degraded by ER associated degradation (ERAD) or forms aggregates that coalesce to form intracellular inclusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Wild-type rod opsin protein translocated normally to the plasma membrane in both cell lines. In contrast, P23H rod opsin was retained in the ER in both cell lines. The only difference observed in rod opsin processing between the WT and sCnx MEFs was a small increase in the incidence of P23H intracellular inclusions in the sCnx cells. This did not appear to be specific for rod opsin, however, as non-rod opsin-expressing sCnx cells also had an increased incidence of ubiquitylated inclusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data show that, unlike <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rh1, mammalian rod opsin biogenesis does not appear to have an absolute requirement for Cnx.

Rhodopsin is formed from the rod opsin protein and the chromophore 11<italic>-</italic>cis<italic>-</italic>retinal. Mutations in rod opsin were first described in 1990 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>] and are the most common cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP; OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=180380">180380</ext-link>). Over 120 point mutations in rod opsin have now been identified (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sph.uth.tmc.edu/RetNet/">Retnet</ext-link>). Heterologous expression of rod opsin in mammalian cell culture and transgenic animal studies have been used to characterize many of these mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. These studies have revealed two major classes of rod opsin mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Class I mutants at the C-terminus of the protein fold normally but are not correctly targeted to the outer segment, whereas class II mutants in the intradiscal and transmembrane domains cause protein misfolding, resulting in retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), degradation, and aggregation. Therefore, it is important to investigate the biogenesis, quality control, and degradation of normal and mutant rod opsin to design therapies for ADRP and enhance our understanding of GPCR biology.</p><p>The biogenesis and quality control of multispanning membrane proteins like rod opsin occurs at the ER. Certain steps in this pathway and the potential involvement of molecular chaperones have been discussed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. The highlights of this process include binding of the rod opsin signal sequence to the signal recognition particle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>] directing the ribosome and the growing polypeptide to the ER membrane. This signal sequence is not cleaved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>], and opsin inserts in the ER cotranslationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>].</p><p>Upon insertion into the ER membrane the N-terminal intradiscal domain of mammalian rod opsin is N-glycosylated at Asn<sub>2</sub> and Asn<sub>15</sub> by the oligosaccharyl transferase enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Most glycoproteins use their glycan chains for correct folding and oligomeric assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]; however, inhibition of glycosylation by tunicamycin suggests mammalian rod opsin does not require glycan chains for correct folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, an intact carbohydrate unit for mammalian rod opsin is not essential for its chromophoric properties or for its regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. In contrast, the class II rod opsin mutant P23H requires glycan chains for efficient degradation via endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD). Mutant rod opsin accumulation in the ER, observed upon tunicamycin treatment, has revealed a glycan independent quality control mechanism that prevents the mutant protein from escaping the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>].</p><p>Glycan chains render nascent glycoproteins substrates for resident lectin chaperones of the ER, most notably calnexin (Cnx) and calreticulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. This quality control process ensures that only correctly folded, assembled, and modified proteins are transported along the secretory pathway and is a paradigm of protein folding in the ER that includes other folding facilitators such as ERp57, which associates with lectin chaperones Cnx and calreticulin to catalyze glycoprotein disulphide formation/isomerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. The membrane association of a nascent glycoprotein will determine whether it will associate with Cnx, calreticulin, or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>].</p><p>Cnx holds a central role in the folding of many glycoproteins in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Elegant genetic studies performed with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of mammalian rod opsin, Rh1, have revealed a requirement for Cnx in its maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Mutations in <italic>Drosophila Cnx</italic> led to severe defects in Rh1 expression, whereas other photoreceptor cell proteins were expressed normally, suggesting a specific requirement by Rh1 for this lectin chaperone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rh1 has two putative N-glycosylation sites at Asn<sub>20</sub> and Asn<sub>196</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>] found on the extracellular domain of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. Site-directed mutagenesis of these residues led to the accumulation of Rh1 protein within the ER and retinal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. Therefore, there appears to be clear differences between Rh1 and mammalian rod opsin in the requirement for glycosylation during processing. In this study we have investigated if these differences are reflected by a divergence in the need for Cnx in rod opsin biogenesis.</p><p>Mice congenitally deficient in the expression of the <italic>Cnx</italic> gene have been previously produced and phenotyped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. The homozygous <italic>Cnx</italic>-deficient embryos were carried to full term; however, about 50% died within 2 days after birth and the remainder developed severe motor disorders which led to premature death. A second <italic>Cnx</italic>-deficient mouse strain was generated by an unexpected recombination event, which expressed a truncated Cnx protein (sCnx) resulting from the deletion of a selectable marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. The truncated <italic>Cnx</italic> gene had lost exons 4, 5, and 6, and the protein product was about 15&#x000a0;kDa smaller than the full-length Cnx protein. The deleted region included cysteine residues involved in disulphide bond formation and residues that form the glucose bonding pocket, for binding of monoglucosylated glycoproteins. Unfortunately, the retina was not included in the phenotyping of the <italic>Cnx</italic> null or sCnx mice, and these animals are no longer available for study. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), derived from wild-type (WT) and sCnx mice have been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Replacement of Cnx with sCnx did not affect cell viability or trigger a compensatory upregulation of other ER-resident chaperones such as BiP, PDI, ERp57 or Crt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Importantly, unlike Cnx, sCnx did not associate with newly synthesized glycoproteins; hence, even though sCnx is not a null mutation, and encodes a protein that still targets to the ER, it shows loss of its affinity for glycoproteins, endogenous and transfected, compared to WT MEFs.</p><p>Therefore, we used MEFs derived from WT and sCnx mice to test if Cnx was necessary for the biogenesis and maturation of mammalian rod opsin, as it is for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rh1. The data show that mammalian rod opsin does not appear to require Cnx for normal processing through the secretory pathway or quality control and degradation of mutant rod opsin, but sCnx cells do appear to have general problems with metastable protein folding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>WT and sCnx MEFs were a gift of M.

The localization of WT rod opsin was investigated in WT and sCnx MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). WT and sCnx MEFs were transfected with WT rod opsin fused to GFP at the C-terminus (WT-GFP). The localization of rod opsin was investigated by confocal immunofluorescence using the intrinsic GFP fluorescence. In both cell types WT rod opsin was processed to the plasma membrane with no retention in the ER, indicating that the protein had progressed through the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). There was no morphological difference in the localization of opsin between the two cell lines, hence Cnx appeared to be dispensable for the correct processing of WT opsin in MEFs. DM detergent soluble cell extracts from WT and sCnx cells transfected with untagged WT rod opsin were analyzed by western blotting and revealed no difference in the 1D4 immunoreactive band pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). This confirmed similar processing and glycosylation in WT and sCnx cells. The expression level of WT rod opsin in the sCnx cells, however, was variable and generally lower than in the WT MEFs at equivalent total protein loadings. This corresponded with lower transfection efficiency in the sCnx cells; for example, the transfection efficiency for WT-GFP determined from 4 independent experiments was 27%&#x000b1;11 for the sCnx compared to 44%&#x000b1;22 for the WT MEFs. This did not appear to be rod opsin-specific as similar trends were observed for GFP alone. EndoH and PNGase F digestion of WT rod opsin in soluble cell lysates did not reveal any differences between the WT and sCnx MEFs (data not shown). To test if Cnx may influence the degradation and aggregation of WT rod opsin, WT, and sCnx MEFs were scored for incidence of inclusion formation of WT-GFP.

In contrast, a punctate staining pattern characteristic of multiple intracellular inclusions positive for myc-ubiquitin was revealed upon expression in sCnx MEFs, indicating their enhanced stress susceptibility in the folding of endogenous polypeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). WT and sCnx MEFs were scored for the presence of these inclusions in 3 independent experiments. WT cells had at least one inclusion in 14% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>) of transfected cells while the sCnx MEFs had inclusions in 55% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>) of cells (p&#x0003c;0.05). The presence of an aggregation-prone metastable protein in the sCnx cells could be predicted to result in enhanced aggregation because of reduced chaperone activity within these cells. Hence, we expressed P23H rod opsin-GFP with the myc-tagged ubiquitin and scored cells with ubiquitylated inclusions. In the presence of P23H-GFP, the number of ubiquitylated inclusions increased for both WT and sCnx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>). The WT cells had at least 1 inclusion in approximately 22% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>), whereas the sCnx MEFs had inclusions in 65% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>) of cells (p&#x0003c;0.05). The presence of P23H-GFP led to a 8% increase in inclusion incidences in the WT cells and 10% increase in the sCnx cells (p&#x0003c;0.05), suggesting that the aggregation of mutant opsin caused further imbalance in proteostasis, in agreement with previous reports that P23H rod opsin inhibits the UPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>].</p><fig id="f4" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>sCnx cells have increased ubiquitylated inclusions.

Cnx binding retains nascent glycoproteins in the ER to undergo cycles of folding until correct folding is complete and the protein can exit the ER. If Cnx binding is prolonged, then ERAD may be initiated. As <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rh1 has a requirement for Cnx in its maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>], we tested the involvement of Cnx in the processing of mammalian rod opsin using a Cnx functionally deficient cell line. We did not observe any differences in the processing of rod opsin in WT and sCnx MEFs. WT rod opsin translocated successfully to the plasma membrane of both cell lines; P23H rod opsin was retained in the ER and formed inclusions in WT as well as sCnx cells. The glycoform pattern of WT and P23H rod opsin observed by western blotting was the same in both cell lines. The only significant difference observed was an increase in inclusion formation for P23H rod opsin in the sCnx MEFs. Therefore, the data clearly support the notion that Cnx is a dispensable chaperone in the processing and ERAD of rod opsin, since the WT and mutant proteins are processed similarly in both cell lines, each targeting its corresponding compartment correctly.</p><p>This was not the case for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rh1, however, which requires Cnx for its maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Rh1 in WT flies is localized solely to the rhabdomeres, whereas in Cnx mutant flies Rh1 was detected predominantly in the ER. In a parallel pulse-chase experiment, Rh1 in control flies had matured by 24 h whereas in Cnx mutant flies, Rh1 was initially detected as an immature high MW form that was significantly reduced by 24 h. After 48 h, very little Rh1 was detected, suggesting that most of it had been degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>].</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> Rh1 and mammalian rod opsin appear to show different requirements for chaperones and chromophore during their biogenesis and quality control. Rh1 was discovered to have a requirement for <italic>NinaA</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. Mutant <italic>NinaA<sup>P228</sup></italic> flies were shown to have a severely reduced Rh1 content in R1&#x02013;6 rhabdomeres. Subsequently, NinaA was shown to be a specific peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase class chaperone for the maturation of Rh1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. Rh1 also requires 3-hydroxyretinal to fold correctly. Lack of 3-hydroxyretinal chromophore either by dietary deprivation or mutations in vitamin A-processing enzymes, such as NinaB dioxygenase and NinaG oxidoreductase, leads to very low levels of detectable Rh1 in rhabdomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. Previous attempts to express invertebrate visual pigments in mammalian cells were not successful. For example, <italic>Limulus</italic> opsin expressed in COS1 cells was retained within the ER, aggregated, and did not form a functional pigment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. This was probably as a result of missing factors in the COS1 cells, such as NinaA and NinaG. These additional requirements for Rh1 processing meant that it was not possible to directly compare the Cnx requirement of Rh1 with mammalian rod opsin expression in sCnx MEFs. However, the reciprocal experiment of expressing bovine rod opsin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has suggested that a NinaA-type chaperone for mammalian rod opsin may not be required.</p><p>Ahmad et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>] showed that when bovine rod opsin was expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>,it showed stable expression even in the absence of endogenous Rh1 and chromophore and was correctly targeted to <italic>Drosophila</italic> rhabdomeres. Unlike Rh1, the processing of bovine rod opsin was independent of NinaA and NinaG activity, showing a clear difference in the processing of vertebrate rod opsin compared to the endogenous invertebrate rod opsin. The processing was not perfect, however, as the bovine rod opsin from <italic>Drosophila</italic> rhabdomeres exhibited only high mannose oligosaccharides and not the fully mature Golgi forms. Also bovine rod opsin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> did not to couple to Gq although it could successfully activate Gt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>].</p><p>According to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/">flybase</ext-link>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> has 3 <italic>Cnx</italic> genes, namely CG9906, Cnx 14D, and Cnx 99A. Rosenbaum et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>] identified the cytogenetic locus for the mutant phenotype to 99A7 on <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromosome 3. This locus encodes 4 putative isoforms (A-D). <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cnx99A displays 48.3% amino acid identity with human Cnx, whereas <italic>Drosophila</italic> CG9906 has 50.4% amino acid identity with human Cnx. Therefore, it is not clear which vertebrate form of Cnx would most closely resemble Cnx99A and if this could reflect a specialized invertebrate form of Cnx for Rh1 biogenesis and maturation that is not conserved across species. The Cnx family of molecular chaperones is conserved among plants, fungi, and animals. In mammals there is one major ubiquitous form of Cnx and a tissue-specific form, calmegin, a type-I membrane protein expressed mainly in the spermatids of the testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>]. In addition to Cnx, calreticulin (Crt) is an ER lumenal homolog. Cnx and Crt associate with a wide array of substrates because they bind monoglucosylated <italic>N</italic>-glycans, which are transiently exposed by glycosylated polypeptides expressed in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. However, Cnx and calreticulin were found to associate with distinct sets of polypeptides in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>]. In addition, the study by Pieren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>] addressed this specifically using WT and sCnx MEFs. The authors found that Crt did not acquire novel substrates upon depletion of Cnx activity. Thus, most cellular Cnx substrates remained inaccessible to Crt even in the absence of Cnx activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Therefore, we would not anticipate that Crt would compensate for the loss of Cnx activity in these cells or in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>].There is no evidence, as yet, for a mammalian eye-specific form of Cnx.</p><p>The increased incidence of P23H rod opsin inclusions in sCnx cells is most likely a consequence of the enhanced stress susceptibility of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>], and not to a specific requirement for Cnx in P23H rod opsin degradation or inclusion clearance. This reduced stress tolerance was also reflected in the lower transfection efficiency and protein expression observed on transient transfection of the sCnx cells with rod opsin or GFP. Cnx occupies a central role in the quality control of glycoproteins either to further folding or degradation. The short nonfunctional version of Cnx expressed in sCnx cells would cause problems for the folding of many nascent glycoproteins in the ER. Therefore, the absence of Cnx activity could affect the stability of metastable proteins within the cells. Alterations in proteostasis, either from increased protein misfolding or impaired chaperone activity, can lead to metastable proteins becoming unstable and revealing their aggregation-prone phenotype. This has been shown to be the case in <italic>C. elegans</italic> temperature-sensitive mutants of muscle paramyosin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>]. In this system, expression of an aggregation-prone polyQ protein was sufficient to cause appearance of the mutant phenotype at the permissive temperature. We observed that the sCnx cells had increased levels of ubiquitylated inclusions both in the presence of transfected P23H rod opsin and in its absence, suggesting that the lack of Cnx and associated imbalance of proteostasis led to the aggregation of metastable proteins. Therefore, the increase in P23H inclusions may not reflect a specific requirement for Cnx, but, instead, it could be a consequence of generalized disturbances of proteostasis in the sCnx cells.</p><p>The data highlight that vertebrate rod opsin and Rh1 are different opsins with distinct folding and processing requirements. There are key differences not only in the mechanisms of phototransduction but also in their biogenesis, processing, and photoreceptor organelle. While parallels can be drawn between the two, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> has proved to be an extremely valuable model system, the 2 opsins do not appear to be sufficiently similar to be able to extrapolate findings from one glycoprotein to the other. The mammalian rod photoreceptor encloses a stack of approximately 1,000 flattened disk membranes with 10<sup>4</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>6</sup> molecules of rhodopsin per disk. Daily phagocytosis of outer segments by the retinal pigment epithelium leads to the whole outer segment being renewed every 10 days, requiring the vectorial delivery of millions of rhodopsin molecules each day to the base of the outer segment. Rod opsin is synthesized in the ER and further modified in the Golgi. Hence, it is possible that in response to this huge demand, rod opsin biogenesis has become finely tuned and specialized in mammalian rods by the development of dedicated chaperone proteins. The studies of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rh1 have firmly established the precedent for such dedicated G-protein coupled receptor chaperones, however, the specific chaperone requirements for mammalian rod opsin remain to be identified.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Professor M.
