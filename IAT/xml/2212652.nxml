Using a restriction enzyme qPCR assay (qAMP), DNA methylation analyses were conducted on postnatal primitive type A spermatogonia lacking DNMT3L. Methylation levels along 61 sites across chromosomes 4 and X decreased significantly by approximately 50% compared to the levels observed in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>germ cells, suggesting that many loci throughout the genome are marked for methylation by DNMT3L. More so, hypomethylation was more pronounced in regions of lower GC content than in regions of higher GC content.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, these data suggest that DNMT3L plays a more global role in genomic methylation patterning than previously believed.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>DNA methylation is central to epigenetic control of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In mice, targeted inactivation of DNA methyltransferase genes causes lethality at early embryonic or postnatal stages, emphasizing the importance of DNA methylation in supporting mammalian development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Germ cell development is the first developmental window during which DNA methylation patterns are programmed in mammals. Marked differences are observed between male and female gametes, especially at imprinted loci where allele-specific gene expression in the offspring is dependent on methylation differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The development of a number of human diseases, including Beckwith-Wiedemann, Prader Willi and Angelman syndromes, has been linked to aberrant expression of imprinted genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In the mouse, a major demethylation event takes place in both germ lines between embryonic days (E) 10.5 to 12.5 as primordial germ cells (PGCs) enter the gonads, following which point DNA methylation patterns are reestablished in a sex- and sequence-specific manner as gametogenesis progresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Most information concerning the dynamics of DNA methylation comes from studies done on the control region of imprinted genes and repeat sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the male germ line, methylation acquisition begins before birth, between E15.5 and E18.5. Repetitive elements such as intracisternal A particles (IAPs), long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and satellite sequences have acquired most of their methylation by E17.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although the remethylation of imprinted genes also begins around E15.5, the process is only completed after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A developmental study done on the imprinted gene <italic>H19 </italic>shows that it begins acquiring its methylation between E15.5 and E18.5, but only becomes fully methylated postnatally by the pachytene spermatocyte stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Importantly, since male germ cells continue to undergo DNA replication after birth, they are also capable of maintenance methylation to ensure proper propagation of the patterns already acquired. In contrast, in the female germ line methylation patterns are acquired postnatally during the oocyte growth phase, once DNA has been replicated and pachynema is completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>DNA methylation patterns are created and propagated through the activity of both <italic>de novo </italic>and maintenance DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases (DNMTs). A number of DNMTs have been characterized and are classified according to similarities found in their catalytic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, we are only beginning to understand how these enzymes interact in the germ line to establish and maintain methylation patterns. We have previously shown that the expression of <italic>Dnmt1</italic>, <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>marks windows of sex-specific methylation in both germ lines, and more recently that the expression of <italic>Dnmt3a </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>is tightly regulated in developing male germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Germ cell-specific inactivation of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, but not <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>, impairs the establishment of <italic>de novo </italic>methylation patterns in germ cells, more specifically at imprinted loci, without affecting the methylation status of interspersed repeat sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Targeted inactivation of the DNA methyltransferase 3-Like gene, <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>, also results in methylation defects at imprinted loci in both germ lines and additionally, in male germ cells, at dispersed repeated sequences such as IAPs and LINEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Spermatogenesis is impaired in <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>mutant males due to abnormal synapses between homologous chromosomes resulting in meiotic failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Although DNMT3L shares common motifs with DNMT3a and DNMT3b, it lacks the ability to transfer methyl groups to DNA. Both cell culture studies and <italic>in vitro </italic>biochemical assays have shown that DNMT3L interacts with and stimulates the <italic>de novo </italic>methylation activity of DNMT3a and its isoform DNMT3a2, as well as DNMT3B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Although concomitant expression of <italic>Dnmt3a2 </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>in gonocytes has previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>mutant mouse models have clearly established the importance of this protein to the germ line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], the action of DNMT3L &#x02013; alone or in combination with another DNMT &#x02013; is still not fully understood.</p><p>Spermatogenesis is a complex process by which haploid male germ cells are created. Sperm integrity not only depends on unique processes such as specialized transcription, meiosis and histone-to-protamine replacement, but also on various epigenetic events including DNA methylation reprogramming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Treating male mice with the cytosine analogue 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, an agent that causes genomic hypomethylation, results in testicular abnormalities with decreased sperm counts and fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. A recent study by Marques <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] showed that imprinted gene defects were associated with oligozoospermia in humans, suggesting that proper DNA methylation programming may be required for spermatogenesis to progress normally. Although little is known about the functional requirement(s) of methylation at single-copy or repeat sequences on germ cell proliferation and differentiation, these results suggest a crucial role for DNA methylation in male germ cell development.</p><p>Our analysis here of <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>function in the male germ line revealed a more prominent and developmentally earlier role for this protein during spermatogenesis than was previously reported. Using a <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>gene-inactivation mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], we determine that histological abnormalities were already occurring during the first week of postnatal development. Lower germ cell counts and delayed entry into meiosis were observed in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>males. A thorough developmental study exploring the expression of <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>in both prenatal and postnatal male germ cells showed that, although <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>expression peaked in gonocytes, it was also detected in spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids. Finally, DNA methylation analysis of chromosomal domains revealed that DNMT3L was crucial to the establishment of global DNA methylation patterns in the male germ line.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Timing of appearance of abnormal testicular histology in Dnmt3L<sup>-/- </sup>males</title><p>Three mutant mouse models have been created to study the role of <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>in the germ line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. All studies have reported the appearance of clear histological defects starting at two weeks after birth, including abnormal synapsis of homologous chromosomes and accumulation of ribosomal particles in spermatocytes, as well as decreased proliferation and loss of germ cells by apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We were intrigued by the fact that the consequences of depriving germ cells of a protein that is so highly expressed before birth would appear only after cells have resumed mitosis, differentiation, and entered meiotic prophase. In hopes of delineating the timing of the defect, we conducted a detailed histological study of developing <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>mutant testes using the model created by Bestor and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Testes were collected at two-day intervals, starting from 4 days postpartum (dpp) until 14 dpp, the time at which defects have been reported to appear. Between 2 and 4 dpp, gonocytes or prospermatogonia re-enter mitosis and relocate to the basement membrane. Some germ cells are set aside to become spermatogonial stem cells, while the rest enter the first wave of spermatogenesis, maturing into type A spermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Between 7 and 8 dpp, the more mature dividing type A spermatogonia differentiate into intermediate and then type B spermatogonia, the last cell type to mitotically divide before entering meiosis. Cells first engage in meiosis between 9 and 10 dpp, as DNA is replicated one last time in absence of cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Histological examination of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>testes at the light microscope level revealed no detectable morphological differences at 4, 6 and 8 days postpartum when compared to <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>and <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/- </sup>testes (data not shown). Germ cells had relocated to the basal compartment and dividing cells were present in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>as they were in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>and <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/- </sup>testes. While testicular histology of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>and <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/- </sup>males remained the same at all time points examined, perceptible changes in the organization of the cells within the tubules first became visible by 10 dpp in the <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>males, although there was no definite defect (data not shown). By 12 dpp, clear differences between control (<italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>and <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/-</sup>) and <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>testes could be noted: fewer cells appeared to enter meiosis and almost no cells with condensed nuclei were visible. As exemplified in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, very few tubules display cells engaged in meiosis in the absence of DNMT3L at 12 dpp.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Histological abnormalities and decreased germ cell counts in newborn <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>testis</bold>. <bold>A) </bold>Hematoxylin and eosin staining of cross-sections of testes from 12 dpp <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/- </sup>(left) and <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>(right) mice.

A difference in germ cell count is observed as early as 6 dpp in absence of DNMT3L. By 10 dpp, mutant males have approximately a quarter of the number of germ cells their <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/- </sup>littermates have. For each time point, GCNA1-positive germ cells were counted per 2000 Sertoli cells; two to three males were examined per genotype. Results are presented as means &#x000b1; SEM; mean counts for individual males are presented as dots when only two animals were analyzed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-7-104-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Reduced germ cell numbers in DNMT3L-deficient newborn males</title><p>These histological observations prompted us to quantify the number of germ cells present in control and DNMT3L-deficient testes using the germ cell-specific antibody GCNA1. GCNA1 can be detected as early as embryonic day (E) 11.5 and is expressed in all germ cells until the zygotene stage, after which point expression becomes restricted to specific chromatin domains in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids in the postnatal testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. First, we established that there were no differences in germ cell counts between <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>and <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/-</sup>males at 10 dpp (data not shown). Subsequently, <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/- </sup>males were used as control. Staining of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/- </sup>testes at 10 dpp revealed numerous cells, but there were consistently fewer cells stained in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>testes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> &#x02013; top panels); the same was observed at 8 dpp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> &#x02013; bottom panels). In fact, there was a clear difference in germ cell counts as early as day 6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). A trend to decreased counts could also be noted at 4 dpp, but there were only two males per group available for analysis. Clearly, absence of <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>causes an early mitotic defect that results in a lower pool of germ cells able to engage in spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Delayed entry of germ cells into meiosis</title><p>Our histological analysis revealed that fewer cells were in meiosis at 12 days postpartum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). To analyze progression to meiosis, we examined the presence of phosphorylated histone H2AX (known as &#x003b3;-H2AX) positive cells in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>males; &#x003b3;-H2AX is recruited to sites of double-stranded breaks and thus serves as an early marker of entry into meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Since the first meiotic cells become visible between 9&#x02013;10 dpp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], we counted the number of tubules that contained at least one positive &#x003b3;-H2AX cell in 10 dpp <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/- </sup>and <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>testes. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, numerous tubules containing at least one positive cell (usually &#x02265; 5 cells/tubule) were observable in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/- </sup>males, while only a few tubules presented positive cells (usually &#x02264; 5 cells/tubule) in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>males. The incidence of positive tubules, i.e. tubules presenting at least one &#x003b3;-H2AX positive cell, was calculated per 100 tubules for both genotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). There were 74.9 &#x000b1; 4.0 positive tubules in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/- </sup>males compared to only 28.2 &#x000b1; 2.6 in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>males. Thus, in addition to depletion in number of germ cells, these results also suggest that there is a delay in the onset of meiosis in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>-deficient males.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Delayed onset of meiosis in the absence of DNMT3L</bold>.

We used quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to determine the expression of <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>in postnatal male germ cells obtained by sedimentation at unit gravity and flow cytometry; in all, nine different populations enriched in specific germ cell types could be isolated using mice of different ages. As described by Dym and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], type A spermatogonia isolated from 6-day-old mouse testes are a mixture of 3 subtypes of type A spermatogonia, namely dark (subtype I), transitional (subtype II) and pale (subtype III) spermatogonia. In contrast, 8-day-old mouse testes contain more mature type A spermatogonia as well as type B spermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

Another study has also revealed a number of changes in gene expression in whole testes lacking DNMT3L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. While a delay in spermatogenesis progression may be responsible for these expression differences, they may also suggest that this protein is involved in methylation of other sequences. Although few techniques allow for the analysis of methylation differences at the whole genome level in a quantitative manner, restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS) allows us to scan and quantify the methylation status of approximately 2600 genomic NotI restriction sites. These sites are found mostly within CpG islands but are also located in non-coding unique and repetitive sequences outside of CpG islands. Presence or absence of a spot on an RLGS profile is indicative of the methylation state of that site. If the restriction site is unmethylated, NotI will cleave the DNA template, resulting in appearance of a spot on the scan; conversely, no spot will be visible if the site is methylated.</p><p>In an attempt to find additional targets of DNMT3L, RLGS was performed on whole testes collected from 10 dpp <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>males of all three genotypes. We first compared the methylation profiles of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>and <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/- </sup>testes and found them to be identical (data not shown). Next, we compared the <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/- </sup>profile to the one obtained for <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>testis and found striking differences between genotypes, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> (top panels). The intensity of a number of spots appeared to decrease in the absence of DNMT3L, suggesting that these sites were becoming methylated. To identify the spots that were changing between <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/- </sup>and <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>testes, we compared these profiles to the ones obtained for adult sperm and liver (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>-bottom panels). In a previous study, we identified a number of differentially methylated sites between mature sperm and adult somatic tissues, including liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. All the spots that were changing in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>testis were the germ cell-specific ones identified in mature sperm. This observation prompted us to question the legitimacy of the methylation differences observed in whole testis of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>males. A testis at day 10 after birth is made up of approximately 40% germ cells, the rest being somatic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Measuring the density of the five changing spots labeled in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> gave an average density value of 44 and 16 for <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/- </sup>and <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>testes, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

Therefore, changes in spot density observed in the <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>testis were due to the loss of germ cells in the absence of DNMT3L, not to changes in DNA methylation state. These results render the use of whole testes for gene expression or DNA methylation analyses invalid and further emphasize the need to use isolated populations of male germ cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>RLGS analysis of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>-deficient testis</bold>.

We chose to isolate cells at this time to obtain a maximal number of germ cells, as spermatogonia are actively dividing at this stage and GFP is still expressed highly in these cells. DNA methylation analyses were then conducted on these pure populations of primitive type A spermatogonia. Quantitative analysis of DNA methylation using real-time PCR, or qAMP, was used to evaluate the methylation state of a number of sequences, including imprinted genes and whole chromosomes. The qAMP assay measures the percentage of CpG dinucleotide methylation within a target sequence by means of real-time PCR amplification of DNA templates digested with methylation-sensitive and methylation-dependent restriction enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>First we used qAMP to confirm that paternally imprinted genes were not acquiring methylation marks properly in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cells.

In <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>germ cells, <italic>U2af1-rs1 </italic>methylation levels remained low, showing that hypomethylated sequences do not gain abnormal methylation marks in absence of DNMT3L. However, we did observe methylation differences for <italic>H19</italic>, <italic>Dlk1-Gtl2 </italic>and <italic>Rasgrf1 </italic>in these same deficient germ cells. For <italic>H19 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> &#x02013; top left), the HhaI site had lost ~85 % of its methylation, while the McrBC sites were demethylated by about 40%; for <italic>Dlk1-Gtl2 </italic>and <italic>Rasgrf1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> &#x02013; top right and bottom left), methylation was down to less than 10% at all cut sites tested.

Chromosomes 4 and X were chosen for analysis using qAMP. Primers were designed to flank HhaI, HpaII or McrBC restriction sites and were placed at roughly five Mb intervals along each chromosome. Loci were chosen solely on the basis of the sequence not being in proximity of a known 5' region of a gene, a CpG island or any type of repetitive sequence; primers were specifically designed to intronic-intergenic sites as the effect of DNMT3L deficiency on interspersed repeat sequences had already been shown by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Approximately 30 small regions were surveyed along each chromosome.

The nature of the mechanisms governing the creation of these patterns has started to emerge as recent studies have pointed to DNMTs that could be involved in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A number of gene targeting experiments have revealed the importance of <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>to spermatogenesis: some paternally imprinted genes and retrotransposons are abnormally methylated in deficient germ cells and these cells are unable to progress through meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, how and why a protein incapable of directly methylating DNA causes such a drastic effect on germ cell integrity is still unclear. We recently conducted a preliminary study on isolated <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>mutant male germ cells and showed that loci identified to be specifically methylated in sperm, and not in somatic tissues, were not methylated properly in absence of DNMT3L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Here, we expand on these findings and provide evidence that DNMT3L is involved in broader DNA methylation events possibly by targeting methylation to lower GC content regions. We also reveal the presence of a mitotic defect in <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>mutant males, as germ cell counts are already significantly lower at 6 days after birth, in addition to showing that the rate of entry into meiosis is markedly reduced in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>germ cells.

Proliferation rates could be affected from the beginning, explaining why germ cell counts are already affected at 4 dpp &#x02013; the time at which most germ cells resume mitosis.</p><p>In addition to lower germ cell counts, we also observed a delay in entry into meiosis, as illustrated by the lower frequency of tubules containing &#x003b3;-H2AX positive cells in 10-day-old DNMT3L-deficient male mice.

Delay in onset of meiosis in <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>mutant males could be caused by failure of germ cells to undergo the necessary steps required to proceed to the next developmental stage.

In fact, atypical chromatin structures have been reported in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>germ cells from the intermediate spermatogonia stage all the way through zygonema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

The data presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> show that <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>expression is down-regulated during the same two developmental windows identified for other <italic>Dnmts</italic>, i.e. differentiation of spermatogonia into spermatocytes and pachynema. These results are the first indication of regulated expression of <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>during postnatal male germ cell development. DNMT3L could be involved in the establishment or the maintenance of methylation patterns during postnatal male germ cell development, in addition to the role it plays in gonocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Genome-wide demethylation observed in germ cells lacking Dnmt3L and link with the regional chromatin state</title><p>Performing qAMP on primitive type A spermatogonia isolated from <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>mutant males allowed us to test the methylation status of a number of sequences. When the status of paternally imprinted genes was assessed, we observed loss of methylation at the <italic>H19 </italic>DMR similarly to what has already been published, but for the other imprinted genes, we generally found a higher reduction in DNA methylation levels compared to former studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The use of different enzymes to perform the methylation-sensitive enzymatic digestions for Southern Blot analysis could potential provide a different answer as different CpGs are being analyzed. However, slight differences in the localization of the primers or probes used to examine the various regions would most likely explain these inconsistencies. As well, we believe that the discrepancies can also be partly accounted for by differences in timing of sample collection and techniques employed to isolate the cells. The analyses presented here were carried out on pure preparations of primitive type A spermatogonia isolated at 6 dpp, the earliest time point tested for DNA methylation differences in a <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>mutant mouse model, while all other studies have been conducted on mixed populations of germ cells isolated at later time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This discrepancy between early and late stages of spermatogenesis may indicate the existence of compensatory mechanisms acting during spermatogonial proliferation to partially restore methylation patterns at paternally imprinted genes in a DNMT3L-independent manner.</p><p>The methylation state of multiple loci on both an autosome and a sex chromosome was also analyzed using qAMP. Loci analyzed by qAMP were selected solely on the basis of not being in the vicinity of a gene or a repeat element and were spaced at roughly 5Mb intervals, allowing for an unbiased screen. Numerous sites across chromosomes 4 and X were severely demethylated in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>germ cells. Again, hypomethylated sequences remained so in cells lacking DNMT3L, suggesting that inherited methylation patterns are erased properly in primordial germ cells prior to DNA methylation reprogramming and that methyl groups are not redistributed to ectopic genomic positions. Interestingly, some loci had very little methylation, while others had the same levels of methylation as found in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>and <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>+/- </sup>germ cells. We initially hypothesized that either these sequences were not targets of DNMT3L and were methylated without requiring DNMT3L stimulation, or <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>inactivation caused for an up-regulation in the expression of other <italic>Dnmt </italic>genes to compensate for the loss of DNMT3L. When we monitored expression of other <italic>Dnmt </italic>genes in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>male germ cells we did not detect any difference in <italic>Dnmt </italic>expression, suggesting that <italic>Dnmt </italic>up-regulation is not a response mechanism associated with the inactivation of <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>in the male germ line. This differs with what we previously observed in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic><sup>-/- </sup>oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], suggesting that the regulatory mechanisms governing expression of DNA methyltransferases in the male and female germ lines differ. Evidence of this is seen for <italic>Dnmt1</italic>, as different mechanisms appear to control DNMT1 down-regulation during male and female meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, a detailed developmental study is still required before this possibility can be excluded, as compensatory mechanisms could be activated at other times during male germ cell development.</p><p>When broad regional characteristics of chromosomes were taken into account, namely the GC content, we found a statistically significant relationship between regions of lower GC density and DNA methylation aided by DNMT3L. Whereas DNMT3L is probably not responding to the regional GC content per se, our findings indicate that broader regional chromatin characteristics may be dictating where DNMT3L directs DNA methylation by recognizing specific histone modifications or interacting with specific histone modification enzymes and their associated partners. Functionally, GC-poor regions are usually found in heterochromatic Giemsa bands and are characterized by a lower frequency of genes, a lower rate of transcription and later replication timing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Heterochromatin is generally decorated by specific histone modifications such as methylation of lysine residues K9 and K20 on histones H3 and H4, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. While a functional relationship between DNA and histone H3K9 methylation was first established in <italic>Neurospora crassa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], recent data showed that DNMT3L binds specifically to the N-terminal tail of H3 when lysine 4 was unmethylated and is insensitive to the methylation state of lysine 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. These data indicate that DNMT3L could recruit or activate DNMT3a2 and DNMT3b upon contact with nucleosomes that contain unmethylated H3K4. Conversely, the wide-spread lack of methylation observed here could be secondary to the lack of methylation at retrotransposable elements: methylation of intergenic-intronic loci could be acquired as a consequence of spreading of methylation to neighbouring sequences from retrotransposons. Hypomethylation of these loci could still be contributing to the phenotype by altering gene expression patterns or modifying global chromatin architecture. Additional studies performed on isolated prenatal gonocytes should allow these various possibilities to be addressed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>CD-1 mice were purchased from Charles River Canada Inc.

RNA and DNA were simultaneously extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen); the RNA was used in qRT-PCR analyses as described above, while DNA methylation analyses were carried out on the DNA. Quantitative analysis of DNA methylation using real-time PCR, or qAMP, was conducted to analyze the DNA methylation status of a number of sequences as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Briefly, the DNA was either mock digested (sham group), or digested with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (NotI, HpaII or HhaI), which cleave DNA if the restriction site(s) are unmethylated, or with a methylation-dependent restriction enzyme (McrBC), which cleaves DNA only if it is methylated. For a given sequence, primers were designed to flank the restriction sites of interest and real-time PCR was performed on the different digested templates using the QuantiTect &#x02122; SYBR<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Green PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's suggested conditions for use of the Mx3000P PCR machine (Stratagene).

The cycle threshold (C<sub>t</sub>) values obtained for the different digested templates are expressed relative to the sham digested group; any differences in C<sub>t </sub>values (&#x00394;C<sub>t</sub>) are indicative of differences in the methylation status of the given sequence of interest. Since each successive round of PCR amplification results in approximately a 2-fold increase in the amount of amplicon, a percentage methylation value can be extracted from the &#x00394;C<sub>t </sub>values. Thus, a &#x00394;C<sub>t </sub>of 1.0 is indicative of 50% template cleavage; 2.0, of 75% template cleavage, and so on. For methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, the following formula can be used to described the relationship of &#x00394;C<sub>t </sub>to percent methylation: %methylation = 100(2<sup>-&#x00394;Ct)</sup>); the relationship follows the inverse function for methylation-dependent restriction enzymes: %methylation = 100(1&#x02013;2<sup>(&#x00394;Ct)</sup>). For the chromosomal analyses, the %methylation values obtained for each different enzymatic digest for a given loci were averaged to produce the percent value attributed to each position. Statistical analyses were conducted using SigmaStat v3.0 (SPSS). As data sets did not have equal variance, Mann-Whitney rank sum tests were ran; a P value of &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered to be significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>DMR Differentially methylated region</p><p>DNMT DNA methyltransferase</p><p>Dpp Day postpartum</p><p>E Embryonic day</p><p>GFP Green fluorescent protein</p><p>PGC Primordial germ cell</p><p>qAMP Quantitative analysis of DNA methylation using real-time PCR</p><p>qRT-PCR Real-time (quantitative) RT-PCR</p><p>RLGS Restriction landmark genomic scanning</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declares that there are no competing interests. </p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SL was responsible for <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>and <italic>GOF18/deltaPE-Oct4/GFP </italic>mice husbandry and genotyping, all germ cell isolations and tissue collections, in addition to performing all qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence studies and part of histological analyses; she also participated in assay and primer design for qAMP.
