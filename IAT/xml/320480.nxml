On this DNA sequence (3.38kb), three open reading frames (ORFs) and three putative tRNA genes were detected in the following order: -ORF701-tRNASer(UGA)-ORF702-tRNAGly(GCC)-initiator tRNAMet(CAU)-ORF703-. The ORF703 is composed of 100 codons in which those for lysine (15%) and arginine (11%) are abundant, and could be accounted for as a counterpart of E. coli ribosomal protein S14 since they share 45% homology in the amino acid sequences. The ORF701 appears to code for a membrane protein, showing a periodic appearance of seven clusters of hydrophobic amino acids. Although the mechanisms remain unknown, the ORF701 causes a streptomycin-sensitive phenotype in resistant mutants of E. coli. The ORFs and tRNA genes are separated from each other by extremely AT-rich spacers containing sequences of dyad symmetry. The third letter positions of the codons in the ORFs are also rich in A and T residues.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0326.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9551"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0327.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9552"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0328.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9553"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0329.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9554"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0330.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9555"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0331.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9556"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0332.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9557"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0333.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9558"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0334.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9559"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0335.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9560"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0336.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9561"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0337.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9562"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0338.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9563"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0339.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9564"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0340.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9565"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
