This is due to the tissue-specific expression of the BK<sub>Ca</sub> auxiliary subunit &#x003b2;1, whose presence dramatically increases both the potency and efficacy of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in promoting channel opening. &#x003b2;1 contains no Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites of its own, and thus the mechanism by which it increases the BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel's Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity has been of some interest. Previously, we demonstrated that &#x003b2;1 stabilizes voltage sensor activation, such that activation occurs at more negative voltages with &#x003b2;1 present. This decreases the work that Ca<sup>2+</sup> must do to open the channel and thereby increases the channel's apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity without altering the real affinities of the channel's Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites. To explain the full effect of &#x003b2;1 on the channel's Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity, however, we also proposed that there must be effects of &#x003b2;1 on Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. Here, to test this hypothesis, we have used high-resolution Ca<sup>2+</sup> dose&#x02013;response curves together with binding site&#x02013;specific mutations to measure the effects of &#x003b2;1 on Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. We find that coexpression of &#x003b2;1 alters Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding at both of the BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel's two types of high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites, primarily increasing the affinity of the RCK1 sites when the channel is open and decreasing the affinity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl sites when the channel is closed. Both of these modifications increase the difference in affinity between open and closed, such that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding at either site has a larger effect on channel opening when &#x003b2;1 is present.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Large-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated potassium (BK<sub>Ca</sub>) channels are crucial for the regulation of arterial tone, where they facilitate a negative feedback mechanism that opposes vasoconstriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nelson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nelson and Quayle, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner et al., 2000</xref>). Intravascular pressure increases arterial tone by a complex process that includes membrane depolarization and the subsequent elevation of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> via voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. This global increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to vasoconstriction, but it also triggers localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events from ryanodine receptors on the smooth muscle sacroplasmic reticulum. These release events, termed Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks, activate nearby BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels that then create a hyperpolarizing K<sup>+</sup> current known as a STOC. STOCs then oppose further constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nelson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perez et al., 1999</xref>). The BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel's accessory &#x003b2;1 subunit has been show to be critically important in this regulatory process, as mice that lack &#x003b2;1 have greatly reduced STOCs in response to sparks as well as hypercontractile smooth muscle and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pluger et al., 2000</xref>). In heterologous expression systems &#x003b2;1 subunits, four of which assemble with a single channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shen et al., 1994</xref>), make the BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel substantially more Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">McManus et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Meera et al., 1996</xref>; Cox and Aldrich, 2000a). Thus, in the absence of &#x003b2;1 it appears that BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels lack the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity required for BK<sub>Ca</sub>-mediated feedback regulation of smooth muscle tone.</p><p>The mechanism by which &#x003b2;1 enhances the BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel's Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity has been the subject of many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wallner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nimigean and Magleby, 1999b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2000</xref>; Cox and Aldrich, 2000b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Qian et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qian and Magleby, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao and Cox, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Orio and Latorre, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Morrow et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Orio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang and Brenner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2008</xref>), but it is still unclear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nimigean and Magleby (1999a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2000</xref>) found that &#x003b2;1 increases the length of time that the BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel spends in bursting states and that this effect persists in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nimigean and Magleby, 1999a</xref>). They suggested that a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent effect underlies most of the channel's increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity. In support of this notion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao and Cox (2005)</xref> found, when studying gating currents, that &#x003b2;1 stabilizes voltage sensor activation such that activation occurs at more negative voltages with &#x003b2;1 present. At most voltages this decreases the work that Ca<sup>2+</sup> must do to open the channel and thereby increases the channel's apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity. However, to account for the full change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity brought about by &#x003b2;1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao and Cox (2005)</xref> also proposed that &#x003b2;1 alters the true affinities of the channel's high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao et al., 2004</xref>), a conclusion supported by the earlier study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cox and Aldrich (2000)</xref>.</p><p>A recent paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al. (2008)</xref>, however, suggests that this may not be the case. Their experiments revealed that mutation of the voltage sensor residue R167 eliminates the ability of &#x003b2;1 to enhance the BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel's Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity, implying that &#x003b2;1 enhances Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity solely by altering the conformation or movements of the voltage sensor. Here, to clarify this issue, we have used high-resolution Ca<sup>2+</sup> dose&#x02013;response curves to determine directly whether or not &#x003b2;1 alters the BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel's affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> at either of its two types of high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites. We find effects of &#x003b2;1 on the real affinities of both sites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Heterologous Expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub> Channels in TSA 201 Cells</title><p>TSA 201 cells (modified human embryonic kidney cells) were transiently transfected with expression vectors (pcDNA 3; Invitrogen) encoding the mouse &#x003b1; subunit (mslo-mbr5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butler et al., 1993</xref>), the mouse &#x003b2;1 subunit of the BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel, enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP-N1; BD), and the empty pcDNA 3.1+ vector (Invitrogen) to control for the total amount of transfected DNA. Cells were transiently transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The eGFP was used to monitor successfully transfected cells. For transfection, cells at 80&#x02013;90% confluence in 35-mm falcon dishes were incubated with a mixture of the plasmids (total of 4 &#x003bc;g DNA) Lipofectamine and Optimem (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, the mixture was left on the cells 4&#x02013;8 h after which the cells were replated into recording Falcon 3004 dishes in standard tissue culture media: DMEM with 1% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (all from Invitrogen). The cells were patch clamped 1&#x02013;3 d after transfection.</p><p>The molar ratio of &#x003b2;1 to &#x003b1;-expressing plasmids transfected was 1 &#x003b2;1 plasmid to between 0.6 and 2 &#x003b1; plasmids for all experiments.

The minimal saturating ratio was determined to be 1 &#x003b2;1 plasmid to 6.8 &#x003b1; plasmids, as determined by the magnitudes of &#x003b2;1-induced G-V shifts at 100 &#x000b5;M [Ca<sup>2+</sup>].

For macroscopic current recordings, data were sampled at 50 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz. In most macroscopic current recordings, capacity and leak current were subtracted using a P/5 subtraction protocol with a holding potential of &#x02212;120 mV and leak pulses in opposite polarity to the test pulse, but with BK<sub>Ca</sub> currents recorded with &#x0003e;100 &#x000b5;M Ca<sup>2+</sup>, no leak subtraction was performed.

In the presence of &#x003b2;1, the range of total activity per patch obtained over the range of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] tested (3 nM to 2.5 mM) was greater than could be covered with a single normalization point. Therefore, in patches with many channels from which we were most interested in making low <italic>Popen</italic> measurements, the <italic>NPopen</italic> data at each [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was normalized by the <italic>NPopen</italic> value measured at 0.88 &#x000b5;M [Ca<sup>2+</sup>].

To yield a single curve at the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] at which the two curves overlapped, the two values present were subjected to a weighted average, weighted by the number of measurements in each of the two curves being brought together.

The affinities of the intact RCK1 sites in the presence and absence of &#x003b2;1 were then determined from the fits. The fit to the &#x00394;E&#x00394;B data (solid line) yielded the following values (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>):<disp-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="JGP_200810129_LW_Equ17.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>And the fit to the &#x00394;E&#x00394;B + &#x003b2;1 data (dashed curve) yielded the following values (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>):<disp-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="JGP_200810129_LW_Equ18.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>Thus, there is a small &#x003b2;1-induced change in the affinity of the RCK1 sites when the channel is closed, and a much larger relative change when the channel is open, the opposite of what we observed at the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl. Most important, however, the changes are diametric and consequently the change in <italic>C</italic> is large (7.5&#x02192;36), and it is this change that drives the expansion of the channel's Ca<sup>2+</sup> dose&#x02013;response curve along the ordinate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref> upon &#x003b2;1 coexpression. Interestingly, the &#x003b2;1-induced change in <italic>M</italic> is &#x0223c;200-fold for the &#x00394;E&#x00394;B channel, similar to what is observed with the &#x00394;E channel. Thus, unlike functional RCK1 sites, functional Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowls are not required for &#x003b2;1's effects on the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent gating properties of the BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel.</p><p>Although &#x003b2;1 has very large effects on the &#x00394;E&#x00394;B channel's Ca<sup>2+</sup> dose&#x02013;response relation, there is a complicating factor that makes our conclusions about the effects of &#x003b2;1 on this site less than definitive. Our analysis assumes that there are no direct interactions between Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites and voltage sensors. We have however shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sweet and Cox, 2008</xref>) that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding at the RCK1 site is voltage dependent, an effect that is most reasonably attributed to a direct intrasubunit interaction between voltage sensor and RCK1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site. Further, we have estimated the allosteric factor by which voltage sensor activation alters the equilibrium constant for Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding at the RCK1 site (<italic>E</italic>) to be &#x0223c;2.8, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Horrigan and Aldrich (2002)</xref> arrived at a similar value, 2.4, based on the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on voltage sensor movement measured with gating currents. This means that <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd8">Eq. 8</xref> is not strictly correct for the &#x00394;E&#x00394;B channel because as Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds and the channels open, more voltage sensors will become active, even if the voltage is held constant, and this could lead to enhanced binding not accounted for by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd8">Eq. 8</xref>. The magnitude of this effect will depend on <italic>E</italic> and on the properties of the channel's voltage sensors. In terms of the Horrigan and Aldrich (HA) model, it will depend on <italic>L</italic> and <italic>V<sub>hc</sub></italic>, and <italic>V<sub>ho</sub></italic>, <italic>z<sub>L</sub></italic>, and <italic>z<sub>J</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Horrigan and Aldrich, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, if &#x003b2;1 changes any of these parameters this could alter the channel's Ca<sup>2+</sup> dose&#x02013;response curve in a way that looks like an increase in <italic>C</italic>, when no real change in <italic>C</italic> has occurred.</p><p>Ideally, our experiments would have been performed at a negative voltage where the channel's voltage sensors are very rarely active; however, in the presence of the &#x003b2;1 subunit voltage sensors become active at far negative voltages where <italic>Popen</italic> at 3 nM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is too low to measure well, making this approach impractical. However, we examined whether the effects of &#x003b2;1 on the BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel's voltage sensing parameters could account for its effects on the &#x00394;E&#x00394;B channel's <italic>Popen</italic> versus [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] curve as follows. We simulated &#x00394;E&#x00394;B <italic>Popen</italic> versus [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] curves using the HA model and voltage-sensing parameters that have been well established for the wild-type mSlo1 channel (<italic>V<sub>ho</sub></italic> = 27 mV, <italic>V<sub>hc</sub></italic> = 151 mV, <italic>z<sub>J</sub></italic> = 0.58, <italic>z<sub>L</sub></italic> = 0.41, <italic>L0</italic> = 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>, and <italic>E</italic> = 2.8) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dissociation constants we determined for the RCK1 site (<italic>K<sub>C</sub></italic> = 23.2 &#x000b5;M and <italic>K<sub>O</sub></italic> = 4.9 &#x000b5;M). This led to the <italic>Popen</italic> versus [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] curve shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref> (dark curve). We then simulated the effects of &#x003b2;1 on the voltage-sensing parameters of the channel by lowering <italic>L</italic> from 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> to 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> to account for the large decline in <italic>M</italic> (<italic>Popen</italic> at 3 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup>), and we altered <italic>V<sub>hc</sub></italic> to +80 mV and <italic>V<sub>ho</sub></italic> to &#x02212;34 mV, parameters we have determined previously for &#x003b1;+&#x003b2;1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao and Cox, 2005</xref>). The resulting curve is also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref> (gray curve), and as anticipated, altering these voltage-sensing parameters did increase the maximum effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on <italic>Popen</italic>. The change in <italic>Popen</italic> brought about by saturating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increased 1.55-fold. Thus, some of the changes we have observed in the &#x00394;E&#x00394;B channel's <italic>Popen</italic> versus [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] curve upon &#x003b2;1 expression likely arise from &#x003b2;1's effects on voltage sensing rather than Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. However, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>, &#x003b2;1 increases the maximum effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on <italic>Popen</italic> 708-fold&#x02014;far greater than the effect we anticipate due to the linkage between Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and voltage sensing (1.55-fold). In fact the anticipated effect is &#x0003c;1% of the true effect of &#x003b2;1. Thus, this complication not withstanding, it does appear that &#x003b2;1 alters the true Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinities of the RCK1 sites as well as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl sites.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>&#x003b2;1's effects on the BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel's voltage-sensing parameters cannot account for the &#x003b2;1-induced changes in the &#x00394;E&#x00394;B channel's Ca<sup>2+</sup> dose&#x02013;response relation.

The essential assumptions we made in fitting our data were as follows: (1) that there is a single conformational change between open and closed that can occur with any number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound, an idea that is consistent with a great many single-channel and macroscopic BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel studies and all current models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McManus and Magleby, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cox et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cui et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horrigan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rothberg and Magleby, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2000</xref>; Cox and Aldrich, 2000a); (2) that there are four of each type of high-affinity site. This has been established for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Niu and Magleby, 2002</xref>), and given the fourfold symmetry of the channel, this seems likely to be the case for the RCK1 site as well; and (3) that there are no interactions between binding sites of the same type or between Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and voltage sensor movement.</p><p>We found that the 0 mV Ca<sup>2+</sup> dose&#x02013;response curve of BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels containing only functional RCK1 sites could be well fitted by supposing that each site independently influences opening, and that each site has a dissociation constant of 15.8 &#x000b5;M when the channel is closed and 2.1 &#x000b5;M when the channel is open. These values produce a <italic>C</italic> value of 7.5, which allows us to calculate that each Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound to a Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl site decreases the energy difference between open and closed by 4.9 KJ/mol.</p><p>In the presence of &#x003b2;1, the RCK1 site's dose&#x02013;response curve at 0 mV could also be well fitted with a simple model and yielded values for <italic>K<sub>C</sub></italic> and <italic>K<sub>O</sub></italic> of 18.5 and 0.52 &#x000b5;M, respectively. These values produce a substantial <italic>C</italic> value of 36 (8.8 KJ/mol per binding event), which we think is in large part responsible for the dramatic increase in the influence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on <italic>Popen</italic> brought about by &#x003b2;1 in the &#x00394;E&#x00394;B channels. As discussed above, however, our estimates of these values are complicated by an interaction between Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and voltage at the RCK1 sites. But we have simulated the influence that this complication will likely have on Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding in the presence of &#x003b2;1, and it turns out to very small compared with the effect of &#x003b2;1 observed.

But interestingly, and of relevance here, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cox and Aldrich (2000)</xref> observed that the affinity of the channel for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the open conformation must not change upon expression of &#x003b2;1, as &#x003b2;1 does not alter the critical [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] required to begin to see a leftward shift in the channel's G-V relation (Cox and Aldrich, 2000a). This is in agreement with our data that show that expression of &#x003b2;1 does not appreciably alter <italic>K<sub>O</sub></italic> for the higher-affinity site (Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl: <italic>Ko</italic><sub>&#x003b1;</sub> = 0.56 &#x000b5;M, <italic>K<sub>O&#x003b1;+&#x003b2;1</sub></italic> = 0.67 &#x000b5;M).</p><p>In considering the effects of &#x003b2;1 on Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, it is interesting to note that the BK<sub>Ca</sub> &#x003b2;1 subunit has very little intracellular sequence, just its N and C termini&#x02014;15 and 13 amino acids long, respectively. The rest of the protein is comprised of two transmembrane domains and a large extracellular loop&#x02014;118 amino acids. Thus, if &#x003b2;1 subunits alter the channel's affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> by interacting directly with Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites, generally accepted to be contained within the cytoplasmic C terminus of the channel, they seemingly must do so through these short intracellular termini. Supporting this idea, chimera experiments with &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Orio and Latorre, 2005</xref>) and &#x003b2;1 N- and C-terminal deletion experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang and Brenner, 2006</xref>) have shown that these termini play a critical role in transmitting &#x003b2;1's effects to the channel proper.</p><p>In addition to &#x003b2;1's effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, and in agreement with the previous findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang and Brenner (2006)</xref>, we found that mouse &#x003b2;1 reduces <italic>Popen</italic> at 0 mV in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, presumably by lowering <italic>L</italic>. Strikingly, our results show that a mutation at a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site (D367A) not only eliminates Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding at the RCK1 sites, but it also eliminates &#x003b2;1's ability to reduce <italic>Popen</italic> at 0 mV in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. That is, a single Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site mutation affects both the mechanism by which the channel senses Ca<sup>2+</sup> and also the mechanism by which &#x003b2;1 influences the intrinsic energetics of opening.</p><p>We also found that when we combine mutations at all three types of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites&#x02014;E399N (low-affinity site), D367A (RCK1 site), and D898/D900 (Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl)&#x02014;we see no effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on channel gating in the &#x003b1;-only channel, and we see no restoration of an effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on channel gating by &#x003b2;1. This in contrast to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qian and Magleby (2003)</xref>, who found that coexpression of &#x003b2;1 restored some Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity to a similar triple mutant. We do not know why we did not see the restorative effect of &#x003b2;1 observed by Qian and Magleby. The most straightforward explanation is that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites were disabled by the mutations and could not be fixed by &#x003b2;1. However, the main differences between the two studies were as follows: our recordings were made at 0 mV, whereas theirs were conducted at +50 mV. The mutations used at each binding site were not exactly the same between the two studies, and Qian and Magleby recorded from single-channel patches, whereas the patches we used typically contained many channels. Furthermore, Qian and Magleby did not see the restorative effect of &#x003b2;1 in every experiment, but rather they reported a large variability from patch to patch. This would seem to suggest that perhaps there is a subtle environmental factor required for the effect they observed that was absent from our experiments.</p><p>Our measurements of the effects of &#x003b2;1 on Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding also stand in some contrast to the recent paper of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al. (2008)</xref>. They found that the mutation R167A in the voltage-sensing domain of the mSlo1 channel eliminates &#x003b2;1's ability to alter the channel's G-V curve at all [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. This result suggests that by altering just voltage sensor movement one can disrupt the &#x003b2;1-induced enhancement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity altogether. It seems hard to imagine how such a mutation could simultaneously eliminate &#x003b2;1's effects on voltage sensor movement and Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding at both binding sites, unless these processes are physically more intertwined than previously thought.</p><p>Perhaps rather than affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding directly, the &#x003b2;1 subunit might be affecting a linkage between Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and voltage sensing, which in turn affects Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. Indeed, we have shown recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sweet and Cox, 2008</xref>) that such a linkage exists between the RCK1 sites and the voltage sensors, so it is possible that an enhancement of the allosteric factor at this linkage, <italic>E</italic>, could create enhanced binding affinity. It would be interesting to explore this linkage in &#x003b1;+&#x003b2;1 channels. However, we found no such linkage between Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl sites and the channel's voltage sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sweet and Cox, 2008</xref>); thus, we do not think that such an effect is involved in the &#x003b2;1-induced changes in the binding affinity we observed at the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl sites.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that the BK &#x003b2;1 subunit has effects on the affinities of the BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel's high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites. It primarily increases the affinity of the RCK1 sites when the channel is open, and it primarily decreases the affinity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl sites when the channel is closed. Both of these modifications increase the difference in affinity between open and closed, such that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding at either site has a larger effect on channel opening when &#x003b2;1 is present.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by program project grant P01-HL077378 and predoctoral fellowship F31 NS047823 from the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>Edward N.
