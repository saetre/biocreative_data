As a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein, nucleolin binds to transcription factors and modulates gene expression during differentiation. To identify binding partners of nucleolin involved in monocytes differentiation, a nucleolin affinity matrix precipitation assay was performed. For this purpose, we used the N-terminal domain lacking nucleolin construct (&#x00394;N-Ncl) generated from human cDNA clones, bacterially expressed as a GST fusion protein and bound to glutathione agarose. Human myeloid leukaemia THP-1 cells were stimulated up to four days with the phorbol ester PMA to induce the differentiation process, and whole cell lysates were used for the pull-down assay. It has been reported previously that Stat proteins are activated during myeloid differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008302-Coccia1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we addressed first these transcription factors and analyzed eluates of our pull-down assays using antibodies against Stat proteins. We found in these experiments that the transcription factor Stat1, but not other Stats (Stat2, Stat3, Stat4, Stat5), was specifically bound to the nucleolin-GST matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008302-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> and data not shown). This binding was time-dependent peaking at 72 hrs of PMA treatment. The macrophage differentiation was monitored by the expression of specific cell surface proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008302-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In the phase contrast images and after Wrights-Giemsa staining, PMA treated cells showed the characteristic macrophage morphology, namely, larger cell size, increased membrane ruffles, and large cytoplasm pseudopodia of the adherent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008302-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0008302-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008302.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Stat1 and nucleolin bind in THP-1 cells in a time-dependent manner.</title><p>(A) Nucleolin-GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione agarose and used as affinity matrix in a pull-down assay with whole cell extracts from non-stimulated or PMA (2 nM) stimulated THP-1 cells.

Since the C-terminal glycine/arginine-rich domain of nucleolin (RGG) was reported to serve for nucleolin interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008302-Ginisty1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, the corresponding nucleolin constructs (C(Ncl) and &#x00394;N(Ncl)) were generated, as well as a full-length Stat1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008302-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Pull-down assays using both &#x00394;N(Ncl)-GST and C(Ncl)-GST, as well as Stat1-GST, confirmed nucleolin- Stat1 binding in THP-1 cells stimulated for differentiation. These results suggest that the RGG region of nucleolin is involved in this interaction. The Stat1-nucleolin binding was additionally found in cells of the human U937 promyelocytic cell line and in the M1 mouse myeloid leukemia cells stimulated for differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008302-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). To assess whether nucleolin and Stat1 might associate in living cells, co- immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-nucleolin and anti-Stat1 antibodies were performed. Indeed, both proteins were co-immunoprecipitated. Remarkably, nucleolin-Stat1 association was only observed in cells stimulated for differentiation, but not in the unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008302-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). As a third approach investigating Stat1-nucleolin interference, we performed cross-linking studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008302-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Cytosolic proteins of PMA stimulated THP-1 cells were subjected to cross-linking using chemical cross-linker BS<sup>3</sup>, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-nucleolin (left panel) or anti-Stat1 antibodies (right panel). An additional high molecular mass band over 250 kDa was revealed in both experimental settings. From the molecular mass value, we assume that the complex contains a Stat1 dimer and nucleolin.

For this purpose, a full-length human macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR), which is a physiological receptor to mediate monocyte differentiation, was expressed in THP-1 cells by means of a lentiviral gene transfer. The expressed M-CSFR was functionally competent and revealed an autophosphorylation in response to stimulation with its natural ligand, CSF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008302-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).

The maximal colocalization of nucleolin and Stat1, as well as individual colocalization of both proteins with nuclear marker was observed after 72 hours CSF-1 treatment. At this time point, most of the cells showed the characteristic macrophage morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008302-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, lower panel).

This finding represents an alternative pathway to the already reported Stat1 nuclear translocation mechanisms, which is mediated by the shuttle protein nucleolin. The NLS sequence of nucleolin is necessary for the correct import into the nuclear compartment. The important result of our experiments is that this mechanism is induced in a stage-specific manner along the monocyte/macrophage pathway. Nucleolin deficiency is associated with impaired expression of monocyte differentiation markers, one of which, the scavenger receptor CD36, is a Stat1 target gene and plays an important role in pathophysiological events related to lipid uptake and inflammation.</p><p>Many different mechanisms orchestrate the myeloid developmental program, including cooperative gene regulation, protein-protein interactions, and induction of cell cycle arrest. We addressed a role of nucleolin in cell differentiation and identified the transcription factor Stat1 as a novel and specific binding partner of nucleolin in hematopoietic cells. Increasing evidence point to multiple functions of Stat1 in myeloid cells mediating inflammatory, proapoptotic and antiproliferative events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008302-Coccia1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008302-Kalliolias1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008302-Galdiero1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies suggest that Stat1 may be an early transcription factor activated during the monocyte maturation process upon migration into extravascular tissues. They further indicate that Stat1 does not trigger <italic>per se</italic> the differentiation process but rather is a part of a developmental program leading to the regulation the transcription of genes specific of mature macrophages. Our findings are along these lines of evidence. We observed the formation of the Stat1-nucleolin complex and its nuclear translocation in the later phase of the monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. Our results support the studies of others reporting Stat1 constitutive activation at day five of monocyte cultivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008302-Coccia1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as changes in activation and DNA binding capacity of LIL-Stat during monocyte maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008302-Tuyt1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. These data suggest that the effects of Stats are tightly controlled according to the status of cell differentiation. The underlying molecular events are, however, sparsely explored.</p><p>Specificity of Stat-mediated cellular reactions is a complex multistep process that explains the variety of Stat-mediated cellular functions. This molecular machinery includes the primary stimuli, activation of specific receptors and transactivation of co-receptors, a cross-talk of intracellular signaling pathways and finally, Stat nuclear translocation and DNA binding. Our study provides evidence that Stat1 nuclear transport and DNA binding in a stage-specific manner along the monocyte/macrophage pathway is mediated by the shuttle protein nucleolin. Our results also suggest that nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttle may play a significant role in the modulation of gene expression that occur during monocyte differentiation. The revealed requirement of nucleolin for Stat1 nuclear translocation was surprising, since the molecular mechanisms of Stat1 nuclear transport have been extensively studied before. Thus, Stat1 can associate with specific transport factors of the importin family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008302-Fagerlund1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008302-Sekimoto1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> or directly interact with the NPC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008302-Marg1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Also an unusual nuclear import signal that specifically regulates the nuclear entry of tyrosine-phosphorylated dimeric Stat1, termed dimer-specific NLS (dsNLS), was identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008302-Meyer2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Our findings add to these schemes a novel mechanism for Stat1 nuclear transport, which involves NLS sequence of nucleolin. NLS containing proteins are transported into the nucleus by importins. The classic mono- or bipartite NLS typically contains a cluster of basic residues that is recognized and bound by the NLS receptor importin-&#x003b1;, which is further associated through a separate domain with importin-&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008302-Jans1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008302-Weis1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

Though we confirmed these observations of others, no specific requirement for phosphorylated Stat1 for nucleolin binding was determined (data not shown). Our experiments with INF&#x003b3; suggest that Stat1 phosphorylation of itself is not sufficient for Stat1 nuclear transport via nucleolin. In agreement with this observation, nuclear translocation of other Stats independently of tyrosine phosphorylation was recently documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008302-Liu1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.

We provide evidence that nucleolin, beyond mediating Stat1 import into the nucleus, is a part of the Stat1-DNA binding complex. Transcription factors can act as multiprotein complexes, whose components may be involved in different aspects of transcriptional regulation. Adaptor proteins and co-activators may serve for bridging the specific transcription factor to the basic transcription machinery or to facilitate the contact with histone acetylases and deacetylases, which are required for the chromatin remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008302-Ying1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008302-ChatterjeeKishore1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.

This association was found in different human and murine cell lines and primary cells of monocytic origin including hematopoietic progenitor cells stimulated for monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. Though being expressed, Stat1 and nucleolin did not associate when cells were stimulated to differentiate to neutrophils and in cells of non-myeloid lineages. Furthermore, in our experiments using nucleolin transgenes we show that IFN&#x003b3;-induced Stat1 nuclear translocation does not utilize nucleolin and in particular its NLS sequence. Our data support the possibility that the nucleolin-mediated Stat1 nuclear transport might represent a specialized pathway for the time-coordinated control of Stat1-regulated gene expression in myelopoiesis. From a clinical perspective, it would be interesting to identify factors, which specifically induce this pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results indicate that this pathway is most likely regulated via the CSF-1/M-CSFR system. Conversely, we need to know whether a paracrine or an autocrine mechanism is involved.</p><p>With the exception for some IFN-stimulated genes, the cellular genes dependent on cytokine-activated Stat proteins are poorly defined.

These observations may explain, at least in part, why Stat1 deficiency in apolipoprotein E-/- mice blocks foam cell formation and early lesion development. Our results suggest that nucleolin-directed Stat1 nuclear transport during the course of macrophage maturation might represent a specific pathway to regulate CD36 expression. Thus, we observed that nucleolin silencing resulted in abrogation of CD36 expression. The regulation of CD36 by Stat1 may be important in other pathophysiological events involving CD36-dependent lipid uptake and inflammation, such as diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome. Therefore, Stat1 inhibition could represent a target to reduce inflammation and to prevent progression of these diseases. Elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanisms of Stat1 regulation could lead to enhanced understanding of these physiological and pathophysiological processes. Our study indicates Stat1-nucleolin interference as one of these mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p>High-quality commercial grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), and Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany).
