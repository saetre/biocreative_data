Polyamine binding to 5S rRNA was investigated by cross-linking of <italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup>-azidobenzamidino (ABA)-spermine to naked 5S rRNA or 50S ribosomal subunits and whole ribosomes from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells. ABA-spermine cross-linking sites were kinetically measured and their positions in 5S rRNA were localized by primer extension analysis. Helices III and V, and loops A, C, D and E in naked 5S rRNA were found to be preferred polyamine binding sites. When 50S ribosomal subunits or poly(U)-programmed 70S ribosomes bearing tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> at the E-site and AcPhe-tRNA at the P-site were targeted, the susceptibility of 5S rRNA to ABA-spermine was greatly reduced. Regardless of 5S rRNA assembly status, binding of spermine induced significant changes in the 5S rRNA conformation; loop A adopted an apparent &#x02018;loosening&#x02019; of its structure, while loops C, D, E and helices III and V achieved a more compact folding. Poly(U)-programmed 70S ribosomes possessing 5S rRNA cross-linked with spermine were more efficient than control ribosomes in tRNA binding, peptidyl transferase activity and translocation. Our results support the notion that 5S rRNA serves as a signal transducer between regions of 23S rRNA responsible for principal ribosomal functions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The large subunit of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ribosomes comprises two RNA species, 23S and 5S rRNA, and 33 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). 5S rRNA is the smallest RNA component of the ribosome, 120 nucleotides long. Its secondary structure has been extensively investigated using phylogenetic data and a suite of biophysical and biochemical techniques, including NMR spectroscopy and microarrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). It consists of five helices (I&#x02013;V), two hairpin loops (C and D), two internal loops (B and E) and a hinge loop (A) organized in a three-helix junction.</p><p>The tertiary structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> 5S rRNA in solution is not known yet. The most detailed picture of the tertiary structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> 5S rRNA has emerged from models reconstructed on the basis of crystallographic and cryo-EM analysis of the large ribosomal subunit or the whole 70S ribosome from bacteria and archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11">4&#x02013;11</xref>). Beyond this contribution, these studies revealed that 5S rRNA, in conjunction with proteins L5, L18 and L25, forms the central protuberance of the large ribosomal subunit. Extending from there it connects the upper part of the large subunit with the peptidyl transferase (PTase) center and the binding site of elongation factor EF-G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Consistent with this 5S rRNA topography, cross-linking and foot printing analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15 B16">12&#x02013;16</xref>), site-directed mutagenesis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> screening of RNA motifs interacting with 5S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) have indicated that 5S rRNA interacts with multiple functional regions of 23S rRNA in <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomes, including helices 38 and 39, the terminal loop of helix 89, and sites between nucleosides 2272&#x02013;2345 in domain V. In parallel, mutagenesis studies in 5S rRNA from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and functional substitution of 5S rRNA within <italic>Thermus aquaticus</italic> ribosomes by antibiotics interacting simultaneously with domains II and V of 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) demonstrated that 5S rRNA is actively involved in different ribosomal functions. Combined with early studies on the reconstitution of active 50S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), this extensive investigation on the structural and functional role of 5S rRNA led to the hypothesis that 5S rRNA assists in stabilizing the PTase center and in facilitating communication between different functional centers of the ribosome. Nevertheless, despite the tendency in this series of experiments to attribute all of the observed effects to 5S rRNA, it is in certain cases difficult to distinguish the role of 5S rRNA <italic>per se</italic> from that of the associated ribosomal proteins. An alternative experimental approach to investigate the functional role of 5S rRNA is to specifically alter its folding and to correlate the resulting conformational changes with alterations in the function of the 50S ribosomal subunit. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Three-dimensional representation showing the ABA-spermine cross-linking sites in 5S rRNA.

For instance, spermine has been found to stabilize the secondary and tertiary structure of 5S rRNA quite strongly, more so and in a different way than Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). This was attributed to the hydrogen bonds afforded by all the primary and secondary amines of spermine. Obviously, to unveil the molecular basis of spermine effect on the structure and function of 5S rRNA, the localization of polyamine binding sites on 5S rRNA is a prerequisite.</p><p>In the present study, mapping of spermine binding sites in 5S rRNA was achieved by photo-affinity labeling of 5S rRNA, either free in solution or as part of 50S subunits or whole ribosomes. In each case, the cross-linking sites were identified by primer extension analysis. As expected, binding of spermine to 5S rRNA caused changes in the conformation of 5S rRNA. The influence of these changes on several ribosomal properties was investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>[&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP and [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P] GTP were obtained from Izotop (Budapest, Hungary).

The entire 5S rRNA, except its extreme 3&#x02032;-end (nucleosides 95&#x02013;120), was analyzed in this way.

To confirm the results of primer extension analysis and to search for possible photoincorporation into positions non-recognizable by reverse transcriptase, samples were first hybridized with selected pairs of 11-deoxynucleotides complementary to 5S rRNA at positions 40 nts apart, digested with RNase H, and applied to a 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide/7M urea gel for analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). 5S rRNA, untreated or photolabeled, was modified with DMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), and then subjected to primer extension analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Kinetics of ABA-spermine cross-linking</title><p>The number of cross-linking sites, the dissociation constant (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>) of the reversible complex between 5S rRNA (R) and the photoprobe (L) and the Hill coefficient were estimated as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).

Cross-links are marked with red (cross-linking in naked 5S rRNA), blue (cross-linking in 50S subunit) and green arrows (cross-linking in POST-complex). Long arrows, strong cross-links; medium arrows, intermediate-strength cross-links; short arrows, weak cross-links.

The primarily labeled nucleosides in single-stranded regions were A and C (84%), while in double-stranded regions the label was more equally distributed among the four nucleosides. In most cases, reverse transcriptase stopped at a single nucleoside. Only three exceptions were recorded, in which two adjacent nucleosides were modified; the one closer to the 3&#x02032;-terminus corresponded to a band with stronger intensity. Such a profile is probably due to a &#x02018;stuttering&#x02019; of reverse transcriptase, observed also previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Evidence for site-specific photo-incorporation was sought by running in parallel control experiments, in which spermine was added in excess in the incubation mixture during photolabeling. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, the authentic stops of reverse transciptase are essentially abolished under such conditions. As detected by additional experiments, spermine exhibited the best competition potency, compared with spermidine and putrescine. Monovalent ions, such as Na<sup>+</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> did not compete, while Mg<sup>2+</sup> decreased the labeling of 5S rRNA in a specific and dose-dependent manner. At 10&#x02009;mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, a 10% reduction in photolabeling was recorded; nucleosides U32, A73, A52, A53, C71, A73 and U80 were the cross-linking residues most affected by Mg<sup>2+</sup>. In contrast, the cross-linking pattern for the remaining positions was not significantly altered.</p><p>An important feature of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B is that the cross-linking pattern depends on the photoprobe concentration and the assembly status of the target molecule. With regards to the former factor, an increase of ABA-spermine concentration from 50 to 300&#x02009;&#x003bc;M enhanced the susceptibility of A52, A53 and G56 to the photoprobe, while it reduced the cross-linking at nucleosides G67 and A73. In addition, the increase of photoprobe concentration resulted in enrichment of cross-linking by additional sites dispersed throughout the 5S rRNA molecule. Assembly of 50S subunit resulted in protection of several positions from cross-linking by ABA-spermine, especially of nucleosides belonging to helices III and V and to loops C, D and E. In contrast, it favored cross-linking to helix II and loop B. Finally, when 50S subunit was incorporated into the ribosomal POST-complex, a conspicuous change in the susceptibility of several nucleosides against ABA-spermine was recorded. Namely, nucleosides A46, C47, A52, A59, C62, G69 and A73 were freshly protected, while C42 and A108 exhibited increased protection.</p><p>Chemical probing experiments using DMS indicated that the protection pattern of 5S rRNA changes, when it is incorporated into 50 subunits. In agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), nucleosides C11, A15, C35, A57, A58, A59, A66, A73 and A99 became protected, while nucleoside A78 became more accessible. Formation of the ribosomal POST-complex reduced the susceptibility of nucleosides C38 and A45 against DMS, but increased the reactivity of A15 and A52. On the other hand, cross-linking of ABA-spermine induced further alterations in the reactivity of 5S rRNA towards DMS by increasing the accessibility of some positions and decreasing the accessibility of others. The results of the latter experiments are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. <table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Reactivity against DMS

Two factors may cause such an effect. First, photolabeling of 5S rRNA molecule may directly influence the ability of the reconstituted particles to associate with 30S subunits. Second, reduced ability could be the result of an impaired reconstitution, and thus of a decrease in the net fraction of the 50S subunits. In order to discriminate between these two possibilities, the crude product was subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation and the yield of reconstitution was estimated. As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, ribosomal particles deprived of 5S rRNA sedimented at about 47S. Such particles, upon association with native 30S subunits, led to the formation of 62S ribosomal complexes. When 5S rRNA photolabeled with 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;M ABA-spermine was used as a component of the reconstitution mixture, both 50S and 47S particles were obtained, thus resulting in a decreased yield of 50S subunits. However, isolated 50S subunits from this mixture were fully active at associating with native 30S subunits and forming 70S ribosomes. In contrast, photolabeling of 5S rRNA with 300&#x02009;&#x003bc;M ABA-spermine prior to its use in the reconstitution experiments, disturbed more dramatically both the yield of 50S subunits and their capability to associate with native 30S subunits. <table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Effect of 5S rRNA photolabeling on 50S ribosomal subunit assembly and the ability of the assembled particles to associate with native 30S ribosomal subunits</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">5S rRNA species<sup>a</sup></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">% Reconstitution<sup>b</sup></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">% Association of ribosomal subunits<sup>c</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wild-type</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">70.0 &#x000b1; 2.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">None</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.d<sup>d</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.7 &#x000b1; 5.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Labeled with 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;M ABA-spermine</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.5 &#x000b1; 7.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">73.5 &#x000b1; 5.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Labeled with 300&#x02009;&#x003bc;M ABA-spermine</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.8 &#x000b1; 3.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.5 &#x000b1; 3.7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF2"><p><sup>a</sup>5S rRNA samples were 3&#x02032;-labeled with [<sup>32</sup>P] before reconstitution into 50S particles. <sup>b</sup>The values of % reconstitution have been normalized to the yield of reconstitution achieved with wild-type 5S rRNA. <sup>c</sup>Native 30S subunits were added in a two-molar excess over 50S particles in order to yield the maximum level of association.

AcPhe-tRNA binding to both sites was remarkably improved in the presence of 50 &#x003bc;M spermine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). At higher molar ratio of AcPhe-tRNA to ribosomes (2:1) or at higher concentrations of spermine (300&#x02009;&#x003bc;M), the binding was further improved.

For the construction of PRE-complexes, poly(U)-programmed 70S ribosomes were incubated for 20&#x02009;min at 37&#x000b0;C with tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> (molar ratio to ribosomes 2&#x02009;:&#x02009;1) in order to pre-fill the P-site.

Subsequently, Ac[<sup>3</sup>H]Phe-tRNA was added (molar ratio 2:1) and incubated for an additional 20&#x02009;min at 37&#x000b0;C to allow non-enzymatic A-site binding (PRE-complex). Ribosomal complexes prepared in this way were reactive against puromycin to &#x0223c;20%.

This means that more than 80% of the bound AcPhe-tRNA sampled the classical A/A binding state. Our results are in agreement with previous observations that <italic>N</italic>-protected aminoacyl-tRNAs bound in a pre-translocation state on the ribosome generally occupy the classical A/A site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).

In the absence of EF-G, however, translocation was much slower and proceeded in a linear fashion at least up to 30&#x02009;min. Spermine either free or covalently bound to 5S rRNA improved spontaneous translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). To examine the effect of spermine on EF-G requirements for efficient translocation, increasing amounts of EF-G were added in buffer B containing PRE-complex at fixed concentration, and translocation was allowed to proceed for 5&#x02009;min at 25&#x000b0;C. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, the extent of translocation in each case followed a hyperbolic curve reaching the same plateau at high concentrations of EF-G. Nevertheless, the concentration of EF-G at which 50% translocation was achieved, differed. Namely, PRE-complexes exposed to free spermine or possessing covalently bound spermine at their 5S rRNA required lower concentrations of EF-G for efficient translocation.<fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Effect of ABA-spermine cross-linking to 5S rRNA on translocation.

To clear this point, we applied the following two approaches: First, we used fusidic acid, an antibiotic that binds to the EF-G&#x000b7;GDP-ribosome complex and prevents dissociation of EF-G&#x000b7;GDP from the ribosome. Under these conditions, the EF-G&#x000b7;GDP-ribosome complex is stalled in a post-translocation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Employment of [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P] GTP in the assay allows the indirect estimation of EF-G binding, by measuring the trapped radioactivity on ribosomes relative to controls incubated in the absence of EF-G. The results from these experiments are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>. It is evident that exposure of whole PRE-complexes to free spermine or covalent attachment of spermine to their 5S rRNA promotes EF-G binding. Similar treatment of P-complex or empty ribosomes results in analogous improvement of EF-G binding. Nevertheless, it is apparent from the data shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref> that the interaction of EF-G with the ribosome is generally stimulated when deacylated tRNA occupies the P-site. In agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), ribosomes deprived of 5S rRNA were almost inactive to bind EF-G. Second, the capacity of PRE-complex to activate hydrolysis of GTP by EF-G was determined. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, the initial velocity of the reaction was found to be almost identical for either ribosomes reconstituted with wild-type or ribosomes containing photolabeled 5S rRNA, and similar to that possessed by native ribosomes, regardless of whether free spermine was present or not in the reaction mixture [compare panels (A) and (B) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>]. Similar behavior was exhibited by P-complex and empty ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), empty ribosomes or PRE-complex were less active in stimulating the GTPase activity of EF-G, compared with P-complex. Interestingly, ribosomal complexes deprived of 5S rRNA exhibited considerably reduced efficiency to activate the GTP hydrolysis by EF-G, much less than that reported by Dohme and Nierhaus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). <table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><p>Binding of EF-G&#x000b7;GTP complex to native and reconstituted ribosomes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ribosomal species<sup>a</sup></th><th colspan="6" rowspan="1">EF-G&#x000b7;GTP bound per ribosome<sup>b</sup></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th colspan="6" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th colspan="3" rowspan="1">-spermine</th><th colspan="3" rowspan="1">+spermine</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">PRE-</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">P-</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">empty</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">PRE-</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">P-</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">empty</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Native</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.48</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.79</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.52</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.93</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.98</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.94</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5S rRNA-deprived</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.02</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.09</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reconstituted with wild-type 5S-rRNA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.17</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.25</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.19</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.44</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.57</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.48</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reconstituted with photolabeled 5S-rRNA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.37</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.54</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.40</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.42</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.52</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.45</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF4"><p><sup>a</sup>Ribosomal complexes were prepared from native subunits, or from native 30S subunits and reconstituted 50S subunits (the latter with wild-type or modified 5S rRNA by 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;M ABA-spermine).

The rationale is that attachment of ABA-spermine to a nucleoside acts as a barrier for reverse transcriptase. This technique bypasses several disadvantages associated with other cross-linking methods utilizing homobifunctional reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). It has been successfully applied so far for mapping spermine binding sites in AcPhe-tRNA free or bound to the P-site of <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), as well as in ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and 16S and 23S rRNA naked or incorporated into ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). It should be mentioned that, apart from monovalent and divalent cations, polyamines too are important components of the ionic environment of ribosomes, playing an essential role in the structural integrity of ribosomes and hence, in translational accuracy and efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Although the existence of spermine in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells is questionable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), accumulated evidence supports the notion that almost all of the cellular functions of the naturally occurring polyamines can be fulfilled by spermine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). On the other hand, due to its four positive charges and the hydrogen bonds afforded by its primary and secondary amines, spermine is the most effective polyamine in stabilizing the RNA folding. Therefore, it can be experimentally used in micromolar concentrations, a very advantageous fact in bypassing artifacts associated with non-specific binding, frequently encountered in the application of photolabeling techniques.</p><p>The number of ABA-spermine cross-linking sites in 5S rRNA, determined in the present study by primer extension analysis, is higher than that calculated by Hill-plot analysis. This contradiction can be explained by the fact that apparently different cross-links localized to adjacent positions in the structure of 5S rRNA may represent the same binding site. To some degree, non-specific binding may also account for it. In fact, as revealed by competition experiments using natural polyamines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) or Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions as competitors, most of the cross-linking sites appear to be specific. The remaining sites are placed on the cytosolic surface of the large ribosomal subunit (C71), at the top edge of the central protuberance (U32, A52, and A53) or are located in defined electro-negative pockets (A73, U80). Nevertheless, independent of the specificity, polyamine binding to certain regions may be beneficial for the stabilization of the 5S rRNA tertiary structure and its communication with functional regions of 23S rRNA. Noteworthy is the binding of spermine within and around loop E, a region implicated in the binding of ribosomal protein L25. Crystal structure analysis of 5S rRNA fragments encompassing the loop E sequence, alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) or in complex with protein L25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), has demonstrated that loop E contains seven non-Watson&#x02013;Crick base-pairs stabilized by several Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Interestingly, molecular dynamics simulations revealed extensive binding of monovalent ions in the 5S rRNA loop E motif, even in the presence of 4&#x02013;5&#x02009;mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Most of the monovalent ion binding sites coincide (G98, U80) or are in close proximity (G105, G72, U77) to cross-linking sites of ABA-spermine. Another issue of importance is related to the occupancy of distant sites from the symmetry center (the G75-A101 pair) by freely diffusing ligands, like charged chemical groups belonging to proteins or drugs. Indeed, in a complex of L25 with a 5S rRNA fragment studied by Lu and Steitz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), an amino group of L25 binds close to U80. Therefore, polyamine binding to this site may modulate directly the interaction of 5S rRNA with protein L25. In contrast, sites located close to the symmetry center display high electronegative potential. This implies that ions associated with these regions may be more difficult to displace. In line, we observed that binding of ABA-spermine to A73 is highly resistant to competition by monovalent cations. Other examples of cross-linking, which may interfere in protein binding, are related to helices II and III, and loops B and C. Crystallographic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>) as well as foot printing and cross-linking data [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>)] have indicated that these regions constitute the primary binding sites for proteins L5 and L18. Detailed analysis of <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> ribosomal protein L5 in complex with a 34-nt fragment comprising helix III and loop C of <italic>E. coli</italic> 5S rRNA revealed that nucleosides C42 and C43 are involved in both hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding with no polar and side chain atoms of L5, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). It is noteworthy that these residues of loop C are susceptible to ABA-spermine cross-linking, regardless of the 5S rRNA assembly status or the photoprobe concentration.</p><p>Photolabeling of 5S rRNA with 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;M ABA-spermine causes profound changes in the susceptibility of several nucleosides in 5S rRNA against DMS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that binding of spermine to 5S rRNA promotes changes in its folding. Namely, loop A adopts an apparent &#x02018;loosening&#x02019; of its structure, while loops C, D, E and helix III achieve a more tight structure. These findings are consistent with previous observations obtained by means of calorimetric studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Photolabeling of 5S rRNA with 300&#x02009;&#x003bc;M ABA-spermine results to a conformer, which does not meet the operational definition of the &#x02018;A&#x02019; form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). 50S subunits reconstituted from 5S rRNA modified in this way associate with native small ribosomal subunits at low yield (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) and are functionally inactive.</p><p>The yield of the 50S rRNA subunit reconstitution obtained by 5S rRNA photolabeled with 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;M ABA-spermine was found to be approximately half that achieved with wild-type 5S rRNA. Kakegawa <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>) indicated that the <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of 50S particles from 23S rRNA, 5S rRNA and TP50 is not influenced greatly by polyamines. On the other hand, there is evidence that 5S rRNA undergoes conformational changes during its assembly into the central protuberance of the 50S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). In agreement, we observed that some of the ABA-spermine crosslinks in 5S rRNA get more pronounced in the 50S subunit than in the isolated state, clearly indicating that 5S rRNA undergoes conformational changes upon incorporation into ribosomes. Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that ABA-spermine cross-linking, although not directly affecting the reconstitution process, may hinder the required conformational changes by stabilizing a rigid conformation in 5S rRNA. In support of this hypothesis, labeling of 5S rRNA with 300&#x02009;&#x003bc;M ABA-spermine reduces further its incorporation into 50S subunits. In contrast to 50S subunits containing 5S rRNA photolabeled with ABA-spermine at 300&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, those assembled from 5S rRNA photolabeled with ABA-spermine at 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;M were fully active in associating with native 30S subunits.</p><p>The loop B &#x02192;loop C arm in 5S rRNA is the most affected region by ABA-spermine photolabeling. A great body of experimental data has previously demonstrated that this region participates in several signal transmission chains connecting 5S rRNA with P-site-bound tRNA. For instance, this region binds protein L5 which interacts with the T-loop of P-site bound tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#x02013;8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Our data show that photolabeling of 5S rRNA with 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;M ABA-spermine results in a subtle but visible stimulation of the AcPhe-tRNA binding to the P-site. Binding to the A-site is not affected, albeit loop B &#x02192;loop C arm is near the tip of H38 of 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) which communicates via protein S13 of the small subunit (bridge B1a) with the anticodon region of A-site-bound tRNA. In fact, several studies revealed that loss of contacts between protein S13 and H38 has little consequences on tRNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53 B54 B55 B56">53&#x02013;56</xref>). Whole ribosomes containing either wild-type or photolabeled 5S rRNA, exhibit greater capacity for AcPhe-tRNA binding to the A-site in the presence of free spermine than in its absence. In this case, however, 30S subunit and AcPhe-tRNA also interact with spermine, a fact that favors tRNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), we observed that omission of 5S rRNA from the large subunit suppresses AcPhe-tRNA binding, in particular to the A-site. Such ribosomes, even though provided with free spermine, cannot recover from the lack of 5S rRNA.</p><p>Ribosomes containing photolabeled 5S rRNA exhibit 30% higher PTase activity than those containing wild-type 5S rRNA. Catalysis of peptide bond formation is mediated almost entirely through precise alignment of the A- and P-substrates within the active center, coupled to substrate-assisted catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that besides the effect of the 5S rRNA photolabeling on the affinity of P-site, the signals transmitted from 5S rRNA via protein L5 to the P-site may also affect the functional positioning of AcPhe-tRNA within the catalytic center. Since the affinity of puromycin for the A-site is not altered upon 5S rRNA photolabeleling, analogous effects on the A-site cannot be postulated. Ribosomes deprived of 5S rRNA retain 10% of their PTase activity, in agreement with previous observations according to which 5S rRNA enhances ribosomal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) but is not absolutely essential for it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>).</p><p>Spontaneous translocation is an inherent property of the ribosome itself, even though extremely slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). This is verified by the present work, also showing that reversible interaction of spermine with whole ribosomes or covalent binding of ABA-spermine to 5S rRNA stimulate EF-G-independent translocation. This prompted us to suggest that certain changes in the folding of ribosomal RNA may be beneficial to the translocation of tRNAs. Supporting evidence is provided by DMS-protection results, indicating that the region around the G1338-U1341 ridge in the small-subunit head and A790 terminal loop in the platform achieves a more &#x02018;open'structure upon ABA-spermine photo-incorporation. Crystallographic studies in <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomes have postulated that the gap left between the G1338-U1341 ridge and A790 operates as a &#x02018;lock&#x02019;, controlling the passage of the P-site tRNA anticodon stem-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). Steady-state data derived in the present work show that translocation in the presence of high concentrations of EF-G and GTP is fast, even in the absence of polyamines. Therefore, monitoring the ABA-spermine cross-linking effect on EF-G-dependent translocation is impossible, without using rapid kinetic techniques. Following an alternative approach, we found that interaction of spermine with the whole ribosome or with its 5S rRNA has a sparing effect on EF-G requirements. Further experiments revealed that photoincorporation of ABA-spermine into 5S rRNA does not affect the initial rate of EF-G catalyzed GTP hydrolysis by 70S ribosomes, but enhances the binding of EF-G to ribosomes. In agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), we found that ribosomes deprived of 5S rRNA retain some EF-G-dependent GTPase activity but are unable to bind efficiently EF-G, even in the presence of spermine. The EF-G binding site in ribosome consists of the GTPase-associated center (GAC) located in domain II of 23S rRNA (helices H42-H44) and the sarcin&#x02013;ricin loop (SRL) located in domain VI of 23S rRNA (helix H95) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Direct contacts of 5S rRNA with GAC, SRL or EF-G have not been identified so far in <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomes. Nevertheless, accumulated evidence suggests that several allosteric signal transmission pathways set 5S rRNA off coordinating the PTase reaction with subsequent EF-G&#x000b7;GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17 B18">12&#x02013;18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, a comprehensive view of the 5S rRNA nucleotide residues involved in spermine binding is obtained by the present study. The results suggest that binding of spermine to 5S rRNA causes conformational changes in certain regions of the molecule. Consequently, these changes have beneficial effects on the ribosome functioning. The general improvement observed in various functional tests is an important argument that the identified sites in 5S rRNA may have an important functional relevance to the overall active structure of the ribosome.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm546_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm546_nar-00871-r-2007-File007.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Dennis Synetos for critical reading of the manuscript and Panagiotis Karahalios for assistance with 5S rRNA preparation.
