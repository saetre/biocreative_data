The <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> null retina has a reduced ganglion cell layer (GCL), with loss of late-born differentiated retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) due to increased apoptosis. TrkB signaling is proposed to regulate the dynamics of RGC apoptosis throughout development. DLX2 expression markedly precedes the onset of TrkB expression in the GCL; TrkB co-expression with <italic>Dlx2</italic> and RGC markers is well-established by E13.5. In the <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> null retina, <italic>TrkB</italic> expression is significantly reduced by E16.5. We demonstrated that DLX2 binds to a specific region of the TrkB promoter in retinal neuroepithelium during embryogenesis. <italic>In vitro</italic> confirmation and the functional consequences of DLX2 binding to this TrkB regulatory region support TrkB as a <italic>Dlx2</italic> transcriptional target. Furthermore, ectopic <italic>Dlx2</italic> expression in retinal explants activates TrkB expression and <italic>Dlx2</italic> knockdown in primary retinal cultures results in reduced TrkB expression. RGC differentiation and survival require the coordinated expression of transcription factors. This study establishes a direct transcriptional relationship between a homeodomain protein involved in RGC differentiation and a neurotrophin receptor implicated in RGC survival. Signaling mediated by TrkB may contribute to survival of late-born RGCs whose terminal differentiation is regulated by <italic>Dlx</italic> gene function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>During vertebrate retinogenesis several distinct cell types are generated from retinal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In the mouse, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are generated first followed by cones, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, rods, bipolar cells and M&#x000fc;ller glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>). In the murine retina, RGCs are born between embryonic day (E) 10 and postnatal day (P) 2 with a maximal birth rate at E15. Cell death occurs during RGC genesis in two distinct phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The first phase occurs at E15.5 and corresponds with the peak of RGC neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The second occurs after birth, peaking at P2 and correlates with the elaboration of RGC projections to the superior colliculus (SC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>The vertebrate <italic>Distal-less</italic> (<italic>Dlx</italic>) homeobox gene family consists of six murine members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) organized into three bigenic gene clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>). Four <italic>Dlx</italic> family members have been implicated in neurogenesis in the mouse: <italic>Dlx1, Dlx2, Dlx5</italic> and <italic>Dlx6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>) with <italic>Dlx1</italic> and <italic>Dlx2</italic> further implicated in retinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>). Previous work established that <italic>Dlx1</italic> and <italic>Dlx2</italic> are both expressed in the retinal neuroepithelium by E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Expression of <italic>Dlx1</italic> becomes largely restricted to the ganglion cell layer (GCL); perinatally, its expression is down-regulated. <italic>Dlx2</italic> is expressed throughout the lifetime of the mouse with expression becoming restricted to RGCs, amacrine and horizontal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Characterization of the <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> null mouse demonstrated loss of approximately one-third of RGCs at E18.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> mutant retinas contain disproportionately higher numbers of RGCs born prior to E13.5 and a decreased population of later born RGCs, with loss of RGCs due to increased apoptosis between E13.5 and E18.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). RGC numbers in the adult <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> mutant retina cannot be determined as mutants die perinatally. The molecular mechanisms underlying RGC apoptosis in the <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> double knockout retina have not been established.</p><p>TrkB, a member of the neurotrophin receptor family encoded by the <italic>NTRK2</italic> gene, demonstrates specific binding affinity for brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin NT4/5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20">18&#x02013;20</xref>). Target-derived BDNF signaling via TrkB modulates cell death during RGC neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Null mutation of the catalytic domain of the <italic>TrkB<sub>FL</sub></italic> receptor results in a dose-dependent increase in the peak RGC death rate, although final RGC numbers remain normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the role of <italic>Dlx</italic> genes in the processes of RGC differentiation and survival, we have tested the hypothesis that DLX2 regulates TrkB expression during retinal development. We show that DLX2 expression precedes TrkB in the embryonic GCL by 1&#x02013;2 days with DLX2 expressing retinal neuroepithelial cells co-expressing TrkB upon migration to the inner retina. As well, DLX2 directly binds to a specific TrkB proximal promoter region <italic>in vivo</italic>, and functions as a transcriptional activator of TrkB expression <italic>in vitro</italic>. We also demonstrate that loss or gain of <italic>Dlx2</italic> function results in a corresponding decrease or increase of TrkB expression within the developing retina.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animal and tissue preparation</title><p>Wild-type tissues were obtained from the CD-1 (ICR) BR Swiss strain of albino mice (Charles River Laboratories, Worcester, MA, USA). <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> knockout mice were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).

Onset of TrkB expression occurred at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) with expression occurring in migrating cells in the central retinal neuroepithelium, the anatomic region from which the ganglion cell layer (GCL) originates. Some non-specific staining is evident adjacent to ventricles, along epithelial edges and in the peripheral region of the retina. This is an artefact of the immunohistochemical staining procedure, when the antibody has minimal epitope to bind (data not shown). At E13.5 there is extensive expression of TrkB in the vitreal (inner) region of the central retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). TrkB expression in the inner retina continues throughout embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D) with expression restricted to the recently established GCL. By P14 lamination of the murine retina is established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). TrkB expression is found in the GCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E, arrows) without expression identified in the inner nuclear layer (INL) or outer nuclear layer (ONL). In the adult retina, expression of TrkB remains primarily restricted to the GCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F, arrows). However, expression of TrkB can now be identified in the INL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F, asterisk) and in the corresponding inner plexiform layer (IPL). Expression of many amacrine cell subtype markers occurs very late in retinogenesis; a good example is tyrosine hydroxylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The onset of Trkb expression in amacrine cells is after P14 (also refer to Supplementary Figure 3C). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Characterization of TrkB protein expression in the developing murine retina.

When evaluating these experiments, it is important to note that up to 50% of cells in the GCL are displaced amacrine cells in adult murine retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Co-expression with Brn3b and Islet1 transcription factors, markers expressed in RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33">31&#x02013;33</xref>) confirmed that TrkB expressing cells in the GCL were indeed RGCs (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2). Co-localization of TrkB with Islet1 and Brn3B was detected at E13.5 indicating that the onset of TrkB expression begins soon after establishment of RGC differentiation (Supplementary Figure 1C, <italic>Islet1</italic>; Supplementary Figure 2C, <italic>Brn3B</italic>). Co-localization with syntaxin, a marker of amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) was identified in the IPL and in a subpopulation of cells in the INL of the adult retina (Supplementary Figure 3C). Interestingly, there was no co-expression with choline acetyl-transferase (ChAT), a marker of cholinergic amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) (Supplementary Figure 3F) indicating that only a subset of amacrine cells express TrkB. Co-expression could not be detected with markers of horizontal (Prox1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) or bipolar cells (Chx10, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).

In this study, DLX2 immunostaining was first detected in the dorsal retinal neuroepithelium by E11.5, where early RGC begin to differentiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). DLX2-expressing cells are found in both dorsal and ventral retina by E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E) with only rare TrkB co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F); however, those cells co-expressing TrkB can be readily identified by E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>I). In the E13.5 presumptive GCL, the proportion of cells expressing DLX2 is 41.5%, TrkB is 18.2% and those cells co-expressing DLX2 and TrkB is 8.7%. DLX2/TrkB double-positive cells are found in the inner retina at this stage with DLX2 single-positive cells located in the outer retina. These DLX2 single-positive cells primarily identify later born neurons migrating to the inner retina. By E16.5, the majority of DLX2 expressing neurons are located in the inner retina in the newly established GCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>K). There is now extensive co-expression with TrkB among the DLX2 positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>L). TrkB single-positive cells can be identified in the GCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>L, arrows) at this stage as well as DLX2 single-positive cells migrating from the outer retina to the inner retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>L, asterisk). By E18.5 DLX2/TrkB co-expressing cells are predominant throughout the GCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>O). TrkB single-positive cells can still be identified but now constitute a minority of the TrkB population in the GCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>O, arrows). DLX2 single-positive cells are also evident in the inner neuroblastic layer (NBL) as the INL begins to be established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>O, asterisks). In the adult retina, co-expression of DLX2 and TrkB is found amongst RGCs in the GCL as well as in the INL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>R, arrows, asterisk). TrkB single-positive neurons in the GCL and INL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>R, plus) are now rare. These results demonstrate that the onset of DLX2 expression precedes TrkB expression in the embryonic GCL by 1&#x02013;2 days. The onset of TrkB expression amongst DLX2-expressing neurons appears upon their migration to the inner retina. This finding supports DLX2's potential role as a transcriptional regulator of TrkB expression in this RGC population. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Co-localization of TrkB with DLX2 in the murine retina.

Whereas TrkB expression in the murine retina has primarily focused on post-natal expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), we have demonstrated that TrkB expression in the murine retina begins at E12.5. Expression in central retinal neuroepithelial cells was coincidental with cells migrating from the proliferative region of the outer retina to the inner retina where differentiation occurs. In post-natal retina, expression of TrkB was restricted to the GCL and INL. Co-expression studies concluded that TrkB expression was restricted to RGCs, from E13.5, and in amacrine cells, but only in the mature retina. While TrkB expression within adult murine RGCs has been well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), its expression in amacrine cells in the mouse has not been previously described, although this data supports earlier reports of TrkB expression in rat amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>).</p><p>TrkB expression by E12.5 is significant as it demonstrates a much earlier onset of expression than previously reported. Initial RGC genesis begins at E10 with extensive RGC genesis occurring 2 days later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Our results suggest that TrkB expression occurs in these cells shortly after acquisition of RGC identity and TrkB may play a role in survival of RGCs during early retinogenesis. Nearly 50% of RGCs die during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) in two distinct phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Previous studies have implicated TrkB in the regulation of the RGC death rate during the second post-natal phase when RGC projections form connections within the SC via target-derived BDNF signaling through TrkB in the early post-natal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The first phase of RGC death occurs pre-natally with a peak at approximately E15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). This early phase of cell death may be mediated by signaling through the p75 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Our results demonstrating early TrkB expression suggest that TrkB may also be involved in the regulation of RGC death during this first phase. The TrkB ligand BDNF is expressed in the murine retina as early as E10.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) providing further evidence for TrkB signaling facilitating pre-natal RGC survival.</p></sec><sec><title>DLX2 directly binds and activates transcription of a TrkB regulatory element</title><p>In this study, we have demonstrated that the onset of DLX2 expression begins in the dorsal retina at E11.5, earlier than previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). DLX2 expression is maintained throughout retinogenesis with expression restricted to RGCs, amacrine cells and horizontal cells in the murine retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). We have demonstrated that DLX2 expression precedes the expression of TrkB by 1&#x02013;2 days in the GCL and that DLX2-expressing neurons co-express TrkB in RGCs and amacrine cells. At E13.5, co-expression is limited to those DLX2-positive cells that have migrated to the nascent GCL. However, migrating DLX2+ neurons remain largely TrkB negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>I). By E16.5 and E18.5 when migration is complete for most DLX2-positive cells, TrkB is co-expressed in nearly all observed DLX2+ cells in the GCL. The same pattern of DLX2 expression preceding TrkB expression was observed among amacrine cells in the GCL and INL. The spatio-temporal pattern of DLX2 and TrkB expression suggests the possibility that DLX2 may play a role in the transcriptional regulation of TrkB.</p><p>Little is known about the transcriptional regulation of TrkB. Thyroid hormone down-regulates TrkB expression in the rat brain through a novel response element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Retinoic acid treatment of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells induces a neuronal differentiation process featuring increased TrkB expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated that the bHLH proteins E47 and NeuroD directly bind to E-boxes within the proximal TrkB promoter activating TrkB expression in SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Moreover, the Wilm's tumor transcription factor Wt1 activates TrkB by binding a Wt1 consensus motif in the human NTRK2 promoter. This regulation is necessary for the expression of TrkB in the epicardium and intramyocardial blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Herein, utilizing chromatin immunoprecipitation of embryonic retinal tissues, we have demonstrated that DLX2 directly binds to specific homeodomain-binding motifs within the <italic>TrkB</italic> promoter (termed R1-pro) <italic>in vivo</italic>. Specificity of DLX2 protein&#x02013;TrkB promoter DNA interactions was confirmed by EMSA <italic>in vitro</italic> using recombinant DLX2 and nuclear extracts expressing endogenous DLX2 obtained from embryonic retina. Mutation of either candidate homeodomain DNA-binding region resulted in loss of specific gel shifts. Reporter gene assays demonstrated that DLX2 binding to R1-pro was functionally significant as there was transcriptional activation of this response elements and this activation was abrogated by mutating either TAAT/ATTA DNA-binding motif <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>The temporal relationship of DLX2 and TrkB expression in subpopulations of RGCs, identification of DLX2 protein&#x02013;TrkB DNA sequence complexes in embryonic retina <italic>in vivo</italic>, together with the transcriptional activation of these <italic>TrkB</italic> gene regulatory elements <italic>in vitro</italic> suggest that DLX2 may act to regulate <italic>TrkB</italic> gene expression in these RGCs to maintain their survival. These results demonstrate for the first time the regulation of TrkB gene expression by a homeodomain transcription factor. This study establishes a direct transcriptional relationship between a homeodomain protein involved in the differentiation of RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and a neurotrophin receptor implicated in RGC survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Loss or gain of DLX2 function alters expression of TrkB in the developing retina</title><p><italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> double mutant mice have increased embryonic retinal apoptosis resulting in a specific loss of approximately one-third of RGCs by E18.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). We have demonstrated decreased TrkB expression in the <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> double knockout mouse. Importantly, a significant reduction of TrkB-expressing cells can be identified by E16.5 with this loss detected as early as E13.5. Thus, loss of TrkB expression precedes reduction of RGC numbers between E16.5 and E18.5 in the <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> double mutant. Establishing this time-line is important; a decreased RGC population would affect TrkB quantification, since TrkB is primarily expressed in this retinal cell subclass. Reduced TrkB expression prior to detection of RGC loss in the <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> mutant retina suggests a mechanism that may contribute to the increased RGC apoptosis. Moreover, acute knockdown of <italic>Dlx2</italic> expression in wild-type primary dissociated embryonic retinal cultures, also results in decreased TrkB expression. Rodent RGCs appear to be very sensitive to RNAi, with adult RGC in culture also showing efficient knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). These <italic>Dlx2</italic> knockdown experiments support our observations of significant reduction of retinal TrkB expression with the loss of both <italic>Dlx1</italic> and <italic>Dlx2</italic> function. Other transcription factors besides <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> are likely required for the expression of TrkB, since a large proportion of TrkB-expressing cells remain in the <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> mutant retina. These unidentified genes are probably genetically upstream of <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> or in parallel pathways. Recently, the basic HLH gene <italic>Mash1</italic> has been shown to bind to a region of the <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> intergenic enhancer, using ChIP assays of developing forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). However, regulation of <italic>Dlx</italic> expression by Mash1 in embryonic retina has not yet been addressed.</p><p>We have shown that ectopic <italic>Dlx2</italic> expression driven by retroviral transduction of retinal explant cultures is sufficient for increased TrkB expression. Forced <italic>Dlx2</italic> expression also leads to increased expression of RGC and amacrine cell markers, although ectopic <italic>Dlx2</italic> expression may have occurred in both RGC as well as non-RGC progenitor populations. Hence, DLX2 promotes the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells toward an RGC or amacrine cell fate. Although TrkB is expressed in both RGCs and amacrine cells, it remains unclear whether RGC survival is facilitated by the TrkB signaling pathway. In support of this hypothesis, NeuroD, shown to directly activate TrkB expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>) is sufficient to drive amacrine cell genesis, although it is not required for amacrine cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>).</p><p>Somewhat unexpected was our observation that forced expression of <italic>Dlx1</italic> by retroviral transduction did not alter expression of TrkB or any retinal cell class marker. The <italic>Dlx1</italic>/<italic>Dlx2</italic> double mutant demonstrates the requirement for both <italic>Dlx1</italic> and <italic>Dlx2</italic> function for correct CNS development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). In the retina, <italic>Dlx1</italic> is expressed by E12.5 but its expression is downregulated at or just prior to birth, dependent on the mouse strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). DLX2, but not DLX1, binds to the <italic>Dlx5/Dlx6</italic> intergenic enhancer in neonatal forebrain and retina <italic>in vivo</italic> and only <italic>Dlx2</italic> activates expression of this enhancer element <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). We have primarily addressed <italic>Dlx2</italic> function in this manuscript due to the availability of specific polyclonal antibodies to study DLX2 expression and perform immunoprecipitation and &#x02018;supershift&#x02019; gel shift assays. Of interest, DLX2 may be a more &#x02018;active&#x02019; transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) or repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) than DLX1. In co-transfection experiments, <italic>Dlx1</italic> and <italic>Dlx2</italic> are not synergistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Although our results support a limited requirement for <italic>Dlx1</italic> in retinal neurogenesis, loss of <italic>Dlx1</italic> function may also have a contribution to the retinal phenotype of the <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> double knockouts.</p><p>TrkB signaling has been demonstrated to inhibit the death of immature RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Mice with null mutations of <italic>TrkB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) have increased rates of RGC death during development. Similar increased developmental cell death within the <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> double mutant retina is also observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Interestingly, loss of function of TrkB or BDNF does not affect the final number of RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Therefore, independent mechanisms are proposed for the regulation of final RGC numbers. Within the <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> double mutant mouse there is a marked loss of cells expressing RGC markers. <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> knockout mice die shortly after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Consequently, the RGC phenotype of the mature retina of these mutants remains unknown. Studies of forebrain neurogenesis in <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> double mutants have demonstrated defects in interneuron differentiation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). Hence, loss of <italic>Dlx</italic> function likely results in a more severe retinal phenotype than that displayed by TrkB mutation alone. The identification of other <italic>Dlx</italic> transcriptional targets in the retina may provide further insights into the role of <italic>Dlx</italic> genes during retinal cell differentiation and survival.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm1099_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm1099_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm1099_nar-02253-d-2007-File010.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by graduate studentships from the Institute of Genetics, Canadian Institutes of Health Research (J.D.M.) and the Manitoba Health Research Council (J.D.M.), a graduate studentship from the Manitoba Institute of Child Health (Q.Z.) and operating grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research ROP65570 (D.D.E.) and the Foundation Fighting Blindness-Canada (J.T.W., D.D.E.).
