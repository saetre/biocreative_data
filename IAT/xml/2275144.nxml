In particular, MAD1 has been demonstrated to interfere with MYC-induced proliferation, transformation and apoptosis. The <italic>MAD1</italic> gene is expressed in distinct patterns, mainly associated with differentiation and quiescence. We observed that <italic>MAD1</italic> is directly activated by G-CSF in promyelocytic cell lines. To investigate the transcriptional regulation of the human <italic>MAD1</italic> gene, we have cloned and characterized its promoter. A region of high homology between the <italic>MAD1</italic> orthologs of human, mouse and rat contains the core promoter, marked by open chromatin, high GC content and the lack of a TATA box. Using deletion constructs we identified two CCAAT-boxes occupied by C/EBP&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; in the homology region that mediate responsiveness to G-CSF receptor signaling. The necessary signals include the activation of STAT3 and the RAS/RAF/ERK pathway. STAT3 does not bind directly to promoter DNA, but is recruited by C/EBP&#x003b2;. In summary, our studies provide a first analysis of the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter and suggest STAT3 functions as a C/EBP&#x003b2; cofactor in the regulation of the <italic>MAD1</italic> gene. Our findings provide the base for the characterization of additional signal transduction pathways that control the expression of <italic>MAD1</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The transcription factors of the MYC/MAX/MAD network have evolved as critical regulators of many aspects of cell physiology, including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Furthermore, extensive work documents that MYC functions as an oncoprotein both in human tumors and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). The proteins of this network form dimeric complexes containing one MAX protein and one member of the MYC or MAD group of proteins or MAX itself. Dimer formation is a prerequisite for sequence-specific DNA binding, both being mediated by the bHLHZip domains, highly conserved regions common to all MYC/MAX/MAD network members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In general, DNA-bound MYC/MAX heterodimers activate gene transcription by recruiting a number of different cofactors, including different histone acetyl transferases, that regulate chromatin and polymerase function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). MYC/MAX complexes bind to DNA sequences with the consensus 5&#x02032;-CACGTG-3&#x02032;, referred to as E-boxes. These elements are also recognized by MAD/MAX heterodimers and at least <italic>in vitro</italic> little difference in the binding specificity between MYC/MAX and MAD/MAX complexes could be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). These findings suggest that the different dimers compete for binding to specific DNA sites. This model is particularly attractive since MAD proteins have been shown to recruit corepressor complexes with histone deacetylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Thus, not only can MYC/MAX and MAD/MAX complexes compete for DNA binding but they also recruit opposing cofactor functions to target genes. In summary, these findings indicate that activating MYC/MAX and repressing MAD/MAX complexes are part of a switch mechanism that regulates the activities mentioned at the beginning.</p><p>The MAD group of proteins consists of six members, the four highly related small MAD1, MXI1 (MAD2), MAD3 and MAD4, and the considerably larger MNT and MGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). It has been suggested earlier on that these proteins might function as tumor suppressors since they can antagonize MYC function. Indeed, tissue culture transformation assays demonstrated that MAD proteins interfere with MYC-dependent transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16">8&#x02013;16</xref>). Furthermore <italic>mxi1</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice exhibit an increased susceptibility to tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, despite extensive effort, little evidence has been obtained to support the tumor suppressor notion for human tumors. This lack of evidence might be, at least in part, due to the rather broad expression pattern of all <italic>MAD</italic> genes and proteins, making it unlikely that enough MAD function can be eliminated during tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In addition to effects on transformation, MAD1 has been implicated in controlling aspects of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21 B22 B23">18&#x02013;23</xref>). The latter is at least in part due to the repression of the <italic>PTEN</italic> gene by MAD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). This results in the activation of the AKT kinase and subsequently inhibition of apoptosis. In addition, ectopic expression of MAD1 in mice resulted in early postnatal lethality and dwarfism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Of particular importance are the studies in mice with a targeted disruption of <italic>mad1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Although the overall phenotype was rather mild, in the absence of Mad1 granulopoiesis is distorted. While the number of mature granulocytes is unaltered, the precursor cells undergo extra rounds of cell division prior to terminal differentiation and the mature cells are highly susceptible to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Consistent with this latter finding, granulocytes of <italic>mad1</italic> transgenic animals are more resistant to apoptotic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Together, these studies provide evidence for important regulatory functions of MAD proteins.</p><p>The available expression studies suggest that the small <italic>MAD</italic> genes are transcribed preferentially during proliferation arrest and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Specifically, <italic>MAD1</italic> expression has been documented in differentiating hematopoietic cells as well as a number of additional cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28 B29 B30 B31 B32 B33">26&#x02013;33</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that the <italic>MAD1</italic> gene must be the target of a number of distinct signaling pathways that control the expression of this gene in the different cell types. Previously, we have observed that <italic>MAD1</italic> expression can be activated in human promyelocytic cell lines by different stimuli, including the phorbol ester TPA and retinoic acid, that induce differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In addition, the cytokine granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was capable of enhancing <italic>MAD1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). G-CSF is a key cytokine to regulate the proliferation and survival of myeloid progenitor cells and to stimulate their differentiation and maturation toward granulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34 B35 B36">34&#x02013;36</xref>). The G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) activates multiple signaling pathways, similar to other cytokine receptors, that include the JAK/STAT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37 B38 B39 B40 B41">37&#x02013;41</xref>). G-CSF regulates a large set of genes that mediate its physiological effects, however, few direct targets have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42 B43 B44">42&#x02013;44</xref>). One immediate early G-CSF target is SOCS3, which upon activation interacts with the tyrosine phosphorylated G-CSFR and downregulates its signaling capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45 B46 B47">45&#x02013;47</xref>).</p><p>In order to obtain insight into the regulation of <italic>MAD1</italic> by G-CSF, we cloned the human <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter region and identified the elements relevant for the G-CSF response. We observed that the JAK/STAT and the RAS/RAF/ERK pathways contribute to the activation of <italic>MAD1</italic> through C/EBP&#x003b2;. Our findings suggest that STAT3 is recruited to the promoter by binding to C/EBP&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and treatment conditions</title><p>HL60 (ATCC CCL-240) and U937 promyelocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FCS.

G-CSF induced <italic>MAD1</italic> expression in HL60 cells to a similar extend and with similar kinetics as TPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Similarly, G-CSF induced <italic>MAD1</italic> in the human promyelocytic line U937 as analyzed by northern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The stimulation was insensitive to cycloheximide and was also observed by qRT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and C).

The <italic>MAD1</italic> gene spans over 23 kbp and extends over 6 exons (alternatively 7 exons) on chromsome 2p13-p12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, HTGS Acc. No. AC019206). Upstream of the most 5&#x02032; mRNA human <italic>MAD1</italic> sequence, we identified a GC-rich region of about 400 bp that revealed a high degree of sequence homology to murine and rat <italic>mad1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). In the following, we refer to this sequence as the homology region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). To determine whether the transcriptional start site(s) (TSS) is located within this region, we performed 5&#x02032;-RACE experiments. Originally we cloned two products that indicated a major TSS at &#x02013;250 and one at &#x02013;46 relative to the translational initiation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). The former is located within the homology region and was used subsequently for the numbering of the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Additional 5&#x02032;RACE analysis and comparison with the 5&#x02032;-ends of <italic>MAD1</italic> clones available in the data base suggested that multiple TSS are used, primarily downstream of the -250 site. This was further supported by the analysis of the primary 5&#x02032;-RACE products. These were amplified with the Sp2 reverse primer and several forward primers using quantitative PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). A sharp increase in the amount of product was observed between primers 18 and 19, which flank the major TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and D). Primer 20, which is located further 3&#x02032;, showed an increase compared to primer 19, while primer 22, which is close to the ATG of the TSS, revealed little additional product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). A primer located at the beginning of intron 1 was used for control but gave no signal (data not shown). Together, these findings are consistent with multiple TSS, comparable to what has been reported for other CpG-island promoters (the number of CpG dinucleotides is given in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Identification of the putative promoter region of <italic>MAD1</italic>.

We observed that constructs with at least the 3&#x02032; half of the homology region possessed promoter activity as compared to the pGL2 control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Shorter constructs beginning at &#x02013;58, +64 and +131 (the numbers define nucleotides relative to the 5&#x02032; start site of transcription) and the isolated homology region from &#x02013;385 to +25 showed little basal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Thus sequences within the homology and the 5&#x02032; untranslated region seem to be necessary for basal promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). These findings are in agreement with the mapping of the start of transcription. Next we determined the G-CSF-responsiveness of the different <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter constructs. RK13 cells do not respond to human G-CSF and therefore human G-CSFR was co-expressed. This resulted in weak activation, probably due to dimerization and auto-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). The largest <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter fragment (&#x02013;1282 to + 248) was activated roughly 3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B). However, deletion of &#x0223c;500 bp (resulting in &#x02013;795 to + 248) substantially enhanced the response to G-CSF/G-CSFR indicating that this distal promoter region contains negative regulatory elements. A high level of activation by G-CSF/G-CSFR was maintained with several <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter fragments including the region from &#x02013;184 to +248 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Deletion of a further 126 bp (in &#x02013;58 to +248) substantially reduced and deletion beyond the start site of transcription abolished the G-CSF/G-CSFR response. A reporter gene construct with the isolated homology region of the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter showed an intermediate level of activity upon stimulation with G-CSF/G-CSFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B). The findings above suggested that the region from &#x02013;184 to &#x02013;58 within the homology domain contains the G-CSF/G-CSFR responsive elements. To verify this conclusion, the &#x02013;184 to &#x02013;58 fragments were cloned into a reporter construct with a minimal core promoter of the thymidine kinase gene (mintk-luc). This <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter fragment was sufficient to confer G-CSF/G-CSFR responsiveness to the minimal tk promoter (&#x02013;184/&#x02013;58-mintk-luc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D).

In the absence of G-CSF, the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter was occupied by RNA-polymerase II (Pol II) in U937 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). In contrast, no Pol II binding was seen within the gene body. This finding provided further evidence that the 3&#x02032; half of the homology region contains the core promoter. Upon G-CSF stimulation Pol II loading remained constant on the core promoter, but Pol II binding was now apparent further downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A).

Nuclei of U937 cells were treated with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to generate nucleosomal-sized DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). This DNA was then analyzed by PCR using primers that amplified overlapping fragments of about 100 bp of the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter. The protection against MNase was poor over the core of the homology region spanning about 250 to 300 bp, while the neighboring portions of the promoter were well protected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). This suggested that the homology region contained either low number of nucleosomes or that the nucleosomes were poorly positioned. In ChIP experiments, acetylated histone H3 was associated with the homology region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). However, the poorly protected region is most likely too small to be separated clearly from neighboring promoter chromatin by ChIP. In summary, these findings demonstrate that the G-CSF-responsive region of the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter shows distinct chromatin organization. Next, we addressed whether G-CSF signaling affected chromatin organization at the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter. G-CSF did not appreciably affect the extent of histone H3 acetylation in U937 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Furthermore, neither G-CSF nor TPA treatment changed the sensitivity of the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter to MNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). From these experiments it appeared that the chromatin organization did not change grossly during stimulation of <italic>MAD1</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec><title>G-CSFR signal transduction pathways that mediate <italic>MAD1</italic> activation</title><p>G-CSFR signaling is mediated by proteins recruited to the region proximal to the transmembrane domain and, upon phosphorylation, through four tyrosine residues (Y704, Y729, Y744 and Y764, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). To address the role of these elements for signaling to the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter, we used receptor deletion mutants. Loss of the distal region of the cytoplasmic portion of the G-CSFR in three different deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), including all four tyrosine residues, completely abolished stimulation of the &#x02013;184 to +248 <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). This suggested that the Tyr residues might be critical to mediate the signaling to the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter. Therefore, we used G-CSFR mutants, in which only a single tyrosine residue was maintained while the others were mutated to phenylalanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). We observed that when either only Y704 or only Y744 was present (lacking the SOCS3-binding sites that mediates repression), stimulation was more pronounced than with the wild-type (wt) G-CSFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). These studies were complemented with <italic>G-CSFR</italic> mutants, in which individual tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Indeed, the role of Y704, the major STAT3-binding site, was further substantiated. Mutation of this tyrosine in G-CSFR(Y704F) was sufficient to significantly reduce activation of the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). In contrast, mutation of Y744 had little consequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D), consistent with the finding that through this tyrosine STAT3 can be activated but to a lesser degree than through Y704 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).

Furthermore, co-expression of a dominant negative mutant of STAT3 (STAT3(Y705F)) that cannot be phosphorylated on this tyrosine was sufficient to reduce the G-CSF/G-CSFR-dependent activation of the &#x02013;184/+248-luc or of the &#x02013;184/&#x02013;58-mintk-luc reporter gene constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>F and data not shown). Similarly, the activities of <italic>G-CSFR</italic> mutants with only one Tyr residue, i.e. Y704 or Y744, were sensitive to STAT3(Y705F) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>F). The <italic>G-CSFR</italic> mutant with only Y764 was weakly sensitive to STAT3(Y705F), possibly a consequence of the reported tyrosine-independent activation of STAT3 by G-CSFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In summary, these observations support the notion that STAT3 is an important downstream mediator of the G-CSFR in the activation of the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>The C/EBP response elements are important to activate the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter in response to G-CSF/G-CSFR</title><p>Since Y704 of the G-CSFR was sufficient to mediate <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter activity, STAT3 appeared to be important. However, inspection of the &#x02013;184 to +248 <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter sequence did not reveal any STAT consensus DNA-binding site. However, we noticed two CCAAT-boxes that can serve as binding sites for C/EBP factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A). These proteins are involved in regulating differentiation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). In addition, a GC-box is present in the G-CSF/G-CSFR responsive region of the homology domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A). These elements are recognized by transcription factors of the SP family and are commonly found in CpG-island promoters, mediating basal activity in many instances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). To address whether these sites might be important to mediate the G-CSF/G-CSFR effect, we mutated the CCAAT-boxes and the GC-box either individually or in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). These mutations reduced the basal promoter activity but affected the G-CSF responsiveness more severely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B and C). While mutating the GC-box had little effect, the loss of the two CCAAT-boxes reduced substantially the response to G-CSF/G-CSFR of the &#x02013;184 to +248 <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). When all three sites were mutated the promoter fragment was only poorly stimulated by G-CSF/G-CSFR. To determine whether these three sites were also relevant in combination with an unrelated core promoter, the mutants were introduced into the &#x02013;184/&#x02013;58-mintk-luc reporter. Similar to the findings with the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter, these mutations affected both basal as well as stimulated activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D and E). In particular, mutating the two CCAAT-boxes reduced the effect by G-CSF/G-CSFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). In combination with the tk promoter, loss of the GC-box also affected G-CSF signaling. When all three sites were mutated little stimulation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). To verify the findings described earlier, we compared the stimulation by G-CSF/G-CSFR of the &#x02013;184 to +248 promoter fragment with the corresponding fragment mutated at the two CCAAT-boxes and at the GC-box. In addition, we included a <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter fragment without the responsive region (&#x02013;58 to +248) and the luciferase vector without a promoter. Mutation of the three sites resulted in a strong reduction in the responsiveness to G-CSF/G-CSFR with the remaining activity being comparable to the fragment without responsive region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>F). Both constructs still revealed a small but reproducible stimulation by G-CSF/G-CSFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In summary, these findings suggested that the three conserved sites, the two CCAAT-boxes and to a lesser extent the GC-box, mediate a substantial part of the G-CSF/G-CSFR-response that controls the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>C/EBP-binding sites and a GC-box mediate the G-CSF/G-CSFR signal.

Of the three tested C/EBP proteins, C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; activated the &#x02013;184 to +248 <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter fragment strongly, while C/EBP&#x003b5; was a poor stimulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). This indicated that C/EBP factors might be involved in regulating the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter. Therefore, we tested whether these proteins could interact with the promoter in cells. U937 cells were stimulated with G-CSF, subsequently crosslinked and the binding of C/EBP&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and all three are expressed in U937 cells (data not shown), to the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter was analyzed by ChIP. Near the core promoter, C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; were constitutively bound while no interaction with C/EBP&#x003b5; could be seen. In response to G-CSF, a shift from preferentially C/EBP&#x003b1; to C/EBP&#x003b2; was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). We further analyzed C/EBP&#x003b2; and observed that stimulation of the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter was dependent on the two CCAAT-boxes with both elements contributing roughly equally to C/EBP&#x003b2;-mediated activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). Similarly in the context of the minimal tk promoter, both CCAAT-boxes were relevant and, in addition, also the GC-box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D). Of note is that SP1 interacted with the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter by ChIP but the expression of wt or dominant negative SP1 had little effect on <italic>MAD1</italic> reporter gene constructs (data not shown). Thus C/EBP transcription factors and their response elements are involved in regulating the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>C/EBP proteins regulate the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter. (<bold>A</bold>) The &#x02013;184 to + 248 <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter reporter gene construct was cotransfected with plasmids expressing different C/EBP proteins.

The cells were then crosslinked, lyzed and the indicated proteins immunoprecipitated. The associated DNA was analyzed by PCR using primers that correspond to the 3&#x02032; portion of the homology region or to a downstream fragment within the <italic>MAD1</italic> gene body. For control serial dilutions of input DNA was analyzed by PCR. (<bold>C</bold>) Transient transfections were performed as described in (A).

Since no obvious STAT3-binding sites could be detected, we evaluated whether C/EBP&#x003b2; and STAT3 could interact. We expressed the two proteins in HEK293 cells in the presence of G-CSFR. The cells were then stimulated with G-CSF, low stringency lysates prepared and C/EBP&#x003b2; immunoprecipitated. STAT3 was co-immunoprecipitated only when the cells were stimulated with G-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>E). In addition, the signal dependency of the interaction of STAT3 with C/EBP&#x003b2; was assessed by using <italic>G-CSFR</italic> mutants. With only Y704 present, which is responsible for STAT3 activation, the interaction of STAT3 with C/EBP&#x003b2; was 3-fold weaker than with the wt receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>F). In contrast, a receptor with only Y764 did not stimulate the interaction between STAT3 and C/EBP&#x003b2;. The interaction was weak indicating that it might be highly transient, providing an explanation for the lack of STAT3-binding sites in the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter. Thus, we propose that STAT3 is recruited by C/EBP&#x003b2; to the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have identified the promoter of the <italic>MAD1</italic> transcriptional repressor. Differential expression of <italic>MAD1</italic> and the other small <italic>MAD</italic> genes and proteins has been well documented in different tissues and during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, relatively little is known about how these expression patterns are controlled. The analysis of the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter in U937 cells revealed an unexpected chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The MNase analysis allowed us to identify a region of chromatin that was highly accessible to nuclease treatment. This region overlapped with the homology region, a promoter sequence that is highly conserved between human, rat and mouse and has the hallmarks of a CpG-island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). What is common to all four <italic>MAD</italic> gene promoters, here shown for <italic>MAD1</italic>, is that they are TATA-less and contain GC-rich regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58 B59 B60">58&#x02013;60</xref>). SP transcription factors are frequently associated with GC-rich promoters, where they fulfill basal activities, but they can also be the target of signal transduction pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). SP1 was described as a critical factor to control the expression of the <italic>MXI1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). SP1 was also found associated with the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter, as determined by ChIP experiments, and interacted with the GC-boxes in electrophoretic mobility shift experiments (data not shown). However, the manipulation of SP1 or SP3 activity did not have substantial effects on the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter reporter gene constructs used in this study (data not shown). These findings are consistent with a basal activity of the GC-boxes and associated SP factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). The promoter of the murine <italic>mad3</italic> gene also contains potential binding sites for SP factors but no evidence for their involvement in <italic>mad3</italic> expression has been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Unlike the other <italic>MAD</italic> genes, <italic>mad3</italic> is also expressed in some cycling cells, peaking in S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). E2F1, a member of the E2F family of cell cycle regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>), binds to the <italic>mad3</italic> promoter and regulates its cell cycle-specific expression. The response element for E2F factors is also conserved in the human <italic>MAD3</italic> gene, suggesting that its regulation is also controlled by E2F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). The murine <italic>mad4</italic> promoter is activated during differentiation. Here an initiator sequence element was found to be critical to repress <italic>mad4</italic> in proliferating cells. This element is controlled by the MIZ1/MYC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). MYC was previously identified as a repressing cofactor of MIZ1, providing a molecular explanation how MYC represses gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Together, these studies define various transcription factors and signaling pathways that control the expression of the four <italic>MAD</italic> genes. As expected from the overlapping but also distinct expression patterns observed, both common and distinct regulatory factors are associated with the different genes. The common factors could include SP proteins that might be relevant for the broad expression pattern of individual genes. In addition, specific factors might determine the expression in a cell-type and signal-specific fashion. E2Fs for <italic>mad3</italic> and C/EBPs for <italic>MAD1</italic> provide examples for the latter. Nevertheless, we assume that the GC-boxes are of functional relevance since their mutation reduces basal promoter activity and since they contribute to C/EBP-dependent gene activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, Pol II was bound to the promoter constitutively, suggesting that in U937 the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter is in a pre-active state. In this state, the incoming G-CSF/G-CSFR signals rapidly increase promoter activity by stimulating STAT3 activity and most likely the RAS/RAF/ERK pathway that controls the activity of C/EBP transcription factors. The C/EBP proteins, similar to Pol II, were constitutively bound to the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter. Whether this is consistent with the presence of an enhanceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>), potentially with SP and C/EBP factors at its core, remains to be addressed.</p><p>The mutagenesis of the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter suggested strongly that the CCAAT-boxes are critical to mediate the G-CSF/G-CSFR response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>). C/EBP transcriptional regulators are involved in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation in many different cell types and function as executors of lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). In particular, C/EBP proteins have been demonstrated to be involved in the control of myeloid and granulocytic cell physiology. Four members of the family (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b4; and &#x003b5;) are expressed in myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). C/EBP&#x003b1; is downregulated during terminal granulocytic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>), an observation that is in agreement with the loss of C/EBP&#x003b1; interaction to the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter in response to G-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). The importance of this C/EBP member is also documented by the observation that <italic>c/ebp&#x003b1;</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice fail to undergo myeloid differentiation and lack neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). In addition, C/EBP&#x003b5; was suggested to be important for granulopoiesis since this factor is preferentially expressed during granulocytic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>). Although this factor is expressed in U937 cells (data not shown), we could not detect it on the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter and it was a poor activator of the <italic>MAD1</italic> reporter genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Similarly, C/EBP&#x003b4; could not activate the <italic>MAD1</italic> reporter genes (data not shown). The fourth C/EBP family member analyzed, C/EBP&#x003b2;, was capable to activate the <italic>MAD1</italic> reporter genes in a CCAAT-box-dependent manner and bound to the promoter in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). C/EBP&#x003b2; is not essential for myeloid development in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>). However, recent findings indicate that C/EBP&#x003b2;-deficient neutrophils display enhanced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>). A role of C/EBP&#x003b2; in controlling MAD1 expression is in line with the anti-apoptotic function of this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Thus C/EBP factors, and in particular C/EBP&#x003b2;, appear to be important to control different aspects of myeloid cell physiology. Since our ChIP experiments revealed that both C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; are bound to the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter, it is possible that these proteins function as homo- or heterodimers in controlling promoter activity. We note however that the two CCAAT boxes represent only &#x02018;half-sites&#x02019; and binding of C/EBP&#x003b2; to these sites in electrophoretic mobility shift experiments is poor (data not shown). Thus it is possible that additional factors are required for efficient binding of C/EBP proteins to the proposed sites in the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter.</p><p>Nevertheless, the mutation of the CCAAT-boxes reduced substantially the responsiveness to G-CSF/G-CSFR; our findings suggest that C/EBP proteins are critical for the activation of the <italic>MAD1</italic> promoter. Since STAT3 seems to be relevant as well, but no binding sites could be found in the responsive promoter fragment, and since we failed to detect STAT3 in ChIP experiments on the promoter, we suggest that STAT3 is recruited by C/EBP proteins to the promoter. Indeed, we observed co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins when overexpressed and stimulated with G-CSF/G-CSFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Probably owing to the weak interaction and possibly the transient nature of this complex, we were unable to detect this complex with endogenous proteins. This model is in agreement with a recent study that showed interaction of STAT3 with C/EBP&#x003b1; in response to G-CSF/G-CSFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>). These authors find that a synthetic C/EBP&#x003b1; reporter is stimulated by STAT3. Thus, it appears that different C/EBP factors can interact with STAT factors and cooperate in gene activation. These findings suggest that STAT3 functions as cofactor in these circumstances. In the future the relevance of the activity of STAT3 in various settings, including tumor formation, will be important to investigate.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank G.
