In a previous work we reported that quadruplex 32R is recognized by three nuclear proteins: PARP-1, Ku70 and hnRNP A1. In this study we describe the interaction of recombinant hnRNP A1 (A1) and its derivative Up1 with the <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplex. Mobility-shift experiments show that A1/Up1 binds specifically, and also with a high affinity, to quadruplex 32R, while CD demonstrates that the proteins strongly reduce the intensity of the 260 nm-ellipticity&#x02014;the hallmark for parallel G4-DNA&#x02014;and unfold the G-quadruplex. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer melting experiments reveal that A1/Up1 completely abrogates the cooperative quadruplex-to-ssDNA transition that characterizes the <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplex and facilitates the association between quadruplex 32R and its complementary polypyrimidine strand. When quadruplex 32R is stabilized by TMPyP4, A1/Up1 brings about only a partial destabilization of the G4-DNA structure. The possible role played by hnRNP A1 in the mechanism of <italic>KRAS</italic> transcription is discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The mammalian <italic>KRAS</italic> gene encodes for a guanine nucleotide-binding protein of 21 kDa that activates several cellular pathways controlling important events such as proliferation, differentiation and signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The Ras proteins behave as a molecular switch cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. The state of nucleotide occupancy is regulated by specific proteins named guanine nucleotides exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPases activating proteins (GAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The <italic>RAS</italic> genes are frequently mutated in solid and haematological neoplasias with single point mutations at exons 12, 13 and 61 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The most common mutated <italic>RAS</italic> gene in solid tumours is <italic>KRAS</italic>, with a 90% incidence in pancreatic adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). As the mutated Kras protein has a defective GTPase activity, it is not inactivated by GAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). It remains locked into the GTP-bound active state which continuously transmits to the nucleus mitotic signals that contribute to the neoplastic phenotypes in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). As pancreatic adenocarcinomas are refractory to conventional treatments, the discovery of new drugs capable to sensitize tumour cells to chemotherapy is being pursued in many laboratories. In our laboratory, we focused on <italic>KRAS</italic> and in order to design anti-<italic>KRAS</italic> drugs we investigated how the transcription of this proto-oncogene is controlled. Previous studies have shown that a nuclease hypersensitive element (NHE), located in the <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter upstream of the transcription start between &#x02013;327 and &#x02013;296, is responsible for most of the transcription activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Earlier we reported that the purine strand of NHE is structurally polymorphic, as its tract of sequence recognized by nuclear proteins is able to fold into stable G-quadruplex structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Using the purine strand of NHE (called 32R) in quadruplex conformation as a bait, we pulled down from a pancreatic nuclear extract three proteins with affinity for the <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplex. By SDS&#x02013;PAGE and mass spectrometry, we identified these proteins as poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1), ATP-dependent DNA helicase 2, subunit 1 (Ku70) and heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Protein hnRNP A1 (from now on A1) is a member of the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein family, which is highly abundant in the nucleus of actively growing mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). All members of the hnRNP family are characterized by two highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) at the <italic>N</italic>-terminus and by a glycine-rich domain at the <italic>C</italic>-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Although a recent structure of a co-crystal of Up1 (a proteolitic portion of A1 retaining binding activity) bound to the telomeric repeat (TTAGGG)<sub>2</sub> suggests that both RRMs interact with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), it has been reported that only one motif (RRM1) is sufficient for strong and specific binding to single-stranded telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and that its sub-element RNP11 mediates destabilization of quadruplex (CGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Proteins hnRNP play various roles in mRNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and in the biogenesis of telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). As protein A1 (and its derivative Up1) was reported to have a telomere-lengthening effect in erytroleukemia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), it is suspected to function as an auxiliary factor of the telomerase holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Considering that the 3&#x02032; G-rich repeats of the telomeres are folded in stable G-quadruplex structures, it has been hypothesized that A1 stimulates telomere elongation by disrupting high-order structures formed by the telomere repeats. Indeed, Up1 was reported to destabilize the bimolecular quadruplex formed by human telomere repeats d(TTAGGGTTAGGG), d(TTAGGG)<sub>4</sub> and the intramolecular quadruplex of d(GGCAG)<sub>5</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25">23&#x02013;25</xref>).</p><p>Since we discovered that A1 is associated to the <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter, in this study we have investigated the interaction between recombinant A1/Up1 and the <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplex. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that A1/Up1 binds to the <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplex with high affinity and specificity, while CD and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments revealed that A1/Up1 destabilizes this non B-DNA structure of the <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter. The results of our study support a transcription mechanism in which A1 should function as a G-quadruplex destabilizing protein, as it seems to occur in the G-rich 3&#x02032; overhang strand of the telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In conclusion, this study sheds some light on the mechanism of <italic>KRAS</italic> transcription regulation and may be useful for the rationale design of anticancer drugs specific for oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>DNA and proteins hnRNP A1/Up1</title><p>The oligonucleotides used in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) were obtained from MWG (Germany) and Microsynth (Switzerland).

A thermometer inserted in the cuvette holder allowed a precise measurement of the sample temperature. The spectra were calculated with J-700 Standard Analysis software (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd) and are reported as ellipticity (mdeg) versus wavelength (nm). Each spectrum was recorded three times, smoothed and subtracted to the baseline.</p><p>Fluorescence measurements were carried out with a Microplate Spectrofluorometer System (Molecular Devices) using a 96-well black plate, in which each well contained 50 &#x003bc;l of 200 nM dual-labelled F-32R-T in 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.4 and KCl as specified in the figure captions. Before adding the protein, the samples were incubated for 24 h at room temperature in the specified buffer. The protein (Up1, A1 or BSA) was added 30 min before fluorescence analysis. The emission spectra were obtained by setting the excitation wavelength at 475 nm, the cut-off at 515 nm and recording the emission from 500 to 650 nm. Upon addition of KCl, F-32R-T assumes a folded quadruplex conformation and FRET is expected between the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; fluorophores. The emission intensity of the donor (FAM) decreases while the intensity of the acceptor increases, correspondingly, as K<sup>+</sup> is added to the sample solution.

When r was increased to 200 and the samples run in a longer gel, 32R migrated essentially as 1:2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>c). The formation of two DNA&#x02013;protein complexes by A1/Up1 is in keeping with the results of Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and the crystal structure of d(TTAGGG)<sub>2</sub> bound to Up1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Since a tract of 12 nt functions as a minimum binding unit, 32R has potentially two binding sites, which can in principle form two DNA&#x02013;protein complexes by binding one or two protein molecules. By quantifying the intensity of the electrophoretic bands, we roughly estimated that the dissociation constant <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of the 1:1 complex is about 50 nM for Up1 and 200 nM for A1. We also tested the binding specificity of A1/Up1 for a variety of well known G-quadruplex structures obtained from <italic>CMYC</italic>, <italic>CKIT</italic>, <italic>VEGF</italic> and <italic>HRAS</italic> promoter sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29 B30 B31 B32">29&#x02013;32</xref>) (for <italic>HRAS</italic> quadruplexes, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp138/DC1">Supplementary Data S1</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>d and e). The various DNA substrates have been <sup>33</sup>P-labelled and treated with an excess of protein (<italic>r</italic> = 50). It can be seen that A1 shows good specificity for the <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplex, as it does not bind to the other quadruplex-forming sequences, unstructured oligonucleotides Gmut1, Gmut2, 32Y (the complementary polypyrimidinic NHE strand) and dsNHE (32R:32Y) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

Therefore, we used spectroscopic techniques such as circular dichroism (CD) and FRET. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows that in 100 mM KCl, 32R is characterized by a CD signature typical of a parallel G-quadruplex: a strong and positive ellipticity at 260 nm and a weak and negative ellipticity at 240 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). When quadruplex 32R is denatured by increasing the temperature, the positive 260 nm band is dramatically reduced and its spectrum becomes similar to that of unstructured oligonucleotides (data not shown). Thus, the structural transition from quadruplex-to-ssDNA is accompanied by a strong reduction of the 260 nm ellipticity. A similar transition was obtained by adding to quadruplex 32R increasing amounts of A1/Up1 (<italic>r</italic> = 1, 2, 4, 6). It can be seen that the protein causes a progressive reduction of the 260 nm ellipticity, indicating that the G4-DNA structure is unfolded by the protein. As a control, we treated quadruplex 32R with an unrelated protein, the trypsinogen inhibitor, and found that the 260 nm ellipticity was not affected and remained constant at all protein concentrations used. The CD spectra of Up1 at increasing concentrations show that the protein between 240 and 320 nm does not have any negative band, but below 240 nm it shows a negative band typical of the polypeptide backbone. The CD data showing G-quadruplex unfolding are in keeping with those previously obtained with the telomeric TTAGGG repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and the hypervariable minisatellite sequence d(GGCAG)<sub>5</sub> treated with Up1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>CD of 32R (2 &#x003bc;M) in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl in the presence of increasing amounts of Up1 (<italic>r</italic> = 0, 1, 4, 6) (<italic>r</italic> = [protein]/[DNA]) (<bold>a</bold>); hnRNPA1 <italic>r</italic> = 0, 1, 4, 6, (<bold>b</bold>); trypsinogen inhibitor (TI) (<italic>r</italic> = 0, 1, 4, 6) (<bold>c</bold>).

By exciting F-32R-T at 475 nm, the emission intensity of the donor at 525 nm decreases while the emission intensity of the acceptor at 580 nm increases, as the KCl concentration is increased from 0 to 140 mM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp138/DC1">Supplementary Data S2</ext-link>). F-32R-T folded in the G-quadruplex conformation (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 75&#x000b0;C in 140 mM KCl) is characterized by a <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.52 (see &#x02018;Materials and methods&#x02019; section). This <italic>P</italic>-value is higher than that observed for the quadruplex formed by the human telomeric repeat d(GGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), because F-32R-T forms a parallel quadruplex where the two fluorophores are at opposite ends of the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). When the G-quadruplex is destabilized by scaling down the KCl concentration to zero or by adding the complementary 32Y strand, that transforms the G-quadruplex into a B-DNA duplex where the donor and acceptor are separated by about 115 &#x000c5;, the donor fluorescence significantly increases (for instance, from spectrum 2 to spectrum 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a) and the <italic>P</italic>-value becomes 0.75. This means that the unfolding of quadruplex F-32R-T is accompanied by a &#x00394;<italic>P</italic> = 0.75 &#x02212; 0.52 = 0.23. We then asked if quadruplex F-32R-T is unfolded by A1/Up1. To choose at which ionic strength the FRET experiments in the presence of A1/Up1 should be performed, we measured the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of quadruplex F-32R-T in KCl and NaCl solutions (in 50, 100 and 140 mM KCl, <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> is 48, 70 and 75&#x000b0;C, respectively; in 100 mM NaCl, the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> is 32&#x000b0;C). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a shows the effect on quadruplex F-32R-T in 50 mM KCl (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 48&#x000b0;C, <italic>P</italic> = 0.62) of Up1 and A1 at <italic>r</italic> = 1, 2, 3, 6, 10. It can be seen that, compared to complementary 32Y, Up1 does not promote a significant increase of the donor emission, a behaviour that might suggest that Up1 has little effect on the quadruplex conformation [for instance the <italic>P</italic>-value is 0.62 at <italic>r</italic> = 0 (spectrum 2), 0.67 at <italic>r</italic> = 10 (spectrum 8), &#x00394;<italic>P</italic> = 0.05]. If we assume that &#x00394;<italic>P</italic> = 0.23 reflects total opening of the G-quadruplex, &#x00394;<italic>P</italic> = 0.05 suggests that F-32R-T bound to Up1 is partially opened (20%). Alternatively, it is possible that F-32R-T in the DNA&#x02013;protein complex is completely opened but with the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends brought close to one another so that FRET takes place. To gain insight into this possibility we performed melting experiments. We reasoned that in case the quadruplex is partially unfolded, its <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> would be lowered, whereas in case it is completely opened by A1/Up1, the quadruplex-to-ssDNA transition should be abrogated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b shows typical melting curves for quadruplex F-32R-T in 50 mM KCl, obtained with a real-time PCR machine, after the DNA was incubated for 30 min with A1/Up1 (<italic>r</italic> = 1, 2, 4, 10) or BSA (<italic>r</italic> = 10) just before melting. It can be seen that an excess of BSA does not change the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of the G-quadruplex, as one expects with an unspecific protein which does not interact with DNA. In contrast, when quadruplex F-32R-T is incubated with A1/Up1, a strong change of the melting curves is observed. The cooperative transition relative to the denaturation of the G-quadruplex (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 48&#x000b0;C) is completely abrogated and replaced with a broad and non-cooperative curve, which reflects the disruption of the DNA&#x02013;protein complex. The abrogation of the quadruplex-to-ssDNA transition is clearly observed with both <italic>F</italic> versus <italic>T</italic> and &#x02013;d<italic>F</italic>/d<italic>T</italic> versus <italic>T</italic> curves. A similar behaviour has been reported for the UV-melting of the virus type 1 nucleocapsid protein bound to the quadruplex formed by d(GGGTTGGTGTGGTTGG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In 100 mM NaCl, where quadruplex F-32R-T shows a cooperative transition with a <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 32&#x000b0;C, we also observed the abrogation of the cooperative transition by A1/Up1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). These data suggest that when F-32R-T is bound to A1/Up1, its secondary structure is completely disrupted and F-32R-T in the DNA&#x02013;protein complex is in the single-stranded form. The fact that the opening of the quadruplex by Up1 is accompanied by a &#x00394;<italic>P</italic> which is 20% of that observed with 32Y (0.05 against 0.23) can be rationalized on the basis of the crystal structure between Up1 and the telomeric repeat (TTAGGG)<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In the crystal, the two RRM elements within a Up1 molecule bind to two separate 12mer oligonucleotides, which are antiparallel and separated by an <italic>inter</italic>strand distance of 25&#x02013;50 &#x000c5;. Thus, we expect that F-32R-T bound to A1/Up1 adopts a U-shape with the two fluorophores close enough to promote energy transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>c). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Fluorescence spectra of 200 nM F-32R-T in water (spectrum 1) or 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl in the absence (spectrum 2) or presence of BSA (<italic>r</italic> = 10, spectrum 3) or Up1 (<italic>r</italic> = 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 10, spectra 4&#x02013;8); (<bold>b</bold>) row FRET-melting curves (<italic>F</italic><sub>525</sub> versus <italic>T</italic>) obtained with the iQ5 real-time PCR machine of quadruplex F-32R-T treated with A1/Up1 at various [protein]/[DNA] ratios, in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl.

We therefore tested whether TMPyP4 reduces the quadruplex destabilizing action of A1/Up1. Quadruplex F-32R-T (200 nM) was incubated for 12 h in 50 mM KCl, in the presence of 200 and 600 nM TMPyP4. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>a shows that TMPyP4 enhances the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of quadruplex F-32R-T from 48&#x000b0;C (curve 1) to 68 (curve 4) and 76&#x000b0;C (curve 5). The mixtures were treated for 30 min with 1 &#x003bc;M A1 (<italic>r</italic> = 5) and then melted. While A1 at <italic>r</italic> = 5 is able to completely disrupt the <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplex in 50 mM KCl (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b), in the presence of the porphyrin it promotes only a partial destabilization of the G-quadruplex: the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> is reduced from 68&#x000b0;C to 58&#x000b0;C (in the presence of 200 nM TMPyP4, curve 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>a) or from 76&#x000b0;C to 63&#x000b0;C (600 nM TMPyP4, curve 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>a). So, the stabilizing effect of the porphyrin partially inhibits the capacity of the protein to unfold the G-quadruplex. To exclude the possibility that TMPyP4 directly interacts with and inhibits A1, we performed a control experiment with TMPyP2, the positional isomer of TMPyP4 showing little affinity for quadruplex DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>b). As expected, TMPyP2 neither stabilizes appreciably quadruplex 32R, nor impairs the unfolding of the quadruplex structure by A1.

They suggest that A1 is likely to function as an auxiliary factor of the telomerase holoenzyme and propose that the protein stimulates telomerase elongation through unwinding of the G-quadruplex structures formed during the translocation steps. Our study suggests that protein A1, being a component of a multiprotein complex formed within NHE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), may have a similar function for the <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter: i.e. to resolve the folded quadruplex conformations.

To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether the kinetic of hybridization between quadruplex F-32R-T and the complementary 32Y strand becomes faster in the presence of Up1. When quadruplex F-32R-T in 100 mM KCl (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 70&#x000b0;C) is mixed at 25&#x000b0;C with the 32Y strand the quadruplex sequence is transformed into the more stable duplex (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 78&#x000b0;C) and the fluorescence of the donor increase as in the duplex it is separated from the acceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>a, from A to C).

Contrarily to what we expected, the addition of increasing amounts of protein A1/Up1 strengthened the pause of Taq polymerase. The precise points at which Taq polymerase was arrested were determined by Sanger sequencing reactions and are indicated with arrows in the template sequence. This suggests that A1/Up1 forms with the DNA template a complex which is sufficiently stable to arrest the processivity of Taq polymerase. That's why A1/Up1 enhances the block of Taq polymerase at the G-rich element. However, to corroborate this hypothesis DNA footprinting experiments should be done to demonstrate direct binding of A1/Up1 to the site of arrest. The complex between A1/Up1 and 32R is destabilized when the G-rich strand hybridizes to its complementary sequence to afford a B-DNA duplex for which A1/Up1 has no affinity (see EMSA). Finally, in keeping with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, the primer-extension assay shows that A1/Up1 binds to the G-rich tract of NHE with a high selectivity, since significant arrests of polymerase at other points of the template are not observed. <fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Primer extension assay showing that Taq polymerase pauses at the G-rich element of <italic>KRAS</italic> where the template forms G-quadruplex structures in the presence of KCl.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) showing that Up1 forms with the telomeric repeats (TTAGGG)<sub>4</sub> two DNA&#x02013;protein complexes.</p><p>In accord with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), A1 and Up1 promote a significant reduction of the 260 nm ellipticity, typical of G4-DNA in the parallel conformation. This demonstrates that both proteins are able to unfold the quadruplex structures of the <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter. This conclusion is further supported by FRET-melting experiments showing that the quadruplex formed by F-32R-T is completely disrupted by A1 or Up1. When the <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplex is incubated for 30 min with A1/Up1 before melting, the cooperative transition of the G-quadruplex is replaced by a non-cooperative transition. This suggests that when the <italic>KRAS</italic> sequence is bound to A1/Up1, it is open and in a single-stranded conformation, as shown by the crystal of Up1 with the telomeric repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In contrast, when a 10-fold excess BSA is added to the G-quadruplex, no change in the quadruplex transition is observed. We interestingly found that protein A1/Up1 facilitates the assembly into a duplex of the two complementary NHE strands. In fact, the half-life of renaturation is reduced from 444 to 133 s in the presence of Up1, 100 mM KCl. This is in accord with earlier studies reporting that A1 promotes a rapid renaturation of nucleic-acid strands, probably by melting the secondary structures that are formed transiently during the annealing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). The finding that A1 resolves the <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplexes has an important biological significance because previous studies supported the notion that the <italic>KRAS</italic> G4-DNA might behave as a transcription suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>)</p><p>The role of A1 <italic>in vivo</italic> has been investigated in the context of the telomere biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23">21&#x02013;23</xref>). One possible function of the protein would be to disrupt the G4-DNA structures of the telomere G-repeats, allowing proper elongation by the telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The data of our study suggest that A1 could have a similar function in the transcription of <italic>KRAS</italic>. This is in keeping with the fact that A1: (i) binds to the folded G4-DNA conformations of NHE but not to the complementary pyrimidinic strand or duplex NHE; (ii) disrupts G4-DNA and (iii) facilitates the assembly of the NHE strands into a duplex. A possible model for transcription regulation of <italic>KRAS</italic> is the following. NHE should exist in equilibrium between a folded (quadruplex) and a double-stranded conformation. In the folded form the promoter is locked into a form that might inhibit transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). To activate transcription, the folded form of NHE should hybridize to the complementary strand in order to restore the duplex. As the quadruplex-to-duplex transformation is likely to be kinetically slow, the functions of A1 would be of destabilizing the quadruplex and allow the G-rich strand to hybridize to its complementary within a time compatible with a response of the cell to molecular stimuli. There are a number of genes with C+G-rich elements in the region surrounding the transcription start site that seems to be characterized by a transcription regulation mechanism involving G-quadruplex structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39 B40 B41 B42 B43 B44 B45">39&#x02013;45</xref>).</p><p>Several proteins from different organisms that interact with quadruplex DNA have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). They can be classified by function into five major groups: (i) proteins that increase the stability of DNA quadruplexes; (ii) proteins that destabilize quadruplex DNA in a non catalytic way; (iii) proteins that unwind catalytically quadruplex DNA in an ATP-dependent fashion; (iv) proteins that promote the formation of quadruplex DNA; (v) Nucleases that specifically cleave DNA at or adjacently to a quadruplex domain. Like other members of the hnRNP family such as hnRNP A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and CBF-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) that destabilise the G-quadruplex formed by the d(CGG)n fragile X expanded sequence, protein A1 acts on DNA in a non-catalytic way, i.e. remaining bound to the DNA substrate. Another protein with a similar property is POT-1 which binds to the telomere G-rich DNA overhangs and disrupts G4-DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). However, contrarily to A1/Up1, POT-1 causes a significant increase of the <italic>P</italic>-value of the quadruplex from the human telomeric repeat, because in the DNA-protein complex the telomeric repeat assumes an extended conformation in which the donor&#x02013;acceptor are separated by a distance that is too long for FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Similarly, A1 disrupts the G4-DNA structures assumed by NHE and its remaining bound to the G-rich sequence prevents the DNA from assuming again the folded conformation. We were indeed surprised to observe by primer extension experiments that at 37&#x000b0;C, A1/Up1 did not remove the block to Taq polymerase and the protein even enhanced the polymerase arrest. This clearly indicates that after interaction the protein remains bound to the template, and the resulting DNA&#x02013;protein complex is sufficiently strong to arrest the processivity of the polymerase.</p><p>Finally, the proposed transcription regulation model suggests two strategies to downregulate the <italic>KRAS</italic> oncogene and sensitize pancreatic cancer cells, which are refractory to conventional treatment, to chemotherapy. First, use of G4-ligands that lock the promoter in the non-transcriptable form by stabilizing the G-quadruplexes; second, use of decoy molecules specific for the proteins that recognize the G4-DNA structure of NHE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Work is in progress in our laboratory along this direction.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp138/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The Italian Association for Cancer Research (AIRC-2008, Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca Contro il Cancro), FVG&#x02013;Region (Grant-2007); Italian Ministry of University and Research (Prin 2008).
