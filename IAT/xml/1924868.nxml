Here, we demonstrate that SV40 expresses a novel later protein termed VP4 that triggers the timely lytic release of its progeny. Like VP3, VP4 synthesis initiates from a downstream AUG start codon within the VP2 transcript and localizes to the nucleus. However, VP4 expression occurs &#x0223c;24 h later at a time that coincides with cell lysis, and it is not incorporated into mature virions. Mutation of the VP4 initiation codon from the SV40 genome delayed lysis by 2 d and reduced infectious particle release. Furthermore, the co-expression of VP4 and VP3, but not their individual expression, recapitulated cell lysis in bacteria. Thus, SV40 regulates its life cycle by the later temporal expression of VP4, which results in cell lysis and enables the 50-nm virus to exit the cell. This study also demonstrates how viruses can generate multiple proteins with diverse functions and localizations from a single reading frame.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The release of viral particles from an infected host cell is essential for a virus to spread within the host organism. Cytolytic viruses such as the common cold, poliovirus, and simian virus 40 (SV40) release their progeny by inducing lysis or death of the host cell. For efficient viral spreading, it is critical that optimal numbers of the virus are assembled before cell lysis and release occurs. Therefore, the timing of cell lysis is an integral and well-controlled step in the viral life cycle. For many years, lysis has been thought to be a nonspecific consequence of viral protein overexpression and the massive production of viral progeny. As SV40 was the first mammalian virus sequenced almost 30 years ago, it is an excellent model virus for investigating the poorly understood mechanism of viral release. In this study, we have identified a novel SV40 protein named VP4 that is required for the timely lytic death of the host cell, and hence regulates the spread of SV40. The late expression of VP4 offers a sufficient period for virion assembly to occur before it initiates the lytic release of the newly assembled viral progeny.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Daniels R, Sadowicz D, Hebert DN (2007) A <italic>very</italic> late viral protein triggers the lytic release of SV40.

However, no known cellular pathways exist for exporting nonenveloped DNA viral progeny from their intracellular site of assembly to the extracellular milieu. Therefore, nonenveloped viruses, including simian virus 40 (SV40), initiate their release from the host cell in a lytic manner. How these cytolytic viruses kill the host cell and rupture its membrane system to facilitate release remains largely unknown &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030098-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>For many years, viral-induced cell lysis was thought to be a nonspecific consequence of viral protein overexpression or the production of large amounts of viral progeny causing changes in cell membrane permeability. However, the necessity for the lytic event to occur in a timely fashion after the completion of viral assembly suggests that cytolytic viruses have evolved a method to ensure that the induction of cell death takes place at the proper time. The enterovirus 2B protein, for example, is proposed to aid in the lytic release process due to its ability to induce calcium leakage from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and alter cell permeability &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030098-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.

In this manuscript, we have identified a new SV40 gene product called VP4 that is expressed &#x0223c;24 h after the late structural proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3. VP4 is essential for the timely lytic release of the viral progeny that enables the efficient spreading of SV40 in culture. VP4 oligomerizes with VP3, and when expressed together, these two proteins possess a lethal lytic property that is conserved in bacteria. These data demonstrate that late in the replication process, following viral assembly, SV40 expresses VP4 to initiate the death of the host cell and the efficient release of its progeny.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>SV40 Expresses an Additional Protein Termed VP4</title><p>The in vitro translations of mRNAs encoding VP2 and VP3 from SV40 unexpectedly produced a protein which migrated at &#x0223c;15 kD, in addition to VP2 and VP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030098-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, lanes 1 and 3, asterisks).

Note that in later figures, the VP2-Met228Ile mutant is designated as &#x00394;VP4.

In addition, the VP2-M295I genome had the ATG codon corresponding to Met295 (VP2-M295I) in VP2 mutated to ATA (Ile). The &#x00394;VP2/3 genome had both ATG initiation codons for VP2 (Met1) and VP3 (Met119) altered to ATA (Ile), whereas the &#x00394;VP2/3/4 genome had the initiation codons for VP2, VP3, and VP4 altered. The wild-type (WT) and mutant genomes were transfected into permissive BS-C-1 cells. The cells were collected 5 d post-transfection, after VP1, VP2, and VP3 expression, and the post-nuclear and nuclear lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting, because all of these proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and imported into the nucleus for viral assembly.</p><p>All of the genomes correctly expressed and localized both the early viral protein large T antigen (LT) and the major capsid protein VP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030098-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Late viral protein synthesis from the VP2 reading frame was examined by immunoblotting with polyclonal antisera against VP3 (&#x003b1;VP2/3), which also recognizes VP2. Cells transfected with WT SV40 or the VP2-M295I genome expressed three proteins that reacted with VP3 antisera: VP2, VP3, and the &#x0223c;15 kD VP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030098-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, lanes 1 and 3, &#x003b1;VP2/3).

Importantly, VP4 was synthesized in cells transfected with the &#x00394;VP2/3 genome, which indicates that it was not produced by the proteolytic cleavage of VP2 or VP3. In addition, VP4 predominantly localized to the nucleus upon cellular fractionation, whereas VP2 and VP3 were present in both the post-nuclear and nuclear samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030098-g001">Figures 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030098-sg002">S2</xref>). Significantly, this indicated that during infection, SV40 expresses the &#x0223c;15-kD VP4 protein by initiating its synthesis from Met228 in the VP2 reading frame, resulting in a polypeptide that corresponds to the C-terminal 125 amino acids of VP2 and VP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030098-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>VP4 Is Essential for the Efficient Propagation of SV40 and Is Nuclear Localized</title><p>To determine the effects of the various mutations on SV40 propagation, the number of BS-C-1 cells expressing LT over the course of infection was quantified by immunofluorescent microscopy.

As expected, the particles generated in cells transfected with the &#x00394;VP2/3/4 genome were incapable of establishing secondary infections. The viral particles produced from the VP2-M295I genome propagated as efficiently as WT, infecting &#x0223c;65&#x00025; of the cells by 7 d, indicating that synthesis of a protein from the AUG codon corresponding to Met295 in VP2 was not required for SV40 infection. In contrast to WT and VP2-M295I, &#x00394;VP4 only infected &#x0223c;10&#x00025; of the cells by 7 d. This demonstrated that VP4 played a role in viral propagation, as limited cell to cell spreading was observed in its absence. In addition, co-transfection of &#x00394;VP2/3 with &#x00394;VP4 partially complemented the &#x00394;VP4 mutation, as &#x0223c;20&#x00025; of the cells were positive for LT by day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030098-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030098-g002">2</xref>B).</p><fig id="ppat-0030098-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>VP4 Is Required for Efficient SV40 Propagation</title><p>(A) Representative fluorescence images with the corresponding phase-contrast image (inset) of SV40 propagation in BS-C-1 cells following transfection with WT, &#x00394;VP4, VP2-M295I, and &#x00394;VP2/3/4 genomes and co-transfection with the &#x00394;VP2/3 and &#x00394;VP4 genomes.

To more thoroughly explore the cellular localization of VP4, immunofluorescence microscopy was employed. Because the polyclonal antibody raised to VP3 recognizes VP2, VP3, and VP4, the localization of VP4 was analyzed after transfection with the &#x00394;VP2/3 genome. This enabled any signal from the VP3 antisera to be attributed to VP4 and allowed the localization to be examined in a context similar to that of a viral infection, as LT and VP1 are still expressed. At 3 d post-transfection, VP4 was found to localize to the nucleus, where it was enriched at the inner nuclear membrane periphery and in punctate structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030098-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). In addition, VP4 appeared to support a significant alteration in the nuclear morphology. The nuclei, as defined by LT, showed an obvious circular shape and size increase in cells transfected with the &#x00394;VP2/3 genome, which expresses VP4. This was a drastic change from the cells transfected with the &#x00394;VP2/3/4 genome, where VP4-like immunostaining was not observed and the cell nuclei were a smaller kidney shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030098-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).

The observed bacterial lysis following the co-expression of VP4 with VP3, but not the individual expression of either construct, suggested that the lytic property was a result of VP4 oligomerization with VP3. To investigate whether VP4 associates with VP3, VP4 synthesized from VP2 and VP3 mRNAs was monitored for its ability to bind GST-VP3 purified from bacteria. VP4 (&#x0223c;45&#x00025; bound) showed a substantially higher affinity for sepharose-bound GST-VP3 than VP2 and VP3 (&#x0223c;25&#x00025;&#x02013;30&#x00025; bound), the positive control VP1 (&#x0223c;12&#x00025; bound), and the negative control luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030098-g004">Figures 4</xref>C and S3B).

Trypan blue staining revealed that these low level transfection-initiated &#x00394;VP4 infections required &#x0223c;24 d, or the length of six WT life cycles, to lyse the majority of the cell population. This was significantly longer than the similar low level transfection-initiated WT SV40 infection, which required &#x0223c;12 d, or three life cycles, to completely lyse a cell population of equivalent size. The viral-containing supernatant was isolated from the &#x00394;VP4-transfected cells at 24 d and the WT-transfected cells at 12 d. The number of LT-expressing BS-C-1 cells was then calculated at 2 d post-infection with equivalent fractions of the &#x00394;VP4 and the WT virus-containing supernatants isolated at 24 and 12 d post-transfection, respectively.

However, new discoveries into the regulation of its temporal viral protein expression have recently been made &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030098-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Here, we demonstrate that SV40 expresses a very late nonstructural viral protein that we have termed VP4. VP4 is encoded within the VP2 and VP3 transcript from a downstream in-frame AUG start codon, and its expression triggers membrane lysis to aid in viral release for the efficient propagation of SV40.</p><p>In support of the hypothesis that VP4 has a role in the lytic process, we observed that VP4 was expressed concurrently with viral-induced lysis &#x0223c;24 h after the known late structural proteins, and that its deletion significantly reduced SV40 spreading by prolonging the viral life cycle. Furthermore, SV40-induced cell lysis could be recapitulated in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> by co-expressing VP4 and VP3, but not by their individual expression, indicating that SV40-induced lysis likely occurs independently of eukaryotic host factors. Altogether, this suggests that VP4 expression initiates the timely execution of the lytic process through a mechanism that relies on its association with VP3.</p><p>There are several reasons that explain why VP4 has gone undetected. First, the small molecular mass of VP4 causes it to migrate off the bottom of most gel separation systems used to visualize the larger structural proteins. Second, VP4 is not incorporated into the viral particle, but is predominantly found in the frequently discarded nuclear fraction. Next, VP4 is expressed very late, immediately before cell lysis. Finally, VP4 is found in lysed cells and is susceptible to proteolysis by trypsin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030098-sg002">Figure S2</xref>), which is a method commonly used to harvest adherent cells. These properties explain why the identification of VP4 has been elusive and provide valuable insight into its function.</p><p>It is unlikely that the observed defect in &#x00394;VP4 propagation was caused by the mutations created in VP2 (Met228 to Ile) and VP3 (Met109 to Ile). The &#x00394;VP2/3 genome, which expresses VP4 and not VP2 and VP3, was able to complement the &#x00394;VP4 genome that contains VP2 and VP3 with the aforementioned Met to Ile mutations. The observed 2-fold rescue in viral propagation following the co-transfection of &#x00394;VP2/3 with &#x00394;VP4 was considered significant due to the fact that &#x00394;VP2/3 has no cell to cell spreading capabilities by itself &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030098-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030098-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. This further supports the conclusion that VP4 was required for the efficient propagation of SV40.</p><p>Cytolytic viruses such as polyomaviruses (SV40, JCV, BKV) and picornaviruses (poliovirus, rhinovirus, and coxsackievirus) induce host cell lysis to release their progeny and prevent their encapsulation in cellular membranes. However, these viruses must regulate the induction of lysis to ensure that it only occurs after the viral assembly stage. SV40 is known to utilize a series of tightly controlled timing mechanisms to direct its replication. At the onset of infection, the early genes trigger viral genome replication before the synthesis of the structural proteins, which assemble around the genome. During assembly, VP1 acts as a second timer. The expression of VP1 prior to VP2 and VP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030098-g006">Figure 6</xref>, step A) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030098-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d; pre-positions the VP1 pentamers to bind to the newly synthesized VP2 and VP3, preventing their insertion into membranes (steps B and C). These VP1&#x02013;VP2 and VP1&#x02013;VP3 complexes are then imported into the nucleus for virion assembly, and the amount of VP2 and VP3 starts to exceed the number of available VP1 pentamers (steps D and E). At this stage, VP4 begins to accumulate, forming hetero-oligomers with VP3, and possibly VP2, which insert into the host cell membranes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030098-sg005">Figure S5</xref>) to initiate cell lysis and viral release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030098-g006">Figure 6</xref>, steps F and G). This model demonstrates how the later expression of VP4 triggers cell lysis.</p><fig id="ppat-0030098-g006" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Proposed Model Displaying the Regulation of the SV40 Lytic Cycle</title><p>VP1 is synthesized first, forming pentamers that sequester newly synthesized VP2 and VP3 (steps A&#x02013;C). Virion assembly (step D) and the stoichiometry of five VP1 per VP2/3 prevent VP2 and VP3 particle incorporation (step E). VP4 is synthesized, it oligomerizes with VP3, and possibly VP2, and targets to the host cell membrane to form a pore (step F), which then initiates the lytic death of the host cell and the release of the progeny (step G).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.0030098.g006"/></fig><p>Viruses are known to evade immune detection and prolong the survival of the infected cell by inhibiting the apoptotic response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030098-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. However, once the replication process has completed, cytolytic viruses must override both the viral anti-apoptotic and the host apoptotic responses in order to induce the lytic death of the host cell. In SV40-infected cells, LT acts to prevent the apoptotic response by sequestering p53 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030098-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030098-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. To counteract the protective activity of LT and induce lysis at the appropriate time, SV40 expresses VP4 very late in assembly. Thus lysis, and hence the length of the SV40 life cycle, is regulated by the temporal expression of VP4, explaining why its removal significantly delayed the lytic death of infected cells.</p><p>Upon sequence analysis of the 12 known polyomaviruses from mammalian and avian species, 11 were found to possess a potential VP4 initiation codon at a similar position in their VP2 transcripts. This suggests that VP4 performs a conserved function, but a detailed investigation to determine whether VP4 regulates lysis in other polyomaviruses is necessary. For the lone exception (goose hemorrhagic polyomavirus), the absence of a VP4 initiation codon could explain its lengthy life cycle (7 d until the first observed cytopathic effects in primary goose kidney cells) and the inability to effectively produce the virus in culture &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030098-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. A question of future concern now becomes, how is the later expression profile for VP4 controlled?</p><p>The requirement of VP4 to be co-expressed with VP3 in order to recapitulate cell lysis in bacteria indicated that the association of VP4 with VP3 dramatically alters the properties of these two proteins. VP3 is a viral structural protein that is thought to be involved in the penetration process &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030098-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. It is expressed late, binds to VP1 pentamers, forms oligomers, and is able to post-translationally insert into ER membranes. In the case of VP4, the structure appears to be altered in such a way that it hides the VP1-binding domain, explaining why VP4 and VP4-like constructs with small tags that contain the majority of VP4 are not able to bind VP1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030098-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. In previous studies where VP1 binding to VP4-like and VP4-truncated constructs containing N-terminal GST-tags was observed, the larger GST-tags may have prevented this change in the conformation of VP4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030098-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030098-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Comparative analysis of VP2, VP3, and VP4 revealed that these proteins possess distinct hydrophobic properties that likely contribute to their functional and conformational variations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030098-sg006">Figure S6</xref> and &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030098-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>The evolutionary pressure placed on viruses to perform multiple tasks with small genomes has caused viruses to diversify their genomes by encoding a number of proteins within single transcripts. They accomplish this task by organizing the genes as large polyproteins or in a polycistronic manner in which different genes are contained within alternative reading frames or at downstream AUG initiation sites in a single reading frame. Within SV40, VP3 and VP4 are expressed from successive downstream AUG codons in the same reading frame as VP2. This strategy for the creation of N-terminally truncated proteins could also be useful for modifying the role of cellular proteins by removing regulatory or functional binding domains, or by altering their localization by deleting targeting sequences. Through these simple mechanisms, cells and their pathogens can significantly expand and diversify the protein population expressed from their genomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>SV40 mutant genomes, cell lines, transfection, and particle isolation.</title><p>The bacterial replication competent plasmid pSV40, encoding the entire WT SV40 genome (strain 776), was obtained from H.
