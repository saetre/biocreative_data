We show that <italic>flo</italic> encodes the ortholog of <italic>Mel-28/Elys</italic>, a highly conserved gene that has been shown to be required for nuclear integrity in worms and nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly in amphibian and mammalian cells. Maternal <italic>elys</italic> expression sustains zebrafish <italic>flo</italic> mutants to larval stages when cells in proliferative tissues that lack nuclear pores undergo cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. p53 mutation rescues apoptosis in the <italic>flo</italic> retina and optic tectum, but not in the intestine, where the checkpoint kinase Chk2 is activated. Chk2 inhibition and replication stress induced by DNA synthesis inhibitors were lethal to <italic>flo</italic> larvae. By contrast, <italic>flo</italic> mutants were not sensitized to agents that cause DNA double strand breaks, thus showing that loss of Elys disrupts responses to selected replication inhibitors. Elys binds Mcm2-7 complexes derived from Xenopus egg extracts. Mutation of <italic>elys</italic> reduced chromatin binding of Mcm2, but not binding of Mcm3 or Mcm4 in the <italic>flo</italic> intestine. These <italic>in vivo</italic> data indicate a role for Elys in Mcm2-chromatin interactions. Furthermore, they support a recently proposed model in which replication origins licensed by excess Mcm2-7 are required for the survival of human cells exposed to replication stress.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>DNA replication is a complex process that requires activation of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair pathways. Genetic analyses in fungi have suggested that nucleoporins, the proteins that make up the nuclear pore complex (NPC), play a role in the cellular response to agents that disrupt cell proliferation or damage DNA. Here we show that mutation of the Elys nucleoporin causes widespread apoptosis in the intestine and other tissues of zebrafish <italic>flotte lotte</italic> (<italic>flo</italic>) mutants. Intestinal apoptosis occurs in the absence of the DNA damage marker &#x003b3;H2X, and levels of chromatin bound Mcm2, a component of the DNA replication helicase, were also reduced in <italic>flo</italic> mutants. These findings suggested that <italic>flo</italic> intestinal cells cannot repair endogenous replication errors. Consistent with this idea, <italic>flo</italic> mutants were highly sensitized to treatment with DNA replication inhibitors such as hydroxyurea, UV irradiation, or cisplatin, but not agents that cause DNA double strand breaks, such as &#x003b3;-irradiation or camptothecin.

RNAi mediated knockdown of ELYS protein inhibited nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly, thus identifying ELYS as either a component of the NPC that directs its assembly, or a protein that organizes the NPC in the chromatin periphery. In addition to its association with the Nup107&#x02013;160 nucleoporins, Elys interacts with the Mcm2-7 DNA helicase complex on chromatin derived from Xenopus egg extract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000240-Gillespie1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. This interaction was proposed to be a mechanism that allows cells to coordinate nuclear assembly with the requirement to shut down replication origin licensing prior to S-phase entry.</p><p>Here, we show that <italic>flotte lotte</italic> (<italic>flo</italic>), a previously described recessive zebrafish mutant with retinal, neural and digestive organ defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000240-Chen1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000240-Ng1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, arises from mutation of zebrafish <italic>elys</italic>. Strong maternal <italic>elys</italic> expression enables cells of early <italic>flo</italic> embryos to survive to larval stages. However, at later stages proliferative cells in tissues in which NPC assembly is disrupted, such as the retina, optic tectum and intestine, undergo cell cycle arrest and ultimately succumb to apoptotic cell death via p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000240-Chen2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. p53-independent apoptosis in the <italic>flo</italic> intestine is associated with activation of the Chk2 protein kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000240-Ahn1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, and initially, normal levels of the DNA damage marker &#x003b3;H2AX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000240-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000240-Lowndes1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggested that Elys may be needed to resolve replications errors that normally occur in highly proliferative organ progenitor cells. Consistent with this idea, we found that Chk2 activation was required for the survival of homozygous <italic>flo</italic> larvae, but not their heterozygous or homozygous wild type siblings. Homozygous <italic>flo</italic> larvae, but not their siblings, were also sensitized to DNA replication inhibitors, but not agents that induce DNA double strand breaks. Finally, we also found that loss of Elys reduces levels of chromatin bound Mcm2, but not Mcm3, Mcm4 or phospho-Mcm4 in the wild type or irradiated <italic>flo</italic> intestine. Together, these and other data support a role for Elys in DNA replication and the cellular response to replication stress, independent of its role in NPC assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The <italic>flo</italic> Mutation Disrupts Tissue Progenitor Cell Proliferation, Differentiation, and Survival</title><p>Zebrafish <italic>flotte lotte</italic> (<italic>flo<sup>ti262c</sup></italic>; hereafter <italic>flo</italic>) is a recessive lethal mutation that was identified as part of a large scale ENU mutagenesis screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000240-Chen1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Here, we show a comparable though less pronounced effect on retinal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000240-g001">Figure 1E&#x02013;1H</xref>). Histological analyses revealed that the cellular layers of the <italic>flo</italic> retinal epithelium were disorganized and contained numerous cells with condensed nuclei typical of apoptotic cells.

This suggests that intestinal progenitor cells in zebrafish larvae rely on Chk2 rather than Chk1 to activate checkpoints in response to both DNA damage and replication inhibitors.

As a result, the effects of the loss of Elys protein function during the later developmental stages, such as organogenesis, can be assayed. The principal findings of our study regarding the role of Elys protein in NPC assembly are in agreement with the reported role of Elys in human cells and in vitro assays of NPC assembly using siRNA knockdown and competitive binding assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000240-Rasala1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000240-Gillespie1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

We focused on understanding the cause of cell death in the <italic>flo</italic> intestinal epithelium because of our prior work using the zebrafish to study digestive organ development. Our experiments showed that apoptosis in the <italic>flo</italic> intestine was not dependent on p53, whereas it was in the retina and tectum. Instead Elys deficiency activated Chk2, a checkpoint protein that can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis independently of p53. Checkpoint activation is an important component of the cellular response to replication stress, because it allows stabilization of stalled replication forks, thereby averting replication fork collapse and activation of apoptotic programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000240-Lambert1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000240-Paulsen1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

For this reason, Chk2 activation in <italic>flo</italic> mutants was unexpected. &#x003b3;-irradiation of zebrafish larvae induced Chk2 phosphorylation, thus showing an evolutionarily conserved role for this arm of the DNA damage response pathway in zebrafish larvae. Chk2 was also activated by replication stress induced by hydroxyurea, whereas Chk1 phosphorylation was unchanged from its baseline level of activation with either treatment. From this, we conclude that hydroxyurea induced replication stress activates Chk2 in the zebrafish intestine because Chk1 is already maximally activated by endogenous replication errors that occur in these highly proliferative progenitor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000240-Wallace1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although we initially postulated a number of mechanisms to explain how mutation of Elys activated the DNA damage response, several lines of evidence support a model in which Elys protein is required for the repair of replication errors that occur in rapidly dividing cells. First, Chk2 inhibition was lethal to <italic>flo</italic> larvae even though we found evidence of only low levels of DNA damage in the mutant larvae at this stage (normal &#x003b3;H2AX levels). This argued that checkpoints were activated in response to physiological stimuli; i.e. - replication stress. Second, survival of <italic>flo</italic> mutants was reduced following treatment with doses of replication inhibitors, such as hydroxyurea, UV-irradiation and cisplatin, that had only minor effects on wild type siblings, or another mutant, <italic>slim jim</italic>, in which intestinal progenitor cells proliferation is also reduced.

In contrast to their sensitivity to replication inhibitors, treatment of <italic>flo</italic> mutants with &#x003b3;-irradiation or the topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin did not compromise survival compared with wild type siblings. Non-sensitivity to these agents, which induce DNA double strand breaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000240-DArpa1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, argues that <italic>flo</italic> larvae retain the ability to activate repair pathways involving homologous recombination or non-homologous endjoining, whereas mechanisms to maintain replication forks in the setting of nucleotide deprivation (hydroxyurea) or intrastrand DNA crosslinks (UV, cisplatin) are compromised by Elys deficiency. Collectively, these data argue that sensitivity of Elys deficient cells to hydroxyurea and other agents is not a non-specific effect incurred by cells that lack nuclear pores.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Reduced Mcm2 in <italic>flo</italic> Intestine May Impair Licensing of Dormant Replication Origins</title><p>Levels of Mcm2-7 complex proteins in eukaryotic cells far exceed the number of active replication origins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000240-Woodward1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.

Reduced Mcm2 levels associated with Elys deficiency could arise from an effect on Mcm2-chromatin loading, or maintenance of chromatin bound Mcm2.

Finally, reduced Mcm chromatin loading is predicted to occur upon DNA-damage induced degradation of the licensing factor Cdt1. However, this too is expected to reduce binding of all Mcm proteins.</p><p>We speculate that reduced levels of chromatin bound Mcm2 prevents firing of dormant replication origins that sustain DNA replication stalled by endogenous replication errors, or stress arising from exogenous agents, such as hydroxyurea. When this compensatory mechanism is impaired, stalled replication forks are more likely to collapse, leading to cell death. Consistent with this idea, mice homozygous for a non-lethal hypomorphic <italic>Mcm2</italic> allele have reduced numbers of proliferating progenitor cells in the subventricular zone of the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000240-Pruitt1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. As the surviving progenitor cells cycle normally, their reduced census argues that surviving progenitor cells were able to overcome endogenous replication stress using an alternative salvage mechanism. Interestingly, a comparable effect on progenitor cell survival was noted in this study in the intestine of the Mcm2 mutant mice.

Unlike zebrafish Elys deficiency, partial Mcm5 knockdown (75&#x00025; reduction) reduced levels of all other Mcm proteins analyzed, including Mcm2 (50&#x00025; reduction), which may explain why survival of these cells was reduced by treatment with hydroxyurea and camptothecin whereas <italic>flo</italic> mutants were only affected by hydroxyurea.</p><p>Mcm2-7 proteins form a hexameric complex <italic>in vivo</italic>, but only the Mcm4,6,7 subcomplex, and not the Mcm2,3,5 subcomplex has helicase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>.
