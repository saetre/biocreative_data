Despite identification of a number of genetic mutations underlying AI, the precise causal mechanisms have yet to be determined. Using a multi-disciplinary approach, we describe here a mis-sense mutation in the mouse <italic>Amelx</italic> gene resulting in a Y &#x02192; H substitution in the tri-tyrosyl domain of the enamel extracellular matrix protein amelogenin. The enamel in affected animals phenocopies human X-linked AI where similar mutations have been reported. Animals affected by the mutation have severe defects of enamel bio-mineralization associated with absence of full-length amelogenin protein in the developing enamel matrix, loss of ameloblast phenotype, increased ameloblast apoptosis and formation of multi-cellular masses. We present evidence to demonstrate that affected ameloblasts express but fail to secrete full-length amelogenin leading to engorgement of the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed accumulations of both amelogenin and ameloblastin in affected cells. Co-transfection of <italic>Ambn</italic> and mutant <italic>Amelx</italic> in a eukaryotic cell line also revealed intracellular abnormalities and increased cytotoxicity compared with cells singly transfected with wild-type <italic>Amelx</italic>, mutant <italic>Amelx</italic> or <italic>Ambn</italic> or co-transfected with both wild-type <italic>Amelx</italic> and <italic>Ambn</italic>. We hypothesize that intracellular protein&#x02013;protein interactions mediated via the amelogenin tri-tyrosyl motif are a key mechanistic factor underpinning the molecular pathogenesis in this example of AI. This study therefore successfully links phenotype with underlying genetic lesion in a relevant murine model for human AI.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a common group of inherited defects of dental enamel formation that exhibit marked genetic and clinical heterogeneity with at least 14 different sub-types being recognized on the basis of their clinical appearance and mode of inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C3">3</xref>). Affected individuals show either hypoplastic (thin but seemingly correctly mineralized) or hypomineralized enamel but an overlap of these characteristics is seen in many cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C2">2</xref>). Autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked forms of AI are recognized. To date, mutations in the genes encoding amelogenin (<italic>AMELX</italic>), enamelin (<italic>ENAM</italic>), enamelysin (<italic>MMP20</italic>), kallikrein 4 (<italic>KLK4</italic>) and the <italic>FAM83H</italic> gene have been shown to underlie non-syndromic forms of AI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C6">6</xref>). Despite these advances, the underlying molecular pathogenesis of the various forms of AI remains poorly characterized.</p><p>Dental enamel is a highly mineralized tissue with &#x0223c;85% of its volume occupied by unusually large hydroxyapatite crystals that are organized into prisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C7">7</xref>). Enamel is unique among the mineralized tissues as it is produced by ectodermally derived ameloblasts which pass through a series of discrete differentiation states that correlate with the various stages of enamel formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C5">5</xref>). During the pre-secretory stage, ameloblasts are separated from the adjacent neural crest cell-derived odontoblasts by a basement membrane which is subsequently removed as the ameloblasts enter their secretory phase. During this latter stage, the ameloblasts secrete an eosinophilic, enamel extracellular matrix of which greater than 90% is composed of amelogenin, the remainder comprising non-amelogenin proteins including ameloblastin, enamelin and tuftelin, together with enzymes, including the proteases enamelysin and kallikrein-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C7">7</xref>). Bio-mineralization of the enamel matrix begins as it is being secreted and there is no non-mineralized &#x02018;pre-enamel&#x02019; equivalent to that seen in other mineralized tissues of the skeleton such as bone or dentine. During the secretory phase, extracellular matrix proteins are enzymically processed such that nascent molecules are converted to smaller fragments that form the greater thickness of the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C7">7</xref>). As the ameloblasts enter their maturation phase, the organic matrix is degraded completely to allow secondary growth of the hydroxyapatite crystals which ultimately occlude the spaces previously occupied by the enamel extracellular matrix proteins. Ultimately, the ameloblasts atrophy and the cellular layer is lost entirely from the mature erupted tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C7">7</xref>).</p><p>One of the difficulties in elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with AI in humans is the near-impossibility of obtaining viable, developing (pre-eruptive) teeth. In contrast, the incisor teeth of adult rodents form and erupt continuously throughout life and offer access to all stages of enamel development in a single tooth. The mouse is therefore an excellent model organism to investigate the fundamental events driving dental development and for studying the molecular pathogenesis of AI. In this context, gene targeting experiments have confirmed a central role for amelogenin, enamelysin and ameloblastin in enamel formation. Although ameloblastin may act as a cell adhesion molecule that is essential for maintaining the differentiation state of the ameloblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C8">8</xref>), both amelogenin and enamelysin are indispensable for the generation of full-thickness enamel of appropriate crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C11">11</xref>). Similarly, analyses of <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced dominantly inherited mouse mutations have demonstrated that enamelin is required for the initiation of mineral crystal formation during the early stages of enamel formation and the generation of full-thickness enamel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C13">13</xref>). These studies also reported animals (mouse mutant M100888) with an X-linked enamel phenotype immediately suggesting mutations in the amelogenin gene (<italic>Amelx</italic>) as this is the only enamel matrix protein currently identified on the X-chromosome. Previously reported human <italic>AMELX</italic> mutations include those resulting in a total loss of secreted protein (e.g. nonsense mutation in the signal peptide); mutations causing loss of the amelogenin C-terminal, and mutations affecting the amelogenin N-terminal region that includes a lectin-like, tri-tyrosyl domain reported to bind to <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucosamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C14">14</xref>).</p><p>The amelogenin tri-tyrosyl domain is defined by the sequence PYPSYGYE<underline>P</underline>MGGW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C15">15</xref>; corresponding to P63 &#x02192; W75 in murine amelogenin) and is highly conserved across the species. A P &#x02192; T mutation in the same amelogenin domain (underlined above), results in hypomaturation AI in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C16">16</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments indicated that this mutation not only inhibited normal amelogenin proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C17">17</xref>) but also abrogated lectin-like binding by the tri-tyroysl domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C15">15</xref>). The three tyrosine residues are essential for the lectin-like properties of the amelogenin tri-tyrosyl domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C15">15</xref>). The tri-tyrosyl domain also binds the <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucosamine mimicking domain in the N-terminal region of cytokeratin 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C18">18</xref>) and <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucosamine residues on cytokeratin 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C19">19</xref>). It has therefore been proposed that these cytokeratins may play a role in amelogenin cell trafficking and secretion.</p><p>In the current study, we have identified a novel ENU-induced <italic>Amelx</italic> mutation in M100888 mice which results in a marked dental phenotype and corresponds to similar reported mutations in human AI. Furthermore, we have utilized the continuously erupting incisor teeth of affected animals to identify an apparent impairment of the normal extracellular matrix secretory pathway and so present evidence of a possible underlying mechanism resulting in AI.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Gross morphological analysis of M100888 mutant mice</title><p>The mouse mutant M100888 was identified during a large-scale screen for dominant abnormal phenotypes of the incisor surface among animals generated from inter-crossing male mice treated with ENU and wild-type (WT) female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C12">12</xref>). Gross morphological analysis of the dentition of affected mice revealed that the upper and lower incisors were shortened and uneven and presented a chalky white, opaque appearance with roughened/pitted surfaces. In contrast, WT incisors were smooth and opalescent (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ001F1">1</xref>A&#x02013;F). Examination of the lower jaw after soft tissue removal indicated that the inferior border of the mandible of affected male mice was enlarged, eroded and discoloured compared with their unaffected counterparts. Subsequent removal of the cortical plate further indicated that the enlarged region of the mandible contained a mass of predominantly soft tissue (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ001F1">1</xref>G and H). Dissection of the lower incisor teeth indicated that the mineralizing enamel distal to the white opaque zone (where enamel extracellular matrix removal would normally have occurred) was irregular and discoloured with ridges perpendicular to the long axis of the incisor (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ001F1">1</xref>I and J).

This mutation affects the first tyrosine residue (Y64) within the conserved tri-tyrosyl motif (PYPSYGYEPMGGW) of amelogenin which is positioned towards the C-terminus of the tyrosine-rich amelogenin peptide (TRAP) domain. Although this mutation was present in all affected male (<italic>n</italic> = 72) and female (<italic>n</italic> = 54) mice analysed, it was not detected in their WT littermates (<italic>n</italic> = 160) nor in a panel of eight inbred mouse strains.

In WT lower incisors, the normal cellular components of the enamel organ were clearly evident.

In general, mutations predicted to cause a total loss of amelogenin function, for example signal peptide mutations, or mutations causing loss of the amelogenin C-terminus, result in enamel hypoplasias, although mineralization defects may also occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C14">14</xref>). In contrast, although only a small number of mis-sense mutations have been described, those which affect the N-terminal region, especially those causing changes in the tyrosine-rich (TRAP) region of amelogenin, result in a predominantly hypomineralization/hypomaturation AI phenotype. In these cases, mature enamel may retain amelogenin and be discoloured. Understanding the relationship between phenotype and underlying genetic lesion is made more complex by the extensive alternative splicing of <italic>AMELX</italic> such that a point mutation could potentially affect several different amelogenin proteins but have no effect on others.</p><p>Despite the progress that has been made in determining the genetic basis of X-linked AI, the underlying molecular pathology remains poorly characterized. This is due to the paucity of available teeth from affected individuals suitable for biochemical and histological examination and the difficulty of obtaining developing human dental tissues. Mouse models are therefore an essential resource for furthering our understanding of the role of amelogenin in enamel bio-mineralization. Analysis of amelogenin-null mice has demonstrated that although ameloblast differentiation is normal, the resulting enamel is hypoplastic, appearing as an abnormally thin layer that lacks the highly organized prismatic structure characteristic of the mature tissue, suggesting that amelogenin is essential for the control of enamel bio-mineralization, structure and thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C26">26</xref>). In this respect, the amelogenin-null mouse combines the various human phenotypes into a single model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C9">9</xref>).</p><p>In the current article, we report the novel mis-sense mutation Y64H in amelogenin as underlying the AI phenotype observed in mice obtained as part of a large-scale ENU mutagenesis programme (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.gsc.riken.jp/Mouse/">http://www.gsc.riken.jp/Mouse/</uri>). The Y64H mutation occurs within the conserved tri-tyrosyl motif (PYPSYGYEPMGGW) of amelogenin which binds to <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucosamine and is positioned towards the C-terminus of the TRAP region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C15">15</xref>). In humans, a P &#x02192; T mutation, which also lies in this domain, underlies a unique but consistent AI phenotype in three families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C27">27</xref>). Our results show that the murine Y64H mutation results in enamel that is hypomineralized in the case of <italic>Amelx</italic><sup>X/Y64H</sup> mice or severely hypoplastic in the case of <italic>Amelx</italic><sup>Y/Y64H</sup> and <italic>Amelx</italic><sup>Y64H/Y64H</sup> animals indicating that the M100888 mutant mice phenocopy AI patients presenting with a P &#x02192; T mutation in the tri-tyrosyl motif of amelogenin.</p><p>Large areas of enamel were missing from the teeth of Y64H homozygotes (both <italic>Amelx</italic><sup>Y/Y64H</sup> males and <italic>Amelx</italic><sup>Y64H/Y64H</sup> females), though the mineral levels in the enamel that remained were within the normal range; however, the ultrastructural appearance was severely dysplastic. It is unclear whether the apparent loss of enamel from these teeth results from post-eruptive breakdown or whether this is a primary developmental defect. Our preliminary investigations using nano-CT scanning of unerupted teeth suggests the latter (data not shown). The physical properties of dental enamel are closely associated with its structure and prismatic organization. Previous studies have shown that nascent amelogenin localizes to prism cores in the newly secreted enamel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C28">28</xref>) suggesting a role in mineral organization. Using SDS&#x02013;PAGE and Western analysis, we failed to demonstrate the presence of full-length nascent amelogenin within the secretory stage matrix of <italic>Amelx</italic><sup>Y/Y64H</sup> teeth. The lower molecular weight amelogenin components detected in these animals are likely to reflect proteins arising from differentially spliced <italic>Amelx</italic> transcripts, the most abundant of which is thought to be the leucine-rich amelogenin peptide (LRAP). LRAP would not contain the Y64H mutation due to splicing out of the 5&#x02032; end of exon 6 containing this mutation.</p><p>The lack of full-length amelogenin in the developing enamel matrix of affected animals suggested therefore that the observed bio-mineralization defects could be due to (i) failure to express full-length amelogenin containing the Y64H mutation; (ii) impaired secretion of Y64H amelogenin or (iii) an unusually high extracellular degradation rate for amelogenins carrying this mutation. Both <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and RT&#x02013;PCR indicated that full-length amelogenin was expressed by ameloblasts in <italic>Amelx</italic><sup>Y/Y64H</sup> mice, eliminating failure to express this transcript as a possible pathogenic mechanism. Our preliminary degradation studies using recombinant WT and Y64H mutant amelogenins incubated with MMP20 extracts showed no gross differences in degradation rate or pattern of resulting degradation products at the time intervals used. This is in contrast to previous reports that showed amelogenin hydrolysis to be compromised as a result of a P &#x02192; T mutation in this same domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C17">17</xref>). Our data tend to eliminate the possibility that the Y64H mutation increases the susceptibility of Y64H amelogenin to normal post-secretory processing and enhanced sensitivity to extracellular proteolysis does not appear to be a mechanism underpinning the observed pathology. We therefore hypothesize that the paucity of full-length Y64H amelogenin in the Y64H mutant enamel matrix results from a failure to successfully traffic and secrete amelogenin into the enamel matrix. Our immunohistochemical data indicate that both amelogenin and ameloblastin accumulate within the ameloblasts of affected mice and that these accumulations become increasingly marked as amelogenesis proceeds. Transmission electron microscopy further confirmed this finding, clearly showing ameloblasts with abnormal cell morphology and engorged endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus heavily immunolabelled with an anti-amelogenin antibody, indicating intracellular retention of Y64H amelogenin.</p><p>In light of the impaired secretion of amelogenin and ameloblastin in M100888 mutant mice, we analysed the effects of WT amelogenin, Y64H mutant amelogenin and ameloblastin expression, both singly and in combination, in a transfected eukaryotic cell line of epithelial origin. This approach is relevant since amelogenin has been shown to interact directly through its tri-tyrosine motif with native and recombinant ameloblastin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C29">29</xref>). In addition, ameloblastin and amelogenin share a common secretory pathway and co-localize within identical secretory granules within ameloblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C30">30</xref>) where they may interact. Co-expression of Y64H mutant amelogenin and ameloblastin in our transfected epithelial cell lines resulted in a marked decrease in cell survival compared with when the three proteins were transfected in isolation or when WT amelogenin and ameloblastin were co-transfected. This observation suggests that a combination of Y64H mutant amelogenin and ameloblastin is a pathological factor in these transfected cells that might also be present <italic>in vivo</italic> in the M100888 mutants. The precise mechanism by which Y64H amelogenin in combination with ameloblastin leads to decreased cell survival in our transfection experiments is unclear but it could be due to Y64H amelogenin&#x02013;ameloblastin interactions resulting in complexes that can be no longer trafficked appropriately prior to secretion due to conformational anomalies. The accumulating protein could then lead to ER stress and cell death.</p><p>Mice expressing a truncated ameloblastin (lacking exons 5 and 6), share similar histopathological features to the Y64H amelogenin mutant mice reported here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C31">31</xref>). The ameloblasts of these mice lose contact with their meagre enamel matrix during the secretory stage of amelogenesis and become disorganized, forming multi-cellular masses often enclosing isolated accretions of matrix-like material. This raises the possibility that the M100888 mutant phenotype may be due in part to disturbances involving ameloblastin secretion and function that normally rely on amelogenin&#x02013;ameloblastin interactions&#x02014;these interactions being compromised in the presence of Y64H mutant amelogenin.</p><p>What is certain is that biological interplay between amelogenin and ameloblastin appears to be necessary to sustain ameloblasts during the secretory stage of amelogenesis. In mice null for both amelogenin and ameloblastin the deleterious effect on enamel formation was greater than in mice null for amelogenin alone or null for ameloblastin alone suggesting a synergistic role for these proteins in amelogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C32">32</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that the ameloblasts in M100888 mutant mice endure a secretory defect which impairs not only the secretion of amelogenin but also that of ameloblastin. The impairment of ameloblastin secretion may be responsible for the altered behaviour of the ameloblasts in the Y64H amelogenin mutant mouse acting similarly to the loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>Ambn</italic> mutant mouse. It is also plausible that the retention of both proteins within ameloblasts would induce cellular stresses which culminate in the extensive apoptosis we observed in the Y64H mutant mouse; a phenomenon that is clearly modelled by our transfection studies.</p><p>However, when considering amelogenin&#x02013;ameloblastin interactions and their potential role in amelogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, the relative abundances of the two proteins must be considered. The intra-cellular concentrations of amelogenin and ameloblastin are unknown but there is a huge excess of amelogenin over ameloblastin in the extracellular matrix. It is therefore conceivable that the synthesis of both proteins differs commensurately and that most amelogenin remains un-associated with the much scarcer ameloblastin in the intracellular secretory pathway. Abnormal amelogenin&#x02013;ameloblastin interactions may therefore be only one part of the reason for impairment of secretion in Y64H mutant mice. Other protein&#x02013;protein interactions may also be affected, including amelogenin&#x02013;cytokeratin interactions. The tri-tyrosyl motif has been shown to bind to a conserved <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucosamine mimicking sequence present in cytokeratin 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C33">33</xref>) and <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucosamine residues on cytokeratin 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C19">19</xref>). Amelogenin and cytokeratin 14 co-localize at the apical regions of ameloblasts and dissociate at the Tomes&#x02019; processes prior to secretion leading to suggestions of a possible role for cytokeratin 14 in chaperoning amelogenin during amelogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C33">33</xref>). Failure to bind cytokeratin 14 was demonstrated when the human P &#x02192; T mutation was introduced into the amelogenin tri-tyrosyl motif or when all three tyrosine residues were replaced by phenylalanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C33">33</xref>). It is therefore possible that the Y64H mutation also affects binding between amelogenin and cytokeratin 14 which is necessary for amelogenin secretion. Whether either or both of these possible mechanisms is driving phenotype in the Y64H mutant mice, we suggest that failure to secrete matrix proteins would lead to cell stress and disruption of normal ameloblast organization and behaviour.</p><p>In this study, we have shown here that abnormal retention of matrix components within the ameloblasts is coincident with loss of ameloblast organization and appearance of multi-cellular masses, frequently associated with tissue necrosis, in the Y64H animals. Analysis of cell proliferation showed that increased cell proliferation was a feature of the surrounding connective tissue rather than the ameloblasts themselves. Investigations of cell death revealed a pronounced loss of ameloblasts associated with apoptosis at around the point where the multi-cellular masses began to form. This massive loss of ameloblasts was seen histologically as a region of necrosis. The increased proliferation within the surrounding connective tissue may therefore be a pathological reaction to this necrosis leading to the observed connective tissue invasion and fibrosis of the persisting enamel matrix. Such fibrosis is a well-known occurrence in many chronic, necrotizing pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C37">37</xref>). The presence of multi-cellular masses in the jaws of the M100888 mice reported here has also been observed in transgenic mice expressing the P &#x02192; T mutation in the human amelogenin tri-tyrosyl motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C38">38</xref>), further paralleling the Y64H mutation with that found in humans.</p><p>We predict that the Y64H amelogenin mutation results in a failure to traffic and secrete protein along the usual pathways resulting in the observed accumulation of amelogenin and ameloblastin in the ameloblast endoplasmic reticulum. This could be due to one of two different mechanisms: the presence of the Y64H mutation in the amelogenin tri-tyrosyl domain could preclude normal chaperoning and intracellular trafficking. Our preliminary results using recombinant Y64H and WT amelogenins show that amelogenin&#x02013;amelogenin near neighbour interactions are similar. It is therefore possible that other protein&#x02013;protein binding, including ameloblastin&#x02013;amelogenin binding and/or cytokeratin&#x02013;amelogenin binding, is necessary to prevent intracellular amelogenin self-assembly which in turn would lead to secretory failure. Other examples of this in man include the premature oligomerization of mutated forms of myelin proteolipid protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, shown to cause secretory failure and resulting in dysmyelinating disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ001C39">39</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we describe here a mis-sense mutation in the murine <italic>Amelx</italic> tri-tyrosyl domain of the enamel extracellular matrix protein amelogenin that phenocopies human X-linked AI where similar mutations have been reported in the same sequence. Animals affected by the mutation have severe enamel bio-mineralization defects associated with absence of full-length amelogenin protein in the developing enamel matrix, loss of ameloblast phenotype, increased ameloblast apoptosis and formation of multi-cellular masses. We present evidence to demonstrate that affected ameloblasts express but fail to secrete amelogenin leading to ER/Golgi engorgement and hypothesize that this is a key mechanistic factor underpinning the pathology. This study therefore successfully links phenotype with underlying genetic lesion in a relevant murine model for human AI.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Source of material and gene sequencing</title><p>The mutant mouse line M100888 was obtained from RIKEN GSC (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.gsc.riken.jp/Mouse/">http://www.gsc.riken.jp/Mouse/</uri>) and maintained on a DBA/2J genetic background.

A 10 &#x000b5;l aliquot of the mixture was removed immediately, diluted with 10 &#x000b5;l of SDS&#x02013;PAGE sample loading buffer containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until required. The remaining sample was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C and further aliquots were removed after 8 and 24 h. Samples were analysed by loading 10 &#x000b5;l per lane on 15% SDS&#x02013;PAGE mini gels and stained with Coomassie Blue.</p></sec><sec id="s4m"><title>Determination of transcript size using RT&#x02013;PCR</title><p>Lower incisors dissected from WT and hemizygous mutant male mice mandibles (<italic>n</italic> = 3) were immediately placed into RNA<italic>later</italic>&#x02122; solution (Applied Biosystems) for RNA preservation in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was extracted from whole mice teeth using the Ribopure&#x02122; kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was evaluated using spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis and subjected to DNase treatment to remove contaminating DNA using the Turbo DNA-<italic>free</italic>&#x02122; kit (Applied Biosystems). Reverse transcription was performed using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche).

This strategy yielded a mutant amelogenin cDNA of identical amino acid sequence to that of the mouse. Subsequently, cDNAs encoding WT and mutant amelogenin were sub-cloned into the expression vector pSG5-HA. A full-length ameloblastin cDNA (IMAGE clone 30504437; Geneservice, Cambridge, UK) was sub-cloned into the expression vector pSG5-FLAG. All constructs were verified by sequence analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4o"><title>Transfection experiments</title><p>COS-7 cells were cultured on coverslips in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Once cells had reached 90% confluence, they were transfected with 8 &#x000b5;g of each construct using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) and incubated as above for 18 h. Transfections omitting the DNA constructs were set up as negative controls. Subsequently, cells were fixed in ice cold 4% paraformaldehyde and autofluorescence was quenched by treating cells first with 50 m<sc>m</sc> ammonium chloride in PBS and then in 0.1 <sc>m</sc> glycine. The cells were then made permeable using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and amelogenin and ameloblastin expression detected using the appropriate fluorescently labelled antibody (see above). Immunolabelled cells were examined on a Delta Vision RT (Applied Precision) restoration microscope using a 100<italic>x</italic>/1.4 Uplan Apo objective and the Sedat filter set (Chroma 89000 v2).
