Four recombinant clones were characterized and each contained the sequence of the oligonucleotide probes used in screening. They were capable also of expressing an antigen recognizable by a polyclonal or a mixture of monoclonal antibodies raised against avidin. The longest clone, lambda cAV4, contained the entire coding sequence of avidin along with a signal peptide of 24 amino acids. An avidin mRNA, approximately 700 nucleotides in length, was induced by a single injection of progesterone over a period of twenty four hours. The avidin mRNA was distributed in a tissue-specific manner, since detectable concentration of the mRNA appeared only in the oviduct after stimulation with progesterone alone or with a combination of progesterone and estrogen. No avidin mRNA was detected in the liver or kidney under these conditions. Preliminary results on the genomic complexity of avidin suggest a single copy gene. Isolation of the natural gene for avidin and studies on its regulation now can be initiated using the cDNA probe.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0398-a" xlink:role="3600"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0399-a" xlink:role="3601"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0401-a" xlink:role="3603"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0393.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3595"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0394.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3596"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0395.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3597"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0396.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3598"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0397.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3599"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0398.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3600"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0399.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3601"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0400.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3602"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0401.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3603"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0402.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3604"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0403.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3605"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0404.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3606"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
