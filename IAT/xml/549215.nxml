During the course of these experiments it was discovered that the <italic>in utero </italic>transfer of the gene for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<italic>cftr</italic>) to normal rat fetuses resulted in phenotypic changes in the neonatal lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. At the time of gene transfer the targeted epithelial cells were undifferentiated multipotential cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Administration of <italic>cftr </italic>to this epithelium using an adenovirus vector system resulted in persistent phenotypic changes in cells although the expression of the transgene was transient. These data provided the first insight that CFTR expression during the fetal period could permanently alter the differentiation of lung epithelial cells. The permanent functional changes in the <italic>in utero cftr</italic>-treated rats included an enhanced resistance to pulmonary bacterial infection three months after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>At the same time, other laboratories were examining the temporal and tissue-specific expression of CFTR. CFTR lung expression is greatest during the fetal period where it is localized to airway epithelial undifferentiated multipotential cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. As these multipotential cells differentiate, the expression of CFTR dissipates and the adult lung expresses only a fraction of that expressed during the fetal period. Thus, CFTR resembles other developmentally important genes in its expression at specific times during organogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In addition to its role as a chloride channel in the mature lung, CFTR's expression in undifferentiated epithelial cells suggested another role (or roles) during development. Moreover, this raised the question of how much of CF disease pathology could be attributed specifically to the lack of CFTR expression during differentiation and how much could be attributed to lack of a chloride channel in the mature lung.</p><p>These questions prompted further experiments by this laboratory in the CF knockout mouse. Reversal of the lethal phenotype of the CF (<italic>cftr </italic>-/-) mouse following transient <italic>in utero </italic>expression of <italic>cftr </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] confirmed the role of this gene in gut development. Because of the rapid cell turnover, the human CFTR transgene was detected in the fetal gut for up to 72 hours post-treatment but not after birth. The <italic>in utero </italic>gene therapy did not permanently replace the CFTR-encoded cAMP-dependent chloride channel but rescued the mice from the disease phenotype and reversed biochemical markers specific to the knockout phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These data established that extra uterine expression of CFTR was not required for the correction of the intestinal obstruction in <italic>cftr </italic>-/- mice.</p><p>Additional insight into the role of CFTR in secretory cell development was obtained when we began to examine the effects of CFTR following <italic>in utero </italic>over expression in homozygous normal mouse pups and discovered that over expression resulted in a lethal phenotype due to epithelial cell hyperplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Characterization of the secretory epithelium following CFTR over expression during fetal development has now demonstrated accelerated lung epithelial cell differentiation in the rat, mouse and nonhuman primate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Experiments examining the developmental role of CFTR relied on either a knockout mouse model that poorly mimicked human lung disease or over expression studies in normal animals. At this point it seemed that only two research approaches were available to determine which aspects of CF pathology were due to the lack of CFTR expression during development. Reversal of human CF by transient <italic>in utero </italic>gene therapy is currently under consideration by our laboratory, but is many years from practical therapeutic consideration. Alternately, one could attempt to transiently inhibit in animals models CFTR production <italic>in utero </italic>to induce aspects of the adult CF disease phenotype in the presence of normal adult levels of CFTR.</p><p>The <italic>in utero </italic>gene transfer method developed by this laboratory uses small quantities of recombinant adenovirus at times during gestation when the lung and intestine epithelium is largely composed of undifferentiated multipotential cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recombinant adenoviruses at 10<sup>8 </sup>pfu/ml of amniotic fluid have been transferred to mice, rats, and rhesus monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The high transfer efficiency and absent immune response suggested that it was possible to use recombinant adenoviruses to transfer antisense genes to the lung and intestinal epithelium and transiently inhibit gene expression. Because undifferentiated multipotential cells were targeted, transfer of the antisense analog of a developmentally active gene would have the potential to significantly affect the developmental cascades in the lung and intestines. Recently, we developed a transient <italic>in utero </italic>knockout (TIUKO) technology to inhibit expression of specific genes in the fetal lung and intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In this paper the TIUKO technology is applied to the question of the developmental role of CFTR in the cystic fibrosis phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Inhibition of CFTR expression using TIUKO</title><p>An adenovirus was constructed from a ATCC plasmid containing exons 1&#x02013;6 of <italic>cftr </italic>included in the [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] cloned into a recombinant adenovirus in the 3'-5', antisense direction (AdCMVAScftr). This virus was used for <italic>in utero </italic>gene transfer into fetal rats at 16 days gestation.</p><p>Sprague-Dawley rats were used in these experiments. There were 75 rats from 7 litters in the control group and 114 rats from 11 litters in the TIUKO group. The rats were treated with AdCMVAScftr at 16 days gestation and were evaluated daily from 18&#x02013;22 days gestation and up to 1 year following birth.</p><p>The choice of controls for these experiments was a primary consideration. We showed in several publications that over expression of CFTR in normal mice and rats results in altered lung morphology. Thus, neither <italic>cftr </italic>constructs nor any sense portion of this gene could be used as a control. An adenovirus with exons 1&#x02013;6 in the sense direction would not express a truncated product and thus its expression could not be detected as a control. The adenovirus constructs with beta-galactosidase (AdCMVlacZ) and green fluorescent protein (AdCMVgfp) were used in previous experiments in several hundred individual fetuses with no effect on the viability, structure, or function of the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, these two adenoviruses with reporter genes were used as negative controls for normal organogenesis.</p><p>The effects of AdCMVAScftr on CFTR expression in rat tissues was compared to control (AdCMVlacZ-treated) lungs at 24 and 72 hours post antisense therapy by fluorescent immunohistochemistry. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, deconvolution microscopic analysis readily detected CFTR in the normal embryonic lungs. The specificity of the immunohistochemistry was shown by the blocking of all fluorescence using specific blocking peptides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Comparison of control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and antisense CFTR treated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) revealed decreased expression of CFTR in antisense treated lungs.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of CFTR expression in rats treated <italic>in utero </italic>with antisense c <italic>ftr </italic></bold>.

Transfection efficiency via the amniotic fluid is less than 10% so only between 10<sup>6&#x02013;7 </sup>cells are affected in the tissue. Thus, real time PCR, northern blots, and western blots lack the sensitivity to detect these changes as shown in our previous publication on the TIUKO <italic>c-myc </italic>mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Thus, the only method available to quantitate reduction in target gene expression in the TIUKO method is image analysis of random sections from multiple, independently treated lungs. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, image analyses of the relative levels of CFTR expressed per cell in the AdCMVAScftr-treated tissues were performed.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Quantitation of CFTR expression following infection with AdCMVAScftr</bold>.

Previously, transient expression of the antisense to a known growth factor <italic>c-myc </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] demonstrated its requirement for normal cell expansion in both the lungs and intestines. The key element in the TIUKO method is the targeting of multi-potential, undifferentiated cells. Because the lung is developing rapidly at the time, organogenesis can be dramatically affected by inhibition of genes involved in a developmental cascade. Thus, inhibition of <italic>c-myc </italic>gave rise to severely hypoplastic lungs and stunted villi formation in the intestines, even though fewer than 10<sup>7 </sup>cells were affected by the antisense transgene. This method can be used to dissect the developmental pathway of different epithelial cell types in these organs.</p><p>One caveat with the TIUKO method, however, is the difficulty in measuring the decrease in expression of the target gene. Because the population of affected multipotential, undifferentiated cells represent a small proportion of the total, rapidly expanding lung population, it is impossible to detect the changes in gene expression via real time PCR, northern blots, or western blots. However, as shown previously two independent methods, antisense and ubiquitin targeted, down regulation of C-MYC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] yielded identical phenotypes and immunofluorescent quantitated decrease of the target transgene,. In this paper, all conclusions are based only immunofluorescent quantitation of target gene down regulation following transient antisense CFTR <italic>in utero </italic>.</p><p>Cystic fibrosis is a pleiotropic disease. The seemingly unrelated phenotypic effects of CFTR are largely unexplained by the hypothesis that CF pathology results from the lack of continuous chloride channel expression. Beginning with the reversal of the CF knockout mouse phenotype with transient <italic>in utero cftr </italic>gene therapy using a recombinant adenovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], this laboratory proposed that CF was also a disease of secretory cell differentiation and that the protein's many functions, including that of a chloride channel, were required for multipotential cell differentiation. Results supporting this hypothesis were obtained in mice, rats and non-human primates. Thus, some of the altered functions observed in CF tissues are due to incomplete development and malfunctioning secretory cells.</p><p>As shown recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], CFTR is highly expressed in the lung during the pseudoglandular phase of development and begins to decline during the cannalicular phase of development where it remains low at birth. This early phase of lung development correlates with that used for <italic>in utero </italic>gene therapy and reversal of the knockout mouse phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These data also suggested that the transient, selective, inhibition of CFTR expression should recapitulate the human CF phenotype without species-specific compensatory mechanisms interference. The development of the TIUKO method permitted such experiments.</p><p>The selective, transient CFTR expression inhibition in a small number (&#x0003c;10<sup>7</sup>) of undifferentiated multipotential cells was performed in using a recombinant adenovirus with a <italic>cftr </italic>fragment cloned in the 3'-5', antisense, direction. As shown in immunohistochemical examinations of lung tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), specific inhibition of CFTR expression occurred to the extent of that obtained previously with antisense <italic>c-myc </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In the lungs of TIUKO CF rats, significant changes in lung structure were not readily apparent at birth. As the animals aged, however, airway thickening and fibrosis were found morphologically. Changes in the airways were confirmed with morphometric analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and pulmonary function tests (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Thus, the TIUKO CF rats reproduced many aspects seen in lung disease of human.</p><p>Elevated serum levels of MRP8 were used to identify CF affected individuals and heterozygous carriers prior to the cloning of the <italic>cftr </italic>gene. The gene for the cystic fibrosis antigen (MRP8) was cloned in 1987 by Dorin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Because intermediate levels of the protein were expressed in clinically unaffected heterozygotes it was hypothesized at that time that its expression was closely related to the basic defect of cystic fibrosis. Work on this protein lost momentum when the <italic>cftr </italic>gene was cloned and confirmed to be a chloride channel and also when MRP 8 expression was not found in the preliminary survey of adult and fetal CF lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Because MRP8/14 is highly expressed in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, the high levels of MRP8/14 in CF patients were explained as a result of inflammation rather than a potential source of it. In addition to elevated levels of MRP8/14 protein in human CF serum, mRNA expression has been found in tracheal gland cells obtained from normal and cystic fibrosis patients. A significant increase in these mRNAs was shown in the cells of CF origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The increased expression of this protein in the fetal lung following antisense <italic>cftr </italic>gene transfer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) is consistent with human CF and the knockout mouse.</p><p>Reversal of the CF phenotype by <italic>in utero </italic>gene therapy and the developmental changes following CFTR over expression studies in mice, rats, and non-human primates are consistent with a developmental paradigm for this disease. As summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, the TIUKO CF rats demonstrate that faulty differentiation of secretory cell may be associated with many of the features of the CF lung disease phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of cystic fibrosis disease phenotypes between human and animal models</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>HUMAN DISEASE PHENOTYPE</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>CFTR KNOCKOUT MOUSE MODEL PHENOTYPE</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>TIUKO CF RAT PHENOTYPE</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">LUNG FIBROSIS</td><td align="left">FIBROSIS AND INFLAMMATION</td><td align="left">PRESENT BY 100 DAYS OF AGE</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MRP8/14 ELEVATED</td><td align="left">DETECTED IN G551D MOUSE</td><td align="left">INCREASED PRENATALLY</td></tr><tr><td align="left">AIRWAY REACTIVITY</td><td align="left">NOT DETECTED</td><td align="left">INCREASED WITH AGE</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CHRONIC INFLAMMATION</td><td align="left">DETECTED IN CONGENIC MICE</td><td align="left">PRESENT BY 100 DAYS OF AGE</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Several recent papers illustrate the potential role of the developmental requirement of CFTR in CF pathophysiology and lung growth Groman and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] found a subset of patients with the CF phenotype and no mutation in the <italic>cftr </italic>coding sequence. This finding is consistent with the role in CF of other genes in a common secretory cell pathway that includes <italic>cftr </italic>as only one of many components. In addition, transplant of human fetal CF lung tissues into SCID mice resulted in lung inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These data are consistent with our prenatal elevation of the MRP8/14 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) and suggest that developmental interference with secretory cell differentiation results in a constitutive inflammatory response.</p><p>Until recently, no distinctive changes in lung structure and function were found in the CFTR knockout mouse. However, recent evaluation by our laboratory of lung function in <italic>cftr+/+</italic>, <italic>cftr+/-</italic>, and <italic>cftr-/- </italic>mice, showed distinct phenotypes for each genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus, normal lung development in mouse is affected in a dose response manner by CFTR. The TIUKO rat is distinct genetically from a heterozygous animal. In heterozygous animals, one maintains a single functional copy of the transgene in all multipotential, undifferentiated cells of the developing fetal lung. So in the mature, heterozygous lung altered pulmonary function but normal structure is observed. In contrast, in the TIUKO CF fetal lung, multipotential, undifferentiated cells infected with the antisense gene have a total deficiency of CFTR (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The developing TIUKO CF rat lung is a mosaic of normal (<italic>cftr+/+</italic>) and CFTR deficient (essentially <italic>cftr-/-</italic>). Thus, as shown in this paper, the TUIKO CF rat exhibited a CF-related phenotype while a CFTR heterozygous does not show any CF features.</p><p>We propose that CFTR is part of a developmental cascade for secretory cells in the lung, intestines, pancreas and other secretory organs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Disruption of this pathway could occur by either a <italic>cftr </italic>mutation, or as suggested by Groman et al's [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] work, other mutations of genes in this cascade. This would lead to incomplete differentiation of secretory cells and loss of function (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). In addition, the failure of secretory cell differentiation leads to a constitutive expression of cytokines that function in development as agents of differentiation. Once the immune system matures postnatally, however, these same cytokines assume a proinflammatory role, leading to chronic inflammation and fibrosis. The TIUKO CF rats may be used to identify these other genes involved in human lung epithelial cell differentiation and diseases resulting from their dysfunction. Finally, the TIUKO CF rat provides an animal model for the development of pharmacologic agents to disrupt the constitutional inflammatory processes in the CF affected tissues.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Developmental Paradigm for Cystic Fibrosis Lung Fibrosis Based on TIUKO CF Rat and Developmental Studies in Mice, Rats, and Non-human Primates</bold>. In Panel A CFTR is shown as one member of a developmental cascade required for normal secretory epithelium development. Included in this pathway are other cytokines, possibly MRP8/14. In normal development in the presence of CFTR feedback mechanisms either completely inhibit or at least decrease the expression of these developmentally active cytokines. In the absence of CFTR, Panel B, the secretory epithelium fails to differentiate properly. Failed development leads to an immature epithelium that does not exhibit the feedback function necessary for inhibition of developmentally required cytokines. Expression of these cytokines in the permanent, developmental immature, CF lung leads to activation of inflammatory cells once the immune system matures post-natal. Constitutive, chronic inflammation would explain the lung fibrosis and inflammatory disease seen in CF patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-5-2-8"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Transient inhibition of CFTR expression in the lungs results in many features of cystic fibrosis in the mature animal.
