These observations were interpreted to suggest that this molecular stress-response chaperone has a capacity to buffer underlying genetic variation. Conversely, the protective role of Hsp90 could account for the variable penetrance or severity of some heritable developmental malformations in vertebrates. Using zebrafish as a model, we defined Hsp90 inhibitor levels that did not induce a heat shock response or perturb phenotype in wild-type strains. Under these conditions the severity of the recessive eye phenotype in <italic>sunrise</italic>, caused by a <italic>pax6b</italic> mutation, was increased, while in <italic>dreumes,</italic> caused by a <italic>sufu</italic> mutation, it was decreased. In another strain, a previously unobserved spectrum of severe structural eye malformations, reminiscent of anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and nanophthalmia complex in humans, was uncovered by this limited inhibition of Hsp90 function. Inbreeding of offspring from selected unaffected carrier parents led to significantly elevated malformation frequencies and revealed the oligogenic nature of this phenotype. Unlike in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> Hsp90 inhibition can decrease developmental stability in zebrafish, as indicated by increased asymmetric presentation of anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and nanophthalmia and <italic>sunrise</italic> phenotypes. Analysis of the <italic>sunrise pax6b</italic> mutation suggests a molecular mechanism for the buffering of mutations by Hsp90. The zebrafish studies imply that mild perturbation of Hsp90 function at critical developmental stages may underpin the variable penetrance and expressivity of many developmental anomalies where the interaction between genotype and environment plays a major role.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Genetic variation is not always expressed as a single consistent phenotype even in familial diseases. Unilateral malformations in paired organs, such as the failure of an eye to develop on one side only, also remind us that gene function is often modified by environmental factors. Following observations by others in fruit flies, we explored the underlying mechanisms for such phenotypic fluctuation, using zebrafish as a vertebrate model. Earlier work suggested involvement of chaperone proteins like Hsp90, which assist with normal protein folding during development and also work overtime to keep proteins functional in response to environmental stress. Using specific drugs at defined times in early development for the limited reduction of Hsp90 activity, we showed that different cryptic genetic variants could be revealed consistently in genetically distinct fish strains. Once uncovered, the frequency of these variants was increased by inbreeding, confirming the role of underlying genetic factors. Similarly, we could modify the phenotypic severity of some&#x02014;but not all&#x02014;known gene variants, worsening some and improving others. It emerged that the most susceptible variants were those carrying amino acid alterations, in which assisted protein folding may either restore near normal function or facilitate malfunction, thus worsening phenotype. This insight may allow us to prevent recurrent malformations by minimizing or perhaps even counteracting the effects of exposure to environmental stress during development.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Yeyati PL, Bancewicz RM, Maule J, van Heyningen V (2007) Hsp90 selectively modulates phenotype in vertebrate development.

Predicting phenotypic outcomes for such cases is often an impossible challenge in clinical genetics. As a corollary, it has become clear that robustness of the wild-type (WT) phenotype to extensive genetic and environmental variation may be ascribed to the complexity, and hence strong buffering capacity of gene networks and cellular surveillance mechanisms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. These homeostatic systems are of major clinical relevance as potential prophylactic and therapeutic targets. Understanding the molecular events that can alter the balance between cryptic and overt phenotypes is therefore an important endeavour.</p><p>Based on observations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, we set out to assess the role of stress-response pathways, particularly of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) function, in phenotype modification, using zebrafish as a vertebrate model. Hsp90 proteins are environmentally responsive chaperones, encoded at multiple loci in vertebrates. Under normal conditions they assist the maturation and folding of newly synthesised proteins and escort metastable regulatory molecules such as kinases and steroid hormone receptors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. In response to mutation or environmental stress, additional Hsp90 capacity is required to maintain newly destabilized proteins in a folding competent state. An unexpected consequence of this dual role is that Hsp90 can become functionally limiting, so that overt phenotypes may be uncovered from previously cryptic genetic variants, in spite of Hsp90 being further induced under stress &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Two recent studies showed that Hsp90 perturbation affects nearly all body parts in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and numerous morphological phenotypes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Most changes were recurrent in a strain-specific manner and enriched by subsequent inbreeding, suggesting that they arose from previously silent but preexisting genetic variants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Recently, it was proposed that Hsp90 can affect the epigenetic state at specific loci, leading to phenotype modulation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Interfering with Hsp90 buffering therefore has phenotypic consequences, which are dependent on underlying genetic and epigenetic components, although it is not clear whether some preexisting genetic change is required for epigenetic inheritance of the trait &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The Hsp90 loci identified in humans have distinct subcellular localisation: HSP90 alpha and beta, encoded by HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1, are expressed in the cytoplasm; while GRP94, a glucose responsive form encoded by HSP90B1 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum; and there is a mitochondrial form, TRAP1 (TNF receptor-associated protein 1). Genetic studies in mice suggest that despite the close similarity between Hsp90aa1 and Hsp90ab1, these paralogues are not functionally redundant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.

Complete loss of Hsp90 function is lethal, as multiple essential pathways are inactivated, a feature exploited in cancer treatment, where tumour-cell growth is heavily dependent on mutated oncogenic proteins that require Hsp90 assistance to function during malignant progression (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; and &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;).

Hsp90 inhibitors used above a threshold level induce a heat shock response through the activation of heat shock factor 1, which is normally silenced by association with Hsp90 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Classical examples of developmental anomalies with variable severity and penetrance include holoprosencephaly, neural tube defects, cleft lip and palate, and heart malformations. Recently our human disease interests have focused on severe eye malformations, such as anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and coloboma &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b034">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. These provide additional good examples of non-Mendelian inheritance patterns, where the relative contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the complex phenotypes remains controversial. If vertebrate phenotypes are also modulated by Hsp90, these could provide the molecular link between periodic environmental fluctuation and the overt manifestation of genetic susceptibility. If the chaperone system plays a buffering role in the variability of certain mutant phenotypes, compromising Hsp90 function may alter the severity or penetrance of some defined traits without affecting overall development.</p><p>Here we report that previously unobserved specific developmental anomalies were uncovered following partial inhibition of Hsp90 function in zebrafish. The spectrum of phenotypes observed and the organ systems affected depend both on the strain used and on the developmental stage at which the carefully controlled Hsp90 inhibitor is administered. Breeding studies clearly indicate that the phenotypes are manifestations of underlying cryptic genetic variation. Under our conditions, WT strains do not give rise to the rare malformations we observed in some mutant strains but do reveal more common anomalies that may reflect the uncovering of generally silent common gene variants. In addition to the de novo exposure of cryptic variation, we also showed that Hsp90 inhibition can modify the severity of some, but not all, already characterized developmental anomalies. Phenotype amelioration was observed in one case and increased severity in another. Both of the modified phenotypes were characterized as missense mutations at different loci. No phenotype modulation was observed at two different loci where the mutations had been identified as nonsense changes. Molecular studies show that in the presence of Hsp90 inhibition one of the mutant proteins studied is rapidly decreased, while its WT allele is largely unaffected, providing a molecular model for Hsp90 modulation of phenotype at the organismal level.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Establishing Drug, Morpholino Doses, and Treatment Timing in WT Strains</title><p>Geldanamycin (GA) has been used previously to examine the requirement for Hsp90 during zebrafish development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

Hsp90 function was reduced by treating embryos with radicicol (a macrolactone), which is functionally equivalent to but structurally distinct from GA (a benzoquinone ansanamycin). Subsequently we also used the GA class inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;, which has low toxicity and is now in clinical trials for cancer therapy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

When treatment was initiated at 30&#x00025; epiboly (defined as 4.6 h postfertilization &#x0005b;hpf&#x0005d;), both drugs caused multiple phenotypes and reduced viability assessed at 24&#x02013;48 hpf. For example, among those surviving to 24 hpf following treatment with 10 &#x003bc;M radicicol or 3.3 &#x003bc;M 17AAG, we repeatedly observed growth retardation, decreased pigmentation, pericardial oedema with or without abnormal heart morphology, fin-fold, and notochord defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g001">Figure 1</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g001">1</xref>K).

Radicicol also produced a few cases of severe growth retardation. Most of these phenotypes were present in all WT strains tested, but with clearly different frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>Higher survival rates and lower frequencies of developmental malformations were achieved by initiating treatment with the same doses but later in development, 50&#x00025; epiboly (5.25 hpf). Many of the elicited phenotypes were milder and transient, like growth delay, fin-fold defects, or mild heart oedemas mostly with normal morphology and circulation. These embryos were generally indistinguishable from sibling controls by 5 d postfertilization (dpf). Notochord folds were noted but heart looping was unaffected. These phenotypes were again shared by most strains tested, albeit at slightly different frequencies. The penetrance of these common phenotypes in each strain was apparently decreased compared to earlier treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030043-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). In agreement, these drug doses had no adverse developmental effects when treatment was initiated at 75&#x00025; epiboly (8 hpf). We assessed the molecular events elicited by initiating treatment at 50&#x00025; epiboly with the indicated drug doses by monitoring heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) levels in treated embryos. Hsp70 was not induced at any of the inhibitor doses tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Hsp90 functional reduction was confirmed by monitoring the Hsp90 client protein RAF1, whose levels decrease with Hsp90 inhibition in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Although this gives an indirect estimation of Hsp90 inhibition, the residual presence of RAF1 protein, even at the highest inhibitor dose used, demonstrates that only partial Hsp90 functional reduction was elicited.</p><p>Morpholinos are injected at two to four cell stage, which decreases Hsp90 protein levels at earlier developmental stages than the selected conditions for chemical treatment; but doses that do not give rise to severe phenotypes when injected into WT embryos still help to validate chemical inhibition studies. Injecting the double morpholino knockdown (Hsp90 a&#x0002b;b: 6 ng of hsp90a and 6 ng of hsp90b) partially decreased Hsp90 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g002">Figure 2</xref>C) and had no noticeable effect on embryos derived from the WT strains Golden (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 71). Higher doses occasionally produced heart defects, such as inverted looping (Golden: 4/100) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g001">Figure 1</xref>O) or no looping (WIK: 5/36) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030043-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A), oedema (Golden: 10/100 and WIK: 0/36), and notochord defects (Golden: 2/100 and WIK: 0/36), but also decreased viability (Golden: 40/100). The low frequency of heterotaxia is in agreement with our observation that trait penetrance decreases when Hsp90 function is chemically reduced before 30&#x00025; epiboly (unpublished data). Doses above 10 ng of each morpholino (Hsp90 a&#x0002b;b) almost completely erased Hsp90 protein, greatly reducing viability, with severe oedema in most embryos (17/20 injected) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030043-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B). While the specific chemical inhibitors reduce the functional capacity of Hsp90 without decreasing Hsp90 protein levels, in morpholino-injected embryos Hsp90 levels were reduced in a dose-dependent manner with the consequent Hsp70 induction and decreased RAF1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).</p><p>The two chemically unrelated drugs and morpholino knock down produced an overlapping spectrum of phenotypes, showing different frequencies and severities that may be due to differences in drug metabolism (between radicicol and 17AAG) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b040">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;, or treatment timing (between drugs and morpholino). Most of the phenotypes observed by initiating drug treatment at 30&#x00025; epiboly were shared by all strains tested but revealed at different frequencies and therefore represent Hsp90 buffering of common gene variants or polymorphisms presumably present in different strain specific combinations. Treatment timing was critical for the penetrance of these traits.</p><p>Importantly, when drug treatment was initiated at 50&#x00025; epiboly, rather than 30&#x00025;, there was no significant impairment of development in embryos derived from WT strains. The selected drug concentrations reduce Hsp90 functional activity without inducing a heat shock response, which could obscure the effect of Hsp90 reduction during development.

The different susceptibility of homozygous and heterozygous <italic>sri</italic> embryos demonstrates that the increased phenotypic severity in homozygotes is due to the synergistic effect between decreased Hsp90 function and the homozygous mutant phenotype rather than to additive effects between reduced Hsp90 function and increased dose of the mutant Pax6b protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Factors That Contribute to Phenotype Modification by Hsp90 Inhibition</title><p>The observation that both lens size and shape can be affected in <italic>sri</italic> derived embryos but only lens shape was altered in <italic>dre</italic> embryos suggests that the two developmental processes can be uncoupled.

Coinjecting 6 ng of each morpholino significantly affected lens size without altering lens shape (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030043-t004">Table 4</xref>), confirming that the two developmental processes can be uncoupled. Hsp90 can also be diverted from its developmental role by the induction of a generalised stress response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Brief heat exposure of homozygous <italic>sri</italic> mutants also resulted in altered phenotypic severity not observed in control siblings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030043-t004">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, lens size and shape were affected by heat shock, but in contrast to Hsp90 chemical inhibition, lens shape was ameliorated instead of worsened (compare <italic>t</italic>-values, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030043-t004">Table 4</xref>). Several factors may be contributing to these phenotypic outcomes: functional reduction of Hsp90 by these treatments may be milder than Hsp90-specific chemical inhibition. This seems likely as RAF1 levels observed after morpholino injections are comparable to those seen in control embryos, despite the reduced Hsp90 protein levels (6 ng Hsp90 a&#x0002b;b, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Higher morpholino doses drastically reduced RAF1 levels but mostly produced severely oedematous embryos whose eyes could not be analysed. More significantly, we observed a positive correlation between Hsp70 levels and amelioration of the lens eccentricity (6 ng Hsp90 a&#x0002b;b, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g002">Figure 2</xref>C; Hsp70 levels, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030043-t004">Table 4</xref>).

AMN-like defects were not induced repeatedly in any other mutant or in WT strains tested (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003e; 3,000), where even higher inhibitor doses (10 &#x003bc;M radicicol or 3.3 &#x003bc;M 17AAG and Hsp90 morpholinos) or earlier treatment (at 30&#x00025; epiboly) were ineffective (Multiple Unrelated Strains, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030043-t005">Table 5</xref>; unpublished data). Except for two embryos among several thousand scored, whenever eyes were affected in WT-treated stocks, it was in the presence of other more severe defects like oedema or incomplete development. These occasional abnormal phenotypes do not recur in subsequent generations and their frequency was unaltered by Hsp90 inhibition; they were not counted in the analysis (Multiple Unrelated Strains, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030043-t005">Table 5</xref>). Where reduced Hsp90 function repeatedly reveals increased frequency of offspring with a particular phenotype, it is deemed to be uncovering a previously cryptic mutation in susceptible populations (Parental Transmitters, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030043-t005">Table 5</xref>).

From these, 11 females were crossed to 15 males in 21 different combinations. Half of the pairs transmitted the AMN trait, albeit at greatly different frequencies (0.5&#x00025;&#x02013;13&#x00025;) in the absence of Hsp90 inhibition. This suggests a genetic basis involving several loci, some of which are required to be homozygous. Highly variable frequencies of affected offspring in different batches of eggs from the same mating pair demonstrate the variable penetrance of the trait. Additional rare phenotypes like cyclopia (fused central eye) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g004">Figure 4</xref>D; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030043-t005">Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030043-t006">6</xref>) and posterior body-axis duplications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g004">Figure 4</xref>G) reappeared after inbreeding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030043-t006">Table 6</xref>).

The almost continuous range of phenotypes conforms to a threshold model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d; where several modifiers are required to interact genetically with a primary recessive mutation to elicit the phenotype &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;. The complexity of the gene interactions will be further illustrated by divergent responses to Hsp90 inhibition (see below).</p><p>The inbreeding regime maintained the complex eye trait for at least five generations but never fixed it at Mendelian frequencies, most likely because only phenotypically unaffected individuals could be mated (Inbreeding, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The low frequency of AMN defects observed in subsequent generations is another indication of the oligogenic nature of the trait. Nevertheless, the sensitivity to reduced Hsp90 levels remains. Female transmission of the AMN trait was observed after outcrossing phenotypically WT F1 carrier females to genetically unrelated WT males (F2, Female Outcross, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g005">Figure 5</xref>) with variable frequencies. The affected individuals derived from these outcrosses were viable and fertile, suggesting loss of some deleterious modifiers. However, the phenotype was not observed in the generation arising from these affected sibling crosses (F3, Female Outcross, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g005">Figure 5</xref>), but it was recovered after further inbreeding (F4, Female Outcross, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This inheritance pattern is consistent with a requirement for a maternal recessive component with partial penetrance. In contrast, when selected males were outcrossed to genetically unrelated WT females, AMN-like embryos were not observed initially (F2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g005">Figure 5</xref>, Male Outcross). However, AMN-like embryos were recovered in the first generation of subsequent inbreeding (F3, Male Outcross, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g005">Figure 5</xref>) suggesting that homozygosity of a recessive zygotic component is required. The recessive genetic basis of the AMN trait, suggested by these inheritance patterns, does not exclude the possibility that additional genetic or epigenetic modifiers also affect the severity and/or penetrance of the AMN phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Hsp90 Inhibition Reveals Digenic Nature of the AMN Trait</title><p>Although all transmitting females tested produce some affected offspring upon outcrossing to an unrelated WT male, treatment of embryos from these pairs revealed two types of AMN transmitter females: Two inbred F1 females crossed to four different WT males showed a significant increase in frequency of AMN offspring when embryos were treated with 17AAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g006">Figure 6</xref>; Group 1, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030043-t006">Table 6</xref>).

Alternatively, a previous unrelated mutation, which would not contribute to the trait under normal circumstances, could compromise development, rendering it more susceptible or dependent on fully functional buffering mechanisms like Hsp90.</p><p>Previous work has shown that in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> Hsp90 does not affect the fluctuating asymmetry of quantitative traits &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;.

Initial studies assessed the response of transfected WT and mutant expressed proteins to Hsp90 inhibitors. The <italic>sri</italic> mutation is expected to disrupt the folding of the homeodomain that contains it (R.M. Bancewicz, unpublished data). Immunohistochemical studies show that while WT Pax6b protein remains mostly unaffected, the levels of Pax6b mutant protein are significantly decreased when Hsp90 function is impaired by 17AAG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030043-g009">Figure 9</xref>). The decreased stability of the mutant protein suggests that it requires Hsp90 for maintenance in a stable conformation.

How the integration of multiple pathways, acting in narrow developmental windows, culminates in morphologically constant phenotypes is the subject of continuing debate. At the molecular level, genome duplication along with increasing complexity of epigenetic codes, chromatin regulation, and genomic organisation have led to increased compartmentation and subfunctionalisation, and to an improved capacity to absorb and buffer genetic variation. However, the underlying variation and phenotypic plasticity can be exposed by perturbing the buffering systems (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b065">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;). Modulating Hsp90 function is one mechanism that has been shown to reveal cryptic variation. Unravelling the mechanisms of variability in heritable phenotypes is important for understanding disease predisposition and penetrance. Here we show how vertebrate phenotype can be modulated by the chaperone Hsp90 and start to decipher the molecular underpinnings of this buffering mechanism.</p><p>Fine-tuning the titration and timing of Hsp90 functional reduction allowed us to demonstrate that Hsp90 is also able to buffer hidden genetic variation in vertebrates. The common phenotypes, revealed at different strain-specific frequencies in WT stocks, may represent common polymorphisms present in the available fish populations at several different possibly interacting loci, suggesting Hsp90 buffering may be responsible for canalising polygenic traits present in noninbred populations. Delaying treatment timing decreased the penetrance of these shared phenotypes and revealed the role of Hsp90 in rare malformations, now dependent on unique strain-specific mutations. Reducing Hsp90 function, within the relevant developmental window, generally increased the frequency of abnormal phenotypes such as anophthalmia and microphthalmia, and it altered the severity of some, but not all, Mendelian phenotypes studied. The resistance of some Mendelian mutants and the opposing (worsening versus amelioration) responses in those susceptible to Hsp90 fluctuation demonstrate that vertebrate Hsp90 buffering is a highly selective mechanism, modulating only defined genetic components of phenotypic variation. The recessive nature of the susceptible alleles characterised in this study suggests that the higher frequency and broader spectrum of phenotypes uncovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> may be influenced by the relatively inbred nature of these organisms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Zebrafish do not tolerate a high level of inbreeding, perhaps providing a better model for generally outbred human populations. The number of Hsp90 loci and the different spectrum of environmental triggers may also influence Hsp90 buffering capacity across phyla.</p><p>Opposite outcomes in the Mendelian microphthalmia mutants <italic>sri</italic> and <italic>dre,</italic> with the same tissues affected in both, demonstrate that Hsp90 modulation of phenotypes strongly depends upon the specific underlying genetic components. Despite the strong effect that Hsp90 inhibition had in <italic>sri</italic> homozygous embryos, it had no measurable effect in heterozygotes. This nonadditive response of the <italic>sri</italic> homozygous mutants to Hsp90 fluctuation confirms the role of Hsp90 in the maintenance of trait thresholds &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b067">67</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast to plants and flies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;, these results imply that dominance relationships &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d; may not be alterable in vertebrates by Hsp90&#x02014;that is, previously recessive characters do not become dominant. The severity of the <italic>sri</italic> phenotype was also increased by heat shock. From the evolutionary point of view, increased temperature may not be a frequent mechanism through which Hsp90 releases variability in mammals, but this mechanism probably underlies the observations that maternal fever in humans and mild experimental hyperthermia in animals are associated with increased frequencies of developmental malformations, both mild and severe &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b068">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b070">70</xref>&#x0005d;. Similar adverse phenotypic outcomes may be elicited through induction of protein-folding stress in the developing embryo as a result of exposure to relatively low levels of environmental pollutants, or when endogenous protein aggregation levels are increased &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b071">71</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The uncovering of the complex AMN phenotypes focuses attention on the role of Hsp90 in oligogenic malformations. The involvement of multiple interacting loci, several with recessive effect, is indicated by the requirement for inbreeding, and the less than 25&#x00025; peak frequency observed for AMN phenotypes. The involvement of two distinct sets of genes, but perhaps with overlapping functions, is suggested by the observation that AMN frequencies may be increased or decreased following Hsp90 inhibition in different parental groups. These opposing responses once more underline the complex mechanisms of interaction between developmental alleles and Hsp90-mediated release of genetic variation. The possibility of decreased phenotypic severity under stress conditions (Hsp90 reduction) is potentially of great evolutionary significance.</p><p>The rapid unmasking of divergent phenotypes after Hsp90 reduction helped us to break down the AMN trait into simpler components, indicating that this vertebrate model system may provide a robust approach to identifying cryptic genetic variation that can modify complex developmental traits. Similarly, heart-loop inversion was observed after earlier Hsp90 inhibition during development in all fish stocks tested, but the different frequencies among WT and mutant strains suggest underlying interacting genetic components. Further analysis of this may permit the identification of common susceptibility alleles at interacting loci. The observation that mutations at loci that would not normally contribute to a certain trait (e.g., <italic>pax6b</italic> in heart looping) may potentiate the effect of compromised Hsp90 buffering, suggests that Hsp90 may act in concert with the organism's genotype. This highlights once more the different release of cryptic genetic variation in good health and disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b072">72</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Our results show that in vertebrates, Hsp90 can buffer the phenotypic variability between and within individuals of discrete qualitative morphological traits (mainly anophthalmia and coloboma in this study) culminating in morphologically asymmetrical individuals. The increased frequency of asymmetric unilateral eye defects upon Hsp90 inhibition implies that buffering by this chaperone system contributes to the stabilization of developmental processes that depend on the partition of signalling molecules across body axes. Asymmetric phenotypes could result from stochastic uneven left/right partitioning of signalling molecules. Altered left-right embryonic signalling can affect heart looping in a simi-lar manner. It will be interesting to investigate how perturbation of Hsp90 activity amplifies the effect of these seemingly stochastic events, culminating in a significant increase of abnormal cases. The occurrence of unilateral and bilateral defects among AMN siblings is also strongly reminiscent of the complex human microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma spectrum &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d; and indicates that environmental and stochastic factors continue to play an important role even when there are shared genetic components.</p><p>We show that in vertebrates, Hsp90 can also modulate phenotypic severity of continuous quantitative traits (e.g., relative lens size and lens shape in <italic>sri</italic> mutants). Surprisingly, Hsp90 inhibition does not alter small quantitative left-right differences of these traits, either in <italic>sri</italic> mutants or in WT strains. This raises the question of a fundamentally different molecular basis for developmental instability of discrete and quantitative (continuous) traits in vertebrates.</p><p>To date neither the identity of specific targets, nor the molecular mechanisms by which Hsp90 modulates phenotypic expression of genetic variants at the organismal level have been identified. The <italic>sri pax6b</italic> mutant allowed us to begin to unravel the molecular basis of Hsp90 buffering. The differential sensitivity of the Pax6b <italic>sri</italic> mutant protein in the presence of Hsp90 inhibitors suggests that Hsp90 chaperones the mutant protein; this may permit recovery of some functionality, thereby decreasing the phenotypic consequences of the mutation. Selective degradation of mutant proteins through Hsp90 inhibition has been documented many times for different genes relevant for tumour progression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. This de novo dependency links a previously robust trait to environmental fluctuation, rendering, in our case, eye development more susceptible to external perturbation. Partial penetrance of another <italic>PAX6</italic> homeodomain mutation (R242T) was also observed in the case of a child with unilateral iris coloboma, whose mutation carrier mother was completely unaffected &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Nonconservative missense mutations in <italic>SUFU</italic> (orthologous to the gene mutated in the zebrafish <italic>dre</italic> mutants) have been observed in independently isolated medulloblastomas &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b073">73</xref>&#x0005d; and are therefore associated with cancer. Geographical clusters of children with eye malformations, born to unaffected parents, and the increased incidence of some cancers in certain areas suggest that environmental factors may be implicated in these diseases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b075">75</xref>&#x0005d;. Might such factors play their role by affecting the penetrance of underlying mutations or deleterious polymorphisms in susceptible individuals through diversion of Hsp90 function? While the modifiable eye mutants are caused by missense mutation, other Mendelian mutants that proved to be insensitive to mild Hsp90 reductions were due to stop codon mutations. We are currently investigating whether different types of mutations (truncation versus missense) at a single susceptible locus might have different susceptibility to Hsp90 buffering. Missense mutations within different protein domains (e.g., homeodomain versus paired domain in Pax6) of susceptible proteins may also confer different basal sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibition, as already demonstrated for some kinases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b076">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030043-b077">77</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, might loci initially resistant to Hsp90 fluctuation become susceptible in different genetic backgrounds?</p><p>The identification of Hsp90-buffered genes, mutation types, or alleles, and the structural basis of their sensitivity to limiting chaperone capacity have important clinical implications and will provide unique opportunities to investigate the regulatory mechanisms involved. Our findings open the way to the discovery of rational protective measures that could significantly reduce recurrence of severe developmental malformations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><named-content content-type="genus-species">D. rerio</named-content> stocks.</title><p>Breeding fish were maintained at 28 &#x000b0;C in a circulating water system on a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle.
