Essential components of the RNA polymerase I transcription machinery, including Upstream Binding Factor (UBF), can be detected on some NORs during mitosis; these NORs, termed competent, are believed to be transcriptionally active during interphase. In cultured mammalian cycling cells, the number of competent NORs, and their distribution among the different chromosomes, does not vary significantly in the sequential cell cycles. In this work we investigate whether this stable state is achieved by equal distribution of competent NORs during cell division. To answer this question we first studied the state of NORs in telophase HeLa and LEP cells. In both cell lines we found a small but significant difference between the emerging daughter cells in the number of UBF-loaded NORs. To reveal the cause of this difference, we followed the fate of individual NOR using HeLa derived cell line stably expressing UBF-GFP. We demonstrated that some NORs in metaphase are &#x0201c;asymmetrical&#x0201d;, i.e. they lack the signal of competence on one of the sister chromatids. Regular presence of such NORs can account for the difference in the number of competent NORs obtained by the daughter cells emerging in mitosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NORs</kwd><kwd>UBF</kwd><kwd>Mitosis</kwd><kwd>Asymmetry</kwd><kwd>4D imaging</kwd><kwd>GFP-UBF</kwd></kwd-group><contract-num rid="WT3">075834</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="WT3">Wellcome Trust</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p id="P3">Ribosomal genes coding 5.8S, 18S and 28S rRNA are organized in clusters which can be identified in mitotic chromosomes and are called Nucleolus Organizer Regions (NORs).

Although rDNA transcription is efficiently blocked from prophase to late anaphase, at least some subunits of RNA polymerase I (pol I) along with its main transcription factors, the Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) and promoter selectivity complex (SL1), can be detected on certain NORs even in metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Babu and Verma, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Weisenberger and Scheer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Jordan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Roussel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Gebrane-Younes et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Sirri et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Leung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Prieto and McStay, 2005</xref>). Such NORs, termed &#x0201c;transcriptionally competent&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;competent&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Dousset et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Savino et al., 2001</xref>), can be also visualized on the chromosome spreads by silver staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Howell and Black, 1980</xref>). It is generally accepted that competent NORs are transcribed, while the others, &#x0201c;non-competent&#x0201d; NORs, remain silent throughout the previous interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Weisenberger and Scheer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Roussel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Gebrane-Younes et al., 1997</xref>). UBF, the most abundant component of the competent NORs, serves apparently as an architectural element responsible for transcriptionally favorable state of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">O&#x02019;Sullivan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Mais et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Prieto and McStay, 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Studies on mitotic chromosomal spreads in cultured cycling cells show that the total number of competent NORs per cell, and frequency with which they appear on certain chromosomes, do not vary significantly in the sequential cell cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Heliot et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Smirnov et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, for example, one of three chromosomes 14 in human derived transformed HeLa cells regularly carries competent NOR, while the NORs belonging to the other two chromosomes remain silent; all chromosomes 15 usually carried competent NORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Smirnov et al., 2006</xref>). Equal distribution of competent NORs between the daughter cells emerging in mitosis seems to be the easiest way to achieve such stable propagation, for in this case there is no need to change the NOR competence status of chromosomes in the course of interphase. But this idea was not experimentally verified. On the other hand, it was shown that the number of nucleoli or intranucleolar silver stained foci is not heritable through mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Kalm&#x000e1;rov&#x000e1; et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Leung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Smetana et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Here we compared the state of NORs in daughter cells emerging at the end of mitosis.

A 3D image stack of 25-30 optical sections, spanning the entire cell volume was recorded at each time point. Low light imaging conditions and resonance scanner regime were chosen to ensure that cells were able to progress from metaphase to the end of telophase.

Results</title><p id="P12">We observed on mitotic chromosomes 6-12 competent NORs (in average 9) in HeLa and 6-10 competent NORs (in average 8) in LEP cells, using antibodies against human UBF, mouse UBF and pol I (each of these antibodies can be used for detecting competent NORs). These data were in agreement with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Smirnov et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In metaphase cells the competent NORs appeared mostly as double dots representing pairs of half-NORs. There were also single signals, small or large, in the last case they could be elongated. Detecting UBF signals in telophase, we found that the competent NORs were distributed among the daughter cells with a certain asymmetry: the emerging daughter cells got equal numbers of competent NORs only in about a quarter of telophases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In extreme cases, the difference in number of UBF signals reached 5 or 6, but most frequently, the daughter cells differed by one competent NOR, and the expected difference between the daughter cells was about 1 in both HeLa and LEP cells (columns 2 and 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The observed asymmetry was close to, though still lower than that predicted by the model in which cells were randomly paired (column 2). To check our result, we compared the mean values of the competent NORs counted on metaphase chromosomal spreads and in telophase cells, and found no significant difference between these values (data not shown), indicating that occasional clumping of UBF signals in the cells could not have an essential impact on our result.</p><p id="P14">Since asymmetry in distribution of the competent NORs between the daughter cells might result from asymmetrical distribution of NORs, we also performed rDNA hybridization and detected the whole pool of NORs in metaphase and telophase. In HeLa cells the number of NORs counted on the preparations of spread mitotic chromosomes, varied from 10 to 15 (in average 13). In LEP cells, 10 NORs could be observed in 99 % cases, which agreed with our previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Smirnov et al., 2006</xref>). In telophase LEP cells we usually found a perfect symmetry: each of the daughter cells contained 10 NORs. In HeLa cells the number of rDNA signals varied from cell to cell as in metaphase, with mean value 13. But in most cases (64%) the daughter cells had the same numbers of NORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), whereas the random pairing model, in which the daughter cells are regarded as independent (see Section 2), predicted 22% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, compare with the <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> that shows predominantly asymmetrical distribution of competent NORs between the daughter cells). Thus, in both HeLa and LEP cells, the NORs were divided between the daughter cells in mitosis rather equally. In other words, the asymmetry in distribution of the NORs, in both HeLa and LEP cells, was not as significant as to account for the asymmetry in distribution of the competent, UBF-positive, NORs.</p><p id="P15">Next we questioned whether the observed asymmetry between the daughter cells appears already at the segregation of daughter chromatids (together with their NORs) in the beginning of anaphase, or some NORs can acquire or lose UBF loading later in mitosis. To answer this we followed the dynamics of competent NORs from metaphase to the end of telophase in the HeLa derived cell line expressing UBF-GFP. In the mitotic HeLa-GFP cells, the GFP signals coincided with NORs stained with antibodies against UBF and Pol I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A and B</xref>), and the number of competent NORs equaled the number of GFP-positive foci. Analysis of the 4D images showed that at the beginning of anaphase, the half-NORs belonging to all double NORs, as well as to some single NORs, were separated and subsequently distributed between the emerging daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) But in a fraction of single NORs, no segregation of half-NORs was observed. One to three of such NORs were found in about 50% of the studied HeLa-UBF cells. These NORs moved towards one of the mitotic poles, thus producing an asymmetrical state in respect to the number of competent NORs. After segregation of all half-NORs, which was not simultaneous, but occurred in some NORs 1-2 min later than in the rest, the number of visible GFP signals did not change until the termination of cytokinesis. In early G1, the UBF-positive signals expanded, often divided in two or more foci, and began to fuse, so that individual NORs could not be identified in the newly formed cell nucleoli.</p><p id="P16">Thus the asymmetry in distribution of the competent NORs between the daughter cells appears at the beginning of anaphase and persists until the end of mitosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S8"><title>4. Discussion</title><p id="P17">Our study shows that both HeLa and LEP cells regularly exhibit an asymmetry of mitosis: the daughter cells receive different numbers of the transcriptionally competent NORs. This asymmetry can be observed at the beginning of anaphase, which implies that it should exist in a hidden form already in metaphase. Different types of competent NORs can be found on preparations of metaphase chromosome spreads, stained with silver or antibody against UBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Smirnov et al., 2006</xref>). Some of them are seen as double dots, others as single dots. In most of the single NORs, the signals of transcription competence are situated on both sister chromatids but very close to each other, as was shown in an electron tomography study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Heliot et al., 1997</xref>). In another, relatively rare group of NORs, the silver signal appears as a single small dot, and some authors speculated that it belongs to only one of the chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Heliot et al., 2000</xref>), but this could not be proven by the method employed in the cited work.</p><p id="P18">In the present study, using HeLa-UBF cell line, we could follow the fate of individual competent NORs throughout the mitosis. In about a half of the dividing cells we observed single UBF-positive signals that apparently belonged to only one sister chromatid, for they did not split in anaphase, but were drawn towards one pole of the cell division, which could lead to unequal distribution of the competent NORs between the emerging daughter cells. Namely, when the number of half-NORs in metaphase was odd, they could not be equally divided between two daughter cells.</p><p id="P19">We thus demonstrated the presence of &#x0201c;really single&#x0201d;, or asymmetrical, NORs which are at least partially responsible for the observed asymmetry in mitosis. In HeLa cells the number of NORs is variable, and this variability should also contribute to the mitotic asymmetry, but only to a very limited extent, because NORs are symmetrically distributed between the daughter cells in most cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Importantly, following the 3D movements of individual UBF signals after metaphase <italic>in vivo</italic>, we demonstrated that NORs do not change their competence in the course of mitosis, and so there is no switch between symmetrical and asymmetrical state.</p><p id="P20">As the average number of competent NORs per cell remains stable in the cycling cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Smirnov et al., 2006</xref>), it is not quite clear how this stable state is sustained in HeLa and LEP cells, in which emerging daughter cells regularly encompass different numbers of competent NORs. It has been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Heliot et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Smirnov et al., 2006</xref>) that competent NORs are non-randomly distributed among the different chromosomes, so that some NORs become competent more frequently than others. As the competent NORs, visualized after premature chromosome condensation with calyculin A, remain single throughout G1, and double NORs first appear in the S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Smirnov et al., 2006</xref>), we hypothesize that the transcription competence of NORs is re-established in association with their replication, and loading of the newly synthesized chromatids with UBF, as well as other components of the transcription machinery, depends on the specific type of chromosomes /NORs. For instance, in HeLa cells all homologs of the chromosome 15 will carry signal of competence with high probability, whereas for the chromosome 14 such probability is much lower. As a result the average number of competent NORs remains constant in the sequential cell generations.</p><p id="P21">Our data imply that different numbers of NORs should be active in the daughter cells. This slight asymmetry very likely leads to a slight asymmetry in the level of transcription activity since the very onset of transcription, i.e. from the end of anaphase. However, according to our data, the asymmetry in respect to the competent NORs is not corrected at least until the end of telophase. We suppose that such correction should take place later, during S phase, when most of the competent NORs (but not all) become duplicated. Although we still cannot exclude that the number of competent NORs may change in G1, S phase is crucial for establishing competence status of NORs. On the other hand, transcription of ribosomal genes can be efficiently regulated without changing the number of competent NORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Grummt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Russell and Zomerdijk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Moss, 2004</xref>). Therefore, we do not regard the correction of the described asymmetry as a direct compensatory response to the shift in rRNA production.</p><p id="P22">To conclude, we have described a small but significant asymmetry in distribution of the transcriptionally competent NORs between the emerging daughter cells in mitosis. Presence of chromosomes with asymmetrical NORs in which only one of sister chromatids carries the signal of competence can account for this asymmetry.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S9"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Prof. A.

number of UBF signals in daughter cells differs by 0 (symmetrical distribution), 1, 2, and so on. Experimental data, obtained from 200 cells are compared with random pairing model (see Section 2.3). Thus, in both cell lines, less than a quarter of the cell pairs were symmetrical with regard to the number of competent NORs. Most frequently the daughter cells differed by one competent NOR. ED stands for &#x0201c;expected difference&#x0201d; in the number of signals between the daughter cells; it was computed as &#x003a3;<italic>f</italic><sub>i</sub><italic>d</italic><sub>i</sub>, where <italic>d</italic>i is the difference in the number of signals between the daughter cells, and <italic>f</italic>i is the corresponding frequency. NED is the &#x0201c;normalized expected difference&#x0201d;, calculated as ED/n, i.e. the value of expected difference divided by the mean number of the signals in given cell population (9 in HeLa, and 8 in LEP cells). NED, which is actually a measure of asymmetry per 1 signal, took on close values in HeLa and LEP cells.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><?landscape?><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of the NORs between the emerging daughter HeLa cells in telophase</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</th><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ED</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NED</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Model</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.22</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.34</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.28</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.14</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.02</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.40</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experiment</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.64</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.32</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.03</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.01</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.41</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.03</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The table shows frequencies with which the number of rDNA FISH signals in the daughter cells differs by 0 (symmetrical distribution), 1, 2, and so on. The data, obtained from 200 cells, were compared with a random pairing model (see Section 2.3). In most cases NORs, in contrast to the competent NORs, were equally distributed between the daughter cells. The value of ED shows that in average daughter cells differed by less than one signal. Low value of NED emphasize the contrast with the case of competent NORs (Compare Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and 2).</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></back></article>
