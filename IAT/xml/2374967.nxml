After receiving apoptotic signals, mitochondrial membrane permeability increases and the mediators such as cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factors are released to the cytoplasm, rapidly followed by the activations of caspase 9 and executive caspase 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In healthy cells, mitochondrial membrane permeability is tightly controlled by voltage-dependent anion channels that are regulated by the interactions between Bcl2 family proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) is a nuclear-encoded protein abundantly located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and the role of this protein is to catalyze the exchange of mitochondrial ATP with cytosolic ADP. ANT therefore plays an important role in cellular energy metabolism by influencing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, ANT is the major component of mitochondrial permeability&#x02013;transition pore complex (PTPC) that interacts with Bcl2 family proteins, thereby contributing to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. ANT-deficient mice are able to form mitochondrial PTPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], however, inducing the argument about the roles of ANT in mitochondrial PTPC.</p><p>Human ANT has four isoforms (ANT1, ANT2, ANT3 and ANT4) and the relative expressions of these isoforms are dependent on developmental stages, proliferation status as well as tissue types or cell types. ANT3 is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and the degrees of ANT3 expression are correlated with the levels of oxidative metabolism. ANT1 is highly expressed in terminally differentiated tissues such as skeletal muscles, heart and brain, whereas ANT4 is a murine stem and germ cell-specific isoform whose DNA methylation plays a key role in its transcriptional silencing in somatic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. On the other hand, ANT2 is specifically expressed in undifferentiated cells or tissues that are able to proliferate and regenerate; for example, the lymphocytes, kidney and liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The expression of ANT2 was recently found to be upregulated in several hormone-dependent cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and the induction of ANT2 expression in cancer cells was directly associated with glycolytic metabolisms, raising a question regarding the role of ANT2 during carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Indeed, the overexpressions of ANT1 or ANT3 induce apoptosis while ANT2 lacks this proapoptotic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. ANT2 repression also leads to cell growth arrest and increases mitochondrial membrane potential from human cells as well as chemosensitized cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], implying that ANT2 inhibits mitochondrial membrane permeability and acts as an antiapoptotic oncoprotein. We therefore hypothesized that ANT2 can be a promising candidate for cancer therapy based on specific molecular targeting.</p><p>iRNA is currently used for knockdown of a particular gene expression to identify the functions of a targeted gene and to examine the potential usage of a targeted gene as a therapeutic method. iRNA is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon, and a multistep process produces active siRNA from RNase III endonuclease (Dicer). The consequent 21-nucleotide to 23-nucleotide siRNAs then mediate the degradation of complementary homologous RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Two basic methods have currently been developed to selectively inhibit gene expression: the cytoplasmic delivery of short dsRNA oligonucleotides (siRNAs) that mimic the active intermediates of endogenous iRNA; and the nuclear delivery of gene expression cassettes encoding shRNAs that imitate micro iRNAs representing the active intermediates of different endogenous iRNA mechanisms. The mechanisms of DNA vector-based approaches involve the synthesis of small RNA from a DNA template under the control of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) promoter in transfected cells. Pol III has an advantage for directing the synthesis of small noncoding transcripts whose 3' ends are defined by the termination within a stretch of four to five thymidines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These properties allow us to use DNA templates for generating small RNAs <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] whose structural features are close to the active siRNAs synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic>. The DNA vector-based iRNA approach can therefore be used widely for analyzing gene functions <italic>in vitro </italic>as well as <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In the present article we investigate the anticancer effects of ANT2 RNA interference in breast cancer models <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>using a DNA vector-based (H1-driven shRNA) iRNA approach. Our results demonstrate that the silencing of ANT2 expression using a DNA vector-based iRNA approach induces apoptotic cell death and cytotoxic bystander effects that elicit anticancer activity <italic>in vitro </italic>as well as tumor regression <italic>in vivo</italic>, implicating that the repression of ANT2 based on shRNA can be a novel method for breast cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>The human metastatic breast carcinoma cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 as well as ovarian cancer cell lines SK-OV-3 and SNU8 were used throughout the study.

In terms of mRNA expressions, ANT2 is highly expressed in both breast cancer cell lines while ANT1 and ANT3 expressions are not detectable. In contrast, the non-neoplastic MCF10A cell line barely expresses ANT2 as well as ANT1 but highly transcribes ANT3. Serendipitously, the transcriptional patterns of ANT isoforms in ovarian cancer cell line SK-OV-3 are identical to breast cancer cell lines (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1a</xref>), emphasizing the significance of ANT2 overexpression in breast cancer cells and ovarian cancer cells.</p><p>ANT2 protein levels were also tested from the breast cell lines by western blotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Owing to the absence of ANT1-specific and ANT2-specific antibodies, however, the protein levels of ANT2 were indirectly detected by subtracting the amount of ANT3 from total ANT protein levels. The total protein levels of ANT in respective breast cell lines are about the same, but ANT3 protein is not detectable from the breast cancer cell lines. On the other hand, ANT3 protein is dominantly expressed in the non-neoplastic MCF10A cell line where ANT3 mRNA is highly expressed. This result suggests that the breast cancer cell lines have more ANT1 and ANT2 proteins than ANT3 proteins. No ANT1 mRNA is detectable from both breast cancer cell lines, however, indicating the majority of ANT proteins in breast cancer cell lines might be ANT2 proteins. Collectively, these arrays of results suggest that the higher expression of ANT2 in breast cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines is a unique feature that may play a key role in cancer development.</p><p>Owing to the unique feature of overt ANT2 overexpression in breast cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines, we hypothesized that the downregulation of ANT2 in these cell lines may induce serious physiological effects that result in cell growth inhibition or cell death. To evaluate the functions of ANT2 in cancer development or the possible utility of ANT2 downregulation for breast cancer therapy, therefore, ANT2-specific knockdown experiments were performed with human breast cancer cell lines. Initially, respective siRNA-1, siRNA-2 and siRNA-3 oligonucleotides directed at exon 2 or exon 4 of ANT2 mRNA were synthesized to determine whether ANT2 siRNA suppresses ANT2 expression. At the same time, DNA oligonucleotides representing the siRNA duplex were cloned into pSilencer&#x02122; 3.1H1 puro vector to produce a high-level silencing effect based on a DNA vector system. The synthesized shRNA derived from DNA templates was composed of two identical 21-nucleotide sequence motifs in an inverted orientation, separated by a 9 base pair nonhomologous spacer (shRNA).</p><p>To confirm the silencing efficacies of ANT2 siRNA-1, siRNA-2 and siRNA-3 as well as pSilencer&#x02122; 3.1H1-ANT2 siRNA (ANT2 shRNA-1, siRNA-2 and siRNA-3), the cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 were transfected with the above samples as well as scramble siRNA and pSilencer&#x02122; 3.1H1-scramble siRNA (scramble shRNA) as negative controls. After culturing for 48 hours, their efficacies in extinguishing ANT2 mRNA expression were evaluated by RT-PCR. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>, the treatment with ANT2 shRNA was much more effective than the treatment with ANT2 siRNA in terms of downregulating the ANT2 mRNA level. Treatment with ANT2 shRNA for 48 hours decreased ANT2 mRNA expressions in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells by over 90% compared with the cells transfected with control vectors, while ANT2 siRNA treatment resulted in markedly less reduction. The total protein levels of ANT were also downregulated by ANT2 shRNA, indirectly indicating that the knockdown of ANT2 reduces the protein levels of ANT2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). These results suggest that ANT2 shRNA is superior to ANT2 siRNA for downregulating ANT2 mRNA as well as protein levels and can be used to target ANT2 for breast cancer therapy.</p><p>Taken together, we have uniquely identified the higher expression of ANT2 mRNA from human breast cancer cell lines MCF7, MDA-231 and SK-BR-3 as well as ovarian cancer cell lines SK-OV-3 and SNU8. To investigate the possible utility of ANT2 downregulation as a cancer therapy, ANT2 shRNA systems were adopted and the actual downregulation of ANT2 mRNA as well as protein mediated by ANT2 shRNA was confirmed from human breast cancer cell lines. As a result, we established a shRNA system to investigate the therapeutic value of ANT2 downregulation in breast cancer <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>ANT2 depletion induces cell cycle arrest (G<sub>1 </sub>arrest) and apoptotic cell death <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To explore the potential of ANT2 shRNA as a treatment for human breast cancer, the diverse phenotypic changes of respective cancer cell lines affected by ANT2 shRNA were investigated. Firstly, the cell survival and proliferation rate were investigated using MDA-MB-231. After transfecting MDA-MB-231 cells with ANT2 shRNA-1 for 24 hours, the transfected cells became less confluent as compared with the cells transfected with scramble shRNA. Many ANT2 shRNA transfected cells even became rounded and detached from culture plates, providing one line of evidence about cell death or cell cycle arrest (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). In addition, the proliferation rate of ANT2 shRNA-1 transfected MDA-MB-231 cells was also obviously reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). To understand the effects of ANT2 shRNA in MDA-MB-231 cells more specifically, the levels of intracellular ATP and the cell cycle status in transfected cells were investigated. Intracellular ATP levels were significantly reduced by up to 50% in the cells transfected with ANT2 shRNA-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>), suggesting the death of ANT2 shRNA transfected cells is ascribed to the reduction of ATP synthesis. Cell cycle analysis indicated that the G<sub>1 </sub>populations of ANT2 shRNA-treated MDA-MB-231 cells were 12% (24 hours) and 14.6% (48 hours), while scramble shRNA-treated cells displayed 0.8% (24 hours) and 7.6% (48 hours) of the G<sub>1 </sub>populations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). Additional analysis gating on the sub-G<sub>1 </sub>population also showed similar results after 24 or 48 hours of transfection, indicating ANT2 shRNA induces G<sub>1 </sub>arrest in breast cancer cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Apoptotic changes of human breast cancer cell lines transfected with adenine nucleotide translocator 2 shRNA. <bold>(a) </bold>Cell morphology analysis: MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with scramble shRNA or adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) 2 shRNA-1 and then examined under a phase contrast microscope after 24 hours of transfection. <bold>(b) </bold>Cell proliferation assay: after 2 or 4 days of transfection with ANT2 shRNA-1 as well as scramble shRNA, the numbers of viable cells were determined using a hemacytometer after staining dead cells with Trypan Blue. <bold>(c) </bold>ATP assay: cells were transfected with ANT2 shRNA-1 as well as scramble shRNA and then lysed to quantify total intracellular ATP levels after 24 hours of incubation.

ANT2 shRNA was more effective than ANT2 siRNA, however, in terms of inducing cell death. For example, ANT2 siRNA induced around 25&#x02013;35% of cell death, while ANT2 shRNA generated about 50&#x02013;60% of apoptotic cells. These results coincide with our previous observation regarding the higher efficacy to suppress ANT2 expression by ANT2 shRNA than ANT2 siRNA as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>, suggesting increased ANT2 downregulation induces more cell death. Additionally, the ovarian cancer cell lines SK-OV-3 and SNU8 transfected with ANT2 siRNA or shRNA demonstrated similar results to those obtained from the breast cancer cell lines (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1b</xref>). These results imply that the physiological effects of ANT2 downregulation could be consistent in both cancers.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that the downregulation of ANT2 efficiently inhibits cell growth and proliferation by reducing ATP levels as well as inducing G<sub>1 </sub>arrest, which ultimately leads to the apoptosis of human breast cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>ANT2 shRNA induces apoptosis by reducing the membrane potential of mitochondria and activating caspase 3 in MDA-MB-231 cells</title><p>To confirm apoptosis was responsible for the cell death induced by ANT2 shRNA in breast cancer cell lines, we examined the presence of genomic DNA fragmentation.

The transfection of ANT2 shRNA-1, shRNA-2 and shRNA-3 resulted in the upregulation of Bax (proapoptotic) and the downregulation of Bcl-xL (antiapoptotic) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>).

Although the transfection efficiency was only about 30%, the proportion of cells killed by ANT2 shRNA treatment exceeded 60%, raising the possible existence of bystander effect. To confirm the presence of a bystander effect in MDA-MB-231 cells, we cultured nontransfected cells with the supernatants obtained from ANT2 shRNA-1, shRNA-2 and shRNA-3 transfected cells and then evaluated cell death by annexin V&#x02013;PI staining.</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, nontransfected cells cultured with the supernatants from ANT2 shRNA-1, shRNA-2 and shRNA-3 transfected cells committed to cell death defined by AV<sup>-</sup>PI<sup>+</sup>.

Most normal cells mainly utilize mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for ATP synthesis but switch to glycolysis at lower oxygen tension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Cancer cells, however, typically depend upon glycolysis (the anaerobic breakdown of glucose to ATP) even in the presence of adequate oxygen, and this phenomenon is called the Warburg effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This increased glycolytic activity in cancer cells is suspected to possibly be due to mitochondrial defects and/or adaptation to a hypoxic tumor microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The inhibition of glycolysis in cancer cells has therefore been suggested as a novel therapeutic strategy as well as a method to overcome drug resistances associated with mitochondrial dysfunctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>ANT exchanges ADP and ATP across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Specifically, ANT1 and ANT3 export ATP produced by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, whereas ANT2 imports ATP produced by glycolysis into mitochondria to supply the energy required for mitochondrial functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In fact, ANT2 is mainly expressed in proliferative and undifferentiated cells, and only trace amounts are existed in differentiated cells, suggesting ANT2 can be an anticancer therapeutic target. In addition to their role in energy metabolism, ANTs are also involved in the formation of mitochondrial PTPC that mediates the nonspecific release of apoptotic mediators. PTPC composed of ANTs, voltage-dependent anion channel, cyclophilin D and Bcl2-Bax family members is formed at the contact sites between mitochondrial inner and outer membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In previous reports, the overexpression of ANT1 or ANT3 induced proapoptotic effects, whereas overexpression of ANT2 did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, ANT2 suppression was also associated with cell growth arrest and the increase of mitochondrial permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. ANT2 is therefore considered an antiapoptotic oncoprotein that functions as an inhibitor of mitochondrial membrane permeability such as Bcl2 and Bcl-xL, supporting the idea to repress ANT2 as an anticancer strategy.</p><p>In the present study, we used DNA vector-based ANT2 siRNA as a tool to inhibit ANT2 transcripts. It was found that DNA vector-based ANT2 siRNA (shRNA) reduced ATP levels, induced cell cycle G<sub>1 </sub>arrest and effectively induced apoptotic cell death. Moreover, this apoptosis was accompanied by mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, cytochrome c release (data not shown) and caspase-3 activation. These facts encouraged us to speculate that ANT2 repression may disable ADP/ATP exchanges in mitochondrial membranes and/or promote PTPC formation as well as apoptosis. Interestingly, we also observed that ANT2 shRNA treatment upregulated proapoptotic Bax expression and downregulated antiapoptotic Bcl-xL expression. We speculate that these changes of gene expressions may contribute to the apoptotic cell death induced by ANT2 shRNA. Bcl2 family members in the mitochondrial membranes modulate the activities of ANTs, and the Bcl2 family and ANT interactively participate in the formation of PTPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. No previous report, however, has demonstrated that ANTs can affect the expressions of Bcl2 family members. The specific mechanisms underlying this novel finding should be determined by further studies.</p><p>In contrast to our results, a recent study using siRNA oligonucleotides to knockdown ANT2 showed that ANT2 suppression neither induced apoptosis nor had any discernible effect on the mitochondrial network as well as the cell cycle. This suppression, however, did result in chemosensitization and increased mitochondrial transmembrane potential as well as reactive oxygen species levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These different observations between our report and others might be due to the utilization of different RNA interference technologies for suppressing ANT2 gene expression. Chemically synthesized siRNA is easily transfected into cancer cell lines and may be more effective in silencing targeted genes than shRNA vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. siRNA synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic>, however, suppresses gene expression only for a short period, while shRNA expression vectors are transcribed and generated <italic>in vivo </italic>over long periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. shRNA expression vectors therefore allow more sophisticated investigations and have been widely used for the functional analyses of genes and for anticancer therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. For example, when siRNA and shRNA iRNA technologies were utilized to knockdown the same gene, their effects were different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In the present study, ANT2 shRNA was found to be more effective for suppressing ANT2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>) and induced more cell death than ANT2 siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>). As a result, our observations support that shRNAs synthesized from DNA templates can induce robust, lasting and near complete inhibitions of gene expression, suggesting shRNA is more applicable to gene therapy than siRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Another important finding from the present study was the bystander effect induced by ANT2 shRNA treatment. We demonstrated that this phenomenon was due to TNF&#x003b1; secretion and TNF-receptor I upregulation from ANT2 shRNA-treated cells. In addition, the cell death induced by the bystander effect was mainly interpreted as necrosis. How the expressions of TNF&#x003b1; and TNF-receptor I were induced by ANT2 shRNA treatment, however, and why the bystander effect induced necrotic cell death, are not known. More experiments are needed to address these questions.</p><p>In a previous report, mitochondrial H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase inhibitor was found to increase mitochondrial membrane permeability, to decrease cellular ATP levels and to stimulate reactive oxygen species production, subsequently leading to the activation of stress-activated pathways and p21 induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In the present study using ANT2 shRNA, we observed the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potentials, ATP depletion, G<sub>1 </sub>stage arrest, apoptosis, the induction of TNF&#x003b1; and TNF-receptor I as well as the upregulation of surface and intracellular heat shock protein 70 expression <italic>in vitro </italic>(data not shown). Among the many common observations between two systems, the induction of heat shock proteins is notable from the immunological point of view. For example, the killing of tumor cells by a HSV-tk (herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase) gancyclovir system generated potent antitumor immunity and induced heat shock protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Interestingly, the induction of heat shock protein 70 expression induced the infiltrations of T cells, macrophages and predominantly dendritic cells into tumors, as well as the intratumoral expressions of T helper 1 cytokines such as IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1; and IL-12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. We therefore speculate that ANT2 shRNA administration <italic>in vivo </italic>might accelerate tumor cell death and increase immune responses against tumors due to heat shock protein 70. A study is now underway to investigate the mechanisms of immune response associated with ANT2 shRNA in a wildtype mouse tumor xenograft model.</p><p>In summary, the knockdown of ANT2 using ANT2 shRNA systems in breast cancer models induces apoptotic cell death followed by ATP depletion, G<sub>1 </sub>stage arrest and the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potentials <italic>in vitro </italic>and tumor regression <italic>in vivo</italic>.
