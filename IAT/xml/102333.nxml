Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase and its substrate specific activator Hct1/Cdh1 are required for degradation of Clb2, the major mitotic cyclin in the budding yeast (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Whereas <italic>hct1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>sic1&#x00394;</italic> cells appear relatively normal, <italic>hct1&#x00394; sic1&#x00394;</italic> cells are inviable, presumably due to their inability to extinguish Cdc28 activity in telophase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The complexity in the regulation of mitotic exit is underscored by the existence of a set of genes essential for this process, referred to as the "mitotic exit network (MEN)". They encode the GTP-binding protein Tem1 and its putative guanine nucleotide releasing factor Lte1, the dual specificity protein phosphatase Cdc14, protein kinases Cdc5, Cdc15, and Dbf2/Dbf20, the Dbf2-binding protein Mob1 (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]) and the spindle-pole-body component Nud1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Conditional-lethal temperature sensitive (ts) mutations in any of the MEN genes cause cells to arrest in late mitosis with elevated mitotic Cdk activity when shifted to the restrictive temperature. Inactivation of Cdc28 by overexpression of Sic1 suppresses multiple MEN mutants and hyperactivation of Cdc28 by overexpression of Clb2 exacerbates their phenotypes, consistent with the idea that a key function of the MEN proteins is to eradicate Cdc28 activity during the transition from anaphase/telophase to G1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Recently, important advances have been made in our understanding of how the MEN is switched on during anaphase. Tem1 is thought to be kept inactive throughout early mitosis by the two-component GTPase-activating protein complex Bub2/Bfa1 which co-localizes with Tem1 at the spindle pole body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. When the mitotic spindle penetrates the mother-daughter neck, the Tem1-bound spindle pole body is translocated into the daughter cell where a cortical pool of Lte1 is thought to activate Tem1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition to this spatial regulation, the GTPase activity of Bfa1 is thought to be inactivated through its phosphorylation by Cdc5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], but it remains unknown how this process is coordinated with the presumed juxtaposition of Lte1 and Tem1 in the daughter cell. Despite this rapid progress in understanding the signals that regulate the MEN, the direct downstream targets of the MEN have yet to be apprehended.</p><p>To address how the MEN components downstream of Cdc15 are organized and what their targets are, we sought <italic>tab (telophase arrest bypassed)</italic> mutants that alleviate the essential requirement for <italic>CDC15.</italic> In theory, <italic>tab</italic> mutants could act downstream of or parallel to <italic>CDC15,</italic> and could be either loss-of-function mutations in genes that inhibit exit from mitosis or gain-of-function mutations in genes that promote exit from mitosis. To our surprise, mutations in six linkage groups were uncovered, with three groups being recessive (<italic>tab1-tab3</italic>) and three groups being dominant (<italic>TAB5-7</italic>). We have shown in earlier studies that <italic>tab2-1</italic> is a reduction-of-function mutation in <italic>NET1</italic> (a.k.a. <italic>CFI1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and that <italic>TAB6</italic> is a gain-of-function mutation in <italic>CDC14</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Net1 sequesters Cdc14 in the nucleolus and inactivates it in preanaphase cells. During exit from mitosis, a <italic>TEM1/CDC15</italic>-dependent signal frees Cdc14 from the nucleolus and allows it to promote inactivation of Clb/Cdc28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The fact that both Net1 and Cdc14 are directly involved in exit from mitosis validates the effectiveness of the tab screen and heightens the potential value of the uncharacterized <italic>tab</italic> mutants. Here, we present a detailed description of the <italic>tab</italic> mutant screen, and describe a third <italic>TAB</italic> gene, <italic>TAB1/MTR10.</italic></p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cdc15 promotes activation of Clb proteolysis by a post-translational mechanism</title><p>Transcription has been postulated to play an important role in triggering exit from mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. For example, Dbf2, a protein kinase that promotes exit from mitosis, is associated with the CCR4 transcription regulatory complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, the Swi5 transcription factor activates <italic>SIC1</italic> expression during late anaphase, and both <italic>sic1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>swi5&#x00394;</italic> are synthetically lethal with <italic>dbf2&#x00394;</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To address if production of new proteins is essential for exit from mitosis, we examined the effects of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide on Clb2 degradation, a key aspect of this process. Mutant <italic>cdc15-2</italic> cells were uniformly arrested in late anaphase/telophase by incubation at the restrictive temperature 37&#x000b0;C. The cultures were then supplemented with 0, 10, or 100 &#x003bc;g/ml cycloheximide before being returned to 25&#x000b0;C to reverse the <italic>cdc15-2</italic> arrest. In the absence of cycloheximide, Sic1 accumulated and Clb2 disappeared as cells exited mitosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;4). In the presence of cycloheximide, Sic1 accumulation was abolished, but Clb2 degradation still occurred with apparently normal kinetics (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;8 and 9&#x02013;12). Although this result does not exclude the likely possibility that synthesis of new proteins (e.g. Sic1) normally facilitates the exit from mitosis, it reveals that a key aspect of mitotic exit &#x02013; inactivation of Cdc28 protein kinase via degradation of the mitotic cyclin Clb2 &#x02013; can proceed beyond the Cdc15-dependent step without synthesis of new proteins.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Post-translational control of Clb2 proteolysis by <italic>CDC15.</italic> Exponentially growing <italic>cdc15-2</italic> (RJD619) cells were arrested in late anaphase by shifting the culture to 37&#x000b0;C for three hours. The culture was split in three and either mock-treated (lanes 1&#x02013;4) or supplemented with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) at 10 &#x003bc;g/ml (lanes 5&#x02013;8) or100 &#x003bc; g/ml (lanes 9&#x02013;12). After five minutes (time = 0), the cultures were released from cell cycle arrest by downshift to 25&#x000b0;C. At indicated time points, samples were withdrawn, and the levels of Clb2, Sic1 and Cdc28 proteins were assayed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-3-4-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>A screen for <italic>telophase arrest bypassed (tab)</italic> mutants</title><p>To understand how the MEN mobilizes post-translational mechanisms to trigger mitotic exit, we conducted a genetic screen for 'telophase arrest bypassed' (<italic>tab</italic>) mutants that bypassed the essential requirement for <italic>CDC15</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

All transformants were tested for their ability to bypass <italic>cdc15&#x00394;</italic> using the 5-FOA growth assay (sample size n = 4&#x02013;17).

In the case of <italic>tab2</italic> and <italic>TAB6,</italic> about half of <italic>sic1&#x00394;</italic> transformants could bypass. This incomplete penetrance is not well understood. There are at least two sources of variability in this experiment. First, <italic>sic1&#x00394;</italic> transformants of <italic>tab cdc15&#x00394; [CDC15, URA3]</italic> were pregrown in rich media to accumulate cells that had lost the [<italic>CDC15, URA3</italic>] plasmid. Because plasmid-loss is a low-probability event and because cells without the plasmid are at a growth-disadvantage, the number of plasmid-free cells spotted on a 5-FOA plate probably was small and varied among different transformants. Second, mutant individuals can exhibit more variability than wild-type individuals, a phenomenon frequently observed in worms and flies. Therefore, it is possible that in only a fraction of plasmid-free cells, the amount of Cdc14 activity reached a level high enough to tolerate <italic>sic1&#x00394;</italic>. Thus, one can imagine that for some transformants, the number of plasmid-free cells spotted on 5-FOA was small and that by chance they or their limited numbers of progeny could not exit mitosis, resulting in the absence of bypass colonies. In other transformants, the opposite could occur, giving rise to mixed results in the plate assay. <sup>b</sup>Similar assay was conducted for <italic>HCT1.</italic> Sample size n = 1&#x02013;7. <sup>c</sup>Transformants from a and b that resulted from non-homologous integration (and hence no deletion of <italic>SIC1</italic> or <italic>HCT1</italic>) were used as a control.
