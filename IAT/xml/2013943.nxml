Ankyrins-G and -B are expressed in non-erythroid tissues, where they function in the maintenance and establishment of specialized membrane domains by interacting with a diverse set of membrane proteins. Ankyrin-G is required for accumulation of voltage-gated sodium channels in excitable membranes at axon initial segments of neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001051-Jenkins1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001051-Zhou1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and at transverse-tubules in cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001051-Mohler1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Using population tools, we next evaluated whether there were negative consequences for longevity in individuals with ankyrin-B variants. If so, we would predict these variants to be depleted or absent in centenarians (humans that reach the age of 100). The European genomic DNA samples used in the population study were a collection of 768 centenarians and 384 non-centenarians obtained from the Associazone Longevita in Italy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001051-g001">Figure 1D</xref> shows the allele frequency of the each variant in non-centenarians (black) and centenarians (red). Centenarians had a reduced frequency of variants at 1.6 percent compared to non-centenarians with 2.4 percent. However, the association between ankyrin-B variants and centenarian status was not significant (for combined ankyrin-B loss-of-function variants p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.3570 for Fischer's exact test, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.3501 for chi-squared test). However, we believe that the high p value is likely to result from a lack of power at this sample size. Given the low allele frequency of these variants, the p value could be improved by increasing the numbers of individuals tested in each group. At the proportions seen in this study, we would need approximately 6000 patients to get a significant p value. We hope to address this study limitation in the future.</p><p>These data indicate that specific ankyrin-B gene variants are both more common than expected and segregated with respect to ethnicity. Negative consequences for those having a function ankyrin-B variant may include both susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmia and reduced longevity.

In the pancreas, ankyrin-B is highly expressed in islets and is virtually absent from surrounding acinar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001051-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Within pancreatic islets, ankyrin-B staining was concentrated in beta cells and virtually absent from alpha cells (glucagon-positive) or delta cells (somatostatin-positive) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001051-g005">Figure 5D&#x02013;E</xref>).

As ankyrin-B expression in acinar cells is minimal, the reduction of ankyrin-B by quantitative immunoblot in pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001051-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) is due primarily to loss of ankyrin-B in beta cells.</p><p>In the heart, reduced expression of ankyrin B protein results in decreased levels of ankyrin-binding partners IP3 receptor, Na/Ca exchanger and Na/K ATPase. The loss of these channels/transporters in critical microdomains of cardiomyocyte transverse-tubules/sarcoplasmic reticulum is believed to be the basis of the arrhythmia phenotype. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001051-Mohler5">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. We determined that ankyrin-B haploinsufficiency also results in loss of IP3 receptor in other cell types, including Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum and bronchial epithelial cells in the lung as a correlate of ankyrin-B function in these cells (Figures S1,S2,S3). Future work will investigate the consequences of ankyrin-B deficiency at a molecular level, and determine which cell types contribute to the global phenotype of the ankyrin-B mouse.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study reports that certain loss-of-function variants in the <italic>ANK2</italic> gene are present in &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; European and west African populations. The frequency of these variants is surprising given the high degree of protein conservation between species and within most human populations. Mice heterozygous for a null mutation in ankyrin-B have previously been demonstrated to have a similar cardiac arrhythmia as humans with ankyrin-B variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001051-Mohler3">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001051-Mohler4">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Further characterization of ankyrin-B<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in this paper reveal a heretofore unrecognized syndrome of increased cardiac contractility and resistance to cardiac glycoside-induced arrhythmia that is balanced by premature senescence. Ankyrin-B is co-expressed with IP3 receptors in specific cell types including Purkinje neurons and bronchial epithelial cells. Interestingly, both ankyrin-B and IP3 receptors are reduced in these cells in ankyrin-B<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (Figures S1,S2,S3). Diminished function of IP3 receptors in calcium signaling thus may underlie some of the phenotypes observed in ankyrin-B<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Together, these findings suggest that the 2 percent of Europeans and up to 8 percent of individuals in west Africa that harbor specific ankyrin-B variants may respond favorably to digitalis treatments and also have increased risk of sudden cardiac death and diseases related to aging.</p><p>Results with ankyrin-B<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice suggest several hypotheses that will be important to test in people. The high levels of ankyrin-B expression in the brain and pancreatic beta cells and early senescence in ankyrin-B<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice suggests that human populations with age-related neurological disorders and/or type 2 diabetes should be evaluated for <italic>ANK2</italic> variants. Resistance of ankyrin-B<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to ouabain-induced arrhythmia suggests that cardiac glycosides could be potentially used more safely in humans with ankyrin-B variants. Moreover, these findings suggest that interference with ankyrin-B function in the heart could be a potentially useful strategy to modify cardiac contractility.</p><p>8.6 percent of the people in our sample from Ghana are heterozygous for the L1622I gene variant. Therefore up to 0.7 percent of this population could be homozygous for the L1622I mutation in the absence of negative selection. While no individuals homozygous for the L1621I variant were detected in 384 individuals, this could result from the relatively small sample size. It will be of interest in the future to screen larger populations from Ghana as well as African Americans to determine if homozygous L1622I individuals exist, and if so whether they exhibit features of ankyrin-B syndrome characterized so far in mice.</p><p>An obvious question is the nature of the benefit conveyed by certain ankyrin-B variants. Resistance to malaria is an unlikely factor, since ankyrin-B is not expressed in erythrocytes (not shown), or in vascular endothelial cells (Figure S2), and since variants are present in both Africans and Europeans. A simple hypothesis is that increased cardiac contractility enhances cardiac output during physical exertion, and thus improves survival. A corollary that can be experimentally tested is that athletes may be more likely to have ankyrin-B variants. Moreover, ankyrin-B variants may contribute to sudden cardiac death among young athletes.</p><p>A striking and highly penetrant effect of ankyrin-B deficiency in the mouse is a moderate reduction in life span accompanied by premature senescence in multiple tissues. One hypothesis to explain this phenotype is that disordered calcium homeostasis as observed in ankyrin-B<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001051-Mohler3">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> results in mitochondrial stress. Inter-relationships between calcium, mitochondria, and aging have been attributed to accumulated damage from reactive oxygen due to calcium overload of mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001051-Nicholls1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. It will be important to evaluate effects of ankyrin-B deficiency and loss-of-function variants on mitochondrial function.</p><p>While the ankyrin-B<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse model has been instrumental in demonstrating the role of ankyrin-B for normal vertebrate physiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001051-g002">Figures 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001051-g003"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001051-g004"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001051-g005">5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001051-Mohler3">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001051-Mohler5">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001051-Tuvia1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>), the broad tissue distribution of ankyrin-B (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001051-g005">Figure 5</xref>) has greatly complicated the ability to precisely correlate animal phenotypes with specific tissue/cell dysfunction. For example, defects in dorsal hair regrowth in ankyrin-B<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001051-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) are indicative of impaired stem cell regeneration. However, since ankyrin-B is also expressed in thymus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001051-Tuvia1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, an alternative hypothesis is that reduced ankyrin function in thymus results in reduced resistance to infection or even potential auto-immune defects associated with hair loss. A central future focus for the field will be to use genetically-engineered mouse and cell models to identify which specific cell types are responsible for the global phenotypes observed in the ankyrin-B<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates an unexpected prevalence of mutations in ankyrin-B that have been linked to risk for sudden cardiac death. We present the first evidence from a mouse model deficient in ankyrin-B that ankyrin-B variants can be viewed as balanced variants with increased risk of sudden death and early aging offset by increased cardiac contractility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001051.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>InsP3R expression in Purkinje neurons is reduced in ankyrin-B&#x0002b;/&#x02212; brain.
