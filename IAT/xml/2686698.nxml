Although both macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] cross-present antigens, only DCs are capable of stimulating naive CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. DCs also play an important role in initiation of NK anti-viral immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Similar to DCs, macrophages also play a variety of roles in immune system-mediated defense, including a central role in innate or natural immunity. Macrophages exhibit a wide variety of functions, including phagocytosis, tumor cytotoxicity, cytokine secretion and antigen presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A number of factors are known that "activate" or engage macrophages in these activities, including viral infection.</p><p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are among the most frequent serious viral infections in the U.S. and are considered to be a major health issue in developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Both macrophages and DCs perform crucial roles in linking innate and adaptive immunity and augmenting the immune response to HSV-1 infection. It was previously shown that human blood monocytes are resistant to HSV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], although a more recent study reported that immature monocyte-derived human DCs could be moderately infected with HSV-1, resulting in productive infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Bone marrow-derived macrophages are also resistant to HSV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The factors involved in the resistance of DCs and macrophages to productive HSV-1 infection are not known. The aim of our study was to determine if STAT1 might play a role in DC and macrophage resistance to HSV-1 replication. We found that DCs and macrophages isolated from STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>mice lost their resistance to HSV-1 infection. Thus, STAT1 seems to be critically important for allowing DCs and macrophages to resist HSV-1 replication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Virus, cells, and mice</title><p>Triple plaque purified HSV-1 strains McKrae, KOS, and GFP-VP22 were grown in rabbit skin (RS) cell monolayers in minimal essential media (MEM) containing 5% fetal calf serum. GFP-VP22 (a gift from Peter O'hare; Marie Curie Research Institute, Surrey, United Kingdom) is a recombinant virus that contains the gene encoding a major tegument protein, VP22, linked to green fluorescent protein (GFP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Six week old female BALB/c (The Jackson Laboratory), 129SVE-STAT1<sup>-/-</sup>, and 129SVE (Taconic) mice were used as a source of bone marrow (BM) for the generation of mouse DCs and macrophages in cultures. BM cells were isolated by flushing femurs and tibiae with PBS. Pelleted cells were briefly resuspended in water to lyse red blood cells and stabilized by adding complete medium (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine). The cells were centrifuged and resuspended in complete medium supplemented with either murine Flt3-ligand (100 ng/ml; Peprotech, NJ) or GM-CSF (100 ng/ml; Peprotech, NJ) to enhance replication of DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. To grow macrophages, the media was supplemented with CSF (100 ng/ml; Peprotech, NJ) instead of Fl3tL or GM-CSF. The cells were plated in non-tissue culture plastic Petri dishes (1 bone per 10 cm dish) for 5 days at 37&#x000b0;C with CO2. After 5 days, the media is removed, the adherent cells were recovered by incubating the cells for 5 min. at 37&#x000b0;C with Versene (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Cells were washed, counted, and plated onto tissue-culture dishes for use the following day.</p></sec><sec><title>Virus replication in tissue culture</title><p>Monolayers of macrophages or DCs were infected with various amounts of HSV-1 strain McKrae ranging from 0.01 to 10 PFU/cell. One hr after infection at 37&#x000b0;C or 4&#x000b0;C, virus was removed and the infected cells were washed three times with fresh media at the appropriate temperature and fresh media was added to each well. The monolayers including media were harvested at various times by freezing at -80&#x000b0;C. Virus was harvested by two cycles of freeze-thawing and infectious virus titers were determined by standard plaque assays on RS cells as we previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Viral RNA and DNA extraction and cDNA preparation in vitro</title><p>DCs or macrophages grown in 24-well plates were infected with 10 PFU/cell of HSV-1 strain McKrae. RNA preparation was done as we previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Briefly, frozen cells were resuspended in TRIzol and homogenized, followed by addition of chloroform, and subsequent precipitation using isopropanol. The RNA was then treated with DNase I to degrade any contaminating genomic DNA followed by clean-up using a Qiagen RNeasy column as described in the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA yield from all samples was determined by spectroscopy (NanoDrop ND-1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Wilmington, Delaware). Finally, 1000 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primers and Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV) Reverse Transcriptase from the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.</p><p>DNA isolation was done as we previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Briefly, cells from each well in tissue culture media were frozen and thawed 2 times at -80&#x000b0;C prior to processing. The lysed cells from each well were transferred to individual microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 3000 rpm to clear cellular debris. The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm to recover the viral DNA pellet. The pellet was digested for 2 hours at 55&#x000b0;C in TE buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 200 &#x003bc;g of Proteinase K. The mixture was extracted with Phenol/Chloroform followed by subsequent viral DNA precipitation using ethanol.</p></sec><sec><title>TaqMan Real-Time PCR</title><p>The expression levels of several viral genes, along with the expression of the cellular GAPDH gene (internal control) were evaluated using commercially available TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with optimized primer and probe concentrations as we previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Primer-probe sets consisted of two unlabeled PCR primers and the FAM&#x02122; dye-labeled TaqMan MGB probe formulated into a single mixture.

This GFP-expressing recombinant virus allows for direct monitoring of virus infectivity without additional manipulation. We visualized GFP expression together with F4/80 Ag-PE (as a macrophage marker) or CD11c-PE (as a DC marker) immunostaining 24 h after HSV-1 GFP-VP22 infection. Briefly, cells were fixed by incubating slides in methanol for 10 min followed by acetone for 5 min at -20&#x000b0;C. Afterwards, slides were rinsed three times for 5 min each at ambient temperature in PBS containing 0.05% v/v Tween-20 (PBS-T). Slides were then blocked for 30 min at ambient temperature in PBS-T containing 1% w/v BSA (PBS-TB). Immunostaining was done according to a direct method using F4/80 Ag-PE or CD11c-PE antibodies (1:200 in PBS-TB for 1 h at ambient temperature) (Becton Dickinson). After an additional three rinses at ambient temperature in PBS-T for 5 min each, slides were dipped into ddH<sub>2</sub>O (to remove salt) and mounted in ProLong Gold mounting media containing DAPI (Invitrogen).</p><p>Images were captured at 1024 &#x000d7; 1024 pixels (original magnification = 20&#x000d7;) in independent fluorescence channels using a Nikon C1 eclipse inverted confocal microscope. We then exported images (n = 3 per condition) as 8-bit greyscale TIFF files for image analysis using Image J software, release 1.40 g. Quantification of GFP labeling was done by first inverting greyscale images and then using thresholding mode to select positive pixels. Data are represented as % immunolabeled area (positive pixels/total pixels captured &#x000d7; 100%). All analyses were done by a single examiner (T.T.) blinded to sample identities, and code was not broken until the analysis was completed.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistics were done by Student's t test or Fisher's exact test using Instat (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).

To determine whether murine bone marrow-derived DCs were also resistant to HSV-1 infection, DCs were isolated from BALB/c mice and cultured in the presence of Flt3L or GM-CSF as described in Materials and Methods. BM-derived DCs are differentially regulated by their growth in Flt3L or GM-CSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. DCs were infected with 1 or 10 PFU/cell of WT HSV-1 strain McKrae. Control RS cells were similarly infected with HSV-1 McKrae. The kinetics of virus replication were quantitated by determining the amount of infectious virus at various times post infection using a plaque assay as described in Materials and Methods. At all MOIs, replication of HSV-1 in DCs was dramatically lower than that seen in RS cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). At 48 hrs post-infection, the amount of infectious virus from DC cultures was reduced &#x0003e; 1,000 fold compared to RS cells, suggesting poor virus replication in DCs grown in the presence of Flt3L or GM-CSF. These results were consistent with previous studies showing that human DCs are not permissive to HSV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Replication of HSV-1 in DCs isolated from BALB/cmice</bold>.

Unbound virus was removed by washing 3&#x000d7; with fresh media at the incubation temperature. The same amount of tissue culture media was added to each cell monolayer in 24 well plates and the cells were frozen at -80&#x000b0;C. After two cycles of freeze-thawing, we determined virus titer by plaque assay. At both 4&#x000b0;C and 37&#x000b0;C, the amount of infectious virus that was detected associated with the DCs was equal to or greater than the amount of infectious virus associated with the RS cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

To determine if BM-derived DCs from STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>mice were susceptible to HSV-1 infection, we isolated DCs from STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>mice (129SVE background), cultured them in the presence of GM-CSF, and infected them with 10 PFU/cell of HSV-1 McKrae as described above. We included DCs isolated from parental STAT<sup>+/+ </sup>mice (wild-type 129SVE mice) as controls. Virus replication in the STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>DCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; open squares) was approximately 1,000-fold higher at 48 hrs post-infection than in DCs from 129SVE mice (solid squares; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

In addition, HSV-1 replication in the STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>DCs approached that seen in RS cells. In our experience, RS cells support replication of wild type HSV-1 McKrae as well or better than any other cell line. Thus, STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>DCs appear to support HSV-1 replication with high efficiency.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Replication of HSV-1 in DCs isolated from STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>mice</bold>.

Infected STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>DCs had significantly more gB DNA than the STAT<sup>+/+ </sup>parental 129SVE DCs (p &#x0003c; 0.05).

Since HSV-1 replicates in a temporal cascade of three classes of viral genes: immediate-early (IE), early (E) and late (L) genes, we looked at the possibility of blockage of transcription of one or more of these three classes of viral genes in DCs isolated from STAT<sup>+/+ </sup>mice. We infected STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>and STAT<sup>+/+ </sup>DCs with 10 PFU/cell of HSV-1 McKrae and then harvested cells at 0, 4, 12, 24, and 48 hr post-infection. Total RNA was isolated as described in Materials and Methods, and various viral mRNA levels were quantitated by RT-PCR. ICP0 and ICP4 were used as indicators of IE genes, TK as an example of an E gene, and gB was taken as a late gene. We performed TaqMan RT-PCR on isolated RNA to determine the amount of HSV-1 ICP0, ICP4, TK, and gB mRNAs relative to levels of each transcript at baseline (just prior to infection). Cellular GAPDH mRNA was used as an internal control. Our results suggest that between 4 hr and 12 hr PI the levels of ICP0 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, ICP0), ICP4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, ICP4), TK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, TK), and gB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, gB) transcripts were similar between STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>and STAT1<sup>+/+ </sup>DCs.

We used mAbs against DCs (anti-CD11c-PE mAb) and macrophages (anti-F4/80 Ag-PE mAb) to show specificity of HSV-1 infected GFP-positive DCs and macrophages, respectively. When considering either macrophages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) or DCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), confocal images showed a qualitative increase in GFP labeling at each dose of HSV-1 GFP-VP22. Furthermore, infected cells appeared morphologically distinct (often displaying a more round, activated phenotype) from non-infected cells when considering either genotype. Finally, quantitative image analysis revealed statistically significant increased GFP labeling in STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>macrophages (by as much as ~40-fold at MOI = 10, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) and in STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>DCs (by as much as ~60-fold at MOI = 1.0, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>) across all three doses of virus administered.

Similarly, infection of resident peritoneal macrophages with HSV-1 results in an abortive infection in which the viral DNA is not replicated and no infectious virus is produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Another study showed that while both mature and immature monocyte-derived DCs are infected by HSV-1, only immature DCs produce infectious virus, but at ten-fold lower levels than most cell lines, despite the fact that DCs express HSV receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, the mechanism of DC and macrophage resistance to HSV-1 replication is not known. Mature DCs are also resistant to productive infection with influenza virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and dengue virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We show here that BM-derived DCs and macrophages isolated from wild type mice, including BALB/c or 129SVE strains and C57BL/6 strain (data not shown) do not support replication of HSV-1 as judged by virus yield, viral mRNA transcription, confocal microscopy of a GFP-viral fusion protein, and viral genomic DNA levels. However, in DCs from STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>mice, HSV-1 replication approached that seen in RS cells. We report here that HSV-1 attaches as efficiently to DCs as it does to the highly permissive RS cells, suggesting that the DCs non-permissiveness for HSV-1 is not due to a defect in viral attachment. Thus, non-permissiveness of DCs to HSV-1 appears due to either inefficient virus penetration or a block in the virus' replication cycle. Since it seems more likely that STAT1 would affect virus replication, we lean towards this explanation. However, it should be noted that the experiments reported here do not definitively distinguish between a block in virus entry versus a block in virus replication. Since RS cells support very efficient replication of HSV-1, these results suggest that STAT1 plays a key role in the resistance of DCs and macrophages to HSV-1 replication. We would predict that STAT1 may also be involved in resistance of DCs to influenza virus and dengue virus, since <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis </italic>also propagates more efficiently in STAT1-null or STAT1 knockdown cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>STAT1-deficient mice are highly sensitive to infection by microbial pathogens and viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] including HSV-1, which replicates to approximately 1000-fold higher titers in the eyes of STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>mice compared to wt mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. We obtained similar results when STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>mice were ocularly infected with HSV-1 strain McKrae or KOS (data not shown). The experiments presented here constitute the first report of a virus replicating more efficiently in DCs and macrophages from STAT1 deficient mice. In addition, the increased HSV-1 replication in DCs and macrophages from STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>mice was approximately 1000-fold higher than in wild type mice, similar to that reported in the eyes of STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. This raises the possibility that the enhanced sensitivity of STAT1 deficient mice to viruses and particularly the 1000 fold increase in HSV-1 replication in STAT1 deficient mice may be due, at least in part, to increased replication of virus in DCs and macrophages. In this regard, it has been reported that HSV-infected DCs are compromised by the infection process and have reduced T-cell stimulatory capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>The increased replication of HSV-1 in STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>DCs and macrophages shown here might be an important factor contributing to increased susceptibility of STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>mice to infection. However, since transfer of BM-derived DCs or macrophages from wild-type mice to STAT1-deficient mice did not reduce the susceptibility of STAT1-deficient mice to HSV-1 infection, even when the avirulent HSV-1 strain KOS was used for ocular challenge (data not shown), additional factors are likely involved. Surprisingly, STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>and STAT1<sup>+/+ </sup>mice had similar levels of corneal scarring following ocular HSV-1 infection (data not shown). Thus, the resistance of APCs in STAT1<sup>+/+ </sup>mice to HSV-1 replication compared to the permissiveness of APCs in STAT1<sup>-/- </sup>mice to HSV-1 replication, did not appear to play an important role in protecting mice against either death or corneal scarring.</p><p>STAT1 is one of the seven members of the mammalian STAT family. STATs participate in gene control and are activated when cells encounter various extracellular polypeptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Targeted disruption of the STAT1 gene in mice revealed a role for STAT1 in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is involved in mediating biologic responses induced by many cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. STAT1-deficient mice lack responsiveness to IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that the absence of responsiveness to IFN-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b3; in DCs and macrophages isolated from STAT1-deficient mice contributes to their susceptibility to HSV-1 infection. However, IFN-&#x003b1; production does not appear to correlate with innate protection against HSV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and we previously showed that expression of murine IFN-&#x003b3; by an HSV-1 recombinant virus does not impair virus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Furthermore, incubation of STAT1<sup>+/+ </sup>DCs or macrophages in the presence of anti-IFN-&#x003b1; mAb, anti-IFN-&#x003b3; mAb, or both mAbs did not increase HSV-1 replication in infected DCs (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown here for the first time that STAT1 (likely via the JAK-STAT1 pathway) is involved in suppressing HSV-1 replication in murine DCs and macrophages. In addition, the lack of virus replication in wild-type APCs did not appear to be due to transcriptional blockage of HSV-1 &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, or &#x003b3; genes, although viral DNA replication did not occur.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KM was responsible for conducting experiments.
