The initiation and termination sites of fumA transcription were located using RNA:DNA hybridisation with single-stranded M13 probes. The length of the fumA transcript was estimated as 1760 +/- 15 nucleotides and the fumA coding region of 1647 base pairs (549 codons) was identified. The deduced molecular weight of the fumarase protein (Mr = 60163) is in good agreement with that of the protein identified by the maxicell procedure. The DNA fragment also contains the 5' end of the manA gene encoding mannose 6-phosphate isomerase, which is transcribed with the opposite polarity to fumA .</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00326-0210.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3631"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00326-0211.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3632"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00326-0212.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3633"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00326-0213.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3634"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00326-0214.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3635"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00326-0215.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3636"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00326-0216.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3637"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00326-0217.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3638"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00326-0218.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3639"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00326-0219.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3640"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00326-0220.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3641"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00326-0221.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3642"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
