The essential telomeric DNA-binding protein Cdc13p both positively and negatively regulates telomere length in budding yeast. Here we test the effect of purified Cdc13p on telomerase action <italic>in vitro</italic>. We show that the full-length protein and its DNA-binding domain (DBD) inhibit primer extension by telomerase. This inhibition occurs by competitive blocking of telomerase access to DNA. To further understand the requirements for productive telomerase 3&#x02032;-end access when Cdc13p or the DBD is bound to a telomerase substrate, we constrained protein binding at various distances from the 3&#x02032;-end on two sets of increasingly longer oligonucleotides. We find that Cdc13p inhibits the action of telomerase through three distinct biochemical modes, including inhibiting telomerase even when a significant tail is available, representing a novel &#x02018;action at a distance&#x02019; inhibitory activity. Thus, while yeast Cdc13p exhibits the same general activity as human POT1, providing an off switch for telomerase when bound near the 3&#x02032;-end, there are significant mechanistic differences in the ways telomere end-binding proteins inhibit telomerase action.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In 1985, a novel enzyme was identified in ciliates that adds repeated DNA sequence to telomeric oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). This enzyme, telomerase, is a reverse transcriptase that iteratively adds species-specific, GT-rich, DNA repeats to the 3&#x02032; ends of chromosomes. Telomerase has since been identified in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms, including humans, where it plays a prominent role in cancer and a growing number of other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex. In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the core enzyme consists of the Est2p reverse transcriptase (or TERT) subunit and an 1157-nt RNA, TLC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7">3&#x02013;7</xref>). In addition to the catalytic subunit, the yeast telomerase holoenzyme also includes the Est3 protein, and proteins that probably directly interact with the flexible RNA scaffold, including Est1p, the Ku DNA repair heterodimer, and the Sm<sub>7</sub> complex, also involved in snRNA maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, whether purified from yeast cells or reconstituted in a heterologous system, yeast telomerase synthesizes predominantly a single DNA repeat, after which it remains stably associated with the ssDNA product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). However, <italic>in vivo</italic>, telomerase can add as little as a few to hundreds of nucleotides to a single telomere in one cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), suggesting that additional telomere-associated proteins may modulate activity.</p><p>Telomere length homeostasis involves the coordination of telomere lengthening and shortening processes. Although the complete mechanism of telomere length regulation remains to be elucidated, several telomere-associated proteins have been implicated in the process. The observation that targeting the C-terminus of Rap1p to telomeres leads to telomere shortening, and that this is proportional to the number of molecules at a given telomere, led to the &#x02018;protein-counting model&#x02019; of telomere length regulation by Rap1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Thus, double-strand DNA-binding factors play a role in length regulation. Additionally, the abundance of limiting telomerase components also appears to provide another level of regulation. There are only &#x0223c;29 copies of the TLC1 RNA per haploid yeast cell (&#x0223c;37 per diploid) and halving the RNA abundance in a <italic>TLC1/tlc1</italic>&#x00394; heterozygote leads to short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This finding complemented those from mammalian studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19">16&#x02013;19</xref>) that had also suggested that telomerase activity can be regulated by the number of active complexes. The function of the yeast ATM kinase homolog, Tel1p, is important for proper telomere length maintenance and is required for repeat addition processivity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>), implicating phosphorylation as critical to telomere length regulation. It has also been proposed that telomeres exist in either an extendible or non-extendible state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), which dictates whether or not telomerase can access a particular telomere end. Recent studies show that the extendible state tends to exist at the chromosome ends with the shortest telomeres, where telomerase is relatively enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Despite the many pathways involved in regulating telomere length, control of telomerase activity by modulating its access to chromosome ends is one of the most fundamentally important.</p><p>The essential Cdc13 protein binds to the 3&#x02032; telomere overhangs through its structurally and biochemically characterized ssDNA-binding domain (DBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28 B29 B30">26&#x02013;30</xref>). Cdc13p is a chromosome end-capping protein, preventing the CA-rich strand of the telomere from undergoing unregulated nucleolytic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). In addition, Cdc13p regulates telomere elongation through recruitment of telomerase via its Est1p subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Recruitment is abolished in the <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>2<sup>est</sup></italic> mutant, which displays shortened telomeres, similar to those of a telomerase-defective strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Cdc13p may also prevent runaway elongation by telomerase, since yeast expressing the <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>5</italic> allele, which lacks the C-terminus, exhibit elongated telomeres and long G-strand overhangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Cdc13p is enriched at telomeres during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), providing additional support for its role in telomere length regulation.</p><p>Telomeric ssDNA-binding protein complexes are known to regulate telomerase activity. It was recently shown that the human single-stranded telomere binding protein POT1 (hPOT1) inhibits telomerase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> on human telomere substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). hPOT1 exerts its inhibitory effect when bound within six nucleotides of the 3&#x02032;-end of a ssDNA oligonucleotide substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Both full-length protein and the DBD of hPOT1 display identical telomerase inhibitory activity, and DNA-binding activity is required for inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Telomerase activity is fully restored even in the presence of full-length hPOT1 or its DBD, if there is at least a 6-nt tail beyond the hPOT1-binding site. This suggests that the relative positioning of hPOT1 along the 3&#x02032; telomere overhangs can serve as a binary switch for telomerase-accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). More recent evidence suggests that hPOT1 regulates telomerase in conjunction with a second shelterin component, TPP1. When both hPOT1 and TPP1 are prebound onto a telomeric oligonucleotide substrate, the human telomerase core enzyme displays enhanced processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). While these data suggest a potential telomerase regulatory role for hPOT1, how this is manifested <italic>in vivo</italic> is not yet understood. Manipulation of hPOT1 by overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37 B38 B39">37&#x02013;39</xref>) or RNAi suppression of hPOT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40 B41 B42 B43">40&#x02013;43</xref>) leads to a variety of phenotypes, including telomere elongation, 3&#x02032; tail structure changes and various DNA damage responses. The complexity of the <italic>in vivo</italic> data does not provide a clear mechanism for how hPOT1 might regulate telomerase activity, potentially due to indirect effects associated with the concomitant disruption of the large shelterin complex at telomeres upon manipulation of hPOT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). In contrast, understanding of the role played by budding yeast Cdc13p in telomere length regulation is somewhat clearer, due to the availability of separation-of-function and temperature-sensitive alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>As a starting point for evaluating the regulation of telomerase by the host of factors identified through genetic analysis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, it is important to know the extent to which Cdc13p binding to telomeric DNA affects its ability to serve as a telomerase substrate. Until recently, such studies were complicated by the inability to reconstitute the yeast telomerase core enzyme <italic>in vitro</italic> and the limitations associated with using immunopurified telomerase from yeast extracts. The discovery that a miniaturized yeast telomerase RNA component provides reconstituted activity with yeast TERT when coexpressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) provides immunopurified core enzyme to directly examine the role of telomere end-binding proteins in the regulation of telomere length by telomerase. We show that, unlike hPOT1, Cdc13p inhibits telomerase activity on substrates that have substantial 3&#x02032; overhangs. This inhibitory activity is observed for both the DBD of Cdc13p and the full-length protein, although we find differences between how the DBD and Cdc13p inhibit telomerase activity on specific substrates. We propose that three mechanisms for yeast telomerase inhibition by Cdc13p have a fundamental role in defining the non-extendible state of yeast telomeres.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cdc13p and Cdc13(DBD) expression and purification</title><p>Full-length Cdc13p was expressed using baculovirus in Sf9 cells and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), with the following modifications. Briefly, baculovirus-infected cells were homogenized and Cdc13p was purified to &#x0003e;90% homogeneity using Ni-affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare). Active concentrations of Cdc13p were determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and defined as the concentration of Cdc13p required to fully shift 100 nM GTGTGGGTGTG (TEL) probe, which is &#x0003e;100-fold above the measured <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>.</p><p>Cdc13(DBD) constructs were overexpressed and purified as described previously, with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Glycerol and detergents were removed from the lysis buffer, and lysis was carried out by sonication. The protein domain was purified using ion-exchange, Ni-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography (GE Healthcare). Filter binding assays were employed to determine the active concentration of DBD protein for all subsequent assays. Active concentration was defined as the concentration of protein required to fully bind the standard TEL oligonucleotide at a concentration of 200 nM, well above the measured <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of the DBD&#x02022;TEL interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Telomerase activity assays</title><p>Reconstituted yeast telomerase was synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega), as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), using plasmids encoding the Mini-T(500) RNA and ProA-tagged Est2p. At the final step of telomerase immunopurification, IgG Sepharose beads were resuspended 1 : 3 (v/v) with 10 mM Tris (pH 8), 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 30% (v/v) glycerol. Telomerase from yeast extracts had been isolated previously from cells overexpressing both TLC1 RNA and ProA-tagged Est2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Unless otherwise indicated, all telomerase assays were performed as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), except at 27&#x000b0;C for 10 min with final substrate concentration at 0.3 &#x000b5;M. When included, DBD or Cdc13p were preincubated with primer DNA for at least 15 min on ice prior to adding telomerase and radioactive [&#x003b1;<sup>32</sup>P]-dGTP. All oligonucleotide substrates were commercially PAGE or reverse-phase HPLC-purified. Markers for +1 telomerase products were made essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Telomerase signal (detected by a GE Typhoon Trio phosphorimager) was quantified by using Imagequant TL software (GE Healthcare) to sum the signal from the reaction products (typically +1 through +7 bands) and normalize it to the internal loading and recovery control. To determine the stoichiometry of DBD required for telomerase inhibition, we determined the amount of protein required to inhibit 78% (on average) of the telomerase signal from six completely independent protein preparations. It required 0.81 &#x000b1; 0.64 (mean &#x000b1; SD) equivalents of protein to achieve this level of inhibition. The high variability is likely caused by batch-to-batch differences in the quantitation of DBD protein preparations, as the extent of inhibition was highly reproducible for a given preparation.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding assays</title><p>Filter-binding assays were used to determine equilibrium binding constants for interactions with Cdc13(DBD). The concentration of DNA used for all experiments was 50 pM and the protein concentrations were varied &#x0223c;100-fold above and below the measured <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>. Oligonucleotides were 5&#x02032;-end labeled as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). All filter-binding reactions were carried out in high-salt binding buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The salt-dependence of the Cdc13(DBD) interaction has been previously shown to be log-linear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), hence the high-salt buffer was used to reduce the affinity of the interactions to the nM range to facilitate more accurate measurements. A Schleiser &#x00026; Schuell minifold vacuum manifold dot blot apparatus was used, employing a two-filter method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) consisting of a nitrocellulose filter (GE Infrastructure Water &#x00026; Process Technologies) to capture the protein and bound DNA, and a HyBond (XL) filter (Amersham Biosciences) to capture free DNA. Membranes were washed twice with 90 &#x000b5;l of binding buffer (without BSA) prior to the addition of 30 &#x000b5;l of each reaction mixture. Membranes were then washed three times with 90 &#x000b5;l of binding buffer (without BSA) then dried and exposed to phosphorimager plates. ImageQuant (GE) software was used to quantify the DNA signal from each membrane filter.

In six telomerase experiments each performed with a different DBD protein preparation, the ratio of DBD : DNA required for inhibition was 1.0 &#x000b1; 0.8 (mean &#x000b1; SD). If Cdc13(DBD) was heat-denatured, inhibition was completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c, lane 10). We also tested importance of the order of addition by adding Cdc13(DBD) after telomerase and primer had been pre-incubated for 10 min. In this case, inhibition was intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c, lane 12), probably because the oligonucleotide substrate is competed away by the relatively fast and tight binding of the Cdc13(DBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Lastly, we show that the DNA synthesis observed was clearly due to telomerase activity since it was abolished by RNase and also required dTTP, the first nucleotide predicted to be added by the TLC1 template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c, lanes 11 and 13).</p><p>If Cdc13(DBD) inhibits telomerase by blocking its access to the DNA substrate, rather than, for example, binding to telomerase, then a mutant DBD with a specific reduction in DNA association should not inhibit effectively. Y522A reduces DNA-binding by the Cdc13(DBD) 650-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). When tested for its effect on telomerase action, DBD (Y522A) did not inhibit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>d). Lack of inhibition by the Y522A Cdc13(DBD) mutant is not due to inactive protein. At high concentrations, DBD (Y522A) did bind DNA by filter-binding and weak telomerase inhibition was observed when 10-fold more protein (6 &#x000b5;M) was used (data not shown). Thus, DNA binding is required for telomerase inhibition by Cdc13(DBD).</p></sec><sec><title>Full-length Cdc13p inhibits telomerase similarly to the DBD</title><p>The 198-residue DBD of Cdc13p inhibits telomerase, but the full-length protein is much larger (924 amino acids) and contains several other domains that also participate in telomere maintenance and length regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).

Cdc13p also inhibited telomerase isolated from yeast overexpressing the core enzyme components Est2p and the full-length TLC1 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>c). Furthermore, the amount of DBD and Cdc13p required for inhibition scaled with primer concentration (data not shown). Thus, full-length Cdc13p and its DNA binding domain both inhibit telomerase by binding to the DNA substrate, leading us to favor a model where Cdc13p prevents productive telomerase access.</p></sec><sec><title>Validation of a system to control the DNA-binding register of Cdc13(DBD)</title><p>We set out to determine if addition of a free 3&#x02032; DNA tail would restore telomerase activity to a Cdc13(DBD)- or Cdc13p-bound oligonucleotide. Binding of the Cdc13(DBD) to telomeric sequence occurs through a minimal consensus binding site containing a GxGT motif at the 5&#x02032; end of an otherwise GT-rich 11-mer sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Thus, longer deoxyoligonucleotides representing degenerate sequence of yeast telomeres typically contain multiple consensus Cdc13(DBD) binding sites. This degeneracy of yeast telomeres and the minimal GxGT DBD-binding motif complicate determining the ssDNA tail beyond bound Cdc13(DBD) needed for telomerase action, since simply adding telomeric sequence to a minimal DBD-binding oligonucleotide creates multiple overlapping protein-binding registers (see next section). Therefore, to test how close to the DNA 3&#x02032;-end Cdc13(DBD) must be in order to inhibit telomerase action, we designed four potential telomerase substrates predicted to restrict DBD binding to the single 11-nt register at the 5&#x02032;-end, allowing for a defined protruding 3&#x02032; tail. Based on prior knowledge of Cdc13(DBD) binding to DNA, our designed sequences are expected to have only one high-affinity consensus site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a) even if lengthened at the 3&#x02032;-end by &#x0223c;9 nt. As expected from the lack of perfect sequence-complementarity to telomerase RNA, these oligonucleotides were suboptimal telomerase substrates, but their ability to serve as telomerase primers was improved by adding &#x02013;GG or &#x02013;TGG to their 3&#x02032;-ends, which increases pairing to TLC1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn830/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link> and data not shown).

We used a 3&#x02032;-specific exonuclease, snake venom phosphodiesterase (SVP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>), to determine the extent of protection by Cdc13p or DBD. First, TEL*&#x02013;GTGGG and a control oligonucleotide containing a tract of adenosines as a 3&#x02032; tail, TEL&#x02013;a<sub>10</sub>, were incubated with Cdc13p and then digested by SVP in a 60-min time course&#x02014;the 5&#x02032; nucleotides were protected in a Cdc13p-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>a). Thus, TEL was protected as expected by Cdc13p after the &#x02212;a<sub>10</sub> 3&#x02032; tail was trimmed off by SVP. This assay shows that Cdc13p was specifically targeted to the engineered TEL* sequence when five telomeric 3&#x02032; nucleotides were appended, because after 10 min of exonuclease action the 5&#x02032; 12 nucleotides remained protected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>a). The transience of the TEL* protection probably originates from a relatively quick off-rate of the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) for the mutant TEL* consensus. These results show that &#x0223c;10-min incubations with SVP are optimal for studying Cdc13p&#x02022;TEL* interactions.</p><p>To compare the binding position of Cdc13(DBD) with that of full-length Cdc13p on TEL*-based oligonucleotides, we performed titrations from substoichiometric protein levels to &#x0003e;2 : 1 protein-to-DNA ratios. For TEL*&#x02013;GTGGG, the DBD and Cdc13p showed indistinguishable patterns of SVP 3&#x02032; nuclease protection of the TEL* sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b, left). However, when we titrated these proteins on TEL*-based primers with longer 3&#x02032; tails, such as TEL*&#x02013;GTGTGTGGG, we observed protection at the 3&#x02032;-end. At low concentrations, Cdc13(DBD) bound the TEL* sequence at the 5&#x02032;-end and, at higher concentrations, protected a 3&#x02032; site. Cdc13p, on the other hand, protected the 3&#x02032;-end of TEL*&#x02013;GTGTGTGGG from SVP digestion even at substoichiometric levels, suggesting that the 9-mer tail binds Cdc13p more tightly than TEL* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b, right). Thus, Cdc13p and its DBD can be directed to the 5&#x02032;-end of TEL* in the context of a telomeric substrate with short tails. However, longer telomeric tails create additional alternate binding sites for Cdc13p and the DBD, thus restricting the tail length that can be examined using this approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Coordinated nuclease protection and telomerase experiments unveil modes of Cdc13p inhibition</title><p>We recognized that the most direct assessment of end structure and its correlation with telomerase activity could be achieved if the telomerase and exonuclease assays were performed on the same Cdc13p&#x02022;DNA complex. Therefore, we developed a coordinated assay that essentially eliminates variability that exists when exonuclease and telomerase assays are performed separately on independently formed protein&#x02022;DNA complexes. This was achieved by doing the two assays in parallel: each particular Cdc13p&#x02022;DNA binding reaction is split and one portion is incubated with telomerase and the other with SVP 3&#x02032; nuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a).

Gel shift analyses support this being a second binding event and not simply repositioning of Cdc13(DBD) on the DNA (J.N.R. and D.S.W., unpublished results).</p><p>Full-length Cdc13p showed binding similar to Cdc13(DBD) on TEL*&#x02013;GG and TEL*&#x02013;GTGGG but, even at concentrations below the level required for binding all of the DNA (as judged by intensity of the &#x02018;totally digested&#x02019; signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b), Cdc13p protected the 3&#x02032; terminus of TEL*&#x02013;TGTGGG and longer oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b). The 3&#x02032; protection by Cdc13p is not due to a <italic>bona fide</italic> &#x02018;end-binding&#x02019; preference by the full-length protein, but rather is more likely caused by a slight alteration in the sequence and length preferences for binding by full-length Cdc13p compared to its DBD alone (J.N.R. and D.S.W. unpublished results).</p><p>With well-characterized tail structures in hand, we tested telomerase activity on these primers in the presence and absence of bound Cdc13p and Cdc13(DBD). In their absence, telomerase was active on all TEL*-based primers, though lower activity was seen with TEL*&#x02013;GG given its limited ability to anneal to the telomerase RNA template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn830/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>). We found that both Cdc13p and Cdc13(DBD) inhibited telomerase action on every primer tested. The DBD and full-length Cdc13p inhibited telomerase action similarly, despite the differences in binding to these telomeric substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>c). Residual telomerase activity correlated well with the fraction of unbound primer present (as measured by the fraction of primer fully digested in our SVP assay; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn830/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link> online), suggesting the bound state is fully inhibitory. In the presence of a short, accessible 5-nt tail, no telomerase activity was observed. Cdc13p and DBD remain 5&#x02032;-localized in this condition, suggesting that an available 5-nt protruding end is too short to support telomerase activity. With the 7-nt tail &#x02013;GTGTGGG, Cdc13(DBD) bound the 5&#x02032;-end preferentially, whereas Cdc13p bound the 3&#x02032;-end of this DNA, yet telomerase was similarly inhibited in both cases. While 3&#x02032;-end-binding by Cdc13p is likely to physically occlude telomerase access, the inhibition observed in the presence of Cdc13(DBD) suggests that even a tail of seven accessible nucleotides is insufficient to support telomerase action. Telomerase was also fully inhibited when a 9-nt tail was appended to TEL*, although both Cdc13p and DBD are bound relatively closer to the 3&#x02032;-end (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b lanes 27&#x02013;29 with lanes 35&#x02013;37), inhibiting telomerase in a similar manner (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>c lanes 23&#x02013;25 with 30&#x02013;32).</p><p>Thus, our CoNuTe experiments with TEL*-based primers show that Cdc13p and its DBD alone each potently inhibit telomerase even when bound rather distant from the 3&#x02032; terminus. Furthermore, these results show that a 7-nt 3&#x02032; tail beyond a DBD binding site is still too short for productive telomerase access to DNA. However, establishing the tail length that would allow for recovery of telomerase activity to protein-bound primers is not possible with the TEL* design as longer telomeric tails necessarily create a second protein binding site, as observed with a 9-nt tail. To further explore the minimal 3&#x02032; tail length required for telomerase access we employed a different approach to constraining the protein binding register, as follows.</p></sec><sec><title>Action at a distance</title><p>Since Cdc13(DBD) and Cdc13p bind the 3&#x02032;-end of TEL*-based oligonucleotides with long extensions, we designed an alternate set of primers for determining the minimal length of DNA required to recover telomerase activity on Cdc13p/DBD-bound primers. In this design, a canonical 11-nt Cdc13p/DBD binding TEL site at the 5&#x02032;-end is separated from a robust telomerase-annealing substrate sequence &#x02013;TGTGGG at the 3&#x02032;-end using a non-telomeric spacing sequence (tracts of deoxyadenosines). Control experiments showed that a TGTGGG hexamer was readily extended by telomerase but was not bound tightly by Cdc13p (data not shown). This approach differs from the TEL*-based oligonucleotide series, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, in three key ways: (i) the region complementary to TLC1 (&#x02013;TGTGGG) is invariant at the 3&#x02032; end of all primers of the series and should hybridize similarly to TLC1 RNA within the telomerase active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a); (ii) there is no theoretical limit to the length of spacer nucleotides that can be inserted between the 3&#x02032;-end and the Cdc13p/DBD binding site since deoxyadenosines do not create a new DBD or Cdc13p site, and (iii) as a result, the high-affinity TEL sequence, as opposed to TEL*, can be used. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>&#x02018;Spacer&#x02019; tracts of deoxyadenosines separate the DBD- and Cdc13p-binding site (TEL) and a telomerase-extendible 3&#x02032;-end, providing further insight into Cdc13p inhibitory mechanisms. (<bold>a</bold>) Cdc13p, like DBD, preferentially binds TEL, but it also loads towards the 3&#x02032;-end at higher protein : DNA stoichiometry. SVP data are shown from CoNuTe assay [telomerase results from this CoNuTe experiment are shown in (<bold>b</bold>)]. Protein concentrations used here and in CoNuTe telomerase assay below are the same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>.

As anticipated, both proteins bound preferentially to the 5&#x02032; TEL region based on SVP protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a). Cdc13(DBD) inhibited telomerase action substantially, though not completely (13 &#x000b1; 3% residual activity), on all of the TEL&#x02013;a<sub>n</sub>&#x02013;TGTGGG (<italic>n</italic> = 5, 8, 11) primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>b), even when the telomerase-annealing site was as far as 11-nt away from the DBD consensus binding site. SVP analysis showed that Cdc13(DBD) did not extensively protect the 3&#x02032;-end at concentrations that were largely inhibitory. Thus, by binding to TEL at the 5&#x02032;-end, Cdc13(DBD) is effectively inhibiting telomerase activity from 5&#x02013;11 single-stranded nucleotides away, producing an inhibitory effect when bound at a significant distance from the telomerase annealing site, which we refer to as action at a distance.</p><p>Cdc13p was an even more potent inhibitor of telomerase than the DBD for TEL&#x02013;a<sub>n</sub>&#x02013;TGTGGG (<italic>n</italic> = 5, 8, 11) substrates, leading to complete loss of telomerase action on all primers tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>b, lanes 7, 14, and 21). We propose that this inhibition originates from a combination of action at a distance as well as more direct inhibition due to a concentration-dependent mode of 3&#x02032; end binding. At higher protein concentrations, Cdc13p shifts 3&#x02032; in these telomerase-refractory complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a, lanes 8, 16 and 24). Protection, however, is not observed on a control primer a<sub>11</sub>&#x02013;a<sub>11</sub>&#x02013;TGTGGG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a, lanes 30&#x02013;32) lacking the TEL binding sequence, suggesting the hexamer telomeric portion does not support stable Cdc13p association. The concentration-dependence of this 3&#x02032; shift in SVP protection suggests that once Cdc13p is bound to the 5&#x02032; TEL sequence of these oligonucleotides, it can facilitate the addition of a second protein. We looked for evidence of a second binding event by gel shift and, although we readily observe the initial binding of Cdc13p onto these primers, a higher mobility band was not observed at high Cdc13p protein concentrations (data not shown). This may be because this secondary binding interaction is rather weak (in the micromolar range) and is not stable during electrophoresis.</p><p>Close comparison of data from the control experiments provides some insights into the mechanism of the inhibition at a distance observed for both the DBD and Cdc13p. We observe that the activity of telomerase on TEL&#x02013;a<sub>11</sub>&#x02013;TGTGGG is 47 &#x000b1; 16% higher than the same oligonucleotide with no TEL sequence at the 5&#x02032;-end (a<sub>11</sub>&#x02013;a<sub>11</sub>&#x02013;TGTGGG; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>b, lane 15 versus 22). This suggests that the TEL sequence, even 11 nt away from &#x02013;TGTGGG 3&#x02032;-end, has the ability to enhance telomerase activity. When Cdc13(DBD) binds to TEL, it likely restricts the contribution of TEL to telomerase activity, providing a potent alternative mechanism of inhibition.</p><p>For all of the control primers with no TEL sequence at the 5&#x02032;-end (a<sub>11</sub>&#x02013;a<sub>11</sub>&#x02013;TGTGGG, a<sub>11</sub>&#x02013;TGTGGG and a<sub>5</sub>&#x02013;TGTGGG), DBD could partly inhibit telomerase at the highest protein concentration tested in the CoNuTe experiment. SVP results from the CoNuTe assays also show some binding to the tract of deoxyadenosines by DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a, lanes 27&#x02013;29), which is not observed for Cdc13p at these concentrations, probably due to the intrinsic affinity differences between full-length and the DBD which carry over to nonspecific interactions. The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for DBD interaction with hexamer TGTGGG is very close to the working concentration of primer in the CoNuTe reactions (300 nM) (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the DBD is inhibiting telomerase through a combination of low-affinity interactions for these primers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Studies in various organisms have shown that the primary chromosome end-binding proteins play two direct roles in regulating genome stability: (i) protecting the chromosome end, which otherwise would elicit a DNA-damage response, and (ii) regulating telomerase access to the 3&#x02032; terminus, thereby controlling chromosome end synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Here we have shown that Cdc13p, as well as its DNA-binding domain alone, block telomerase access, thus inhibiting its action. This result is reminiscent of studies with human POT1 and ciliate telomere end binding protein (TEBP&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;), which have also been shown to inhibit telomerase <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). However, Cdc13p inhibition differs from these cases in multiple ways, as discussed below.</p><sec><title>Cdc13p can inhibit telomerase by three different modes, whereas DBD exhibits two</title><p>Our data reveal three related mechanisms of Cdc13p inhibition of telomerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). The first of the inhibitory modes occurs when the telomerase active site is simply blocked from productively accessing the 3&#x02032;-end (&#x02018;complete occlusion&#x02019;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>b). This activity is readily explained in context of the structure of Cdc13(DBD) bound to TEL sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>): the bases are all buried in a highly aromatic protein&#x02022;DNA interface, and DNA hybridization with the telomerase RNP could only occur upon gross structural rearrangement. This scenario applies to most of the inhibitory situations we have described herein, such as with primer TP1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, using the DBD and Cdc13p, respectively. This occlusion mechanism is supported by the observation that the DNA-binding defective Y522A point-mutant of the Cdc13(DBD) does not inhibit telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>d). We also observed that residual telomerase activity is proportional to amount of unbound primer when it is available in excess over protein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn830/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>). Furthermore, the fact that more Cdc13(DBD) and Cdc13p are required to inhibit telomerase action as primer concentration is increased supports a straightforward model of competitive binding of protein to DNA that regulates telomerase action. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Models for the relationship between telomeric DNA binding and telomerase inhibition by Cdc13p. (<bold>a</bold>) In the absence of any telomere-binding protein, telomerase binds to its substrate and readily extends it via reverse transcription of its RNA template. (<bold>b</bold>) Complete occlusion model for inhibition of telomerase. The DNA-binding domain as well as full-length Cdc13p are capable of occluding telomerase access to the 3&#x02032;-end of its substrate, even when additional 3&#x02032; nucleotides protrude beyond the Cdc13&#x02022;DNA interaction interface. (<bold>c</bold>) Action at a distance inhibition. Although part of telomerase interaction with DNA is blocked by DBD or Cdc13p, some telomerase activity is achieved, presumably via interaction of the catalytic site and the very 3&#x02032;-end. (<bold>d</bold>) Facilitated occlusion model. Cdc13p binds secondarily towards the 3&#x02032;-end of the DNA primer in a concentration-dependent manner, leading to more potent inhibition. This is stepwise, effectively inhibiting first as indicated in c (action at a distance) and then, additionally, as shown in b (complete occlusion), when Cdc13p loads also on the 3&#x02032;-end, facilitated by first loading at a more 5&#x02032; position.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn830f7"/></fig></p><p>The second mode of observed inhibition unveils an apparent sensitivity of yeast telomerase to Cdc13p or DBD positioned far upstream from the 3&#x02032;-end on long DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>c). This &#x02018;action at a distance&#x02019; inhibition is less efficient than the direct occlusion inhibition, but nevertheless it represents a novel activity that provides insights into the mechanism of telomerase action and its regulation. Telomerase activity, which is enhanced by presence of 5&#x02032; telomeric sequence, is reciprocally reduced by DBD and Cdc13p when they are bound to this region of these primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). With only six telomeric nucleotides at the 3&#x02032;-end of these oligonucleotides, this 5&#x02032; TEL&#x02022;telomerase interface is particularly important for productive substrate-enzyme interaction. Binding of TEL by Cdc13(DBD) then blocks this activity-stimulating interaction, reducing telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>c). Since this region of the primer almost certainly does not directly anneal to telomerase RNA, the inhibition by distally 5&#x02032;-bound Cdc13(DBD) must be mediated through alternative interactions. One possibility is that binding to the 5&#x02032;-end of the primers inhibits the ability of the primer to interact with the telomerase &#x02018;anchor site&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>), which has been reported to positively and negatively affect yeast telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). The anchor site of yeast telomerase may be similar to that of other telomerases, possessing multiple sites that bind DNA based on its specific length and sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>).</p><p>The third mode of telomerase inhibition is exhibited by Cdc13p but not its DBD alone, implicating other domains of the protein in mediating this activity. The SVP protection results for Cdc13p from the CoNuTe assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a demonstrate a pattern of increased 3&#x02032; protection at the highest Cdc13p concentrations. Furthermore, complete telomerase inhibition does not appear until there is this 3&#x02032; shift in SVP protection pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, it seems that after Cdc13p initially binds to the 5&#x02032; region of these oligonucleotides, it facilitates additional 3&#x02032; DNA protection from nuclease and also telomerase action in a Cdc13p concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest an additional mode of inhibition, which we refer to as facilitated occlusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>d). How Cdc13p protects additional 3&#x02032; sequences once bound to TEL and whether this effect is specific to these particular substrates is not yet entirely clear. It may involve binding of a second protein, but we have not directly demonstrated this.</p></sec><sec><title>Telomerase regulation by the major telomere end-binding proteins: yeast Cdc13p in perspective</title><p>Cdc13p and human POT1 both inhibit telomerase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> by binding DNA and occluding access of telomerase to its substrate [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and this work]. Human telomerase can access hPOT1&#x02022;DNA substrates productively when 6 nt or more are protruding past the protein binding site at the 3&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). This activity is exhibited by both the full-length POT1 protein and its DNA-binding domain. However, in budding yeast the telomeric ssDNA-binding protein serves additional functions. A 7-nt protruding tail beyond the bound Cdc13(DBD) is a relatively nonproductive substrate for yeast telomerase. In fact, even when Cdc13p or its DBD alone were bound as far away as 17 nt from the 3&#x02032;-end of a telomerase substrate, telomerase activity was blocked. These data suggest that the role of Cdc13p in regulating telomerase activity is more multi-faceted than that exhibited by hPOT1.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, Cdc13p is both a positive and negative regulator of telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). A truncated version of Cdc13p lacking the C-terminal domain, which follows the DBD, leads to elongated telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). This <italic>cdc13-5</italic> allele may behave like the DBD alone <italic>in vitro</italic>, because the N-terminus of Cdc13p has not been implicated in DNA binding, but rather in protein&#x02013;protein interactions to recruit the telomerase holoenzyme to telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). With the development of quantitative assays and a reconstituted minimal system, we have a better understanding of the role of Cdc13p on telomerase function. Our inability to find a primer that, upon binding of Cdc13p, is a robust telomerase substrate suggests that the positive regulation role of Cdc13p is mediated in conjunction with other telomere factors. Approximately 273 genes have been shown to have a direct or indirect role in mediating telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). Many of these elicit their effects indirectly, but some are direct regulators. Est1p, a component of telomerase that interacts with Cdc13p to recruit telomerase to telomeres, is a prime candidate to overcome the basal repressive activity of Cdc13p. Like Est1p, Est3p is telomerase-associated and essential for telomerase function <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>). Stn1p and Ten1p also interact with Cdc13p and display telomere length phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). The <italic>in vitro</italic> system presented here will be a powerful tool to dissect the role of telomere-associated factors in mediating telomere length homeostasis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn830/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> [<grant-num>GM59414</grant-num> to D.S.W., <grant-num>GM28039</grant-num> to T.R.C., <grant-num>K99 GM80400</grant-num> to D.C.Z., and T32 GM65103 (NIH/CU Molecular Biophysics Traineeship awarded) to J.N.R.].
