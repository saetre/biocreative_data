Identification of molecules that regulate ER function may facilitate development of breast cancer treatment strategies. The forkhead box class O (FOXO) transcription factor FOXO3a has been suggested to function as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Using protein-protein interaction screening, we found that FOXO3a interacted with ER-&#x003b1; and ER-&#x003b2; proteins in the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, suggesting that there exists a crosstalk between the FOXO3a and ER signaling pathways in estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The interaction between FOXO3a and ER was investigated by using co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays.

Tumorigenesis was assessed in athymic mice that were injected with MCF-7 cell lines over-expressing FOXO3a.

Moreover, we found that FOXO3a upregulated the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2. These findings suggest that FOXO3a induces cell growth arrest to effect tumor suppression. FOXO3a repressed the growth and survival of MCF-7 cells in cell culture.

Approximately 70% of human breast cancers express estrogen receptors (ERs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Many ER-&#x003b1;-positive human breast cancer cells require estrogen for proliferation and undergo apoptotic cell death when they are deprived of it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Clinically, the presence of ER-&#x003b1; in breast cancer is viewed as a good prognostic factor, being associated with a lower risk for relapse and better overall disease-free survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Indeed, ER-&#x003b1; is a major target for endocrine therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and functional ER-&#x003b1; protein is both sufficient and necessary to predict responsiveness to such therapy in a high proportion of breast tumors. Thus, assessment of ER status has become standard practice in the clinical management of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], with hormonal intervention offered to patients with ER-&#x003b1;-positive tumors.</p><p>Current endocrine therapies for ER-&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer target the action of estrogen on breast cancer cells by using selective ER modulators such as tamoxifen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], aromatase inhibitors such as exemestane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], or pure antiestrogens such as fulvestrant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, only about 50% of ER-positive tumors respond to currently available hormonal therapies, and most tumors that initially respond eventually become resistant to endocrine therapy, even though ER may still be present in the tumor tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Attempts to prevent or reverse antiestrogen resistance have been hampered by the lack of knowledge of the signaling mechanisms that underlie the regulation of ER function.</p><p>The cellular and molecular events that regulate ER-&#x003b1; and ER-&#x003b2; protein expression and function are poorly understood. Expression of ER-&#x003b1; may not be regulated genetically; for example, lack of expression of ER-&#x003b1; generally is not associated with physical loss of the ER-&#x003b1; gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, ER-&#x003b1; expression can be regulated through epigenetic modification, for instance methylation at the promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], by post-translational modifications, or through direct interaction with corepressor proteins that repress ER-&#x003b1;-mediated transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Less is known of the regulation of expression and function of ER-&#x003b2; in breast cancer cells and tissues. Additional information on the cellular and molecular events that regulate ER-&#x003b1; and ER-&#x003b2; protein expression and function is needed.</p><p>FOXO3a, which is one of the forkhead box class O (FOXO) transcription factors, is a key tumor suppressor in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The function of FOXO3a is regulated mainly by nuclear translocation. In general, FOXO factors in animal cells are regulated by Akt or other kinases, which phosphorylate them at conserved serine/threonine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This phosphorylation leads to the release of the FOXO transcription factors from the DNA and translocation of those factors to the cytoplasm, where 14-3-3 protein binds to the phosphorylated FOXO factors and retains them as inactive proteins in the cytoplasm. However, in the absence of stimulation from survival signals, Akt is inactivated in quiescent cells, which results in retention of FOXO factors in the nucleus. In addition to Akt, I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK)-&#x003b2; is also important in regulating FOXO3a localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Nuclear FOXO has been shown to upregulate the expression of specific target genes that modulate the cell metabolic state or oxidative stress or aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], those that control cell cycle progression such as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], or those that regulate the mitotic program such as cyclin B and Polo-like kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Downregulation of cyclin D has been implicated in FOXO-induced cell cycle inhibition in some cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Nuclear FOXO has also been reported to induce cellular apoptosis through upregulation of Fas ligand (Fas-L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], Bim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Changes in FOXO function could tip the balance between cellular differentiation and neoplastic transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Although FOXO3a reportedly can suppress cell growth and tumorigenesis in ER-negative breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], whether FOXO3a also regulates cell proliferation or tumorigenesis in ER-positive breast tumors is unknown. Here we report our discovery that FOXO3a interacts with ERs. We found that FOXO3a interacts with both ER-&#x003b1; and ER-&#x003b2; and inhibits their transcriptional activities. Gene expression profiling with a DNA microarray suggested that FOXO3a inhibits the expression of ER target genes. FOXO3a suppressed proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells by inducing the expression of key CDK inhibitors and reducing the expression of cyclin D<sub>1</sub>. Moreover, FOXO3a suppressed tumorigenesis of E2-induced tumorigenesis of MCF-7 cells in an animal orthotopic breast tumor model, suggesting that FOXO3a plays a critical tumor-suppression role in estrogen-dependent breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and cell lines</title><p>Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with 10% or 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA, USA) or phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA), with or without 100 nmol/l 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (E2; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).

In addition, we found that the expression of cyclin E is not significantly altered in these MCF7-FO cells either (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>).

Our finding that silencing FOXO3a in MCF-7 promoted tumorigenesis and tumor growth in an E2-independent manner <italic>in vivo </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8d</xref>) further supports the notion that FOXO3a plays a critical role in repressing the ER-mediated survival pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>. One plausible mechanism of this effect is that ER becomes constitutively active in the absence of estrogen (such as the development of hormone-refractory disease) when MCF-7 cells are lacking FOXO3a, an ER co-repressor. The second possible mechanism of this effect is that silencing of FOXO3a might induce certain receptor tyrosine kinases, which in turn activate ER activity in MCF-7 cells in an estrogen-independent manner. The third possible mechanism of this effect could be that other factors (such as cytokines or chemokines) might be upregulated in MCF-7 cells that lack FOXO3a through autocrine regulation and contribute to this hormone-independent growth effect. However, we have no mechanistic data to prove the possible mechanism of this effect at present. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanism that underlies this effect will lead to better understanding of the role of FOXO3a in preventing hormone-independent growth of MCF7 cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Notably, we also demonstrated a direct physical interaction between FOXO3a and ER-&#x003b1; or ER-&#x003b2; and suppression of ER-&#x003b1; and ER-&#x003b2; transactivation activities by FOXO3a <italic>in vitro</italic>. Transient over-expression of FOXO3a has been shown to lead to increases in ER-&#x003b1; expression and ER-&#x003b1; promoter activity in a reporter assay in ER-&#x003b1;-positive NF639 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. However, we found that the expression of ER-&#x003b1; and ER-&#x003b2; proteins was not significantly affected by the ectopic expression of FOXO3a in all three variants (MCF7-FO) of ER-&#x003b1;-positive and ER-&#x003b2;-positive MCF-7 cells. One possible explanation for this difference is that FOXO3a can function on the one hand as a co-repressor, one that is associated with ER-&#x003b1; and ER-&#x003b2; proteins and inhibits their transactivating activities; and on the other hand as a transcription factor that binds the promoter of ER-&#x003b1; and induces transcription of ER-&#x003b1; as a feedback mechanism in some situations. Alternatively, the observed difference could be due to differences in the expression methods or the cell lines used.</p><p>Because many estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells express both ER-&#x003b1; and ER-&#x003b2;, one plausible meaning of this observation is that FOXO may interact with ER-&#x003b1; and ER-&#x003b2; simultaneously at different FOXO domains, resulting in inhibition of both ER-&#x003b1; and ER-&#x003b2; function in breast cancer cells and suppression of ER-mediated tumor growth and development. In general, ER-&#x003b1; and ER-&#x003b2; consist of six functional domains. The structurally distinct amino terminal A/B domains (17% amino acid identity) contain a ligand-independent transactivation function (AF1). The near identical central C region is the DNA-binding domain. The flexible hinge, or D, domain contains a nuclear localization signal and links the C domain to the multifunctional carboxyl-terminal (E/F) domain, which exhibits 56% amino-acid homology between ER-&#x003b1; and ER-&#x003b2;. E/F is involved in ligand binding, dimerization, and ligand-dependent transactivation functions (AF2). Thus, the second possible significance of this phenomenon is that ER-&#x003b1; and ER-&#x003b2; may use distinct functional domains to interact with FOXO at different domains so that ER-&#x003b1; and ER-&#x003b2; may not compete for the binding site of FOXO. Moreover, it has been shown that ER-&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; can form heterodimers on DNA, and they interacted with ERE and E2 in a manner similar to that observed with the ER homodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The third possible implication of this finding is that ER-&#x003b1; and ER-&#x003b2; heterodimers may interact with FOXO at different domains to form a large complex that could not bind to ERE on DNA, and thereby ER-&#x003b1;/ER-&#x003b2; are not functional.</p><p>Finally, our findings provide a mechanistic basis for FOXO3a-mediated tumor suppression in ER-positive breast cancer cells. FOXO3a inhibited ER-mediated signaling through a nongenomic mechanism and upregulated the expression of three CDK inhibitors that could result in suppression of tumor growth and tumorigenesis in estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although our results were generated using MCF-7 variants and mouse models, the <italic>in vivo </italic>data in particular may have important clinical implications for treating or preventing the development of resistance to endocrine therapy. For instance, the development of resistance to antiestrogen therapy remains a clinically important problem. However, a major limitation in alternative approaches to treating or preventing antiestrogen resistance is that we lack knowledge of the precise signaling mechanisms that underlie the regulation of ER function and development of ER-unresponsiveness in ER-positive breast cancer cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further investigation of FOXO factors in inhibition of ER function and signaling may contribute new insights into this problem. Understanding the molecular basis of FOXO3a-induced suppression of cell growth and tumor development could also provide opportunities to develop innovative anticancer therapeutic modalities, such as small molecules that can activate FOXO3a, thereby potentially suppressing the growth of breast tumors and possibly preventing recurrence after therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We suggest that FOXO3a plays a critical role in suppressing estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data further support that agents such as small molecules that activate FOXO3a may be novel therapeutics for inhibition and prevention of tumor proliferation and development in breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CDK = cyclin-dependent kinase; E2 = 17&#x003b2;-estradiol; ER = estrogen receptor; ERE = ER-responsive element; FasL = Fas ligand; FasR = Fas receptor; FOXO = forkhead box class O; FOXM1 = forkhead box M1; HA = hemagglutinin; IKK = I&#x003ba;B kinase; luc = luciferase reporter; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; PgR = progesterone receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YZ conducted all of the breast tumorigenesis and tumor growth studies in female athymic nude mice.
