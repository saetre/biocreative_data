Fibrosis is one of the largest groups of diseases for which there is no therapy. It has been estimated that nearly 45&#x00025; of all deaths in the developed world are caused fibrotic conditions which include: cardiovascular disease, pulmonary fibrosis, diabetic nephropathy and liver cirrhosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007438-Wynn1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. An example of a chronic fibrotic disease is systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma) which, in its diffuse form, can affect the skin and internal organs such as the lung and kidney, resulting in significant morbidity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007438-Varga1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the fundamental cause for fibrotic conditions including SSc is unclear, a common theme of these diseases is the abnormal persistence of a particular specialized form of fibroblast, termed the myofibroblast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007438-Gabbiani1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007438-Wynn2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

These results suggest that anti-Rac strategies may be useful anti-fibrotic treatments. Future efforts examining the potential utility of rac inhibition as a strategy in SSc will require an assessment of the specificity of rac inhibition in selectively blocking fibrogenic responses in vitro and an in vivo prior to the translation of this knowledge into humans.
