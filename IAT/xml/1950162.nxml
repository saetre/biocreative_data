The mechanisms by which paternal-specific methylation of the DMD survive the period of genome-wide demethylation in the early embryo and are subsequently used to govern imprinted expression are not known. Methyl-CpG binding (MBD) proteins are likely candidates to explain how these DMDs are recognized to silence the locus, because they preferentially bind methylated DNA and recruit repression complexes with histone deacetylase activity. MBD RNA and protein are found in preimplantation embryos, and chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that MBD3 is bound to the <italic>H19</italic> DMD. To test a role for MBDs in imprinting, two independent RNAi-based strategies were used to deplete MBD3 in early mouse embryos, with the same results. In RNAi-treated blastocysts, paternal <italic>H19</italic> expression was activated, supporting the hypothesis that MBD3, which is also a member of the Mi-2/NuRD complex, is required to repress the paternal <italic>H19</italic> allele. RNAi-treated blastocysts also have reduced levels of the Mi-2/NuRD complex protein MTA-2, which suggests a role for the Mi-2/NuRD repressive complex in paternal-specific silencing at the <italic>H19</italic> locus. Furthermore, DNA methylation was reduced at the <italic>H19</italic> DMD when MBD3 protein was depleted. In contrast, expression and DNA methylation were not disrupted in preimplantation embryos for other imprinted genes. These results demonstrate new roles for MBD3 in maintaining imprinting control region DNA methylation and silencing the paternal <italic>H19</italic> allele. Finally, MBD3-depleted preimplantation embryos have reduced cell numbers, suggesting a role for MBD3 in cell division.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Genomic imprinting is a specialized system of gene regulation whereby only one copy of a gene is used, either the maternal or the paternal copy. Misregulation of imprinting in humans results in developmental disorders such as Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, and is implicated in many cancers. Study of imprinted genes in mice can lead to a greater understanding of these diseases as well as insight into gene regulation. Many imprinted genes are associated with methylation on the silenced allele. The imprinted gene <italic>H19</italic> is maternally expressed and paternally methylated in a region upstream of the promoter known as the differentially methylated domain. This region is required for proper imprinted expression of <italic>H19</italic> and its upstream imprinted neighbor <italic>Igf2</italic>. Our studies have explored the requirement for methyl-CpG binding protein 3 (MBD3) in silencing of the paternal allele. MBD3 is known to be part of a repressive complex that resides at silenced genes. In our experiments, we have shown that MBD3 is required for imprinting of <italic>H19,</italic> and is also required for the maintenance of methylation on the paternal allele. Finally, the MBD3 protein can be found at the differentially methylated domain. The identification of a protein required for silencing of the paternal allele of <italic>H19</italic> is an important step in understanding regulation of this gene.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Reese KJ, Lin S, Verona RI, Schultz RM, Bartolomei MS (2007) Maintenance of paternal methylation and repression of the imprinted <italic>H19</italic> gene requires MBD3.

Failure of transcriptional regulation defines the molecular basis for many human diseases, emphasizing the importance of this control for normal growth and development. Accordingly, loss of imprinting is implicated in a number of human diseases and cancers. For example, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a disorder characterized by overgrowth and tumor development, results from defects in gene expression from either of two linked but independently controlled imprinted gene clusters on 11p15.5, the <italic>H19</italic>/<italic>IGF2</italic> or <italic>KCNQ1OT1</italic>/<italic>CDKN1C</italic> clusters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The mechanism by which imprinted gene expression is established and maintained has been extensively studied but still remains incompletely understood. DNA methylation represents one of the best candidates for conferring parental-specific expression patterns because DNA methylation is differentially acquired in the parental germlines, maintained following fertilization, and subsequently employed to silence the nonexpressed allele. One of the best examples of such regulation is observed at the mouse <italic>H19</italic>/<italic>Igf2</italic> locus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The <italic>H19</italic> gene, which encodes a noncoding RNA, and the <italic>Igf2</italic> gene, which encodes a fetal mitogen, are expressed from opposite parental alleles, but their imprinted expression is regulated by common DNA elements &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. One such element is a 2-kb imprinting control region located 2 kb upstream from the <italic>H19</italic> transcriptional start site, designated the differentially methylated domain (DMD), which is required for imprinted expression of both <italic>H19</italic> and <italic>Igf2</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. The DMD forms an active CTCF-dependent insulator on the maternal allele that governs expression of <italic>H19</italic> and repression of <italic>Igf2</italic>. In the male germline, the DMD acquires methylation that is necessary for repression of the paternal <italic>H19</italic> allele &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Methylation of the DMD is essential for imprinted expression because <italic>H19,</italic> which is normally maternally expressed throughout development, is biallelically expressed in DNA methyltransferase 1 <italic>(Dnmt1)</italic> mutants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, while much is known about the sequences required for <italic>H19</italic> imprinting and the necessity for differential DNA methylation at this locus, less is known about how DNA methylation leads to silencing of the paternal allele.</p><p>Although CTCF has been shown to bind the unmethylated DMD on the maternal <italic>H19</italic> allele, leading to formation of an insulator, cofactors that are required for recognition of the repressed paternal allele have not been identified. The methyl-CpG-binding proteins (MBDs) are possible candidates for the dual jobs of recognizing DNA methylation marks and silencing transcription from the locus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that these proteins can bind methylated DNA and associate with repressive complexes in vitro. These proteins may, therefore, provide the link between DNA methylation and transcriptional silencing at imprinted loci.</p><p>To determine the role of MBDs in imprinted gene regulation, we have taken an RNAi approach to generate hypomorphic alleles. Although we and others have found that transcripts for all <italic>Mbd</italic> genes are present in early mouse embryos (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;; KJR, unpublished data), <italic>Mbd3</italic> was chosen as the first target for RNAi because <italic>Mbd3</italic> null embryos die early in embryogenesis, suggesting a critical role in development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, we have determined that MBD3 is bound to the <italic>H19</italic> DMD. Using both injections of one-cell embryos with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) against Mbd3 (dsMbd3) and a transgenic (TG) RNAi approach that reduces Mbd3 mRNA in oocytes, we demonstrate that <italic>H19</italic> is activated on the normally methylated and repressed paternal allele in blastocysts with reduced amounts of MBD3 protein. This biallelic <italic>H19</italic> expression in Mbd3 RNAi embryos is significantly different from control embryos, which retain monoallelic expression. Other imprinted genes analyzed in the Mbd3-depleted embryos are monoallelically expressed, suggesting each locus may require a separate MBD partner. Interestingly, Mbd3 RNAi embryos have reduced DNA methylation at the <italic>H19</italic> locus, but not at the imprinted <italic>Snrpn</italic> locus, indicating a critical role for MBD3 in maintaining paternal methylation marks at the <italic>H19</italic> locus during a critical window of genome wide demethylation. Finally, reducing MBD3 levels affects cell division and, consequently, the size of RNAi embryos. These findings support the hypothesis that MBD proteins are required for the interpretation and maintenance of allele specific methylation marks leading to repression of the paternal <italic>H19</italic> allele.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Temporal and Spatial Pattern of Expression of Mbd3 RNA and Protein during Preimplantation Development</title><p>RT-PCR experiments using <italic>Mbd3</italic> specific primers demonstrated that Mbd3 RNA is present in oocytes and preimplantation mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030137-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The RNA was quantified and normalized relative to known amounts of rabbit globin RNA added prior to RNA preparation. Mbd3 RNA levels are high in the oocyte, become reduced through early stages of preimplantation embryogenesis, but rise again by the blastocyst stage. This profile is consistent with expression of many other transcripts; degradation of maternal transcripts followed by replacement at the two-cell stage with zygotic transcripts. MBD3 protein follows a similar distribution, with levels highest in the oocyte and blastocyst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030137-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Interestingly, MBD3 protein is present on the DNA and spindle in eggs, and is nuclear at all other stages with punctate foci of stronger staining. As proposed for transcription factors that remain associated with chromosomes during mitosis and direct transcription following entry into interphase, MBD3&#x02032;s association with chromatin in eggs may provide a similar molecular memory to ensure appropriate marking of the maternal allele. Thus, both Mbd3 RNA and protein are present at this critical period for imprinted gene expression when imprints are becoming established.</p><fig id="pgen-0030137-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Mbd3 RNA and Protein Patterns in Oocytes and Preimplantation Embryos</title><p>(A) Mbd3 and globin primers were used to amplify Mbd3 and exogenously added globin RNA from oocyte and preimplantation embryo cDNA samples.

The first is during primordial germ cell migration and colonization of the genital ridge, when the entire genome, including imprinted genes, is demethylated.

Most methylated sequences are demethylated during these two events, but imprinting control regions escape this demethylation.

How these processes occur has remained completely unknown up to this point. We propose that MBD3 is intimately involved in these processes at the <italic>H19</italic> locus during preimplantation development.</p><p>We initiated our studies with MBD3 for several reasons: it is expressed during this critical period of preimplantation development, <italic>Mdb3</italic> knockouts display an early embryonic lethal phenotype &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, and MDB3 is associated with chromatin at the <italic>H19</italic> DMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030137-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Two RNAi approaches allowed us to reduce Mbd3 RNA and protein from oocytes and preimplantation mouse embryos. The RNAi strategy for depleting target RNA has several advantages over traditional gene targeting experiments: RNAi allows for (1) reduction in maternal RNA and protein that persists in traditional knockouts, (2) production of a hypomorphic allelic series, and (3) easy use of hybrid strains for allelic gene expression analysis.</p><p>Using two types of RNAi approaches&#x02014;injection of dsRNA and TG RNAi&#x02014;we observe the same effects on the imprinted expression and DNA methylation of <italic>H19</italic>. Both methods proved effective at reducing Mbd3 RNA and protein. In RNAi embryos, but not control embryos, <italic>H19</italic> is biallelically expressed in a significant fraction of blastocysts examined (40&#x00025; of TG RNAi and 26&#x00025; of injection RNAi blastocysts). These results demonstrate that MBD3 is required for proper imprinted expression of <italic>H19</italic>.</p><p>Our initial hypothesis was that an MBD would bind to the methylated DMD and recruit repressive complexes to silence the paternal allele, but it is important to note that MBD3 fails to bind methylated substrates as assayed by in vitro DNA binding assays, likely due to a phenylalanine instead of a critical tyrosine in its MBD motif &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Whereas in vitro experiments suggest that MBD3 does not bind directly to the methylated DMD, our ChIP results indicate that MBD3 is directly associated with chromatin at the <italic>H19</italic> DMD. Similarly, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that MBD3 interacts with the methylated maternal allele of the imprinted gene <italic>Zrsr1</italic> in adult mouse livers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, MBD3 is an integral member of the chromatin-remodeling enzyme Mi-2/NuRD, and recent data suggest that in the absence of MBD3, this complex is unstable &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. The reduction of MTA-2 levels in Mbd3 RNAi embryos suggests that the amount of repressive NuRD complexes is reduced in RNAi embryos, and that in the absence of these complexes, <italic>H19</italic> can be expressed from the paternal allele. These data suggest an important role for the NuRD complex in imprinted gene expression. Given the previously described genetic and biochemical interactions between MBD2 and MBD3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, MBD2 may also have a role in imprinted gene repression. However, <italic>Mbd2</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; embryos have been examined and shown to have proper expression of several imprinted genes including <italic>H19</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Experiments to reduce simultaneously levels of MBD3 and other MBDs should uncover any such role for MBD2 that may have been compensated for by the presence of MBD3.</p><p>Although <italic>H19</italic> is biallelically expressed in a significant number of Mbd3 RNAi blastocysts, not all blastocysts exhibit such a loss of imprinting. Likewise, the DMD is not completely demethylated on every strand, although there are strands that were completely demethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030137-g005">Figure 5</xref>). There are several possible explanations for this result. First, RNAi may not completely ablate MBD3 function. Quantification of RNA levels indicated a fairly robust reduction in Mbd3 RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030137-g002">Figure 2</xref>), and a nearly complete loss of protein, as determined by immunocytochemistry, but, with the technology currently available, it is difficult to determine the effective loss of MBD3 at the level of chromatin, where it presumably acts. Second, even if robust reduction of MBD3 is attained, MBD3 is one of several family members that are expressed in preimplantation embryos, and these other family members might provide compensatory activity in the absence of MBD3. Finally, the timescale of this experiment may not provide adequate time for MBD3 protein to turn over completely, and for the results of the RNA reduction by RNAi to be completely realized.</p><p>We examined expression of a handful of other imprinted genes in RNAi embryos, but none showed derepression of the silent allele, suggesting that MBD3 is not involved in their repression. In this case, other MBDs might be required for their imprinted expression. Alternatively, the presence of other MBDs might be sufficient to compensate for the reduction in MBD3 at these loci, but not at <italic>H19</italic>. By reducing several MBDs in concert by RNAi, such compensatory mechanisms might be uncovered. Also, <italic>H19</italic> may be especially sensitive to perturbation of imprinting cofactors and the paternal allele may be derepressed with the slightest insult to the repressive complex, whereas other imprinted genes may be able to make do with reduced MBD3 protein. Other types of experiments with longer-lived effects such as knockout alleles might be better suited to uncovering these effects as well as determining if MBD3 is required for the imprinting of genes such as <italic>Igf2</italic> that are expressed later in development<italic>.</italic> Finally, the continued discovery of new proteins with an affinity for methylated DNA might eventually uncover different mechanisms for the recognition and silencing of methylated sequences.</p><p>Our data suggest that MBD3 is required for maintenance of DNA methylation at the <italic>H19</italic> DMD during preimplantation development. Similar to the result in which a portion of embryos exhibit biallelic expression, a significant fraction of DNA strands are demethylated. For the reasons outlined above, the loss of MBD3 at this locus may not be complete or its effects may not be complete at the blastocyst stage. The partial loss of DNA methylation and accompanying loss of repression at <italic>H19</italic> suggests there may be a threshold for DNA methylation loss and concomitant paternal expression of <italic>H19</italic>. Indeed, the percentage of hypomethylated strands is similar to the number of embryos with biallelic expression of <italic>H19</italic>. Our data reporting loss of methylation at the <italic>H19</italic> DMD in the absence of MBD3 uncovers a new role for MBD proteins: protection of methylated regulatory sequences from DNA demethylation during preimplantation development. This role may not have been predicted by the MBD3 protein sequence, but it is clear that methylated imprinted regions must both be recognized and maintain their parental marks during this developmental time period. It is an interesting finding that a repressive complex that recognizes a differentially methylated region would also be responsible for maintaining that difference during development.</p><p>In conclusion, development of embryos that lack MBD3 is perturbed, whether MBD3 is removed transiently by RNAi (this study) or by a traditional deletion of the <italic>Mbd3</italic> locus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. In the RNAi experiments, imprinted <italic>H19</italic> expression is disturbed along with loss in DNA methylation on the paternal allele. In addition, the Mbd3 RNAi blastocysts are smaller and slower to hatch than controls, suggesting delays in development and perturbed cell cycles. <italic>Mbd3</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; animals die during the peri-implantation period, but the phenotype had not been extensively described until recently &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Kaji et al. (2006) reported that <italic>Mbd3</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; ES cells did not exhibit any cell cycle delay when the ES cells were examined by flow cytometry &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, but that 5.5-dpc embryos have reduced cell numbers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. These results suggest that the smaller Mbd3 RNAi embryos may be due to a developmental timing defect rather than a cell-cycle delay. TUNEL assays did not detect an increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis between RNAi embryos and controls, suggesting that RNAi embryos are not smaller due to increased cell death (unpublished data). Furthermore, both inner cell mass and trophoblast cells are present, suggesting no defects in the first preimplantation lineage decisions. Consistent with delays in cell division that we observe, cells deficient for <italic>Hells,</italic> a member of the SNF2 family of chromatin remodelers that is also a global regulator of DNA methylation, have defects in DNA methylation and are slow in completing mitosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the hypomethylation observed in Mbd3 RNAi embryos might similarly lead to problems in cell division in embryos that may not be observed in cultured ES cells. Finally, in both our study and in the studies of <italic>Mbd3</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; ES cells, loss of Mbd3 negatively affects the Mi-2/NuRD complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Consequently, even a transient MBD3 loss could lead to a global disruption of silencing carried out by this complex beyond the perturbation we report at the <italic>H19</italic> locus. A microarray analysis of global transcript profiles might uncover more genes regulated by this complex or genes specifically responsible for the other phenotypes we see beyond imprinting defects. Our results, thus, uncover an essential role for MBD3, and the Mi-2/NuRD complex, in regulating the imprinted <italic>H19</italic> locus, and provide tools to explore additional roles for MBD3 in genome-wide transcriptional regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice.</title><p>For dsRNA injections, oocytes and embryos were obtained from either CF1 (Harlan, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.harlan.com/">http://www.harlan.com/</ext-link>) females mated to CF1 males (for embryo assays) or from C57BL/6J (The Jackson Laboratory, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jax.org/">http://www.jax.org/</ext-link>) females mated to B6(CAST7) males (for allelic assays) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030137-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.
