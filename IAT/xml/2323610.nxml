Previous proteomic evidence revealed that the content of certain peptide fragments including Vgf-derived peptide aa 398-411 (Vgf<sub>398-411</sub>) of the precursor Vgf protein in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) correctly identified patients with ALS from normal and disease controls. Using quantitative ELISA immunoassay we found that the CSF levels of Vgf decreases with muscle weakness in patients with ALS. In SOD1 G93A transgenic mice, loss of full-length Vgf content in CSF, serum and in SMI-32 immunopositive spinal cord motor neurons is noted in asymptomatic animals (approximately 75 days old) and continues to show a progressive decline as animals weaken. In vitro studies show that viral-mediated exogenous Vgf expression in primary mixed spinal cord neuron cultures attenuates excitotoxic injury. Thus, while Vgf may be a reliable biomarker of progression of muscle weakness in patients with ALS, restoration of Vgf expression in spinal cord motor neurons may therapeutically rescue spinal cord motorneurons against excitotoxic injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>VGF</kwd><kwd>ALS</kwd><kwd>biomarker</kwd><kwd>excitotoxicity</kwd><kwd>SOD-1 mice</kwd><kwd>disease progression</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vgf nerve growth factor inducible peptide, a non acronymic peptide is a member of the chromogranin/secretogranin family of proteins.

ALS patients were classified as having either definite or probable ALS according to the WFN El-Escorial diagnostic criteria. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref> ALS patients were classified according to number of segments with clinical weakness, from a total of 3 segments of the central nervous system (cranial, cervical, and lumbar). Clinical weakness identified only in one segment occurred in 10 patients; weakness in two segments was identified in 7 patients. The total score on manual muscle testing (MMT) measured severity of muscle weakness. Five muscle groups in each of the four limbs were examined and graded according to the standard Medical Research Council (MRC) criteria, on a scale from 0 (no movement) to 5 (full strength against maximal resistance). The total possible normal score on this examination is 100. All CSF samples used were derived from comparable fractions (e.g. 20&#x02013;25 ml), to limit variability from rostro-caudal concentration gradients. Following collection, samples were gently mixed, divided into aliquots, and immediately frozen in dry-ice and stored at &#x02013;80&#x000b0; C. Written informed consent, approved by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB) on November 3, 2004, was obtained from all subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>ELISA assays</title><p>hVgf ELISA, microtiter plates were coated with 2-mg/mL goat polyclonal anti-Vgf antibody (R15) (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA), which recognizes the C-terminal epitope of Vgf. Unoccupied binding sites on the plates were blocked by incubation with casein. Samples and standards were applied in duplicate and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Following the Vgf capture phase, the plates were reacted with rabbit anti-Vgf antibody (#9130 against Vgf<sub>78-340</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref> followed by incubation with a reporter antibody (HRP&#x02013;conjugated anti&#x02013;rabbit IgG, Santa Cruz Biotech, CA).

Before testing, mice underwent a one-week training period wherein they were introduced to the apparatus and handled by the operator daily. Testing was conducted during the last 4 hours of the day portion of the light cycle in an environment with minimal stimuli (noise, movement, changes in light or temperature) for a maximum time maintained on the rod by each mouse of 240 seconds.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot and protein expression analysis</title><p>Frozen brain and spinal cord samples were first pulverized on dry ice, homogenized in cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM &#x003b2;-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO4, 1 &#x003bc;g/ml leupeptin, and 1mM phenylmethyl sulphonyl fluoride), and sonicated for 2 min at 4&#x000ba;C.

The fluorescence emitted was observed through each appropriate filter on a fluorescence microscope (BX51; Olympus) and digitally photographed using a cooled charge-coupled-device camera (model VB-6000/6010; Keyence Co.). In control studies run in parallel, tissue sections were also stained with anti- glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a glial marker, or and anti NeuN, a neuronal marker, as previously described.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Stereology of SMI-32 immunopositive neurons</title><p>For stereological assessment of SMI-32 (a non-phosphorylated neurofilament epitope) immunoreactive spinal cord motorneurons, 10 serial coronal sections (12 &#x003bc;m thick) were cut 350 &#x003bc;m apart through the lumbar (L3 to L5) spinal cord of each animal. The sections were mounted onto positively charged glass slides (Superfrost Plus, Fisher Scientific) and immunostained using a commercially available rabbit anti-rat SMI-32 antibody (D20, 1:1000, Santa Cruz, CA). SMI-32 immunopositive neurons were counted from digitised images (200X) within the ventral horns under fluoresce microscopy. These counts were within a homogenous structure, making the tenets of stereology valid. SMI-32-stained neurons were counted using the Neurolucida system at a magnification of 250X in both ventral horn areas from six L3-L5 tissue sections of the spinal cord of each mouse. All SMI-32 immunoreactive neurons were counted from within the ventral horn below a lateral line across the spinal cord from the central canal. Correction for tissue section thickness was made in all specimens.</p><p>For stereological analysis, 10 serial coronal sections (12&#x003bc;m thick) were cut 350&#x003bc;m apart through the lumbar (L3 to L5) spinal cord of each animal (WT controls; n=6).</p></sec><sec><title>Semiquantitative Vgf quantification in spinal cord motorneurons</title><p>The immunostaining densities were digitized with a high-resolution fluorescence charge-coupled-&#x000ad;device camera (Sony, Tokyo, Japan) and semi-quantified using Bioquant computer-assisted densitometry (Biometrics, Nashville, TN). Fluorescence camera aperture and focus were adjusted to provide an optimal image. The overall illumination was also adjusted so that the distribution of relative values fell within the limits of the system avoiding a floor or ceiling effect. Once established, the setting remained constant for all the images acquired for all the ICC experiments. Therefore, when all the parameters were fixed, only tissue staining intensities influenced the measured values. Average value density measurements from individual Vgf immunoreactive dorsal spinal cord neurons, reflecting immunostaining intensity, were made on digitized images by delimiting the cellular area of interest free hand, using predetermined criteria to define the region of interest. The immune intensity of the cellular Vgf encompassing the L3-L5 regions of spinal cord were semi-quantified from approximately 6 to 8 frames per spinal cord tissue section<strike>s</strike>; about 3 to 10 neurons per frame were randomly quantified. The technician who performed these measurements had no knowledge of the study groups. To normalize any unevenness in lighting across the field of view; background values were determined over the white matter area of each individual tissue section and automatically subtracted from the values over unstained spinal cord motorneurons. The optical density of cellular Vgf immunostaining in spinal cord dorsal neurons was expressed using arbitrary units.</p></sec><sec><title>Mouse Vgf radio immuno assay (RIA)</title><p>C-terminal specific Vgf antibody (ab5901) was used in RIA analysis as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref> to detect full-length Vgf and processed Vgf peptides containing the C-terminus. AQEE30 peptide was radiolabelled with I<sup>125</sup> at ~2000 Ci/mmol specificity by GE-Healthcare (Woburn, MA). Briefly, samples or standard AQEE30 peptide, from 30-3000 fmol, were incubated with anti-Vgf (AQEE30) antibody (1:3000 dilution) in 200 &#x000b5;l RIA buffer (50mM Tris-Cl, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% Triton-X100, 0.1% Gelatin, 0.02% Sodium Azide) at 4&#x000b0;C overnight.

Thus a mechanism by which abnormal energy metabolism may have an influence on clinical ALS is through depletion of Vgf neuroprotection against spinal cord motorneuron excitotoxic injury.</p><p>Collectively our study suggests that reduced Vgf content in the serum, in the CSF, and in spinal cord motorneurons may be a biological diagnostic index for ALS. It remains to be directly tested whether restoring Vgf expression in spinal cord motor neurons therapeutically rescues the ALS phenotype.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Supported by ALS grant from the
