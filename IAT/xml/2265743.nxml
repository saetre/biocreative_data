We have previously reported that zinc treatment induces prostate malignant cell apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway. Metallothionein (MT) is a major receptor/donor of zinc in the cells. However, the studies on the expression of MT in association with the prostate pathological and malignant status are very limited, and the zinc regulation of MT isoform expression in prostate cells remains elusive. The goals of this study were to define the expression of endogenous MTs, the isoforms of MT 1, 2, 3 at both messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein levels; and to investigate the zinc effect on MT expression in normal prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and malignant PC-3 cells, and in relevant human tissues. Cellular MT proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence staining and Western blot analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine the MT isoform-specific mRNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our results demonstrated a significant suppression of endogenous levels of MT1/2 in malignant PC-3 cells (95% reduction compared to the normal prostate cells) and in human adenocarcinoma tissues (73% MT1/2 negative). A moderate reduction of MT1/2 expression was observed in BPH. Zinc treatment remarkably induced MT1/2 expression in PC-3 and BPH cells, which was accordant with the restored cellular zinc level. MT 3, as a growth inhibitory factor, was detected and up-regulated by zinc mainly in BPH cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provided evidence of the association of attenuated MT1/2 with prostate tumor progression, and the zinc induction of MT1/2 expression resulting in cellular zinc restoration. The results suggest the potential of MT1/2 as a candidate biomarker for prostate cancer and the utilization of zinc in prostate cancer prevention and treatment.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Zinc is an essential element involved in many cellular functions and is required by approximately 300 enzymes for their biological activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In humans, deficiency of zinc might inhibit growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], but it is also closely related to increased risk of certain malignant tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Normal prostate contains the highest zinc level, but a dramatic decrease of cellular zinc (60&#x02013;70% loss) was found in malignant prostate cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We have demonstrated that zinc exposure induces apoptosis in malignant prostate PC-3 and benign hyperplasia prostate (BPH) cells, but not in normal prostate HPR-1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Despite few studies on the relationship of zinc accumulation and zinc-induced prostatic cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], the mechanisms of the disturbance of zinc homeostasis and zinc restoration in relation to pathogenesis and malignancy of prostate tissues remain unclear.</p><p>Cellular zinc homeostasis is modulated by many factors such as zinc transporters (ZnTs and ZIPs) and metallothioneins (MTs), which are involved in the aspects of zinc transport, trafficking, and signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Among these factors, MTs are of low molecular weight (~6 kd); molecules and the cysteine-rich motifs in &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; domain are responsible for their zinc-binding property, hence, the Zn-MT-thionein conjugated pair functions as a receptor/donor for other zinc-related proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. MTs are ubiquitously expressed in most cells and tissues and play important roles in many biological processes such as metal ion homeostasis and detoxification, protection of cells from the damage caused by oxidative stress, cell proliferation and apoptosis, and in some aspects of the carcinogenic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>MT genes belong to a super family with characteristics common to equine MT, first isolated half a century ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Since then, four isoforms (MTs 1, 2, 3, and 4) were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]; among them, MTs 1 and 2 are the major isoforms expressed in most adult mammalian tissues. MT 3 was originally found exclusively in the normal human brain as growth inhibitor factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and lately, the expression of MT 3 was further identified in kidney, breast, pancreas, intestine, bladder, and prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. MT 4 expression was reported in the stratified squamous epithelium and has an important role in cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The zinc regulation of MT gene transcription was through metal response elements (MREs), which are present in multiple copies within the proximal promoters of MT genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. MREs seem to be MT isoform-dependant and cell-type specific. In prostate cells, high concentration of zinc (100 &#x003bc;M)-induced MT1/2 expression was studied in malignant PC-3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, the information regarding zinc regulation of MT1/2 in normal and BPH cells is very limited, whereas contradictory observations of this in human prostate tissues were reported. In addition to MT1/2, several MREs on the promoter region of MT 3 gene were also identified; however, the effect of zinc on MT 3 expression has not been clarified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To date, questions of whether MT 3 is expressed in human prostate and whether such expression is regulated by zinc associated with its growth-inhibitory role remain unclear and need to be studied.</p><p>In addition to the previous findings from different investigations, this study for the first time provided new evidence on zinc regulation of MT gene expression and elucidated the relationship between the gene expression and the cellular zinc homeostasis in relation to the pathogenesis status of the prostate tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Differential expression of endogenous MT1/2 in normal, benign hyperplasia, and malignant prostate cells correlates to the cellular zinc levels</title><p>To ascertain the relationship between zinc homeostasis and MT1/2 gene expression in prostate tumorigenesis, the cellular zinc accumulation and the endogenous MT1/2 protein levels were detected in normal HPR-1, BPH, and malignant PC-3 cells. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, higher endogenous cellular zinc was found in HPR-1 cells followed by BPH, and the lowest zinc level was detected in PC-3 cells. After the zinc treatment, a significant gaining of the cellular zinc was observed in both BPH and PC-3 cells with 1.7-fold and 3.3-fold increase, respectively. In contrast, the zinc level in HPR-1 cells was modestly enhanced (&#x0003c;0.6-fold). The cellular endogenous MT1/2 proteins in three cell lines were further evaluated by Western blot analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The results showed that the highest endogenous level of MT1/2 was detected in HPR-1 cells, while PC-3 cells appeared to have the lowest endogenous MT1/2, only about 5% of that found in HPR-1. The MT1/2 in BPH cells was higher than in PC-3 cells, but still much less, about 25% of the amount found in HPR-1 cells. Apparently, MT1/2 in HPR-1 and BPH is significantly higher than in PC-3 cells; however, no significant difference of MT 1/2 between BPH and PC-3 cells was detected.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cellular zinc accumulation in human prostate cells</bold>.

A strong fluorescence intensity of MT1/2 signals was identified in HPR-1 cells, while a much weaker immunoreactivity was observed in BPH and PC-3 cells. From the data of IFS it was further evident that MT1/2 expression displayed a cell-type specific pattern in the prostate cells. Although the cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of MT1/2 was observed in all three cell lines, a higher ratio of nuclear MT1/2 versus cytoplasmic distribution appeared only in HPR-1 cells. The specificity of the MT1/2 signals was confirmed in the negative controls in which only the secondary antibody was applied (top panels of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Immunofluorescence detection of MT1/2 in HPR-1, BPH, and PC-3 cells</bold>.

The background of non-specific staining was monitored using the red FLURO-conjugated secondary antibody only indicated as the control (top row), in which the cells were also stained with Hoechost 33258 shown the blue-stained nuclei to remark the cells. The differential immunoreactivities of the cells to MT1/2 antibody were determined by the intensity of red fluorescence between the cell lines (middle row). The images with both MT1/2 and Hoechost nuclear staining (bottom row) were the attempts to detect the cellular distribution of MT1/2.

To extend this important relationship, the effect of zinc on the induction of MT1/2 was investigated and a time-course study of zinc-induced MT1/2 was conducted with three cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The results of Western blot analyses revealed that zinc exposure (1 &#x003bc;g/ml) of BPH and PC-3 cells resulted in a significant increase in the MT1/2 determined early, at 6 h, by about 2.8-fold and 4-fold compared to the controls, respectively. This distinct induction effect of zinc on MT1/2 was continuously observed up to 24 h in both BPH and PC-3 cells. In contrast, in HPR-1 cells only a slight increase of MT1/2 expression, with no significant difference to the controls, was detected after 12 h of zinc treatment. The results demonstrated a dynamic association of cellular zinc and MT1/2 expression with a cell-type specific property in prostate cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Regulation of MT1/2 protein expression in HPR-1 BPH, and PC-3 cells</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

In order to further determine whether zinc regulated MT 3 gene expression, a time-course study of zinc effect on MT 3 gene transcription was conducted by using RT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The results showed that among three cell lines, the highest endogenous level of MT 3 mRNA was identified in BPH cells while a remarkably lower level, about 25% of that in BPH cells, was detected in PC-3 cells; and there was only a marginally detectable amount found in HPR-1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Most interestingly, zinc treatment significantly increased MT 3 mRNA in BPH (2-fold) and PC-3 (3-fold) cells at late time points, at 6 h and 3&#x02013;6 h, respectively; however, no zinc induction of MT 3 mRNA was found in HPR-1 cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Detection of zinc regulation of MT3 gene expression in HPR-1, BPH, and PC-3 cells by RT-PCR</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

In contrast to the MT 3 mRNA levels obtained from RT-PCR assays, the MT 3 protein was neither detectable in PC-3 nor in HPR-1 cells. Next, we conducted a time-course study of zinc (15 &#x003bc;M) effect on MT 3 in BPH cells by Western blot analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).

The specificity of MT1/2 signals identified by IHC staining was determined by using the negative controls in which only secondary antibody was applied resulting in no MT1/2 immunoreactive signals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). The results showed that various immunoreactivities for MT1/2 were detected in differential prostate tissues, and the immunoreactivity was mostly confined to the epithelial cells of prostatic glands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In contrast, the stroma cells showed negative-to-weak immunoreactivity for MT1/2, and the connective tissues appeared to have no reaction to the MT1/2 antibody. In normal prostate tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C &#x00026; D</xref>), the distinct higher intensity of immunostaining was observed in the nuclei, while the cytoplasm showed an evenly distributed staining in almost all glandular epithelial cells. The results showed that in BPH tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8F</xref>) a patchy MT1/2 staining of epithelial cells was observed, that is, lacking uniformity of immunoreactivities resulting in uneven immunostaining intensity among the cells. In general, the majority of the epithelial cells in BPH tissue remained immunoreactive to MT1/2, while in some cells a stronger reaction had occurred than in other cells. A significant reduction of the immunostaining intensity was observed in the malignant adenocarcinomatous glands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8G</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8H</xref>). Only a few malignant cells appeared to have had the immunoreaction for MT1/2, whereas the nuclei and cytoplasm showed a negative reaction to MT1/2 in most of the malignant cells.

The disturbance of zinc homeostasis in prostate would significantly impair the cellular metabolism and growth as discussed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Now, a critical issue could be raised: Does the low level of cellular zinc lead responsively to a suppressed endogenous MT level or does the down-regulated MT expression result in a significant depletion of cellular zinc underlying the tumorigenesis of prostate tissues. Most recently, an important study on the mechanism of MT gene regulation by metal response element-binding transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) was reported by Dr. R. Tjian's group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In this study, the robust response of the MT genes to metal was used as a model; MTF-1, a core facilitating factor, and two central regulatory factors, transcription factor II D (TFIID) and mediator (MED), were identified as major players in modulating the transcriptional response of MT to metal. The MTF-1 recruits TFIID, which then binds MT promoter DNA and subsequently activates transcription upon recruitment of the MED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The appropriate expression of the endogenous MT genes is achieved only when these coactivators are balanced. Intriguingly, they found that the MTF-1 requires different coactivator subunits depending on the context of the core promoter (the stability of the multi-subunit coactivator complexes can be compromised by loss of a single subunit), leading to the potential control of fine-tune transcriptional regulation. We observed that the endogenous level of MT in the prostate cells is cell-type specific and that the oncological trend of the endogenous MT may be closely related to MTF-1-involved MT gene regulation.</p><p>The alteration of MT1/2 gene expression was not only found in human prostate, but was also discovered in primary human hepatocellular carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], in which the suppression of MT1/2 gene expression is mediated through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway by the inactivation of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein &#x003b1; (C/EBP&#x003b1;). On the other hand, MTF-1 interacted with C/EBP&#x003b1; as a complex and subsequently activated MT1/2 gene expression. An early study also indicated that in prostate cancer cell lines the MT1 promoter activity was suppressed by promoter methylation of cytosine within the CpG dinucleotide region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Besides the MT promoter methylation, the possibility of dysfunctional interaction of MTF-1 with nuclear factor I (NFI) was also seriously considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These findings highlight insights for future investigations for the regulation of MT gene expression in association with the prostate zinc homeostasis and tumorigenesis.</p><p>MTs, as zinc donors/receptors, play a key role for zinc-related proteins and enzymes, which are involved in many crucial cellular functions including cell metabolism, signaling transduction pathways, and nuclear gene transcriptional regulation. Concordantly with the functions, the extensive cellular distribution of MT1/2 was observed in normal prostate HPR-1 cells with the intensity of immunofluorescence staining in the cytosol and even stronger signals in the nuclei (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). However, a substantive decrease of MT1/2 intensity was displayed in both BPH and PC-3 cells, which confirmed the result of the Western blot analysis. In extension of previous observations of high IHC staining in the nuclei of BPH cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], we found that normal HPR-1 cells exhibit much more aggregation of MT1/2 in nuclei, than BPH and PC-3 cells do. This suggests that the suppression of MT expression and the alteration of MT distribution in BPH and PC-3 cells may negatively influence the cellular function.</p><p>The results of the suppressed MT1/2 expression in prostate malignant cells led us to further investigate MT1/2 expression in human prostatic tissues including the normal, BPH, and adenocarcinomas. At the present time, only few studies provided limited information of MT1/2 expression in human prostate tissues. Among these data, the correlation of the positive IHC staining of MT1/2 and the adenocarcinoma status was variable ranging from 33% (15/45) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], 67% (20/30) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] to 100% (5/5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]; while some reports indicated that the Gleason grades of the tumor tissue scoring from low to high reversely corresponded to the intensity of MT1/2 IHC staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>In this study, normal and BPH tissues give images of intensive and/or patchy MT1/2 IHC staining, which are consistent with some previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Moreover, we determined the negative and/or weak MT1/2 IHC staining in the majority of adenocarcinomatous cells (72%), which is in agreement with one of most recent reports (67%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], while other studies showed higher staining signals of MT1/2 in prostate malignant tissues, 33% and 0%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The discrepancy of the IHC staining data may result from the differential MT1/2 antibodies and the variable staining methods. Apparently, examining more prostate malignant tissues with a standard IHC method will provide significant information of MT1/2 expression, which could be considered as the candidate gene used for early diagnosis and gene therapy for prevention and targeting of prostate caner.</p><p>In addition to MT1/2, we have also determined, for the first time, the zinc regulation of MT 3 expression at both transcriptional and translational levels in three prostate cell models. Although the MT 3 was initially thought to be a neuron-specific MT isoform possessing a neuronal cell growth inhibitory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], in recent years the demonstration of a wider, non-neural distribution of human MT 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] motivated a study of MT 3 in prostate, in which a variable nature of MT 3 expression was detected in prostate tissues and cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Contrary to expectations based on the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], we found that among three cell models, only BPH cells profoundly express the highest endogenous level of MT 3, which was also significantly up-regulated by zinc at both mRNA and protein levels (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Also, neither normal HPR-1 nor malignant PC-3 cells seem to express essential amounts of MT 3 or to respond to zinc induction of the MT 3, thereby suggesting a cell-type specific nature of the MT 3 gene expression and regulation. The characteristic inhibitory effect of MT 3 on cell growth was discriminated by promoting cell necrosis from cell apoptosis in human proximal tubule cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that zinc inhibits prostate BPH and PC-3 cells growth mainly by cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Now with the recognition of the zinc effect on MT 3 in BPH cells, it is possible that the role of MT 3 as a growth inhibitory factor may also involve in zinc-induced cell death in BPH cells.</p><p>Using human prostate cell models, we demonstrated that zinc treatment, at least in <italic>in vitro </italic>cell culture system, can restore the cellular zinc especially in the malignant cells, in which the endogenous zinc was depleted possibly due to the down-regulated MT expression through the MTF-1 involved mechanism. In turn, the restored zinc subsequently enhances MT gene expression significantly to secure the physiological and/or pharmacological level of zinc which will be recruited quickly by the proteins and enzymes to resume their bioactivities and eventually to control cell proliferation and/or death. Hence, zinc supplement may serve as a potential approach to modulate the molecular environment in prostate BPH and malignant cells aiming to enhance their responses to other chemotherapeutical treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides important new information on zinc regulation of MT, isoforms 1, 2 and 3, expression in human prostate cells and tissues. Evidently, MT1/2 expression is significantly down-regulated in BPH, PC-3 cells, and human prostate malignant tissues; and MT 3 expression is a specific characteristic of BPH cells. Zinc restoration leads to re-establishing cellular homeostasis of zinc through up-regulation of MT gene expression, which may eventually result in resuming the critical selection for proliferation or death of the cells. The results suggest MT as a candidate tumor marker for diagnosis, prognosis and management guidance; and warrant further investigation of zinc as a potential supplement to benefit the BPH and prostate cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Human prostate cell lines and zinc treatment</title><p>Three human prostatic cell lines were used in this study: (a) HPR-1, a cell line derived from normal human prostate epithelial cells (kindly provided by Dr. C.

HPR-1 cells were cultured in keratinocyte medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) (2.5 mg/500 ml) and bovine pituitary extracts (25 mg/500 ml) (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies, Bethesda, MD). BPH and PC-3 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 5% and 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS), respectively. All mediums were supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (1 U/ml, Invitrogen), and the cells were maintained at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Examination of hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) stained sections revealed adenocarcinomas in 18 cases, normal prostatic glands in 5 cases, and all cases (n = 23) harbored BPH glands. The slides were coded without identification related to the patients. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was carried out with rabbit anti-human/rat MT1/2 antibody (1:125 dilution) in a Dako cytomation autostainer with a standard protocol for IHC. Briefly, the samples of prostate were deparaffinized with heating and xylene incubation. Antigen retrieval was done by heating in ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), PH 9.0 buffer (Lab vision, Fremomt, CA) at 99.3&#x000b0;C for 20 min, incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide, blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 5 min, incubated with MT1/2 antibody at room temperature for 30 min, followed by incubation with Horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody in a dilution of 1:200 for 30 min. Color was developed by incubating samples with diaminobenzidine (DAB)+chromogin for 10 min followed by Dako DAB enhancer for 5 min. Hematoxylin was used as counter stain. The specific staining of MT1/2 in the sections was examined using BX 50 Olympus microscope and the photographs were taken with attached Olympus DP 70 camera operated with DP Controller 2.1.1.183 software (Olympus Corporation).
