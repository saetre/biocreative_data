Most xenobiotic compounds require an enzymatic activation to form a carcinogen or toxicant. The reactive intermediates resulting form enzymatic drug metabolism are often unstable and therefore are unlikely to be transported from the liver to other tissues to exert toxicity. Therefore, the chemical toxicity found in extrahepatic tissue often results from cellular metabolic activities in the organ. However, knowledge on the variability and regulation of expression of drug metabolizing enzymes in the human gastrointestinal tract and particularly the large intestine is poor in comparison with the "classical" drug metabolizing organs (e.g. liver).</p><p>Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a multi-gene superfamily of heme-containing enzymes catalyzing the oxidative metabolism of many compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. CYP families 1, 2, and 3, which are the main CYP families participating in the metabolism of xenobiotics, are highly expressed within the liver, but are also expressed in extrahepatic tissues (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Members of the CYP families 2 and 3, and herein especially CYP2C and CYP3A4, are present in relative high concentrations in small intestinal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and it has been suggested that they facilitate a barrier function to protects the small intestine from toxic xenobiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been shown that total CYP content increases slightly in the progression from duodenum to jejunum and subsequently decreases significantly in the ileum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Despite the fact that it has been suggested that the absence of some of these microsomal enzymes in the colon may be involved in the comparably high incidence of carcinoma in this organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], information available on the expression of CYPs in the large intestine of humans is limited and some of the available data are contradictory. Therefore, the main purpose of the present study was to evaluate the expression pattern, protein concentration, and distribution of four representative CYPs (CYP2C, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5) in ascending, descending and sigmoid human colon mucosa of virtually healthy subjects. Furthermore, protein levels were related to mRNA expression pattern.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Association Stuttgart, Germany. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects included in the study. During routinely performed coloscopies, two biopsy specimens (each 5&#x02013;10 mg) of normal colon mucosa were obtained from either ascending (n = 10), descending (n = 7), or sigmoid (n = 24) colon of a total of 41 volunteers (age 30 &#x02013; 80). None of the subjects displayed any macroscopic evidence of colonic neoplasia or other disease in colon. All patients completed a questionnaire concerning factors that may influence the expression of cytochrome P450 such as medication, smoking, and alcohol consumption (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Neither anthropometrics nor lifestyle and drug intake differed significantly between donors of biopsy specimens of ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon. Furthermore, no significant correlation was observed between these parameters and the protein levels as well as mRNA expression patterns of CYPs investigated. Subjects and controls did not consume drugs known to interfere with or to induce CYPs investigated in this study.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Anthropometic and life style data of subjects.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>Parameter</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Ascending Colon</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Descending Colon</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Sigmoid Colon</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>n</bold></td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">24</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Age</bold></td><td align="center">52 &#x000b1; 9</td><td align="center">54 &#x000b1; 15</td><td align="center">55 &#x000b1; 9</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Sex : Female/male</bold></td><td align="center">5/5</td><td align="center">1/6</td><td align="center">8/16</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>BMI</bold></td><td align="center">26.5 &#x000b1; 5.7</td><td align="center">27.8 &#x000b1; 4.9</td><td align="center">25.4 &#x000b1; 4.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4"><bold>Cigarette use</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Yes/No</bold></td><td align="center">3/7</td><td align="center">3/4</td><td align="center">4/20</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>(number/d)</bold></td><td align="center">2.8 &#x000b1; 6.2</td><td align="center">8.3 &#x000b1; 9.8</td><td align="center">1.5 &#x000b1; 4.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4"><bold>Alcohol consumption</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Yes/No</bold></td><td align="center">3/7</td><td align="center">2/5</td><td align="center">12/12</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>(g/d)</bold></td><td align="center">9.4 &#x000b1; 14.6</td><td align="center">8.2 &#x000b1; 7.8</td><td align="center">9.8 &#x000b1; 12.6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>All data are expressed as means &#x000b1; SD.

In addition, some blots were probed for &#x003b2;-actin (Sigma, Munich, Germany) to ascertain identical protein loading of samples. Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBST, 0.01% v/v Tween 20) and probed with dilutions of primary antibodies in TBS followed by an incubation with the secondary antibody. Anti-CYP2E1 and anti-CYP3A4 antibodies were generous gifts of Dr. M. Ingelman-Sundberg, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden; anti-CYP2C8 and anti-CYP3A5 were purchased from Chemicon, Inc.

Blots were photographed (Camera LAS 1000, Fuji, USA) and densitometric analysis was performed using the software AIDA (Raytest, Isotopenmessgeraete, Straubenhardt, Germany). As positive control and for semiquantification, serial dilutions of microsomes and Supersomes derived from cell lines and clones expressing human CYP2C8, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 (Gentest Corporation, Woburn, MA, USA) respectively were loaded on each gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse transcription and PCR</title><p>The integrity and concentration of RNA was analyzed in a 1.2% agarose gel.

Expression of members of the CYP2C-, CYP2E-, and CYP3A-family in normal mucosa along with substantial interindividual differences in the expression levels of CYPs in the colon has been reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, some of the available data are contradictory and most studies either determined mRNA or protein levels. Furthermore, detailed information on the distribution of CYPs within the colon (e.g. distal vs. proximal colon) is lacking. For example, McKay et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] detected CYP3A protein in two out of 13 morphologically normal colon mucosa specimens of patients with neoplasia in the colon. Similar results were also reported by Mercurio et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and McKinnon et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] for CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 mRNA expression in colon. Using immunohistochemical methods, Yokose et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] reported the presence of CYP2C(8&#x02013;19) in healthy human colon mucosa also finding large interindividual differences. In contrast, Western blot analyses by de Waziers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and Massaad et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] applying conventional immunoperoxidase staining procedure failed to detect the expression of cytochromes P450 2C8-10 and 2E1 protein in human colon mucosa. In the present study, the expression and protein levels of four representative CYPs were determined in different regions of the large intestine. At the levels of mRNA expression CYP2C, CYP2E1, and CYP3A5 concentration was found to be significantly different between the three different regions investigated with CYP2C mRNA expression being significantly higher in proximal regions of the colon than in the distal (e.g. descending and sigmoid colon). In contrast, mRNA expression of CYP2E1 and CYP3A5 was significantly lower in the proximal colon (i.e. ascending) than in the distal part of the organ. However, in accordance with the findings of others, mRNA expression of all four CYPs was found to vary extensively between individuals, even though expression of histone 3.3, which was used as housekeeping gene, was detected in all samples. At the level of protein, CYP2C8 concentration was found to be lower in the descending colon when compared with the more distal sigmoid region of the colon. Contrary, CYP2E1 protein levels were higher in descending colon than in the sigmoid colon. Taken together, these data suggest that CYP expression in colon not only varies among individuals but also among different regions of the organ.</p></sec><sec><title>CYP protein levels and mRNA expression are not related</title><p>Studies of the mRNA and protein expression of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 in rat duodenum and kidney, as well as the expression of CYP2C7 (corresponding to human CYP2C8) and CYP2E1 in rat colon mucosa, revealed a dissociation of mRNA expression and protein levels of CYPs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] Hakkak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] suggested that the expression of CYPs is not solely regulated at the transcriptional level. This is supported by results of <italic>in vitro </italic>investigations in rat hepatocytes, which indicated that protein level of CYP2E1 is regulated by posttranscriptional ligand-dependent stabilization of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Similar mechanisms have been described for rat and human CYP3A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro </italic>studies using cultured hepatocytes showed that only ~60&#x02013;70% of mRNA encoding for CYP2E1 is translated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Indeed, in the present study, no differences with respect to protein levels of subjects with detectable and undetectable mRNA expression of the CYPs were found.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, interindividual variability seems to be a characteristic of CYP expression in colon as has been reported by others before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, in the present study we found significant differences of CYP2C(8), CYP2E1 and CYP3A5 mRNA expression and protein levels between different regions of the colon (e.g. ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon). Metabolic implications of this "zonification" remain to be determined. Nevertheless, differences found in the present study might result in alterations of detoxification of carcinogens or pro-carcinogens and therefore contribute to high susceptibility of this organ to carcinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>IB has made substantial contributions to acquisition of data, the biochemical analysis, and the drafting of article.
