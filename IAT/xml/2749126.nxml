Here we present evidence that hSSB2, a homolog of hSSB1, plays a role similar to hSSB1 in DNA damage-response pathways. This was evidenced by findings that hSSB2-depleted cells resemble hSSB1-depleted cells in hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging reagents, reduced efficiency in HR-dependent repair of DSBs, and defective ATM-dependent phosphorylation. Notably, hSSB1 and hSSB2 form separate complexes with two identical proteins, INTS3 and hSSBIP1 (C9ORF80). Cells depleted of INTS3 and hSSBIP1 also exhibited hypersensitivity to DNA damage reagents, chromosomal instability, and reduced ATM-dependent phosphorylation. hSSBIP1 was rapidly recruited to laser-induced DSBs, a feature also similar to that reported for hSSB1. Depletion of INTS3 decreased the stability of hSSB1 and hSSBIP1, suggesting that INTS3 may provide a scaffold to allow proper assembly of the hSSB complexes. Thus, our data demonstrate that hSSB1 and hSSB2 form two separate complexes with similar structures, and both are required for efficient HR-dependent repair of DSBs and ATM-dependent signaling pathways.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS100">National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="CS100">Z01: AG000657&#x02013;09</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">CA123232</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">CA129537</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold (OB-fold)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> is a single strand DNA or RNA binding domain that has been found in proteins from all species. Proteins containing this domain play essential roles in diverse cellular processes on DNA, including replication, transcription, recombination, repair, telomere maintenance, and DNA damage-activated checkpoint pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). OB-fold domains can also mediate protein-protein interactions such that proteins containing these domains often associate with each other to form multi-OB-fold complexes. Examples of such complexes include replication protein A (RPA), TPP1-POT1, Cdc13-Stn1-Ten1, and RecQ-mediated genome instability (RMI) complex that consists of RMI1 and RMI2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). OB-fold-containing proteins can also associate with other DNA-processing enzymes to form complexes that coordinately remodel DNA structures generated during replication and/or repair. One example is the Bloom syndrome protein complex, which consists of BLM helicase, topoisomerase 3a, as well as two OB-fold complexes, RPA and RMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). RPA can stimulate the DNA unwinding activity of BLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), whereas RMI can promote double Holliday dissolution, a reaction that requires coordinated action by both BLM and Topo 3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>hSSB1 and hSSB2 are closely related human OB-fold proteins that are highly conserved during evolution. hSSB1 has been shown to be a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that plays essential roles in protecting genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Cells depleted of hSSB1 display increased genomic instability, hypersensitivity to radiation, deficiency in activation of ATM-dependent checkpoint pathway following DNA damage, and reduced efficiency in homologous recombination (HR)-dependent repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). The exact mechanism of how hSSB1 protects genome stability remains unclear. The available evidence suggests that it has at least two roles. It may directly participate in HR-dependent repair of DSBs by stimulating activity of RAD51 recombinase and/or by recruiting RAD51 to the DNA damage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In addition, it may mediate the ATM-dependent signaling pathway because its depletion results in defective phosphorylation of several ATM substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Our group has previously identified RMI as an essential component of the BLM complex and shown that, like BLM, it plays a crucial role for BLM to maintain genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). During bioinformatic analyses of OB-fold domains of RMI, we noticed that they share a certain degree of similarity to the OB-fold domain of hSSB2. We therefore hypothesized that hSSB2, and perhaps hSSB1, may also be present in multiprotein complexes that participate in DNA damage response. Here we show that hSSB1 and hSSB2 are indeed present in two separate complexes with identical components, one of which is a novel protein, and both complexes participate in the DNA damage response.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Cell Cultures, Antibodies, and siRNAs</title><p>HeLa, HEK293, and U2OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed a HEK293 cell line stably expressing FLAG-tagged hSSB2 and immunoprecipitated hSSB2-associated complex with a FLAG antibody. To distinguish hSSB2 complex components from contaminating polypeptides, we also performed a mock IP from regular HEK293 cells that do not express tagged hSSB2. SDS-PAGE and silver staining analyses revealed the presence of three specific major polypeptides in the FLAG-hSSB2 IP, with apparent molecular masses of about 115, 25, and 10 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>, compare <italic>lane 3</italic> with <italic>lane 2</italic>). By mass spectrometry, the 25-kDa polypeptide was identified as hSSB2.

Silver staining revealed the presence of about 10 major polypeptides, three of which displayed molecular weights similar to components immunoprecipitated by the FLAG antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). These three polypeptides were found to be hSSB2, INTS3, and hSSBIP1 by both mass spectrometry (data not shown) and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>, <italic>lanes 13&#x02013;15</italic>).

The findings that hSSB2, INTS3, and hSSBIP1 can be co-immunoprecipitated by multiple antibodies provide further evidence that they constitute one complex.</p></sec><sec><title>hSSB1 Forms a Separate Complex with INTS3 and hSSBIP1</title><p>IP-coupled immunoblotting analysis is a biased approach that may not reveal major components of a complex. To avoid the bias, we used silver staining and mass spectrometry to analyze polypeptides immunoprecipitated by the INTS3 antibody. Three major polypeptides of about 115, 33, and 10 kDa were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>). Mass spectrometry identified the 115- and 10-kDa polypeptides as INTS3 and hSSBIP1, consistent with their association in an hSSB2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>, <italic>lanes 4&#x02013;9</italic>). Interestingly, the 33-kDa polypeptide was identified as hSSB1, indicating that INTS3 and hSSBIP1 form a complex not only with hSSB2 but also with hSSB1. In accord with this notion, immunoblotting showed that polypeptides immunoprecipitated by INTS3 or hSSBIP1 antibody contained not only hSSB2 but also hSSB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>, <italic>lanes 6</italic> and <italic>9</italic>). Moreover, reciprocal IP by hSSB1 antibody yielded both INTS3 and hSSBIP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>, <italic>lanes 10&#x02013;12</italic>). Together, the data indicate that INTS3 and hSSBIP1 associate with both hSSB1 and hSSB2.</p><p>To distinguish whether hSSB1 and hSSB2 are present in a single complex or two separate complexes with INTS3 and hSSBIP1, we performed IP-Western analyses and found that hSSB1 and hSSB2 are mutually excluded from one another's immunoprecipitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>, <italic>lane 12</italic> and <italic>15</italic>). The data indicate that hSSB1 and hSSB2 form two separate complexes, each of which contains INTS3 and hSSBIP1. Notably, although both hSSB1 and hSSB2 were detected in the INTS3 immunoprecipitate by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>, <italic>lane 6</italic>), only hSSB1 (about 35 kDa), but not hSSB2 (about 25 kDa), was observed as an abundant polypeptide by the silver staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>). The data suggest that hSSB1 is more abundant than hSSB2 so that the majority of INTS3 in the extract is present in the hSSB1 complex. This interpretation is consistent with the data that the stability of INTS3 is strongly dependent on the presence of hSSB1 but not hSSB2 (see below).</p><p>We fractionated the HeLa nuclear extracts by Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography and found that both hSSB1 and hSSB2 co-fractionated with INTS3 and hSSBIP1, with the peak of each protein near fraction 36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>E</italic>). The data are consistent with the notion that the two hSSB proteins form two separate complexes of the same size with INTS3 and hSSBIP1. Fraction 36 corresponds to a globular complex of about 500 kDa, which is much larger than the sum of the calculated molecular mass of hSSB, INTS3, and hSSBIP1 (about 150 kDa). The results imply that the hSSB complex may contain more than one copy of each subunit or may not be globular. Notably, both hSSB1 and hSSB2 fractionated in an additional peak corresponding to complexes of about 150 and 100 kDa, respectively. These molecular masses are about four times the calculated mass of each protein, hinting that hSSB may form homotetramers. This notion is supported by previous findings that bacterial SSB exists as homotetramers. A portion of INTS3 (about 30% or less) also fractionated in an additional peak (faction 26) corresponding to a complex of about 1 MDa, which could be derived from the integrator complex reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>INTS3 and hSSB1 Are Essential for Stability of the hSSB1 Complex</title><p>The stability of a component of multiprotein complexes often depends on the presence of the other components so that when one protein is depleted, the others become unstable and show reduced cellular levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Usually, components with direct interactions show the strongest interdependence for their stability, perhaps because their proper folding requires interacting partners. We depleted various components of hSSB1 and hSSB2 complexes and examined their interdependence for protein stability. When INTS3 was depleted in NFF cells, the levels of both hSSB1 and hSSBIP1 were reduced about 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>F</italic>, <italic>lane 2</italic>, and <italic>G</italic>). Similarly, when hSSB1 was depleted, the levels of INTS3 and hSSBIP1 were also reduced about 50 and 30%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>F</italic>, <italic>lane 4</italic>, and <italic>G</italic>). These data are consistent with the notion that these three proteins are components of one complex and that stability of this complex strongly depends on INTS3 and hSSB1. The depletion of hSSBIP1 reduced the level of INTS3 by about 30% but did not significantly affect the level of hSSB1. It was noted that hSSBIP1 siRNA had poor depletion efficiency when compared with INTS3 siRNA as they depleted their targets by 70 and 90%, respectively. It is possible that the different effects of INTS3 and hSSBIP1 siRNAs may be partially attributed to their differential depletion efficiency.</p><p>Although INTS3 depletion strongly reduced the level of hSSB1, it did not significantly affect the level of hSSB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>F</italic>, <italic>lane 2</italic>, and <italic>G</italic>). Likewise, deletion of hSSB2 had no significant effect on the levels of INTS3 and hSSBIP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>F</italic>, <italic>lane 3</italic>, and <italic>G</italic>). The data are consistent with the INTS3 immunoprecipitation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>), and we infer that the majority of INTS3 and hSSBIP1 that form hSSB complexes are in the complex with hSSB1 but not hSSB2. This may help to explain the observation that the hSSB2 level was only marginally affected by INST3 knockdown because such knockdown will generate misfolded hSSB1 in larger amounts than hSSB2 so that the former will be more easily recognized and degraded than the latter when they compete for the limited capacity of cellular protein degradation machinery. We noticed that INTS3 knockdown reduced levels of both hSSB1 and hSSB2 in two cancer cell lines, U2OS and HeLa (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/C109.039586/DC1">supplemental Fig. 1</ext-link>).

This recruitment occurs rapidly within 30 min of IR.

This type of damage should generate DSBs as &#x003b3;H2AX was recruited to the site with 5 min of laser treatment (data not shown). The recruitment of hSSBIP1 was also rapid, within 15 min of laser treatment. Together with the published data on hSSB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), these findings suggest that whole hSSB complexes may rapidly relocate to DSBs, where they participated in repair and signaling reactions.

A previous study has shown that one highly conserved OB-fold protein, hSSB1, participates in HR-dependent repair of DSBs and ATM-mediated signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Here we show that hSSB1 and its homolog, hSSB2, form separate complexes with two identical proteins, INTS3 and hSSBIP1 (C9ORF80). The fact that hSSB1 and hSSB2 are homologous and associate with identical partners implies that their respective complexes likely have similar structures and functions. Indeed, we showed that hSSB2-depleted cells resemble hSSB1-depleted cells in several phenotypes, including hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging reagents, reduced efficiency in HR-dependent repair of DSBs, and defective ATM-dependent phosphorylation pathway in response to IR, suggesting that the two SSB proteins may have non-overlapping functions in DNA damage response. Moreover, hSSBIP1 was rapidly recruited to DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>E</italic>), similar to previous findings for hSSB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Furthermore, cells depleted of INTS3 or hSSBIP1 showed increased chromosomal aberrations in the absence or presence of IR, similar to those depleted of hSSB1 and hSSB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> Our data suggest that the two hSSB complexes may employ similar mechanisms in mediating repair of DSBs and ATM-dependent damage-response pathways.</p><p>Although hSSB1 and hSSB2 are homologous and form complexes with the same partners, the two proteins appear to have some interesting differences. First, hSSB1 complex may be more abundant than the hSSB2 complex, based on the silver staining data that hSSB1, but not hSSB2, is one of the major polypeptides co-immunoprecipitating with INTS3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>) and that the stability of INTS3 also strongly depends on hSSB1, but not hSSB2. Second, the hSSB1 complex may be more important than the hSSB2 complex in mediating ATM-dependent signaling events as cells depleted of hSSB1 have a stronger reduction in ATM-dependent phosphorylation for several substrates than do those depleted of hSSB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic>). The data suggest that the two hSSB complexes also have overlapping functions in DNA damage response.</p><p>How may INTS3 and hSSBIP1 facilitate the functions of hSSB proteins? Bioinformatic analyses failed to reveal domains of known function within these proteins. INTS3 has previously been identified as a component of an integrator complex that interacts with the C terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, but its exact role in the integrator complex remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Cells depleted of INTS3 or hSSBIP1 display hypersensitivity to DNA damage reagents, increased genomic instability, and a modest reduction in ATM-mediated phosphorylation, suggesting that both proteins may play a role in DNA repair and signaling within the hSSB complexes. One possible role for INTS3 may be to serve as a scaffold protein to allow assembly of hSSB complexes. INTS3 (about 115 kDa) is considerably larger than hSSB (about 30 kDa) and hSSBIP1 (about 10 kDa), consistent with such a role. Also, INTS3 strongly decreased the stability of the other two partners, whereas depletion of either hSSB1 or hSSBIP1 only led to a modest effect on the stability of each other. Thus, INTS3 may interact with both hSSB1 and hSSBIP1 to assist their proper folding and assembly into the complex. The effect of INTS3 depletion on DNA repair and ATM signaling could then be indirect, through destabilization of hSSB1 and hSSB2. Alternatively, INTS3 may possess an as yet unidentified activity in binding DNA or other proteins.</p><p>Unlike INTS3, whose depletion strongly reduced the levels of hSSB1 and hSSBIP1 (about 60% each), depletion of hSSBIP1 did not significantly affect the level of hSSB1 and only modestly reduced levels of INTS3 (30%). Nevertheless, cells depleted of hSSBIP1 show sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents indistinguishable from that of cells depleted of INTS3. The role of hSSBIP1 may thus be not simply through stabilization of other components of the complex. It remains to be determined whether INTS3 and hSSBIP1 interact with DNA and other proteins.</p><p>The intrinsic potential of <italic>INTS3</italic> interactions is emphasized by findings that it is one of the genes frequently amplified in hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>INTS3</italic> might alter the normal DNA damage-response pathway, contributing to cancer development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Data</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_284_35_23525__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="supp_C109.039586_jbc.C109.039586-1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supported-by"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health Grant Z01: AG000657&#x02013;09 from the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging and National Institutes of Health Grants CA123232 and CA129537 (to T.
