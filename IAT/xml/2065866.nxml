Brd2 contains two tandem bromodomains (BD1 and BD2, 46% sequence identity) in the N-terminus and a conserved motif named ET (extra C-terminal) domain at the C-terminus that is also present in some other bromodomain proteins. The two bromodomains have been shown to bind the acetylated histone H4 and to be responsible for mitotic retention on chromosomes, which is probably a distinctive feature of BET family proteins. Although the crystal structure of Brd2 BD1 is reported, no structure features have been characterized for Brd2 BD2 and its interaction with acetylated histones.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we report the solution structure of human Brd2 BD2 determined by NMR. Although the overall fold resembles the bromodomains from other proteins, significant differences can be found in loop regions, especially in the ZA loop in which a two amino acids insertion is involved in an uncommon <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>-helix, termed <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>D. The helix <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>D forms a portion of the acetyl-lysine binding site, which could be a structural characteristic of Brd2 BD2 and other BET bromodomains. Unlike Brd2 BD1, BD2 is monomeric in solution. With NMR perturbation studies, we have mapped the H4-AcK12 peptide binding interface on Brd2 BD2 and shown that the binding was with low affinity (2.9 mM) and in fast exchange. Using NMR and mutational analysis, we identified several residues important for the Brd2 BD2-H4-AcK12 peptide interaction and probed the potential mechanism for the specific recognition of acetylated histone codes by Brd2 BD2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Brd2 BD2 is monomeric in solution and dynamically interacts with H4-AcK12. The additional secondary elements in the long ZA loop may be a common characteristic of BET bromodomains. Surrounding the ligand-binding cavity, five aspartate residues form a negatively charged collar that serves as a secondary binding site for H4-AcK12. We suggest that Brd2 BD1 and BD2 may possess distinctive roles and cooperate to regulate Brd2 functions. The structure basis of Brd2 BD2 will help to further characterize the functions of Brd2 and its BET members.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Eukaryotic transcription is a highly regulated process. Transcription activation in eukaryotes requires the modification of histones on enhancers and promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Histone acetylation plays a major role in this modification, and forms histone codes in combination with methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. One potential postulate of histone codes is that defined patterns of modification in histones can be recognized by specific factors. Bromodomain, a conserved ~110 amino acid module that is originally identified by sequence alignment as a common motif among <italic>Drosophila </italic>Brahma, female-sterile homeotic (fsh) and four other potential transcription regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], can recognize acetylation of histones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and is thought to participate in deciphering the histone codes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Bromodomain-containing proteins have been classified into several distinct subgroups: (i) histone acetyltransferases (HATs), including GCN5, P/CAF and TAF<sub>II</sub>250; (ii) ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes, including Brahma, Swi2, Snf2 and Brg1; (iii) the less-characterized BET (bromodomain and extra C-terminal domain) family, which is a novel class of transcriptional regulators carrying two tandem bromodomains and an ET domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Retention on chromosomes during mitosis is likely a distinctive feature of the BET family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], because proteins of other bromodomain families are displaced from chromosomes during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. There are four mammalian protein members of BET family: Brd2/Ring3 (also referred to as Fsrg1), ORFX (Fsrg2), Brd4/HUNK1 (Fsrg4), Brdt (Fsrg3).</p><p>Brd2 gene is initially identified as an open reading frame localized to the class II major histocompatibility locus on human chromosome 6p21.3 and is related to the <italic>Drosophila </italic>gene <italic>female sterile homeotic </italic>(<italic>fsh</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The homologous genes in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], frog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], have been reported. Brd2 is a nuclear-localized serine-threonine kinase that has elevated activity in human leukemias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It has been shown to synergistically transactivate cell cycle regulatory genes, including <italic>cyclin D1, cyclin A, cyclin E </italic>and <italic>dihydrofolate reductase </italic>(<italic>dhf</italic>), in combination with Ras or MEKK through E2Fs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. A murine homologue of Brd2 is contained in a mediator transcription complex that involves homologues of the yeast transcriptional regulators Med6, Med7, Rgr1, and Srb7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Later on, Brd2 is reported to associate with a transcription complex containing E2F-1, E2F-2, TBP and chromatin remodeling machines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and to serve as a bridge between E2F-1 and TBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Brd2 is also reported to associate with mediator subunits cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (Cdk8), thyroid receptor-associated protein 220 (TRAP220), and the Pol II large subunit (Pol II ls) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Directed overexpression of Brd2 in mouse lymphocytes is found to develop B-cell lymphoma and leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In addition, Brd2 can interact with latent nuclear antigen (LANA) of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV-8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Taken together, these reports indicate that Brd2 can serve as a transcription regulator and a contributing element in oncogenesis.</p><p>The bromodomains of Brd2 have been shown to selectively bind to histone H4 tails acetylated at Lys12 (AcK12) and to be responsible for mitotic retention on chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The bromodomains are essential for transcriptional activation of important E2F-responsive genes by Brd2 through E2Fs. Bromodomain-deletion derivant of Brd2 has a high level of autophosphorylation activity and exhibites significant E2F-1 phosphorylation <italic>in vitro </italic>compared with wild-type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It is also reported that the association of Brd2 with E2Fs, mediator components and Pol II is dependent on the presence of and is stimulated by acetylated histone H3 and H4 peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The association with E2Fs and specific interaction with acetylated histones both establish anchor points for Brd2-containing transcription complex to <italic>cyclin A </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition, Brd4 (another BET member) also associates with mitotic chromosomes, and tethers viral DNA to host's mitotic chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Brd4 interacts with P-TEFb through its bromodomains and stimulates Pol II-dependent transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Hence the bromodomains and their recognition of specific acetylated histones play important roles in functions of BET family members. Bromodomains of the BET family differ substantially from those of other families in amino acid sequence, despite that they share conserved hydrophobic residues in the hydrophobic core of the domain. Previous studies showed that different bromodomains have different specificities for binding to acetylated histones in living cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, it is yet unknown the structural basis for Brd2 recognizing the specific acetylated histone code. Here, we have determined the solution structure of the second bromodomain (BD2) of Brd2 by NMR and studied its binding properties to acetylated histone H4. Comparing this structure with bromodomains from other proteins, significant differences are found in loop regions; specifically some additional secondary structures exist in Brd2 BD2. Using NMR titration experiments, the conserved hydrophobic cavity that is previously characterized in other bromodomains is found to serve as a binding site for histone H4 acetylated at K12. Through mutational analysis, we detected that the basic residues flanking the acetylated lysine of histone H4 peptides, and some resides in loop regions of Brd2 BD2 are important for their mutual recognition. Our results provide further structural and functional details aimed at revealing how Brd2 and other BET members recognize specific acetylated histone codes and thus impact transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Structure description</title><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> lists the structural statistics for the 20 structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank [PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2G4A">2G4A</ext-link>].

In the long ZA loop between helices <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>Z and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>A, there are three additional short helices: <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-helices <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>Z' (residues 318&#x02013;326) and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>A' (residues 337&#x02013;342), and an uncommon <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>-helix, termed helix <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>D (residue 331&#x02013;335).

In the present work, we have determined the solution structure of the second bromodomain of Brd2, which shares more sequence identity with other BET bromodomains than with bromodomans of other families (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The structure of Brd2 BD2 consists of a previously characterized four-helix left-handed bundle, with additional helices in ZA loop. Compared with other published bromodomain structures, extensive structural variations are found in loop regions (ZA and BC loop); especially, in ZA loop there exists an uncommon helix <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>D that is also present in BET family members Brd2 BD1 and Brd4 BD2. We speculate that the specific recognition of H4-AcK12 may involve this helix <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>D. Recently published structure of hsBRG1 bromodomain reveals a <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>Z sheet insertion between helices <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>Z and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>Z'. The <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>Z sheet is proposed to have a role in orienting an acetylated substrate by changing the flexibility of the ZA loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The observations of the uncommon helix <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>D insertion in Brd2 BD2 and the <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>Z sheet insertion in hsBRG1 demonstrate that different bromodomains must have sufficient structural diversities to support specific recognition of acetylation codes. More and more information appears about the important functions of proteins in the BET family; especially that it is observed that Brd2, as well as Bdf1 and Brd4, remains mitotically associated with chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Our study provides a structural basis to further understand the functions of proteins in the BET family.</p><p>Consistent with a former study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], our NMR titration experiments show that Brd2 BD2 specifically binds to H4-AcK12 peptide. We acquired the K<sub>D </sub>value (2.9 mM) for this specific binding and determined the interaction to be dynamic in solution. Brd2 BD2 binds to H4-AcK8 peptide with much lower affinity and does not bind to H2B-AcK5 peptide or unacetylated peptide H4-U at all. While the full length Brd2 can bind to H2B acetylated at K5/K12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], Brd2 BD2 can not. One possibility is that Brd2 BD1 is responsible for this interaction. The binding interface of H4-AcK12 peptide on Brd2 BD2 is further identified by NMR titration experiments, which is a conserved hydrophobic and electroneutral cavity with a negative-charged collar formed by five aspartate residues (D330, D338, D341, D385 and D387). These aspartate residues exhibited significant chemical shift changes in Brd2 BD2 titration with H4-AcK12 peptide and served as a secondary binding site as in hsGCN5 bromodomain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The N-terminal tail of histone H4 is positively charged; and coincidently, when the positively charged residues (Lys 8, Lys 16 and Arg 17) flanking the acetylated lysine were mutated to negatively charged residues, Brd2 BD2 no longer bound to this peptide (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). When another flanking residue Ala 15 on H4-AcK12 peptide was substituted with glycine, it induced high aggregation of Brd2 BD2 with an unknown mechanism. Thus, the residue Ala 15 may also have a role in the specific recognition of H4-AcK12 by Brd2 BD2. The complex structure of scGCN5 with H4-AcK16 peptide revealed a primary interaction provided by acetylated lysine and a secondary interaction came from K+2 and K+3 positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Our result of Brd2 BD2 not binding to unacetylated peptide H4-U also solidate the notion that an acetylated lysine is a determinant in bromodomain-ligand recognition. Residues Lys 8, Lys 16 and Arg 17 (corresponding to K-4, K+4 and K+5 positions) provide a secondary recognition, while the residue Ala 15 (corresponding to K+3 position) may also be involved in the interaction with Brd2 BD2. So the interaction mode for Brd2 BD2 with H4-AcK12 peptide may be different from that of scGCN5-H4-AcK16 complex, which is further supported by the observation of large sequence and structural variations in the ZA and BC loops between Brd2 BD2 and scGCN5 [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>].</p><p>The H4-AcK12 peptide binding pocket on Brd2 BD2 is constructed of many conserved or type-conserved resides. To determine which is crucial for H4-AcK12 recognition, we designed a series of mutations in the binding cavity, including V329A, Y339F, Y339A and N382A in respect that all these corresponding residues in hsP/CAF, hsCBP or scGCN5 bromodomains have extensive contacts with their ligands. Especially, the highly conserved residue N382 may be involved in orienting the acetylated Lys 12 as its corresponding residue N407 in scGCN5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Mutant N382A was constructed to examine its effect in H4-AcK12 interaction. <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectra revealed that when the conserved residue V329 or N382 is mutated to alanine, the Brd2 BD2 conformation is disrupted throughout ZA and BC loops, even extending to the helices B and C for N382A mutant. Neither mutant V329A nor mutant N382A binds to H4-AcK12 peptide. For Y339F and Y339A mutants, the recombinant proteins have converted into inclusion body when expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>(data not shown). Thus these highly conserved residues may be more important in maintaining a proper conformation for ligand recognition. On the other hand, L334A or L336A mutant just mildly disturbs a few adjacent residues and most likely doesn't affect the conformation of the binding pocket. However, these two mutants bind to H4-AcK12 with much lower affinities compared with wild type Brd2 BD2. Mutation-induced function disruption may be the main reason for L334A and L336A mutants not binding to H4-AcK12 peptide. Both residues L334 and L336 are localized in helix <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>D (residue 331&#x02013;335), and L334G335 forms a two amino acids insertion unique to Brd2 BD2 and other BET members. Our results definitely show that the two amino acids insertion and helix <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>D are implicated in Brd2 BD2 and H4-Ack12 peptide interaction. However, the complex structure of Brd2 BD2 with H4 AcK12 peptide is needed to completely understand the interaction mechanism.</p><p>The solution structure of Brd2 BD2 is monomeric, whereas the crystal structure of Brd2 BD1 is determined to be a homodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. No inter-molecular NOEs were observed in Brd2 BD2, which was consistent with monomeric state as indicated by gel-filtration and GST-pull down analysis (see methods). It is not surprising that Brd2 BD1 shares only 46% sequence identity with BD2 and the dimeric residues are just partially conserved in BD2. In fact, the equivalent BD1s or BD2s from different proteins of BET family share higher homologies than the non-equivalent BD1 and BD2 in the same protein. Although both Brd2 BD1 and BD2 specifically recognize the same acetylated histone H4 tail, it is reasonable to propose that they play distinctive roles in Brd2 functions. In the Brd2 containing coactivator complex, BD1 may be a dimeric module and interacts with TBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], while BD2 may mainly serve to bind to acetylated histones. It is also probable that Brd2 BD1 and BD2 interact with acetylated histones in different context. And multi-bromodomains could enhance the affinity for acetylated histones. An intriguing question immediately rises and waits to answer. How Brd2 BD1 and BD2 cooperate to regulate Brd2 functions, and thus modulate its transcriptional activation effect?</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Brd2 BD2 is monomeric in solution and interacts weakly and dynamically but specifically with H4-AcK12. The helix <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>D in the long ZA loop may be a common characteristic of BET bromodomains. The conserved hydrophobic cavity is found to serve as a primary binding site for H4-AcK12 as in other bromodomains. A negatively charged collar of the cavity serves as a secondary binding site for H4-AcK12. Actually, the flanking basic residues on H4-AcK12 are important for their mutual recognition. Brd2 BD1 and BD2 may cooperate to regulate Brd2 functions. The structure of Brd2 BD2 will help to further characterize BET family members.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cloning, expression and purification of Brd2</title><p>The DNA fragment encoding residues 301&#x02013;408 corresponding to the second bromodomain of Brd2 was amplified from human brain cDNA library (Clontech) by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the two primers 5'-<underline>CTCGAG</underline>ATCTGGCATCTTGGCATAACGG-3' and 5'-<underline>CATATG</underline>GAACAGTTAAAACATTGCAATG-3' (restriction sites are underlined) designed based on the mRNA sequence of Brd2 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="M80613">M80613</ext-link>]. The reaction product (about 330 bp) was purified and then cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega). The positive clones were identified by restriction digest. Then the DNA fragment was ligated into the <italic>Nde</italic>I/<italic>Xho</italic>I-cleaved plasmid pET22b(+) (Novagen), yielding plasmid pET22b-BD2. The plasmid pET22b-BD2 was then transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>BL21 (DE3) host cells for expression. Uniformly labeled recombinant Brd2 BD2 was produced using SV40 medium containing 0.5 g/l 99% <sup>15</sup>N ammonium chloride and 2.5 g/l 99% <sup>13</sup>C-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon source, respectively. Recombinant Brd2 BD2 was purified using Ni-chelating column (Qiagen). The purified recombinant Brd2 BD2 protein contains a C-terminal His tag (LEHHHHHH), with the N-terminal Met cleaved during expression (data from Mass spectrum). The purity of recombinant Brd2 BD2 was confirmed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE (15%, w/v) and the concentration was measured with BCA kits (Pierce). The <sup>15</sup>N-labeled and <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N- labeled Brd2 BD2 were about 0.5&#x02013;1.0 mM. All the samples for NMR contained 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 5.8), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA in 90% H<sub>2</sub>O/10% D<sub>2</sub>O or in 99.96% D<sub>2</sub>O. Brd2 BD2 mutants were generated by conventional PCR method using pET22b-BD2 plasmid as template. Mutants V329A, L334A, L336A and N382A represented mutations of Val 329 to Ala, Leu 334 to Ala, Leu 336 to Ala and Asn 382 to Ala respectively. The uniformly <sup>15</sup>N-labled proteins of Brd2 BD2 mutants were produced as described above. The integrity of Brd2 BD2 mutants were assessed by their <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectra.</p><p>For GST fusion Brd2 BD2, the DNA fragment was cloned into pGEX-4T (Amersham Bioscience) resulting plasmid pGEX-BD2. The construct was also expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>BL21 (DE3). The GST fusion protein was purified using Sepharose 4B (Amersham Bioscience) and following the protocols.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of Brd2 BD2 in solution</title><p>The state of purified recombinant His-tagged Brd2 BD2 in solution was analyzed using gel filtration chromatography and GST-pull down experiments. The gel filtration analysis was performed with a &#x000c4;KTA FPLC instrument (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with Hiload 16/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column. The purified His-tag fusion Brd2 BD2 was loaded onto the column equilibrated with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris and 500 mM NaCl (pH7.8) and was eluted with the same buffer. The molecular weight was calibrated with marker proteins included Cytochrome C (MW 12300), Myoglobin (horse, MW 17800), Chymotrypsinogen (MW, 25000), Albumin (egg, MW 45000), Albumin (bovine serum, MW 67000). In the analysis, Brd2 BD2 was eluted as a single peak, demonstrating the homogeneity of the sample. The apparent molecular weight of Brd2 BD2 was estimated to be 11 KD, corresponding well with the theoretic molecular weight of Brd2 BD2 (13.8 KD) (data not shown).</p><p>In GST-pull down experiments, the purified recombinant GST and GST-BD2 were immobilized on 200 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l Sepharose 4B beads. After washing four times (1 ml every time) with GST binding buffer, the beads were then incubated with excessive amount of His-tag fusion Brd2 BD2 in total volume of 1 ml at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. The beads were washed by GST binding buffer supplemented with different concentrations of NaCl. Finally the proteins were eluted from beads by boiling. All samples were analyzed on Tricine-SDS-PAGE (15%, w/v) and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. The GST-pull down experiments exhibited that the His-tagged and GST-tagged Brd2 BD2 didn't associate with each other in solution (data not shown). Accordingly, the recombinant Brd2 BD2 was homogenous and mainly monomeric in solution. Hence we moved forward to perform NMR experiments of Brd2 BD2.</p></sec><sec><title>NMR spectroscopy and data processing</title><p>The NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DMX600 spectrometer with self-shielded z-axis gradients. The following spectra were recorded at 298 K to obtain backbone and side chain resonance assignments: 2D <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC, 2D <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C-HSQC, 3D triple-resonance spectra HNCO, HN(CA)CO, CBCA(CO)NH, CBCANH, C(CO)NH-TOCSY, H(CCO)NH-TOCSY, <sup>15</sup>N-TOCSY, HBHA(CBCACO)NH, 2D CB(CC)HD-COSY (aromatics), 3D <sup>15</sup>N-separted NOESY (mixing time 110 ms). The <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>15</sup>N-labeled sample was then lyophilized and dissolved in 99.96% D<sub>2</sub>O, which was followed immediately with HSQC experiments to monitor the disappearance of NH signals at 293 K. After all of the peaks vanished, 3D HCCH-TOCSY, HCCH-COSY and <sup>13</sup>C-separated NOESY (mixing time 130 ms) were recorded on this sample at 298 K.</p><p>NMR data processing was carried out using NMRPipe and NMRDraw software, and the data were analyzed with SPARKY. All software was run on a Linux system. Linear prediction was used to improve spectral resolution in the indirect dimensions where constant-time acquisition was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental restraints and NMR structure determination</title><p>NMR distance restraints were collected from two different NOESY spectra: 3D <sup>15</sup>N-separated NOESY in H<sub>2</sub>O for amide protons, 3D <sup>13</sup>C-separated NOESY in D<sub>2</sub>O for aliphatic protons. NOE restraints were grouped into four distance ranges: strong, 1.8&#x02013;3.0 &#x000c5; and 1.8&#x02013;3.5 &#x000c5;; medium, 1.8&#x02013;4.0 &#x000c5; and 1.8&#x02013;4.5 &#x000c5;; weak, 1.8&#x02013;5.0 &#x000c5;; and very weak, 1.8&#x02013;6.0 &#x000c5;. Considering that the spin diffusion effect could be serious for aliphatic protons, a more conservative distance estimation was used for the 3D <sup>13</sup>C-separated NOESY; therefore, most medium-range and long-range NOEs from this spectra were put into the weak or very weak groups. The 1.8 &#x000c5; lower limits were imposed only implicitly by the van der Waals repulsion force. For methyl protons, nonstereospecifically assigned methylene protons, and aromatic ring protons, r <sup>-6 </sup>summation averages were applied. Based on the chemical shifts values, the program CSI and TALOS were used to identify the secondary structure elements. The derived secondary structures were converted into restraints on <italic>&#x003d5; </italic>and <italic>&#x003c8; </italic>angles. Hydrogen bond restraints were obtained by identifying the slow exchange amide protons mainly in the regular secondary structures.</p><p>Structures were calculated using the program CNS v1.1, employing a simulated annealing protocol for torsion angle dynamics. For the initial rounds of structure calculations, only sequential, intraresidual, medium-range NOEs, unambiguous long-range NOEs and dihedral angle restraints were used. Later, all other long-range NOEs and hydrogen bonds were introduced in consecutive steps. Simple impulsion nonbonded interactions were used during structure calculation. At the final stage, 200 conformers were calculated; of these, 20 conformers with the lowest energy were selected. The coordinates of the 20 selected structures and the mean structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank [PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2G4A">2G4A</ext-link>]. The qualities of the structures were assessed with PROCHECK. All residues are located in allowed regions on Ramachandran plot apart from K217 due to paucity of inter-residual NOEs. Being unassigned, the C-terminal His tag had no NMR restraints, and they were excluded from structure calculation.</p></sec><sec><title>Histone N-terminal tail peptides and NMR titration</title><p>The peptides of acetylated histone tails H2B-AcK5 (residues 1&#x02013;12 of histone H2B, SDPA-AcK-SAPAPKK, where AcK is an N<sup><italic>&#x003b5;</italic></sup>-acetyl-lysine), H4-AcK8 (residues 1&#x02013;12 of histone H4, SGRGKGG-AcK-GLGK), H4-AcK12 (residues 7&#x02013;17 of histone H4, GKGLG-AcK-GGAKR), H4-L10A (Leu 10 to Ala mutation of H4-AcK12, GKGAG-AcK-GGAKR), H4-L10G (Leu 10 to Gly mutation of H4-AcK12, GKGGG-AcK-GGAKR), H4-A15G (Ala 15 to Gly mutation of H4-AcK12, GKGLG-AcK-GGGKR), H4-acid (Lys 8 to Asp, Lys 16 to Asp and Arg 17 to Glu mutations of H4-AcK12, GDGLG-AcK-GGADE) and the unacetylated peptide H4-U (residues 7&#x02013;17 of histone H4, GKGLGKGGAKR) were purchased from Sangon. All these compounds were used without additional purification. For binding titrations, the samples of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled Brd2 BD2 and Brd2 BD2 mutants were prepared in phosphate buffer (pH 5.8) as mentioned above, with the concentrations between 0.2 mM and 1.0 mM. Solutions of the peptides H2B-AcK5, H4-AcK8, H4-AcK12, H4-L10A, H4-L10G, H4-A15G, H4-U and H4-acid were prepared at concentrations between 55 mM and 100 mM, under identical buffer conditions.
