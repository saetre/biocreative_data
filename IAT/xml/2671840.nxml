The resulting Fn aggregates are conformationally distinct from plasma Fn as indicated by a change in available thermolysin cleavage sites. Recombinant BBK32 and anastellin affect the structure of Fn matrices formed by cultured fibroblasts and inhibit endothelial cell proliferation similarly. Within BBK32, we have located the sFn-forming activity to a region between residues 160 and 175 which contains two sequence motifs that are also found in anastellin.

In fact, the panels of virulence factors employed are often organism and host species specific and sometimes also disease specific. Despite this variation, bacterial infectious disease processes appear to involve some common steps. The microbial pathogen usually has to adhere to a tissue(s) in the host in order to establish a colony, and to survive, the microbe has to evade the host's defense systems.</p><p>In this context of diversity it is remarkable that so many pathogenic organisms appear to bind and adhere to fibronectin (Fn) substrates. Fn is an abundant animal glycoprotein found in a soluble form in most body fluids and deposited as part of the insoluble extracellular matrix of most tissues. The protein is composed of two 220 KDa polypeptides held together by disulfide bonds at the C-terminal end. Each polypeptide is a mosaic protein composed of three types of repeating modules: 12 type I modules (F1), 2 type II modules (F2), 15&#x02013;17 (dependent on alternative splicing) type III modules (F3), and an alternatively spliced variable sequence that is not homologous to other parts of Fn. F1 and F2 modules are stabilized by disulfide bonds, whereas F3 modules lack disulfide bonds and can reversibly partially unfold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Plaxco1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Plaxco2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Soluble Fn adopts a somewhat compact form that is stabilized by intramolecular ionic interactions between specific modules. These interactions occur primarily between the <sup>1</sup>F1&#x02013;<sup>5</sup>F1, the <sup>2</sup>F3&#x02013;<sup>3</sup>F3, and <sup>12</sup>F3&#x02013;<sup>14</sup>F3 segments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Johnson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In the extracellular matrix, Fn takes on a more extended form and the protein is likely engaged in multiple intra- and intermolecular interactions (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Mao1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>). The structural organizations of Fn matrices have not been elucidated in detail; however, it is likely that the incorporation of soluble Fn into a matrix involves a complex but orderly breaking of intramolecular bonds in the compact soluble Fn and the formation of new intra- and intermolecular interactions. This process is facilitated by integrins and other cellular components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Pankov1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Sechler1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently Vakonakis, <italic>et al.</italic>, suggested that cell-generated tension on Fn, disrupts interactions between <sup>1</sup>F3 and <sup>2</sup>F3, creating a conformation of <sup>1&#x02013;2</sup>F3 that binds to the N-terminal domain and initiates fibrillogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Vakonakis1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Fn play key roles in basic physiological processes such as cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival by interacting with a variety of extracellular macromolecules and cellular receptors, primarily of the integrin family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Mosher1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Integrins constitute a family of dimeric cell surface receptors that recognize specific extracellular matrix and cell bound ligands. Integrins &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, &#x003b1;<sub>4</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, and &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> are the primary Fn receptors.</p><p>Fn may occur in different aggregated forms. &#x0201c;Superfibronectin&#x0201d; (sFn) is a form of Fn aggregates that resembles Fn matrices, but with distinct biological activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Morla1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. sFn is formed by mixing plasma Fn with anastellin, a recombinant form of the C-terminal two-thirds of the <sup>1</sup>F3 Fn module. F3 modules are &#x003b2;-sandwiches composed of a four-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet and a triple-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet. In anastellin, strands A and B are removed, exposing the E and C strands, which is perhaps responsible for anastellin's self-association and interaction with other Fn modules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Briknarova1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. These interactions lead to the formation of sFn. Ohashi and Erickson suggested a model of sFn formation whereby anastellin binds and partially unfolds F3 modules and prevents refolding, thus exposing hydrophobic surfaces and &#x003b2;-sheet edges. The exposed elements bind to similar exposed elements on other Fn modules, leading to a specific aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Ohashi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. sFn dramatically enhances cell adhesion compared to plasma Fn when coated on a cell culture dish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Morla1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, and it has been demonstrated that anastellin can inhibit angiogenesis. This effect is believed to represent the basis for anastellin's observed anti-tumor activity in mouse models of human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Akerman1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Yi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. McKeown-Longo, <italic>et al</italic>. showed that anastellin added to cultured cells becomes incorporated into the Fn matrix deposited by the cells and induces a conformational rearrangement in the Fn matrix that can be monitored by a specific monoclonal antibody. Anastellin also effectively blocks serum-dependent proliferation of cultured endothelial cells. This effect is not due to induced apoptosis, but is caused by blocking the serum-dependent activation of ERK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Ambesi1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>More than 100 different Fn-binding microbial proteins have been reported so far, although most of the Fn-microbial protein interactions have not been characterized in detail. Previously, we showed that the Fn-binding MSCRAMMs, FnBPA and FnBPB from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and Sfb1 from <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, contain a common motif that allows these proteins to bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of Fn by a unique binding mechanism that we called the tandem &#x003b2;-zipper. When these MSCRAMMs target soluble Fn, the compact conformation of the host protein undergoes a change resulting in a more open structure, where binding sites for the &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin are exposed (Liang, <italic>et al.</italic>, in preparation). Thus, staphylococci or streptococci recruiting Fn to their surfaces via these MSCRAMMs are coated with activated Fn that can lead to &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin-dependent host cell invasion.</p><p>Fn-binding MSCRAMMs can also bind to other domains in Fn. A motif targeting the gelatin binding domain (GBD) in Fn has been identified in Sfb1. ShdA of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serotype Typhimurium appears to target the F3 module, <sup>13</sup>F3 (which makes up part of the heparin-2-binding domain of Fn) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Kingsley1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The binding motif in ShdA has not been clearly defined. Furthermore, the biological consequences of these interactions are still unclear.</p><p>We have unsuccessfully searched many of the identified Fn-binding MSCRAMMs for the presence of the motifs identified from FnBPA, FnBPB, and Sfb1 that target the Fn NTD or GBD. An exception is BBK32 from <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>. BBK32, a 47 kDa lipoprotein, was originally identified as a Fn-binding MSCRAMM by probing lysates of spirochete with Fn in Western ligand blots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Probert1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Expression of BBK32 at the site of experimental infection in mice increases until day 7 and then declines, but <italic>bbk32</italic> gene expression can be detected in the skin, heart, spleen, joints, and bladder at least 30 days post challenge, indicating that the lipoprotein is expressed by the spirochete as it disseminates to different tissues in the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Fikrig1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The N-terminus of BBK32 contains a signal peptide followed by a &#x0201c;lipobox&#x0201d; and an extended intrinsically disordered segment (residues 21&#x02013;205) that contains the Fn-binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Kim1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. This segment contains a sequence motif that resembles the motifs in FnbpA. In fact, BBK32<sub>(147&#x02013;205)</sub> binds to the N-terminal type I modules found in Fn by the tandem &#x003b2;-zipper mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Raibaud1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, we identified a motif resembling the GBD-binding sequence in Sfb1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Raibaud1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In further analysis of the binding specificity, we found that the MSCRAMM not only binds to the NTD F1 modules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Kim1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Raibaud1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and the GBD (manuscript in preparation), but also the <sup>1&#x02013;2</sup>F3, and <sup>3</sup>F3 modules. This observation prompted us to examine if BBK32, like anastellin can induce conformational changes in soluble Fn that can lead to aggregation of the glycoprotein. Here we report that the BBK32-F3 interaction induces an ordered aggregation of soluble Fn that exposes thermolysin cleavage sites that are cryptic in soluble Fn. Recombinant BBK32 has specific biological activities in that it can affect the structure of Fn matrices formed by cultured fibroblasts and effectively inhibit endothelial cell proliferation. Furthermore, we have identified two specific amino acid sequence motifs found in BBK32 that can induce Fn aggregation. Thus, we conclude that a specific motif in BBK32 can target F3 modules in Fn and induce the formation of ordered Fn aggregates.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>BBK32 binds to <sup>1&#x02013;3</sup>F3 of Fn</title><p>We previously reported that the Fn-binding activity of BBK32 is located to an intrinsically disordered segment of the protein corresponding to residues 21&#x02013;205 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Kim1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and that a motif corresponding to residues 147&#x02013;205 binds to the <sup>1</sup>F1&#x02013;<sup>5</sup>F1 N-terminal segment of Fn by the tandem &#x003b2;-zipper mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Kim1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Raibaud1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Experiments designed to further define the MSCRAMM binding sites in Fn by probing a thermolysin digest of Fn with rBBK32 <sub>(21&#x02013;205)</sub> in Western ligand blots to determine the protein-protein interaction, indicated that the MSCRAMM binds more strongly to the 56 kDa fragment than to the 43 kDa gelatin binding fragment (data not shown). Since the only difference between these two Fn fragments is the inclusion of <sup>1</sup>F3 in the 56 kDa fragment, this result suggests that BBK32 <sub>(21&#x02013;205)</sub> may interact with the <sup>1</sup>F<sub>3</sub> module. We, therefore, generated recombinant forms of <sup>1</sup>F3, <sup>1&#x02013;2</sup>F3, and <sup>3</sup>F3 and examined the binding of BBK32 to these Fn modules in ELISA-type binding assays. BBK32 bound all the recombinant F3 modules in a concentration dependent manner.

We now demonstrate that a recombinant form of BBK32 <sub>(21&#x02013;205)</sub> also binds to Fn F3 modules and can induce an ordered Fn aggregation that resembles the formation of sFn induced by anastellin. This aggregation probably is a consequence of conformational changes induced in Fn upon BBK32 or anastellin binding. Aggregates of plasma Fn induced by either BBK32 or anastellin expose similar thermolysin cleavage sites. Both proteins affect the structure of cellular Fn in deposited matrices by cultured fibroblasts as monitored by the disappearance of the epitope for the monoclonal antibody IST9. Furthermore, both BBK32 and anastellin can inhibit the proliferation of cultured endothelial cells. Thus, BBK32 and anastellin appear to modulate the conformation of Fn in similar ways and have similar biological activities. The ability to induce ordered Fn aggregation is not a property seen for all Fn-binding MSCRAMMs. A segment of the staphylococcal Fn-binding MSCRAMM FnbpA did not show these effects. The FnbpA D3 segment contains a well defined <sup>4</sup>F1&#x02013;<sup>5</sup>F1 binding motif, but does not bind to F3 modules nor does it induce Fn aggregation.</p><p>The Fn-binding activity of BBK32 was previously located to an intrinsically disordered segment of the lipoprotein corresponding to residues 21&#x02013;205.

The residues in BBK32 that appear to comprise the sFn-inducing motif have weak sequence homology to a sequence found in anastellin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005412-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Recombinant anastellin and BBK32 are structurally different. Anastellin represents the C-terminal two-thirds of the Fn <sup>1</sup>F3 module, and has a defined structure with two &#x003b2;-sheets. When both proteins are aligned the motif appears to be divided, however, when anastellin is properly folded, the residues are in close proximity and are available for Fn interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005412-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). The active sFn-inducing motif in anastellin has not yet been elucidated, however, residues QLISI (weak homology to the QGIAG sequence in BBK32 <sub>(168&#x02013;175)</sub>), are only exposed in anastellin and not in the complete <sup>1</sup>F3 module. The RPKNSV sequence identified in anastellin is in a short loop region of the protein where it could have a restricted flexibility in the intact F3 module.

This epitope has been located to the EDA module (specifically residues <sup>39</sup>PEDGIHELFP<sup>48</sup>) that also harbors binding sites for the &#x003b1;<sub>4</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>9</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005412-Liao2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is possible that binding of BBK32 to Fn may regulate Fn's interactions with these integrins, which in turn may benefit the spirochetes.
