TFIIIA containing a Leu in place of His33 in the Cys2His2 zinc binding site of finger I lost the ability to protect the entire 5S RNA gene ICR (nucleotides +96 to +43) from DNase I digestion. Thus, mutation of one potential zinc ligand in the N-terminal finger inhibited specific DNA binding by the N-terminal as well as downstream fingers. Cooperativity apparently exists among TFIIIA zinc fingers in metal binding/finger folding and DNA binding. Substituting a Ser for Gly69 or a Glu for Lys 71 in the conserved TGEK tetrapeptide in finger II of TFIIIA resulted in the loss of DNA binding. A Gly-dependent bend structure and a terminal positive charge in this tetrapeptide are important for TFIIIA interaction with DNA. Whereas TFIIIA with a Ser substituted for Cys20 in finger I (proposed zinc ligand) did not protect the ICR from DNase I digestion, TFIIIA containing a Ser substituted for Cys35 (not a proposed zinc ligand) retained the ability to bind the ICR. When Cys112 or Cys 164 (proposed zinc ligands in fingers IV and VI) were replaced by Ser, the DNase I footprint patterns afforded by the respective mutant proteins were similar, protection on the ICR from about nucleotides +96 up to +78. A similar pattern was obtained with a TFIIIA mutant in which fingers V, VI, VII, and a portion of VIII were deleted. Maintenance of zinc coordination spheres in necessary for DNA binding by downstream fingers. The six fingers comprising the N-terminal half of TFIIIA appear to act in two groups of three with binding of the second group dependent upon initial binding of the N-terminal group to the +90 to +80 region of the 5S gene ICR.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00104-0186-a" xlink:role="6873"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00104-0186-b" xlink:role="6873"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00104-0187-a" xlink:role="6874"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00104-0187-b" xlink:role="6874"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00104-0184.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6871"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00104-0185.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6872"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00104-0186.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6873"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00104-0187.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6874"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00104-0188.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6875"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00104-0189.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6876"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
