In the prototypic model an environmental stimulus interacts with the N-terminus of a sensor protein, leading to autophosphorylation of a specific histidine residue using ATP. The sensor then acts as a kinase and transmits the phosphate group to a conserved aspartate residue on a cognate response regulator protein. This normally enables the regulator to control the transcription of a certain set of genes by sequence specific DNA binding.</p><p>Sequencing of the <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>genome has identified more than 30 TCS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Four <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>sensor proteins, ArcB, EvgS, TorS and BarA, have two extra domains, D1 and H2, besides the H1 transmitter domain and are thus denoted as 'tripartite' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>tripartite sensor BarA (<underline>b</underline>acterial <underline>a</underline>daptive <underline>r</underline>esponse) forms a TCS with the UvrY response regulator protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. UvrY positively controls expression of the noncoding <italic>csrB </italic>and <italic>csrC </italic>RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which bind the 6.8 kD CsrA protein and thus prevent it from interfering with ribosome loading of various target mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The Csr (carbon storage regulation) system has been shown to have a major impact on regulation on carbon metabolism pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Deletion of the <italic>barA </italic>or <italic>uvrY </italic>genes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, as a consequence, has drastic effects on the ability of the bacteria to successfully grow in a competition depending on the carbon source of the medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Mutations in the Csr system in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>and <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>also cause other phenotypic effects, including changes in motility, adhesion and biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Deletions of orthologous systems in other bacteria; BarA-SirA in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, ExpS-ExpA in <italic>Erwinia carotovora</italic>, BarA-VarA in <italic>Vibrio cholerae </italic>and GacS-GacA in <italic>Pseudomonas spp</italic>, clearly diminishes virulence of the bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The fact that this system is important for infections in a large spectrum of host organisms has also been corroborated by work demonstrating the necessity of the <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>GacS-GacA system for infections in either animals, nematodes, insects or plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The underlying mechanism behind this effect on virulence is far from clear. Several indirect effects have been reported, particularly on the formation of secreted molecules implied in the virulence of the bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], but the only verified direct target genes are functional homologues to the <italic>csrB</italic>/<italic>csrC </italic>regulatory RNAs as well as the genes encoding the HilA and HilC transcriptional regulators in <italic>Salmonella </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The nature of a physiological stimulus acting directly on the sensor is still elusive. Bile and intestinal short fatty acids have a clear effect on this two-component system in <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], although it is unclear if these effects are mediated <italic>via </italic>the sensor or not. Considering the fact that the system is activated in bacterial monocultures, we earlier proposed that a stimulus reflects the energy/growth status of the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p><italic>Escherichia coli </italic>is the causative agent in more than 80% of the uncomplicated human urinary tract infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. <italic>Macaque fascularis </italic>monkeys express the digalactoside receptors to which the P fimbriated uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>strains bind and thus provide a suitable animal model system to study a cystitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Here we show that a mutant in the BarA-UvrY two-component system is less fit in a competition in such a cystitis model. We propose that this effect is at least partially mediated by a reduced ability to adapt the carbon metabolism in response to the varying carbon sources in urine.</p></sec><sec><title>Results &#x00026; discussion</title><sec><title>Monkey cystitis competition assay</title><p>Two female monkeys were inoculated in the bladder with a 1:1 mixture of the <italic>DS17 </italic>wild type and the <italic>AKP168 uvrY </italic>mutant. Urine samples were collected at day 2, 5, 7, 13 and 15 to determine the colony forming units (CFU) and the relative number of wild type and mutant bacteria. Both monkeys exhibited typical symptoms of an acute cystitis as measured by bacteruria and an increased level of leukocyte markers in the urine (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The infections were cleared naturally by day 13 from both animals (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Our analysis of the isolated samples clearly showed that the <italic>uvrY </italic>mutant <italic>AKP168 </italic>was rapidly lost in both monkeys, in comparison with the wild type <italic>DS17 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). On the fifth day of infection more than 95 % of the isolated bacteria were wild type. We also observed a similar take-over of the wild type strain in samples collected from the vagina in these monkeys (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This is expected, as urine continuously contaminates the vagina. We were however unable to perform additional infections as there were no more animals available for such a study.</p></sec><sec><title>The BarA-UvrY two-component system controls the carbon utilization in the cell</title><p>We recently showed that the ability of a <italic>uvrY </italic>mutant to grow in a competition culture with the wild type depends on the growth medium, such that the mutant has a higher fitness than the wild type in gluconeogenic media, e.g. LB, but a lower fitness than the wild type in glycolytic media. These results led us to conclude that the BarA-UvrY TCS is important for the bacteria to efficiently switch between different carbon sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The switching ability is crucial in a glycolytic medium, as long-term growth will change the composition of the medium, with a gradual accumulation of secondary metabolites (e.g. acetate). Accumulated intermediates will in turn be metabolized when the primary metabolites are exhausted. When all carbon sources are depleted from the medium, lysed bacteria will be the only carbon source that can be used. The major carbon source in such lysates is amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In gluconeogenic media, based on amino acids or other small metabolites fuelling directly into the Krebs cycle, the composition of the medium will be relatively unchanged in a long-term culture, including the stage when amino acids from lysed bacteria will be the principal carbon source. Growth in such media is not directly aided by the BarA-UvrY TCS and mutants where the sensor or regulator has been disrupted are rather more fit than the wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In support of our hypothesis, the BarA-UvrY TCS has been demonstrated to control transcription of the <italic>csrB </italic>and <italic>csrC </italic>noncoding RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], which via the CsrA protein regulate the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenis and glycolysis by inversely controlling the concentration of their mRNA at the post-transcriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the case of csrB, UvrY has been proven to act directly on the csrB promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Growth of wild type and <italic>uvrY </italic>mutant strains in human urine</title><p>To test if the higher fitness of the wild type bacteria in the monkey cystitis model could be due to their ability to efficiently switch between different carbon sources present in urine we cultivated the bacteria in sterile filtered urine. The composition of urine varies between individual samples, but typically contains a mixture of amino acids, sugars and fatty acids as carbon sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>We first cultivated the <italic>DS17 </italic>and the <italic>AKP168 </italic>strains individually in urine freshly collected from three human subjects (U1, U2 &#x00026; U3). The growth varied significantly between the individual urines but there was no significant difference in growth between the mutant and the wild type in any of the three urines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We subsequently allowed the <italic>DS17 </italic>wild type and the <italic>AKP168 </italic>mutant to compete in these three human urines. Each competition culture was first split into two and the level of mutant was followed in each culture. In all six urine competitions the level of <italic>uvrY </italic>mutant decreased during the two first days, but this was followed by an increase in the level of <italic>uvrY </italic>mutant with a fluctuating pattern that was specific for each urine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). As urine is a complex medium consisting of a mixture of carbon sources, the initial decrease in the relative level of <italic>uvrY </italic>mutant may well be explained by its impaired ability to efficiently switch between gluconeogenic and glycolytic carbon sources. The competition profiles were markedly different between the urines but the same in the parallel cultures from the same urine (although with a slight time shift in U3). Our premise that the initial composition of the individual urine determines the competition profile agrees well with this reproducibility. The observed fluctuations after day 1&#x02013;2 are thus unlikely to be explained by random processes or by spontaneous mutations in either the <italic>AKP168 </italic>or the wild type strain creating a growth advantage in stationary phase, GASP mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. From the results, it is more likely that each competition profile is decided by the initial composition of each individual urine. To exclude that the reduced fitness of the <italic>uvrY </italic>mutants in the urine cultures was the result of additional weakening mutations, we demonstrated that mutants taken at day 7 from the different urine competitions could successfully outcompete the wild type strain in a competition in LB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><p>The increase in the level of mutant after the initial decrease may be explained by the massive lysis of bacteria after the entry into stationary phase. Lysis will provide an environment with an excess of gluconeogenic carbon sources, where it is known that a <italic>uvrY </italic>mutant has a growth advantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>We also repeated the competition in the same urines (U1, U2 &#x00026; U3) complemented with LB. In these competitions where there is a constant excess of gluconeogenic carbon sources in the medium, the <italic>uvrY </italic>mutant rapidly outcompeted the wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), similar to what is observed in LB alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Thus, there seems to be no dominant factor in urine that would explain the lowered fitness of the <italic>uvrY </italic>mutant.</p><p>Although our model system cannot mimic the exact conditions in the bladder, such as the continuous addition of fresh urine, the data suggest that a <italic>uvrY </italic>mutant has an impaired ability to efficiently metabolize the different nutrient components in the urine. This also emphasizes that an optimal growth rate is critical for bacteria during an infection. In analogy with our results, it is interesting to note that long-term growth of <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>strains in gluconeogenic media selects for strains with inactivating mutations in the orthologous GacS-GacA system, unlike when the same strains are tested in an infection model (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It would be interesting to test what role the described metabolic switches plays in the other bacterial species where it is known that the BarA-UvrY two-component system family affects virulence.</p><p>We cannot exclude that other factors under the control of this TCS contributes to the lowered fitness of the <italic>uvrY </italic>mutant observed in the <italic>in vivo </italic>cystitis model. Earlier studies have demonstrated effects of the BarA-UvrY TCS and the downstream Csr system on adhesion, aggregation and biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], all of which may play a role in the persistence of bacteria in the bladder in concert with the ability to utilize and switch between glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This paper demonstrates that the BarA-UvrY system is a determinant for virulence in a monkey cystitis model. Based on different competition profiles we propose that the BarA-UvrY TCS is important for the bacteria to efficiently switch between different carbon sources present in urine. This would provide a plausible explanation to the reduced fitness of the <italic>uvrY </italic>mutant in the cystitis model as urine consists of several different carbon sources and as the prevalent carbon sources will change over time. This also agrees well with the observed higher fitness of the <italic>uvrY </italic>mutant in competitions in purely gluconeogenic media as the <italic>uvrY </italic>mutant is predisposed for gluconeogenesis. In conclusion, the ability to grow quickly and benefit from the available carbon and energy sources is crucial for virulence. During infection there may be different carbon sources available and we believe that the ability to know when to metabolize them is in part conferred by the BarA-UvrY two-component system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Monkey cystitis competition model</title><p>Two adult female <italic>Macaque fascularis </italic>monkeys were infected by inoculation of a bacterial suspension (1 ml of 10<sup>8 </sup>bacteria/ml), containing equal amounts of <italic>DS17 </italic>wild type and the isogenic <italic>uvrY </italic>mutant <italic>AKP168</italic>, into the bladder using a catheter (the bladder void volume is approximately 150 ml).
