Most studies to date of the essential chemokine Cxcl12 (Sdf-1) have focused on the ubiquitously expressed secreted isoforms &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;. Here we show that, unlike these isoforms and all other known chemokines, the alternatively transcribed &#x003b3; isoform is an intracellular protein that localizes to the nucleolus in differentiated mouse Cardiac tissue. Our results demonstrate that nucleolar transportation is encoded by a nucleolar-localization signal in the unique carboxy-terminal region of Sdf-1&#x003b3;, and is competent both in vivo and in vitro. The molecular mechanism underlying these unusual chemokine properties involves cardiac-specific transcription of an mRNA containing a unique short-leader sequence lacking the signal peptide and translation from a non-canonical CUG codon. Our results provide an example of genome economy even for essential and highly conserved genes such as Cxcl12, and suggest that chemokines can exert tissue specific functions unrelated to cell-to-cell communication.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemoattractant cytokines, known as chemokines, are a class of small proteins that play key roles in intercellular signalling and cell migration throughout animal development and during adult life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Baggiolini1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Three isoforms of Cxcl12/Sdf-1, produced from alternatively spliced mRNA variants, have been identified in humans, rats and mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-DeLaLuzSierra1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Yu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Gleichmann1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Sdf-1&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; were the first isoforms identified, and most available data on Sdf-1 were obtained with the &#x003b1; isoform. These isoforms are highly similar, distinguished by a difference in just four amino acids in the C-terminus and a larger 3&#x02032;UTR in <italic>Sdf-1&#x003b2;</italic>. This similarity is reflected in the minor differences between their biological properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-DeLaLuzSierra1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Both proteins are secreted via the canonical intracellular secretory pathway, mediated by a signal peptide sequence.</p><p>The &#x003b3; isoform was identified more recently, together with other minor isoforms in humans (&#x003b4;, &#x003b5;, and &#x003c6;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Yu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Preliminary data from humans show that SDF-1&#x003b3; expression is mainly restricted to regions of adult brain and heart, with a similar pattern seen in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Gleichmann1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Pillarisetti1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the biological significance of Sdf-1&#x003b3; has been unclear, since it binds Cxcr4 with low affinity and displaces Cxcr4-bound Sdf-1&#x003b1; only at high concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Laguri1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, it is ineffective at driving signal transduction, as revealed by its low capacity to stimulate intracellular calcium mobilization, weak chemotactic activity and lack of effect on progenitor cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Altenburg1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Contrasting with the sequence similarity of Sdf-1&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;, Sdf-1&#x003b3; contains a unique thirty amino-acid sequence at its C terminus, making it almost twice as large as Sdf-1&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; (14 versus 8 kDa) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Segret1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, almost 60&#x00025; of the residues in this C-terminal extension are basic (lysine and arginine). Enrichment in basic residues is a characteristic of protein domains involved in intermolecular interactions with DNA, lipids, sugars and other proteins, and in translocation across membranes during localization to subcellular compartments. The lysine and arginine residues in the Sdf-1&#x003b3; C-terminal region are arrayed in at least four clusters resembling the canonical nuclear localization signals (NLS) of cellular and viral proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Lange1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, a feature not described for any other chemokine. Recent reports describe extracellular actions for two of these clusters as heparan-sulphate binding domains, with unexpectedly strong binding affinity for cellular glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Laguri1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Rueda1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. However, all these experiments were conducted with in vitro synthesized recombinant Sdf-1&#x003b3;, and activity derived from the expression from the endogenous locus has not been reported.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that Sdf-1&#x003b3; is a nuclear protein in the mouse heart, where it is expressed in a temporally coordinated pattern during development and at high levels postnatally and in adults. Our results show that the Sdf-1&#x003b3; C-terminal region localizes the protein to the nucleus via canonical NLS motifs and to the nucleolus via a specific nucleolar localization signal (NoLS). The Sdf-1&#x003b3; C-terminal extension moreover confers nuclear localization on heterologous cytoplasmic proteins. We have demonstrated that the <italic>Sdf-1&#x003b3;</italic> mRNA in cardiac tissue has a short (25 nt) leader sequence which lacks a signal peptide sequence and the AUG initiation codon used to translate <italic>Sdf-1&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> mRNAs. Sdf-1&#x003b3; is instead translated from the non-canonical codon CUG at position 169.

In HEK293T cells transfected with this plasmid the localization of CFP was unequivocally nuclear, with sub-localization to the nucleoli, and the same distribution was seen with CFP fused to full-length Sdf-1&#x003b3; (pCFPSdf1&#x003b3;&#x02212;96&#x02212;450) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007570-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).

In contrast, CFP2 localized evenly throughout cell nuclei, indicating that cluster 2 (KKKR), which resembles the SV40-type NLS, is sufficient for nuclear redistribution. CFP14, maintaining integrity of clusters 1 (KKEK) and 4 (KRK), targeted the nucleus in the absence of cluster 2, but a proportion of transfected cells showed a cytoplasmic distribution. CFP124 was extensively sub-localized to nucleoli, similar to the distribution of the wild type sequence (CFP1234) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007570-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>).

Based on this last activity, the nucleolus can be regarded as a reservoir of regulatory proteins, acting as a sequestering compartment for regulatory complexes, or regulating the exposure of proteins to proteolysis during developmental decision-making (Hand 1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Martindill1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, hypoxia sensing responses (VHL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Mekhail1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, cell death and proliferation (AKT, p53, ARF, MDM2, c-myc) and mitosis (Cdc14).

Our results show that nucleolar accumulation of Sdf-1&#x003b3; is unaffected by inhibition of the nUPS, suggesting that nucleolar accumulation of Sdf-1&#x003b3; is unrelated to protein quality-control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-vonMikecz1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Gardner1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. It therefore appears that Sdf-1&#x003b3; in the heart is localized to the nucleolus to exert its biological function. Our preliminary data indicate that overexpression of Sdf-1&#x003b3; seems not to be required for the induction of apoptosis or to promote any alteration of the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Organismal complexity relies partly on the capacity of genomes to generate protein diversity. Such diversity is commonly achieved through alternative gene expression pathways (alternative transcriptional initiation, mRNA splicing and translation initiation), allowing related proteins to acquire domains that confer novel activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Kafri1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the first description of intracellular forms of growth factors for FGF family members and their receptors &#x0005b;reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007570-Delrieu1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>&#x0005d;, several growth factors and cytokines have been shown to be expressed both as secreted and intracellular forms (nuclear or cytoplasmic). By including or deleting key domains from their structures, proteins can be targeted to particular cell compartments and excluded from others. Such diversity must strike a balance between protein stability, compatible signalling and multifunctionality.</p><p>We have shown that a product of the chemokine <italic>Sdf-1</italic> gene is specifically directed to the nucleolus through a combination of transcriptional and translational mechanisms. The specific nucleolar expression of <italic>Sdf-1</italic>&#x003b3; in the heart suggests important functions in this organ and provides the first example of a nucleolar directed chemokine. These new properties of this isoform will lead to novel insights into the functions encoded by the <italic>Sdf-1</italic> gene.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmid Construction</title><p>Plasmids were generated from PCR products with the pGEM-T Easy system (Promega Biotech Ib&#x000e9;rica SL, Alcobendas, Spain).
