Homodimers of RIP60 (replication initiation-region protein 60 kDA) purified from nuclear extract bind two ATT-rich sites in ori&#x003b2; and foster the formation of a twisted 720 bp DNA loop <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>. Using a one hybrid screen in yeast, we have cloned the cDNA for human RIP60. RIP60 contains 15&#x000a0;C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger (ZF) DNA binding motifs organized in three clusters, termed hand Z1 (ZFs 1&#x02013;5), hand Z2 (ZFs 6&#x02013;8) and hand Z3 (ZFs 9&#x02013;15). A proline-rich region is located between hands Z2 and Z3. Gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting experiments show hands Z1 and Z2 independently bind the ori&#x003b2; RIP60 sites specifically, but with different affinities. Hand Z3 binds DNA, but displays no specificity for RIP60 sites. Ligation enhancement, DNase I footprinting, and atomic force microscopy assays show that hand Z2 and a portion of the associated proline-rich region is sufficient for protein multimerization on DNA and DNA looping <italic>in vitro</italic>. Polyomavirus origin-dependent plasmid replication assays show RIP60 has weak replication enhancer activity, suggesting that RIP60 does not harbor a transcriptional transactivation domain. Because vertebrate origins of replication have no known consensus sequence, we suggest that sequence-specific DNA binding proteins such as RIP60 may act as accessory factors in origin identification prior to the assembly of pre-initiation complexes.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x9943c80.0x9564a68" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession nos AF201303</p></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a pathway for the assembly of replication initiation complexes at chromosomal origins of replication (or ARS elements) has been described (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c3">3</xref>). The origin recognition complex (ORC) binds in a sequence-specific and ATP-dependent manner to the conserved ARS-consensus sequence (ACS) throughout the cell cycle, providing a protein&#x02013;DNA complex that recruits replication proteins such as Cdc6p, Mcm proteins and Cdc45p to a pre-replication complex (pre-RC) in a cell cycle-specific manner. During S phase entry, the pre-RC is activated by at least two cell cycle-regulated kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c5">5</xref>). While these and other proteins are known to be involved in the assembly and activation of replication complexes in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, the mechanism by which replication forks are established by ORC and its associated factors is not known.</p><p>Homologs of ORC, Cdc6 and Mcm proteins have been identified in other yeasts, plants and vertebrate organisms, suggesting the pathway for assembly of replication complexes is highly conserved in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c1">1</xref>). However, significant differences between origin structure in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and other organisms suggest that additional steps in regulation of the initiation pathway have emerged during evolution. For example, binding of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> ORC to origin DNA is mediated by AT-hooks fused to ORC4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c6">6</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract replication of DNA molecules requires ORC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c8">8</xref>), Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c9">9</xref>) and Mcm proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c10">10</xref>), but not specific ACS-like DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c13">13</xref>). Moreover, in contrast to <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Xenopus</italic> ORC does not appear to be bound to mitotic chromatin in cycling egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c7">7</xref>). Comparison of the properties of CDC6 homologs in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>S.pombe</italic> and human cells also indicates significant differences occur in the down-regulation of initiation pathways after S phase entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c16">16</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian cells, lack of a definitive genetic assay has precluded identification of the <italic>cis-</italic>acting elements required for replicator function (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c17">17</xref>). Comparison of initiation sites mapped by biochemical and physical methods has failed to identify an ACS-like sequence, nor has vertebrate ORC been reported to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Nonetheless, numerous studies show replication initiates at preferred sites in mammalian chromosomes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c18">18</xref>), and recent work demonstrates that these preferred sites are used in multiple cell cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c19">19</xref>). Examination of origin selection during the cell cycle indicates that specific initiation sites are identified after mitosis during early G<sub>1</sub> by factors that are subject to regulation by cell cycle-dependent kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c21">21</xref>). Elements of nuclear structure, including attachment to the nuclear matrix, have been proposed to provide the critical determinants that lead to selection of specific initiation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c22">22</xref>). Based on these and other studies, we have proposed that transcription factors and other DNA binding proteins expressed upon exit from mitosis act upstream of ORC to identify those sites in mammalian chromatin where initiation complexes are assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c23">23</xref>).</p><p>To address this possibility we have searched for proteins that interact with ori&#x003b2;, a short region located 17 kb downstream from the 3&#x02032; end of the Chinese hamster <italic>dhfr</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c24">24</xref>). Biochemical and physical mapping studies, including those using 2D gel analysis of replication intermediates, have shown initiation of DNA replication begins with high frequency at ori&#x003b2; (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c18">18</xref>). We have sequenced ori&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c25">25</xref>) and characterized it with regard to structural features such as bent DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c26">26</xref>), an unusual GC-rich Z-triplex motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c28">28</xref>) and DNA unwinding elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c25">25</xref>). Protein binding studies <italic>in vitro</italic> show ori&#x003b2; contains binding sites for Oct1, AP-1 and RIP60 (replication initiation-region protein 60 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c30">30</xref>). In addition to inducing DNA bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c26">26</xref>), dimers of RIP60 purified from HeLa cell nuclear extract bind to two inverted ATT-rich sites within ori&#x003b2; and dimer&#x02013;dimer interactions mediate the formation of a 720 bp twisted DNA loop <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c31">31</xref>).</p><p>Because DNA looping has been implicated in the regulation of initiation of DNA replication in both plasmids and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c34">34</xref>), we have cloned the cDNA for RIP60 and characterized its DNA binding and DNA looping activities. RIP60 contains three clusters of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger (ZF) motifs, two of which bind RIP60 sites specifically <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here we show that the central cluster (hand Z2) and a portion of an associated proline-rich protein multimerization domain are sufficient for both high affinity DNA binding and DNA looping by RIP60. Using activation of the polyomavirus origin of replication as a functional assay, we also show that RIP60 is not a replication enhancer akin to upstream transcription factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligonucleotide primers</title><p>The following oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by a combination of denaturing gel electrophoresis and gel elution:</p><p>p512 (5&#x02032;-GGCAGATCTGGCCTGTCTGTGAAT-3&#x02032;);</p><p>p520 (5&#x02032;-CCTCTAGATCTGTTCTATATCAGATTG-3&#x02032;);</p><p>p521 (5&#x02032;-GGTCCGGATCCCTAGTTTTGATGAGGG-3&#x02032;);</p><p>OCH7 (5&#x02032;-GATCTTTTATTATTATTATTAGTTCG-3&#x02032;);</p><p>OCH8 (5&#x02032;-GATCCGAACTAATAATAATAATAAAA-3&#x02032;);</p><p>OCH13 (5&#x02032;&#x02013;GATCCGGGAAGGCGGGCGCTGGGGGCGCTGC-GGCGCTGCGCTCCACCT-3&#x02032;);</p><p>OCH14 (5&#x02032;-GATCTAGGTGGAGCGCAGCGCCGCAGCGCCCC-CAGCGCCCGCCTTCCCG-3&#x02032;);</p><p>OCH35 (5&#x02032;-GCATAATAAAAAAAATTAGT-3&#x02032;);</p><p>OCH36 (5&#x02032;-ACTAATTTTTTTTATTTATGC-3&#x02032;);</p><p>OCH37 (5&#x02032;-CTGTTTTTTTTAGTATTAAGC-3&#x02032;);</p><p>OCH38 (5&#x02032;-GCTTAATACTAAAAAAAACAG-3&#x02032;);</p><p>OCH39 (5&#x02032;-GATCTTAACAGTAATAATAAATATCT-3&#x02032;);</p><p>OCH40 (5&#x02032;-GATCAGATATTTATTATTACTGTTAA-3&#x02032;);</p><p>RIP1 (5&#x02032;-GACCCGGGATCCATGCTGGAACGTCGTTGCAGG-3&#x02032;);</p><p>RIP2 (5&#x02032;-GACCCGGGATCCGGGAGATGCCGTCGACCGC-3&#x02032;);</p><p>RIP3 (5&#x02032;-GACCCGGGATCCGTACCTCTGAAACCGGCCCAG-3&#x02032;);</p><p>RIP4 (5&#x02032;-GACCCGGGATCCTCAGACATCGTGCTTCTTCTG-3&#x02032;);</p><p>RIP5 (5&#x02032;-GACCCGGGATCCTGGGCCGGTTCCAGAGGTACC-3&#x02032;);</p><p>RIP6 (5&#x02032;-GACCCGGGATCCGCGGTCGACGGCATCTCCACC-3&#x02032;);</p><p>RIP7 (5&#x02032;-GACCCGGGATCCGAATTCTCGCTTGTGAATCTTGCT-GTGAGACAGC-3&#x02032;);</p><p>RIP8 (5&#x02032;-GACCCGGGATCCTCCGAGGGGTCGGCCCAGGCG-3&#x02032;);</p><p>RIP9 (5&#x02032;-GACCCGGGATCCGAGGGAGGGGGGGGCTTCGA-TCGG-3&#x02032;);</p><p>RIP10 (5&#x02032;-GACCCGGGATCCGAATTCTACAGCTGCGACGAC-TGCGGCAGGAGC-3&#x02032;).</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of plasmids and strains for the one hybrid screen in yeast</title><p>Plasmid pBM2389 contains a histidine reporter gene regulated by an enhancerless P<sub>GAL1-UAS</sub> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c35">35</xref>). pBM2389 contains a TRP1 selectable marker and CEN&#x0002f;ARS sequences for plasmid maintenance.

Sequence analysis of tryptic RIP60 fragments identified two amino acid sequences, VAEALEEAAAK and NLVSHRRIHTGERPYA, the second of which is similar to a Kruppel C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-type zinc finger (ZF) DNA-binding motif (L.Dailey and L.Zeltser, unpublished results). Repeated attempts to clone the cDNA for RIP60 by PCR based on the peptide sequences failed. Because scanning transmission electron microscopy indicated RIP60 binds DNA as a homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c31">31</xref>), we reasoned a one hybrid screen in yeast might provide the specificity necessary to clone the RIP60 cDNA. The screen in yeast was devised to identify proteins that bind the RIP60 DSR target sequence and activate expression of a linked reporter gene (lacZ or histidine) by recruiting a fused GAL4 transcriptional activation domain (GAD) to the promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f1">1</xref>A).</p><p>From 14 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> primary transformants, 37 fusion proteins that specifically activate lacZ expression in yeast strains YCH4 and YCH5, but not YCH3, were identified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f1">1</xref>B and C). Sequence analysis indicated that 16 overlapping clones (clone class 134B) share significant similarity to a cDNA for an HMG protein expressed in a mouse carcinoma cell line, two encode the human Oct2 transcription factor, and eight overlapping clones (class 146A) encode a protein with multiple C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> ZF motifs. Specificity tests indicated that each of the eight clones from the latter group encode fusion proteins that require RIP60 target sequences to induce lacZ reporter expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f1">1</xref>C and data not shown).</p><p>Using clone 146A-1 as probe, a HeLa cDNA phage library was used to isolate the full-length cDNA for the ZF protein. Two clones with poly(A) tails of different lengths but otherwise identical cDNA sequence were isolated. The 2.9 kb cDNA of pBS-27 has 129 bp of untranslated 5&#x02032; sequence, an open reading frame that encodes a 567 amino acid protein of 63 kDa, and 1124 bp of 3&#x02032; non-translated sequence including the poly(A) tail. Sequence analysis shows the open reading frame includes the two RIP60 peptides (underlined), 15 Kruppel-like C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> ZF motifs (in bold), and a proline-rich region between ZFs 8 and 9 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f2">2</xref>A). The 15 ZFs are organized in three clusters, which we refer to as hand Z1 (ZF 1&#x02013;5), Z2 (ZF 6&#x02013;8) and Z3 (ZF 9&#x02013;15) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f2">2</xref>B). Other than the ZF motifs, no regions of homology to other proteins were identified. Based on the DNA binding specificity (see below), predicted molecular weight, and the presence of the two novel peptide sequences, we concluded that the 2.9 kb cDNA of clone pBS-27 encodes RIP60.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence-specific binding by hands Z1 and Z2</title><p>The RIP60 cDNA and various truncated versions of the RIP60 open reading frame were inserted into several expression vectors for production of GST fusion proteins in bacteria, and HA and GFP-tagged proteins in mammalian cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f3">3</xref>A). We first examined the expression and localization of the HA- and GFP-tagged fusion proteins in mammalian cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that each recombinant HA-tagged fusion protein was expressed in mouse NIH 3T3 cells in accord with its predicted size (data not shown). Despite the lack of an obvious nuclear localization signal, fluorescence microscopy of transfected CHOC 400 and NIH 3T3 cells also showed that each RIP60 GFP fusion protein was localized primarily in the cell nucleus (data not shown).</p><p>RIP60 purified from HeLa nuclear extract binds specifically to two inverted ATT-rich sequences within ori&#x003b2;, as determined by DNase I footprinting, competitive gel shift analysis and scanning transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c31">31</xref>). To map the DNA binding domains of RIP60, GST fusion proteins containing hands Z1, Z2 and Z3 (and combinations thereof) were used in gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting assays. Expression of full-length RIP60 (Z123) was difficult in bacteria: &#x0003c;10&#x00025; of the full-length RIP60 GST-fusion protein was observed after induction as compared to constructs for Z1, Z2 or Z3 (data not shown). Therefore binding studies were also performed with nuclear extracts from mouse NIH 3T3 cells transfected with a mammalian expression vector containing the human RIP60 coding sequence (pCMV-HA-Z123).</p><p>Competitive gel shift analyses showed that full-length RIP60 (HA-Z123) binds to the DSR probe in the presence of a 1000-fold molar excess of IBF, SV-AT and Py-AT competitors, and that binding is competed by a 10-fold excess of DSR DNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f3">3</xref>B). Because the AT-rich sequences from the SV40 and polyomavirus origins of replication (SV-AT and Py-AT) failed to compete for binding, we conclude that RIP60 binds the ATT-rich DSR specifically, and is not a general AT-rich DNA binding protein. Addition of anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 to nuclear extract from cells transfected with pCMV-HA-Z123 supershifted the putative HA-Z123&#x0002f;DSR complex, verifying that the specific DNA-binding activity resulted from expression of HA-tagged RIP60 (data not shown).</p><p>Binding of GST-Z1 to the DSR probe was eliminated by a 100-fold excess of DSR competitor DNA, but was not significantly affected by large molar excesses of the IBF, SV-AT or Py-AT competitors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f3">3</xref>B). A slight competitive effect was observed in the presence of 1000-fold excess of Py-AT competitor DNA. Binding of the GST-Z2 to the DSR probe was stable in the presence of 1000-fold excess of IBF, SV-AT or Py-AT competitors, but was competed with 100-fold excess of unlabeled DSR DNA. Similar binding specificities were observed for GST-Z12 and GST-Z23 (data not shown). In contrast, binding of GST-Z3 to the DSR probe was eliminated by a 1000-fold excess of all unlabeled competitors tested. From these results we conclude that GST-Z123, GST-Z1, GST-Z12, GST-Z2 and GST-Z23 all bind specifically to the DSR from ori&#x003b2;. In a similar manner, the USR was also able to compete for binding of these proteins to the DSR (data not shown). These results are consistent with our previous findings using purified RIP60 and indicate that RIP60 binds specifically to the USR and DSR ATT-rich target sites, but not all AT-rich sequences.</p></sec><sec><title>GST-Z2 forms multimers on DNA</title><p>To examine the interaction of RIP60 and hands Z1 and Z2 with the DSR in more detail, <italic>in vitro</italic> DNase I footprinting assays were performed with end-labeled DHFR-E, a 250 bp bent DNA fragment which contains the DSR and a neighboring consensus AP-1 binding site. DNase I footprinting assays with RIP60 purified from HeLa cell nuclear extract showed that the protein protects the ATT-rich DSR sequence on the top strand of DHFR-E from nucleotide position 3461 to position 3481, and from position 3476 to position 3461 on the bottom strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c30">30</xref>). Binding of RIP60 to the DSR also induces a characteristic nuclease hypersensitive site at position 3483 that borders the protected sequences on the top strand.</p><p>GST-RIP60 protected the DSR sequences from DNase I digestion on both the top strand (position 3461&#x02013;3481) and bottom strand (position 3476&#x02013;3461) of the DHFR-E probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f4">4</xref>A and B), while little protection from nuclease cleavage was observed outside of the DSR target (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f4">4</xref>A and B, lane&#x000a0;20). While the region of nuclease protection provided by GST-RIP60 mapped to the same nucleotide residues observed in footprinting experiments using native RIP60, the recombinant fusion protein did not induce hypersensitive sites within flanking sequences on either the top or bottom strands of the DHFR-E probe.</p><p>GST fusion proteins possessing either the Z1 or Z2 domains (GST-Z1, GST-Z2, GST-Z12, GST-Z23) protected the same DSR sequences on both strands of the DHFR-E probe from nuclease digestion as did GST-RIP60 and native RIP60 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f4">4</xref>A and B, and ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c30">30</xref>). Fusion proteins containing hand Z2 induced multiple hypersensitive sites on the top strand of DHFR-E (arrows), including the prominent site at position 3483 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f4">4</xref>A, open arrow). At higher protein concentrations both GST-Z2 (lanes 5&#x02013;7) and GST-Z23 (lanes 15&#x02013;17) protected sequences extending through the AP-1 site toward the end of DHFR-E. In contrast, GST-Z3 did not protect any sequence on either strand of the DHFR-E probe from DNase I cleavage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f4">4</xref>A and B, lanes 8&#x02013;10). These results are consistent with the gel shift experiments which indicate that Z3 domain of RIP60 does not recognize the DSR. GST-Z12 bound the DSR and produced the same nuclease protection patterns as GST-Z1 or GST-Z2, but it did not induce nuclease hypersensitive sites on either strand of the DHFR-E probe that were observed with GST-Z2 or GST-Z23. Rather the pattern of nuclease protection and hypersensitivity induced by GST-Z12 was virtually identical to that of GST-RIP60 (or Z123). Failure to observe extended footprints by GST-RIP60 may have resulted from difficulty in producing the full-length protein in bacteria.</p><p>The footprinting results demonstrated that GST-RIP60, and truncated forms of RIP60 that contained either domains Z1 or Z2, bound specifically to the DSR target, protecting both strands of the bent DNA region from DNase I cleavage in a manner similar to the full length protein. The observation that GST-Z2 and GST-Z23, at higher protein concentrations, protected sequences adjacent to the DSR also suggests that sequences within hand Z2 are sufficient for multimerization of RIP60 on DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Specific binding of GST-Z2 is more stable than that of GST-Z1</title><p>Both GST-Z1 and GST-Z2 bound the DSR and USR specifically in footprinting and gel shift experiments, suggesting that RIP60 contains two independent domains capable of recognizing ATT-rich binding sites. To ascertain if Z1 and Z2 show any differences in binding activity, we examined the stability of Z1 and Z2 complexes with the DSR in competition gel shift assays. Identical amounts of GST-Z1 and GST-Z2 were incubated with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled probe for 20 min, and then a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor DSR was added. Samples were removed from the binding reactions at various times thereafter and loaded directly onto non-denaturing gels running at low voltage. After all the samples were loaded, the voltage was increased to 100 V for 1 h. After drying the gels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f5">5</xref>A and B), the signals in the shifted complexes were quantified by phosphoimaging. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f5">5</xref>C the CPM within the protein&#x0002f;DNA complexes are expressed as a percentage of the total signal per lane (i.e. bound probe over bound plus free probe).

For ligation enhancement assays, the URS and DRS RIP60 binding sites were separated by ~6 kb by linearizing pCH127 with <italic>Acc</italic>I. In the linear pCH127 substrate, the USR and DSR sites are located 300 and 450 bp from the DNA ends, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f6">6</xref>A).</p><p>In the absence of protein or ligase, only the linear pCH127 plasmid template was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f6">6</xref>B, lane 1), while the addition of ligase alone for 5 min (lane 2) generated two ligation products. The addition of GST-Z1 or GST-Z3 had little effect on the plasmid ligation products when compared to ligase alone (compare lanes 3 and 5 to lane 2 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f6">6</xref>B). The addition of GST-Z2 (lane 4), GST-Z12 (lane 6) or GST-RIP60 (lane 8) altered the distribution of ligation products, resulting in the formation of more slowly migrating bands. The addition of GST-Z23 (lane 7) had no effect in this experiment. The presence of DSR competitor inhibited the ability of GST-Z2 to enhance plasmid ligation (lane 9), while the presence of an excess amount of the SV-AT competitor DNA had no effect (lane 10). These results indicate that binding of GST-Z2 to the linear pCH127 plasmid at the USR and DSR was required to enhance ligation of the template under these conditions. The ligation products induced by GST-Z2 also required 5&#x02032;-phosphates on the substrate, as prior dephosphorylation of the linear pCH127 template with calf intestinal phosphatase prevented GST-Z2 ability to enhance plasmid ligation (lane 11).</p><p>To assess the role of the PRR in DNA looping, we compared the binding activity of GST-Z2 to GST-Z2&#x00394;P in gel mobility shift, ligation enhancement and AFM DNA looping assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f7">7</xref>). At equivalent protein concentrations GST-Z2 bound the DSR probe more avidly than GST-Z2&#x00394;P (compare lanes 2&#x02013;4 to lanes 5&#x02013;7, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f7">7</xref>A). While the weak binding of GST-Z2&#x00394;P was specific (data not shown), it did not form multimers on the gel shift probe as did GST-Z2 (arrows, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f7">7</xref>A). In ligation enhancement assays, addition of ligase alone for 20 min resulted in a broader spectrum of ligation products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f7">7</xref>B, lane 3) as compared to the addition of ligase for 5 min (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f6">6</xref>B, lane 2). As before, addition of GST-Z2 markedly increased the efficiency of end-to-end ligation of linear pCH127 (lanes 6&#x02013;8), yielding products similar to those observed with ligase alone after 20 min (lane 3). GST-Z2&#x00394;P, at any protein concentration tested, had no effect (lanes 9&#x02013;11). These results suggest that the PRR is involved in protein&#x02013;DNA and&#x0002f;or protein&#x02013;protein interactions required for DNA looping by RIP60.</p><p>To confirm these results, we examined DNA binding of GST-Z2 and GST-Z2&#x00394;P to linear pCH127 by AFM. In the presence of GST-Z2, looping between the upstream and downstream binding sites was readily evident (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f7">7</xref>C). In several instances the ends of the linear pCH127 DNA were observed to protrude from the looped DNA complex (arrows, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f7">7</xref>C). When GST-Z2&#x00394;P was used in AFM experiments, stable binding to the USR or DSR on the linear DNA substrate was rarely observed, and loops between the two sites were not detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f7">7</xref>D).</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of RIP60 on activation of the polyomavirus origin of replication</title><p>In an attempt to study the effects of RIP60 expression on DNA replication, we used a polyomavirus (Py)-based transient plasmid replication assay. The Py core origin requires an enhancer for activity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c48">48</xref>). When the enhancer element is replaced with binding sites for a variety transcription factors, the cognate transcription factors are able to stimulate Py origin-dependent plasmid replication, providing the transcription factors contain a transcriptional activation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c48">48</xref>). For example, the heterodimeric transcription factor complex of Fos and Jun (AP-1) has been shown to enhance replication from the polyomavirus origin of replication through the agency of AP-1 binding sites located in the enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c49">49</xref>). The polyomavirus origin-dependent plasmid replication assay utilized four plasmid components: (i) a reporter plasmid containing the Py core origin of replication that harbors protein recognition sequences in place of the native viral enhancer region; (ii) a Py large T-antigen expression plasmid required for replication of the reporter plasmid; (iii) effector plasmids expressing HA-tagged RIP60 fusion proteins or control transcription factors; and (iv) unmethylated pUC19 plasmid DNA (pUC19<sup>&#x02013;</sup>) which serves as an internal control for transfection efficiency and plasmid recovery. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f8">8</xref>A, the reporter plasmids used here were derived from pPyOICAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c44">44</xref>) and contained either six AP-1 binding sites (pPy-AM<sub>6</sub>-OICAT), the 250 bp DHFR-E fragment (pPy-DHFR-E-OICAT), or the 5x-DSR fragment (pCH30).</p><p>As a positive control, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the pPy(AM)<sub>6</sub>OICAT reporter plasmid in the absence or presence of Fos and Jun effector plasmids. Consistent with the results of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c49">49</xref>), we observed that coexpression of Fos and Jun stimulated replication of the pPy(AM)<sub>6</sub>OICAT reporter by ~40-fold over control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f8">8</xref>B, lane 4). In contrast, expression of RIP60 increased replication of a reporter plasmid with five copies of the DSR in the enhancer region (pCH30) only ~3.5-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f8">8</xref>B, lane 10). RIP60 had no effect on replication of the enhancerless plasmid OICAT (lane 6) or on the DHFR-E plasmid with a single binding site in context of the bent DNA sequence (lane 8). These results and sequence analysis indicate that RIP60 does not contain a potent transcriptional transactivation domain, which was independently confirmed in transcription enhancer assays (P.Held and N.Heintz, unpublished data).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The steps involved in origin recognition in animal cells are unknown. We have proposed that mammalian replication origins are multipartite regulatory elements that resemble transcriptional promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c23">23</xref>). In this model, ORC and its associated factors are considered the functional counterparts of basal transcription factors in that these proteins are used for all replication initiation events, regardless of cell type or time of activation during the S phase. As cells exit mitosis, we suggest that transcription factors and other DNA binding proteins establish a coordinated program of transcription and replication for the ensuing cell cycle. Similar to their effects on gene promoters, the binding of sequence-specific factors may modify local chromatin environment, distort DNA structure, or promote the binding of ORC or other replication factors. Introducing an origin identification step upstream of ORC that depends on site-specific DNA binding proteins would provide for flexibility in origin selection in different cell types, facilitate coordination between gene transcription and replication, and account for the heterogeneity in origin sequences that have been described to date.</p><p>To identify proteins that might participate in establishment of the replication program for the <italic>dhfr</italic> gene, footprinting and gel shift experiments were used to identify protein binding sites in the <italic>dhfr</italic> ori-&#x003b2; region. These studies showed ori&#x003b2; binds AP-1 and Oct1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c29">29</xref>) and led to the identification of RIP60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c30">30</xref>). Recently, high resolution mapping of short replication intermediates have placed the USR RIP60 site in the precise center of a <italic>dhfr</italic> origin of bidirectional DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c50">50</xref>). At this time, however, there is no formal evidence that RIP60 or any other sequence-specific DNA binding protein is involved in ori&#x003b2; activity.</p><p>Here we describe the cloning and initial characterization of RIP60. Due to the high number of ZFs in RIP60, PCR-based cloning from RIP60 peptide sequences was unsuccessful. Because RIP60 binds the DSR as a homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c31">31</xref>), we reasoned a one hybrid screen in yeast might provide the specificity required to distinguish RIP60 from the hundreds of other ZF proteins expressed in mammalian cells. Indeed, the one hybrid screen proved remarkably efficient, resulting in the isolation of multiple overlapping cDNAs for RIP60, each of which encoded fusion proteins that included hand Z2 (ZFs 6&#x02013;8) and the PRR. More important, no other ZF protein was recovered in the screen, suggesting that the screen was both sensitive and specific.</p><p>RIP60 purified from HeLa cell nuclear extract produces a footprint of ~20 bp over both strands of the DSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c30">30</xref>). Footprinting and gel shift experiments indicate that the N-terminal five ZFs of hand Z1 and the central three ZFs of hand Z2 are sufficient for specific binding to both the DSR and USR sites in ori&#x003b2; (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f4">4</xref>). While GST-Z1 and GST-Z2 independently recapitulate many of the features of the RIP60 footprint on the DSR, binding of GST-Z1 to either the USR or the DSR is unstable relative to GST-Z2, GST-Z1 does not form multimers on DNA or mediate DNA looping (not shown), and GST-Z1 has no activity in ligation enhancement assays. In contrast, the GST-Z2 fusion that contains 37 amino acids from the PRR is capable of binding both the USR and DSR <italic>in vitro</italic>, multimerizing on DNA, and forming a DNA loop in excess of 6 kb (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f7">7</xref>). GST-Z3 binds DNA, but does not bind the USR or DSR <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Based on the studies with the GST fusion proteins, we conclude that GST-Z2 supports both the sequence-specific recognition of the USR and DSR and the protein&#x02013;protein interactions required for looping <italic>in vitro</italic>. Because deletion of the PRR reduces the stability of DNA binding by hand Z2 as well as eliminates looping, at this time we cannot ascribe the DNA looping activity directly to the PRR. However, the PRR does contain three consensus sequences for polyproline helices, which have been implicated in protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c51">51</xref>). We are presently examining how binding to DNA facilitates the protein&#x02013;protein interactions required for looping. Because the PRR appears to be required for both stable binding and multimerization on DNA, our present data suggests binding and looping includes the following steps. First, GST-Z2 binds the USR and DSR sites in a site-specific manner and nucleates the assembly of protein multimers on neighboring DNA sequences. It is evident from the footprinting experiments that ZFs 6&#x02013;8 in hand Z2 are able to stably bind DNA sequences that border the DSR once Z2 has bound the DSR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd141f4">4</xref>A and B); these multimers may occupy several hundred base pairs of DNA. A specific binding site appears to be required for nucleating multimerization, as addition of specific DSR competitor to the ligation enhancement assays inhibits looping. Second, because GST-Z2 does not aggregate in solution (data not shown), DNA binding may alter the conformation of ZFs 6&#x02013;8 and&#x0002f;or the PRR such that the inter-molecular protein&#x02013;protein interactions between distantly bound multimers required for DNA looping are favored. Finally, competition assays suggest formation of the DNA loop stabilizes both protein&#x02013;DNA and protein&#x02013;protein interactions in the loop, as has been observed for EBNA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c53">53</xref>).</p><p>Despite strong DNA binding and looping <italic>in vitro</italic>, full length RIP60 and various derivatives thereof do not have significant replication enhancer activity in the polyoma origin-dependent plasmid replication assay. Other work has shown that neither RIP60 binding sites nor RIP60 itself stimulate the expression of reporter genes in transient transfection assays (P.Held and N.H.Heintz, unpublished data). Together with sequence analysis, these results indicate that RIP60 does not contain a transcription transactivation domain. Thus, like many other polydactyl ZF proteins of unknown function, RIP60 does not appear to be a transcription factor.</p><p>Despite lack of a transactivation domain, RIP60 has several properties similar to the origin binding protein EBNA1, which is required for the replication and maintenance of Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). EBNA1, which has no inherent enzymatic activity involved in replication, binds as a homodimer to two sets of related sequences in EBV oriP <italic>in vitro</italic> and fosters the formation of a 900 bp DNA loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c34">34</xref>). Presumably EBNA1 acts in replication by interacting with cellular replication factors such as RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c54">54</xref>). Like EBNA1, RIP60 appears to have no inherent enzymatic activity, binds as a homodimer to two sets of sequences within an origin region, and induces the formation of a 720 bp DNA loop.</p><p>Few of the hundreds of polydactyl ZF proteins that have been sequenced have been assigned a function, and given that RIP60 was not found in the public databases, clearly more remain to be discovered. While originally described as a DNA binding motif, ZFs have been implicated in binding RNA, binding RNA&#x0002f;DNA hybrids, and protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd141c55">55</xref>). A homodimer of RIP60 bound to DNA would include 30&#x000a0;ZFs, only a portion of which are likely to be in contact with DNA. The remaining ZFs could be involved in binding RNA, other distal DNA sequences, or even other proteins. Dissection of the cellular function of RIP60 will require further work, such as genomic footprinting and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments to ascertain the binding activity of RIP60 at ori&#x003b2; during the cell cycle.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd141f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> One hybrid screen in yeast for RIP60.
