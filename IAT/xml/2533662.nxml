The kidney, the main site of RBP4 catabolism, contributes to an elevation of RBP4 levels during chronic kidney disease (CKD) whereas during chronic liver disease (CLD) RBP4 levels decrease. Little is known about RBP4 isoforms including apo-RBP4, holo-RBP4 as well as RBP4 truncated at the C-terminus (RBP4-L and RBP4-LL) except that RBP4 isoforms have been reported to be increased in hemodialysis patients. Since it is not known whether CLD influence RBP4 isoforms, we investigated RBP4 levels, apo- and holo-RBP4 as well as RBP4-L and RBP4-LL in plasma of 36 patients suffering from CKD, in 55 CLD patients and in 50 control subjects. RBP4 was determined by ELISA and apo- and holo-RBP4 by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).

The binding of ROH to RBP4 guarantees the homeostatic regulation of plasma ROH levels, which are an essential aspect for a variety of physiological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Recently, RBP4 levels have been reported to be elevated in insulin resistant subjects as well as in subjects with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These diseases involve liver and kidney disorders in late stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In healthy individuals RBP4 is mainly synthesized in the liver and secreted into the circulation in a 1:1:1 complex with ROH (holo-RBP4) and transthyretin (TTR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The binding with TTR increases the molecular weight of RBP4 and thus prevents its glomerular filtration and catabolism in the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. After releasing ROH into the target cells the remaining apo-RBP4 (unbound ROH) is rapidly filtered through the glomeruli and subsequently reabsorbed in the proximal tubular cells via the megalin-cubulin receptor complex and catabolized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Importantly, dysfunctions of both, the liver and kidneys, are known to influence RBP4 homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]: chronic kidney diseases (CKD) and chronic liver diseases (CLD) interfere with RBP4 metabolism through their action on RBP4 synthesis and catabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>RBP4 has been reported to occur in different isoforms in serum, namely holo-RBP4 (RBP4 bound to ROH) and apo-RBP4, which remains after the release of ROH into the target cell. In addition, little is known about RBP4 isoforms resulting from the truncation of RBP4: RBP4-L, which is truncated at one C-terminal leucine molecule (Leu-183), and RBP4-LL, which is truncated at a second leucine molecule (Leu-182 and Leu-183). The relative amounts of apo-RBP4 are increased in rats during acute renal failure and RBP4-L and RBP4-LL have been shown to be increased in hemo-dialysis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It is assumed that renal dysfunction is closely linked to an increased occurrence of apo-RBP4 as well as RBP4-L and RBP4-LL in serum. However, sufficient data in these patients are lacking. In addition, it is unknown whether the liver, as site of RBP4 synthesis, may also contribute to the occurrence of RBP4 isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Thus, we examined RBP4 levels and isoforms in plasma of patients suffering from various CLD, as well as in patients with CKD, and compared the results with those obtained from healthy controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Anthropometric and clinical parameters</title><p>Anthropometric and clinical characteristics of controls, CLD patients and CKD patients are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

Our results also show that RBP4 levels were significantly elevated in serum of CKD patients compared to both, CLD patients and controls. In contrast, RBP4, TTR and ROH levels were significantly decreased in CLD patients, as compared to CKD patients and controls.</p><p><italic>Jaconi et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] investigated RBP4-L and RBP4-LL in the serum of hemo-dialysis patients and regarded the occurrence of RBP4 isoforms to be specific for CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To date, RBP4 isoforms have been investigated exclusively in a small number of patients ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], respectively) suffering from CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and not in CLD patients. Our data show that RBP4-L and RBP4-LL, which are truncated at the C-terminal end of the molecule, were increased in CKD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In contrast to that, in CLD patients &#x02013; irrespective of the kind of liver disease &#x02013; there were no increased amounts of RBP4-L and RBP4-LL, thus supporting the relation between RBP4 isoforms and kidney function. The increased survival and retention of RBP4 in the circulation during CKD may contribute to the increased truncation of RBP4. Although there is evidence that a specific carboxypeptidase is responsible for the truncation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], the physiological impact of RBP4-L and RBP4-LL is not known. However, RBP4-L and RBP4-LL isolated from CKD serum, inhibit chemotaxis and oxidative metabolism of polymorphonuclear leucocytes. These alterations in leucocytes activity may disturb immune defense in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition, the C-terminal end of RBP4 is involved in ROH binding, and therefore, RBP4 modifications may also influence the interaction with TTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, we confirmed that RBP4, TTR and ROH levels in various liver diseases were markedly depressed, particularly in patients with c2-cirrhosis or hepato-cellular carcinoma, which is in accordance with results of previously published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This decrease is due to a loss of functional hepatic tissue resulting in decreased synthesis of RBP4 and TTR and decreased release of the ROH-transport complex into the circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>In patients with CKD, the levels of RBP4 were markedly elevated and therefore the molar ratio of RBP4 to TTR was increased. In healthy states, TTR is present in a 3&#x02013;5 fold molar excess in plasma and the serum RBP4/TTR ratio is approximately 0.4 whereas in CKD patients an increase in the RBP4/TTR molar ratio up to 1.06 has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This is consistent with the 3-fold elevated RBP4/TTR ratio from 0.36 in controls to 0.96 in CKD in our study. Due to the increase of RBP4 and the simultaneous fall in TTR levels in CKD, almost one molecule of TTR and one molecule of RBP4 are present in the circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The decrease in TTR levels in CKD may be due to malnutrition and/or infectious disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The kidneys play an important role in the recycling of RBP4 since RBP4 catabolism is disturbed in CKD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. According to previous studies elevated serum creatinine levels, a marker for kidney dysfunction, are associated with high serum concentrations of RBP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This is due to the loss of functional tissue and/or the entire nephron in kidney failure, which leads to decreased filtration of creatinine and abnormal survival of small serum proteins resulting in an increase of their serum levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This might explain the increased RBP4 levels in CKD (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Under physiological conditions 98% of RBP4 is bound to ROH (holo-RBP4) and 2% circulate ROH free as apo-RBP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In this study we show that the percentage of plasma apo-RBP4 is highly increased in CKD patients compared to controls and CLD patients, thus supporting early findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Nearly all of the apo-RBP4 is normally glomerularly filtered and reabsorbed by the kidney proximal convoluted tubules. The increase in the molar ratio of RBP4 to ROH in our CKD patients indicates an excess of RBP4 over ROH, leading to an increase in RBP4 unbound to ROH, which is consistent with the increase in apo-RBP4. The altered holo- to apo-RBP4-ratio in CKD complies also with previous results indicating that impaired kidney function compromises sufficient metabolisation of apo-RBP4 from serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This finding is confirmed by the correlation of apo-RBP4 and serum creatinine in our study.</p><p>The alterations in RBP4 metabolism during CKD are of interest in relation to T2DM since T2DM patients are exposed to increased oxidative stress which has been reported to be linked to endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It is known that T2DM patients often suffer from kidney dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and therefore the RBP4-L and RBP4-LL may further enhance oxidative stress through their action on polymorphonuclear leucocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the study show that the disturbed catabolism of RBP4 in CKD results in an increase in RBP4 isoforms including apo-RBP4, RBP4-L and RBP4-LL &#x02013; whereas the generation of RBP4 isoforms is not influenced by liver function. However, both CKD and CLD do influence serum RBP4 levels. Since the increase in RBP4 isoforms was not observed in patients suffering from various CLD, the important physiological function of the kidneys in that context is emphasized and it may be suggested that impaired catabolism of RBP4 in the kidneys leads to an accumulation of RBP4 isoforms in serum. These results support the hypothesis that the C-terminal truncation of RBP4 may be specific during CKD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Sera of 50 healthy subjects were obtained from the Department of Clinical Nutrition, German Institute of Human Nutrition, Potsdam-Rehbr&#x000fc;cke, Germany.

Therefore peaks were analysed "valley-to-valley" and are expressed as percentage of non-truncated RBP4 (nRBP4).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of relative amounts of apo- and holo-RBP4</title><p>Relative amounts of holo-RBP4 and apo-RBP4 in serum were assessed by using nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) with subsequent immunoblotting analysis. Under these conditions retinol remains bound to RBP4 and due to the higher molecular weight of holo-RBP4 (+ 286 Da), two bands may be detected. The PAGE was performed according to Siegenthaler and Saurat with slight modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Briefly, the resolving gel was prepared using 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide and 0.05% ammoniumpersulfate (APS) and 0.075% N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) as crosslinker in 0.375 Tris/HCl, pH 8.8. The stacking gel (4% acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 0.05% APS, 0.1% TEMED) was prepared in 0.125 M Tris/HCl, pH 6.8. 10 &#x003bc;l of serum diluted 1:20 in sample buffer (0.125 Tris/HCl, 2.74 M glycerol, 0.1 mM bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) was applied to each slot, with 12 samples per gel. The electrophoresis conditions were 25 mA per gel for 30 to 45 min at room temperature. The proteins were separated according to their electrophoretic mobilities and subsequently transferred onto a polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) sheet. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using rabbit anti-human RBP4 (Dako) and peroxidase-coupled swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Dako). Antibody binding was visualized using the Luminol reaction (BM Chemiluminescence Blotting Substrate, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Since the binding of ROH persists under nondenaturating conditions two bands are obtained per lane, apo- and holo-RBP4. Band intensity of both RBP4 isoforms was read with an imager (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) and with the Quantity One<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>software (Bio-Rad). The relative amounts of apo- and holo-RBP4 per lane are expressed as per cent of total intensity of each lane. However, since apo- and holo-RBP4 are the only visible bands, the sum of the relative quantities of both isoforms equals 100% per lane.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical procedures</title><p>Results are shown as medians and interquartile ranges. Statistic calculations were performed using SPSS 14.0 (SPSS statistical package, SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test for significant differences in continuous variables between the groups. If there was a significant effect, Mann-Whitney U-rank test was performed to describe differences in proportions between cases and controls. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were used to test the association between laboratory parameters and variables of ROH-RBP4 transport complex. Values of P &#x0003c; 0.05 were regarded as significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CKD: Chronic kidney disease; CLD: Chronic liver disease; MALDI-TOF-MS: Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; RBP4: Retinol-binding protein 4; T2DM: type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SKF and BN carried out sample analysis and prepared the manuscript.
