The central executioner of apoptosis is a family of aspartic acid-specific cysteine proteases known as caspases. Smac/DIABLO is released from the mitochondria during apoptosis and its stimulation promotes caspases activation by neutralizing members of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) family, such as X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of Smac/DIABLO and XIAP in the control of caspases activation in endometrium of cycling rats. Polyoestrus female rats were sacrificed at each stage of estrous cycle (diestrus, proestrus, estrus, and metestrus). Endometrial protein extracts were collected to perform Western Blot analysis. Alternatively, uterine horns were sectioned for immunohistochemistry (IHC). We and others showed previously the presence of apoptosis at estrus in rat uterine epithelium. In the present study, cleaved caspase-3, -6, and -7 fragments were detected at estrus. IHC confirmed that caspase-3 was present only in luminal and glandular epithelium at estrus. XIAP was highly expressed at estrus in both epithelial and stromal cells. In contrast, expression of Smac/DIABLO was elevated at diestrus, proestrus and metestrus but was minimal at estrus. Treatment of ovariectomized rats with 17&#x003b2;-estradiol induced XIAP expression and inhibited Smac/DIABLO protein expression in the endometrium. Cleaved caspase-3, -6, and -7 fragments increased in endometrial protein extracts following 17&#x003b2;-estradiol treatment. Expression of NF-&#x003ba;B and I&#x003ba;B proteins, and I&#x003ba;B phosphorylation status were detected in the endometrium but were not influenced by the estrous cycle. These findings suggest that Smac/DIABLO and XIAP are regulated differently and may play important roles in the regulation of endometrial cell fate. Moreover, this study confirms a key role for executioner caspases in the control of apoptotic processes at estrus in the rat uterus.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>In the absence of embryonic factors during pre-implantation period in uterine luminal epithelium, glands and stroma cell death is found in a cycling fashion through the estrous cycle by a mechanism known as apoptosis. Estrogens and progesterone are directly responsible for the histological and morphogical changes in the uterus during estrous cycle. Studies have shown that apoptosis was induced in luminal epithelium at estrus in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Other studies have shown that estrogen induces uterine epithelial cell proliferation and estrogen withdrawal results in cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of apoptosis in the uterus. Our group has recently demonstrated that Akt, a serine/threonine protein kinase also known as PKB, is an important kinase involved in the control of endometrial cell proliferation and its expression and phosphorylation/activation are regulated during the estrous cycle, particularly through the action of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We have further showed a decrease in Akt activity at estrus which was accompanied by an increase in apoptosis in luminal epithelial cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Whether downstream Akt targets might be involved in the regulation of proliferation/cell death in the endometrium is unknown.</p><p>X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is a well known inhibitor of caspase-3, -7 and -9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. XIAP belongs to a family of IAP genes which represent critical regulatory factors of apoptosis signaling and regulation. The IAP family also includes c-IAP1 (HIAP2), c-IAP2 (HIAP1), NAIP and Survivin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recently, we demonstrated in rat granulosa cells and human ovarian surface epithelial cancer cells that XIAP overexpression induces Akt phosphorylation/activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Akt is activated by phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 in response to growth factors or cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K). Once phosphorylated Akt has been shown to 1) phosphorylates and blocks the action of several pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and 2) block cytochrome C release from the mitochondria through the regulation of Bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The kinase Akt has been shown to induces phosphorylation of procaspase-9, suggesting that caspase processing and apoptosis can be directly regulated by protein phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This is supported by the observation that an activated form of Akt is able to block apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>At the time of apoptosis induction Smac/DIABLO is released from mitochondria into the cytosol, where it binds to IAPs and enables caspase activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It has been shown that Smac/DIABLO promotes not only the proteolytic activation of procaspase-3 but also the enzymatic activity of mature caspase-3, both of which depend upon its ability to interact physically with IAPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Smac/DIABLO is synthesized with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence that is proteolytically removed during maturation to the mature polypeptide. X-ray crystallography has shown that the first four amino acids (AVPI) of mature Smac/DIABLO bind to a portion of the third BIR (BIR3) domain of XIAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This N-terminal sequence is essential for binding IAPs and blocking their antiapoptotic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Caspases are well known executioners of apoptosis. Once activated from their proactive forms, caspases target important proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). Caspase-3 is one of the key executioner of apoptosis and induces downstream caspase-6 which in turn target cleavage of important structural proteins such as laminin and keratins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Among other caspase targets, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP, 113&#x02013;116 kDa), a nuclear enzyme which is activated during DNA damage, is known to be cleaved by caspases-3 and -7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We have recently demonstrated that Akt is also a target for caspase-3 cleavage, indicating that Akt survival pathway inhibition is an important mechanism for apoptosis activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Although the regulation and importance of XIAP and Smac/DIABLO has been described in other systems and cell types, their expression has not been reported for the uterus. In the present study, we have investigated the regulation of XIAP, Smac/DIABLO, caspase-3, -6 and -7 during the four stages of estrous cycle (proestrus, estrus, metestrus and diestrus) and further analyses were carried out to determine the possible regulation of XIAP and Smac/DIABLO by 17&#x003b2;-estradiol in ovariectomized rats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>XIAP, Smac/DIABLO, NF-&#x003ba;B, I&#x003ba;B, Phospho-I&#x003ba;B and cleaved-caspases antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs (Mississauga, ON).

Rats with three regular cycles of 4 days were used in these experiments and killed at various stages of the estrous cycle (diestrus, proestrus, estrus and metestrus). Uteri were collected and fixed for immunohistochemical staining (IHC) or endometrial protein extracts collected by scraping the endometrium for Western analysis. To determine the effect of estrogen, rats were ovariectomized for at least 10 days and then injected with (17&#x003b2;-estradiol) E<sub>2</sub>. Animals were treated for a total of 3 days and killed after hormone treatment (72 hours) according to previous preliminary time-course studies done in our laboratory (Leblanc et al., unpublished information) and information found in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

After two wash with PBS, slides were then incubated with 0.3 % hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. After washing with PBS, tissues were incubated with blocking serum (Vectastain ABC Kit) at room temperature for 1 h. Then, a primary antibody (XIAP 1:200; Smac/DIABLO 1:100; and cleaved caspase-3 1:100) was added to the slides and incubated at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. After washing 5 min in PBS, tissue sections were incubated for 30 min with 3 &#x003bc;g/ml biotinylated antibody (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse). Subsequently, slides were washed with PBS and incubated with avidin-biotin complex reagent containing horseradish peroxidase for 30 min.

Apoptosis was mainly located in luminal epithelial cells at estrus. On the other hand, cell proliferation was maximal at proestrus as determined by expression of the cell proliferation marker CDC47/MCM7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Since executioner caspases such as caspase-3, -6 and -7 are key proteases involved in the execution of apoptosis, we have investigated, using antibodies specific for activated forms (cleaved fragments), their expression in the endometrium throughout estrous cycle. Caspase-3 fragments were detected in greatest amounts at estrus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Caspase-3 19 KDa fragment was weakly detectable at diestrus and proestrus, maximal at estrus and further reduced at metestrus. Likewise, caspase-3 17 KDa fragment was detected only at estrus and metestrus but was significantly reduced at metestrus compared to estrus. Large cleaved caspase-6 subunit (18 KDa) was absent at diestrus and proestrus, maximal at estrus and reduced at metestrus. Similarly, large cleaved caspase-7 subunit (19 KDa) was weakly detected at diestrus and proestrus, was highly increased at estrus and reduced at metestrus. IHC studies using the antibody specific for cleaved caspase-3 (cleaved caspase-6 and -7 antibodies are not functional for IHC) revealed that cleaved caspase-3 fragment signal was located in apoptotic luminal epithelial cells at estrus and that the signal was absent in proliferative endometrium at proestrus.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Cleaved caspase-3, -6, and -7 expression in rat endometrium during estrous cycle.

We have previously demonstrated in human ovarian cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and rat granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] the importance of XIAP and Akt expression/activity. In the present study, regulation of XIAP and Smac/DIABLO have been investigated in rat uterus to determine their importance and their possible influence on endometrial cell survival/death in relation to the stage of estrous cycle.</p><p>In the present study, expression of XIAP was maximum at estrus and increased in response to E<sub>2 </sub>in ovariectomized rats. XIAP was strongly expressed in luminal and glandular epithelia and stroma during estrus, perhaps to protect these cells from apoptosis. Although stimulation of XIAP by E<sub>2 </sub>is consistent with mitogenic activity and apoptosis inhibitory activity, it is not clear why XIAP expression does not increase during proestrus. A recent study showed that XIAP may be directly regulated by the presence of tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) in rat granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Since it has been shown that TNF-&#x003b1; mRNA expression was high at estrus and was regulated by estrogen in the mouse uterus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], a similar process may be involved in the endometrium. Thus, action of E<sub>2 </sub>on XIAP expression might be indirect and might involve specific factors regulated upstream and/or downstream by this hormone. Whether involvement of TNF-&#x003b1; or other growth factors/cytokines might be involved in this process remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In contrast, Smac/DIABLO was decreased at estrus and E<sub>2 </sub>treatment in ovariectomized rats reduced its expression. These results directly support the mitogenic action of estrogens on endometrial cells. Since Smac/DIABLO is a pro-apoptotic protein, its down-regulation may be sufficient to activate XIAP to inhibit caspase activity. Smac/DIABLO down-regulation also support our results obtained at estrus showing apoptosis predominantly in luminal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and suggest that this pro-apoptotic factor might have a key function in triggering apoptosis at this particular time of rat estrous cycle. There is currently no information available in the literature demonstrating that E<sub>2 </sub>modulates Smac/DIABLO expression and the present findings are the first to demonstrate this mechanism. E<sub>2</sub>treatment resulted in the cleavage of caspase-3, -6 and -7 in endometrial cells. This results was contradictory to the fact that E<sub>2 </sub>induces endometrial cells proliferation rather than inducing activation of the caspase cascade and apoptosis. Although it has been shown that E<sub>2</sub>triggers apoptosis in a preosteoclastic cell line <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and in thymocytes of ovariectomized mice <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], it is unlikely that E<sub>2 </sub>induced apoptosis in the endometrium. This can be explained by the fact that following injection of ovariectomized rats with E<sub>2</sub>, latent endometrial cells are forced to proliferate and they might be in a situation of stress. Indeed, controlling the balance between survival and death factors is a key mechanism in order to maintain homeostasis in the proliferating endometrium. Increased caspase cleavage is not necessarily a sign of apoptosis activation; caspases activity can be blocked by the presence of high levels of XIAP (or other known or unknown inhibitor of apoptosis proteins such as cIAPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]) and the presence of low levels of Smac/DIABLO. This particular mechanism in endometrial cells might be important in order to rapidly induce apoptosis at the appropriate timing (at estrus for instance) through the simple inhibition or degradation of XIAP protein through its ubiquitin protein ligase activity its degradation in proteasomes in response to apoptotic stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Another explanation for the induction of caspase activation in response to E<sub>2 </sub>might be due to the presence and activity of E<sub>2 </sub>metabolites. For example, 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2), a natural metabolite of E<sub>2</sub>, is a potent antitumor and antiangiogenic agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and has been shown to induce apoptosis is several cell type (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]). Furthermore, 2ME2 is currently tested in clinical trials for cancer therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. 2ME2 is a major metabolite of estradiol in human serum and its concentration peaks at mid-cycle, like that of estradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Studies have shown that 2ME2 acts through other signaling pathways than E<sub>2</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. A recent study revealed that 2ME2 treatment resulted in up-regulation of death receptor 5 (DR5) protein expression <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>and rendered cells more sensitive to the cytotoxic activities of the DR5 ligand tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In addition, the latter study demonstrated that 2ME2-induced apoptosis required activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Another recent study also showed induction of caspase-3 and apoptosis in response to 2ME2 in gastric carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. These observation established in other systems and cell types suggest that 2ME2 could be an element of investigation in order to determine how E<sub>2 </sub>might be involved in the induction of caspase cleavage in rat endometrium and the possibility that activation of caspases observed might not be a direct action of E<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Recent studies demonstrated that the transcriptional nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-&#x003ba;B) is a direct downstream target of phosphorylated Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B is sequestered (p65 and p50 subunits) in the cytoplasm by the I&#x003ba;Bs inhibitors which are phosphorylation targets of Akt. Upon phosphorylation I&#x003ba;Bs are released and degradated through ubiquitination and NF-&#x003ba;B enter nucleus for gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In the literature, we found that XIAP promoter is a target for NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Since we have recently demonstrated the activation of Akt in response to 17&#x003b2;-estradiol in rat endometrium and that Akt has been shown to activate NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], we wanted to know if Akt/ NF-&#x003ba;B/I&#x003ba;B pathway might be involved in the regulation of XIAP expression. Results of the present study showed that there was no difference in the expression of NF-&#x003ba;B and I&#x003ba;B nor I&#x003ba;B phosphorylation during the four stages of estrous cycle which exclude the involvement of this pathway in the regulation of XIAP or Smac/DIABLO expression. Other pathways downstream of Akt known to be regulated by this kinase are currently investigated in our laboratory such as eNOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], Bad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x003b2; (GSK-3&#x003b2;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], and caspase-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. A recent report further demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) induced activation of Akt, NF-&#x003ba;B and induced phosphorylation of Forkhead transcription factor (FKHR), which in turn up-regulated a series of intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins such as XIAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Because, FKHR is also a well known target for Akt action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], phosphorylation, activity and regulation of this transcription factor in the uterus needs to be investigated.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study showed for the first time the presence and regulation of XIAP and Smac/DIABLO in the rat endometrium and further demonstrated that these two survival factors are regulated in the opposite direction by E<sub>2</sub>. Further analysis will be necessary to determine more specifically, the intra-cellular and molecular signal transducers involved in the process of apoptosis in the rat reproductive tract and to determine the mechanism by which XIAP and Smac/DIABLO are regulated.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work has been supported by a grant from NSERC (238501-01).
