Collectively, these observations underscore a need to understand, and to therapeutically exploit the molecular mechanisms underlying &#x003b2;-cell replication and regeneration. Abundant data in mice have demonstrated that the &#x0201c;G1/S checkpoint,&#x0201d; or the &#x0201c;G1/S pathway&#x0201d; (supplemental Fig. 1, available in an online appendix at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/db08-0631/DC1">http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/db08-0631/DC1</ext-link>), in the cell cycle is critical in regulating rodent &#x003b2;-cell replication and physiological function (rev. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to this richness in knowledge regarding &#x003b2;-cell cycle control in the mouse, relatively little is known regarding cell cycle control in the human islet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). This is important because the fundamental reason for studying &#x003b2;-cell replication is to leverage such knowledge for expanding functional human &#x003b2;-cell mass for the treatment or prevention of diabetes.

However, we were able to observe cdk-4 immunoreactivity using a third cdk-4 antiserum (cdk-4&#x02032; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>). To be certain that the cdk-4 immunoblots accurately reflected endogenous cdk-4 and not cross-reactivity with another cdk or other protein, we adenovirally overexpressed human cdk-1, cdk-2, cdk-4, and cdk-6 in human islets and performed immunoblotting using three different commercially available cdk-4 antisera. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>H</italic>, the Abcam 3112 and Santa Cruz 749 antisera failed to detect cdk-4 in human islets, although cdk-4 immunoreactivity was readily visible by both antisera when cdk-4 was overexpressed. In contrast, cdk-4 was easily observed in normal human islet preparations under basal conditions using the Santa Cruz 260G antiserum, and this was enhanced by overexpression of cdk-4 but not by overexpression of cdk-1, cdk-2, or cdk-6. These observations suggest that the three cdk-4 antisera do not cross-react with other cdks and that authentic cdk-4 is indeed present in human islets, but at sufficiently low levels that it is only observable using the third cdk-4 antiserum. RT-PCR and sequencing of the amplified cDNA products confirmed that human cdk-4 mRNA in present in human islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>I</italic>).</p><p>Surprisingly, in marked contrast to results in murine islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), human islets contain the cdk-4 homolog cdk-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>).

As can be seen in the figure, cdk-6 was observed in each of the human islet preparations with each of the three antisera used, and in each case, there was a specific increase in expression after transduction with Ad.cdk-6. Moreover, cdk-6 immunoreactivity was not enhanced by overexpression of cdk-1, cdk-2, nor cdk-4, indicating specificity of the antisera for cdk-6. RT-PCR and sequencing of the amplified cDNA products confirmed that human cdk-6 mRNA is present in human islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>I</italic>).</p><p>Upstream of the cdks and cyclins are two families of cell cycle inhibitors, the INK4 family and the CIP/KIP/WAF family.

Because of the central role of the G1/S transition in &#x003b2;-cell cycle control, because of the reported differences in the rates of &#x003b2;-cell proliferation rates in human versus rodent &#x003b2;-cells, and in light of the need to develop a means of enhancing human &#x003b2;-cell regeneration, we analyzed the molecules that control the G1/S checkpoint in the human islet.</p><p>We find that in contrast to murine islets which contain little or no cdk-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), each of the four G1/S cyclins and cdks is present in the human islet. In particular, cdk-6, an activator of cell cycle progression in many cell types, is abundant in human islets and specifically within the &#x003b2;-cell. The inability to detect cdk-6 in murine islets and the central role of cdk-4 in murine islets are supported by the observations that cdk-4 appears to be the downstream mediator of &#x003b2;-cell proliferation induced by the IRS-1&#x02013;PI3 kinase pathway in murine &#x003b2;-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) that knockout of cdk-4 leads to severe &#x003b2;-cell attrition and neonatal diabetic ketoacidosis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), whereas cdk-6 knockout mice display no &#x003b2;-cell phenotype but instead have severe hematologic abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Our observations suggest that although cdk-4 is essential to murine islet development and function, cdk-4 in human islets is likely redundant with cdk-6, which may play a similar and complimentary role in human &#x003b2;-cells.</p><p>In functional terms, overexpression of cdk-6 in combination with cyclin D<sub>1</sub> leads to uniquely robust proliferation in human &#x003b2;-cells. We have previously demonstrated that cdk-4 overexpression in combination with cyclin D<sub>1</sub> in human &#x003b2;-cells led to an approximate ninefold increase in proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, these studies were limited entirely to in vitro observations for 48&#x02013;72 h. We report that a second combination of cell cycle activators (cdk-6 in combination with cyclin D<sub>1</sub>) can induce an even greater stimulation in human &#x003b2;-cell replication&#x02014;for some, 40-fold. Furthermore, unlike cdk-4 overexpression, which alone is unable to either measurably phosphorylate pRb or activate &#x003b2;-cell replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>), cdk-6 overexpression alone is able to accomplish both of these outcomes, presumably by combining with endogenous &#x003b2;-cell <sc>d</sc>-type cyclins. Furthermore, as we previously reported for the cdk-4/cyclin D<sub>1</sub> combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), cell death was not activated in human &#x003b2;-cells by the cdk-6/cyclin D<sub>1</sub> combination. Future studies will be required to define whether cdk-6 alone will prove as effective in vivo as when supplied in combination with cyclin D<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>Perhaps the most critical observation in the current study is that, unlike prior in vitro studies with human islets and human autopsy specimens in which human &#x003b2;-cell replication does not occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), induction of human &#x003b2;-cell replication can be documented and quantified in vivo for the first time using the NOD-SCID human islet transplant model described here. In addition, the whole-animal glucose and insulin metabolic axis can simultaneously be monitored. Although the diabetic NOD-SCID mouse model is not novel, its use to document accelerated human &#x003b2;-cell replication is. This human islet transplant model is important, because it will permit investigators to ask for the first time, using human islets, whether interventions such as glucose infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), lipid infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), or treatment with growth factors or drugs such as GLP-1, exenatide, gastrin, EGF, or others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) can lead to activation of human &#x003b2;-cell replication in vivo.</p><p>In addition to the studies centered on cdk-6, the human G1/S proteome reveals a variety of additional novel observations. For example, human islets, like their murine counterparts, contain all seven INK4 and CIP/KIP/WAF family members, all three pocket proteins, menin, and p53. That is, every single cell cycle inhibitor that might be present in any cell type is present in the human islet; if one wanted to design a cell type that could not possibly replicate, this is how it would be accomplished. Their simple presence of course does not prove function, but this model will also allow further detailed in vivo study. For example, physiological and therapeutic activation of cell cycle progression in human &#x003b2;-cells, like their murine counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), might be accomplished by knockdown or silencing of individual or combinations of cell cycle inhibitors such as menin, p18 and p27, or pRb and p53.</p><p>Another novel observation is that human islets contain all three pocket protein members, pRb, p107, and p130; previously, only pRb has been identified in human islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). As another example, human islets lack E2F2, a protein that is present in murine islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and the loss of which in knockout mice leads to severe pancreatic exocrine and endocrine dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Similarly, human islets contain E2F3 and E2F7, whereas their murine counterparts lack both E2F3 and E2F7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The functional and therapeutic implications of these observations are currently unknown but clearly merit further exploration.</p><p>A number of additional important questions remain for future studies. One important question relates to the quantification of &#x003b2;-cell mass loss or accrual in this model. It would be ideal to be able to accurately assess &#x003b2;-cell mass as well as &#x003b2;-cell differentiation. However, this will be challenging given the complex mixture of cell types contained in islet grafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Potential approaches to quantitate increments in &#x003b2;-cell mass might include intraocular anterior chamber transplant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) or combining insulin promoter-driven viral delivery of luciferase with external imaging coupled with graft histomorphometry.</p><p>It is also important to emphasize that the immunoblots describing the human G1/S proteome were performed on whole human islets, which are comprised predominantly of non-&#x003b2;-cells. Thus, for the cell cycle proteins described (other than cdk-4 and cdk-6, which were confirmed to be present in the &#x003b2;-cell using immunohistochemistry), future studies will need to unequivocally document the presence or absence of these molecules in human &#x003b2;-cells.</p><p>Another important question relates to the duration of the adenovirus expression and &#x003b2;-cell replication induced by cdk-6/cyclin D<sub>1</sub>. We have examined only a single early time point, but it is important to know whether adenoviral expression is sustained for the entire 6 weeks of the experiment or even longer. In this regard, we have recently demonstrated, using a similar model, that adenoviral expression of hepatocyte growth factor in transplanted primate islets persists for at least 6 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>).</p><p>Although we show that cdk-6 overexpression is able to activate the &#x003b2;-cell cycle, this does not address the physiological role of cdk-6 in the human &#x003b2;-cell nor mechanisms through which it acts. Further studies will be required to define the consequences of cdk-6 loss on human &#x003b2;-cells and to identify the cyclin INK/KIP/CIP partners of cdk-6. This is particularly interesting in that the large majority of cdk-6 is present in the cytosolic compartment, not the nuclear compartment where it might phosphorylate pocket proteins. Is cdk-6 a cytosolic protein only in resting &#x003b2;-cells that translocates to the nucleus in proliferating &#x003b2;-cells? Or does cdk-6 always remain in the cytoplasm? Can it drive cell cycle progression by sequestering CIPs/KIPs in the cytoplasm away from cdk-1/cdk-2 cyclin A/E complexes? Answering these questions and others will require purification of human &#x003b2;-cells, coimmunoprecipitaton, colocalization, live-cell imaging, and other studies. In addition, whether cdk-6 expression or activity is regulated by growth factors and signaling pathways in human islets, as is cdk-4 in the murine islet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), provides fertile ground for future study.</p><p>Finally, cdks and cyclins are oncogenes. This raises the question as to whether sustained therapeutic cdk or cyclin activation might have oncogenic consequences. On the &#x0201c;high oncogenic risk&#x0201d; side of the equation, cdk-4 is associated with melanoma and other malignancies and cyclin D<sub>1</sub> with insulinomas, breast cancer, and lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). On the &#x0201c;low oncogenic risk&#x0201d; side of the equation, these cell cycle molecules of course are also normal regulators of cell cycle replication in all cells, including &#x003b2;-cells. Under normal physiological circumstances, their level of expression is tightly controlled and does not lead to tumor development but suffices to expand &#x003b2;-cell mass in embryology and childhood. Thus, if it were possible to control the duration and degree of expression of these molecules through the use of &#x003b2;-cell&#x02013;specific and regulatable promoters, their degree and duration of activation might be engineered to mimic physiological &#x003b2;-cell replication and expansion. Because the islet grafts can be left in place for months or even 1 or 2 years, the model described here will permit accurate and meaningful study of their oncogenicity.</p><p>In summary, we have provided a human &#x003b2;-cell cycle &#x0201c;G1/S proteome,&#x0201d; which can serve as a road map or model to more deeply understand and exploit human &#x003b2;-cell replication. We have also developed an in vivo model in which to explore the function of these molecules as well as a broad variety of physiological maneuvers on human &#x003b2;-cell replication. We have also demonstrated a variety of other unanticipated differences between rodent and human G1/S regulatory machinery. Collectively, these studies make three fundamental points. First, rodent studies aimed at augmenting human &#x003b2;-cell replication need to be confirmed in human islets; if one wants to understand human &#x003b2;-cell replication, one will need also to study human &#x003b2;-cells. Second, although progress is being made in understanding the molecular details of cell cycle control in the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell, current understanding is still rudimentary. Third, it is clearly possible to drive human &#x003b2;-cell replication in ways that retain differentiation and function in vivo, at least over a period of days to weeks. Approaches designed to exploit fundamental cell cycle control in human &#x003b2;-cells may provide insight into how best to expand human &#x003b2;-cells for therapeutic purposes in the treatment of diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_58_4_882__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="supp_db08-0631_db08-06311.suppl.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.
