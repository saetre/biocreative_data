Disruption of Lsh leads to developmental growth retardation and premature aging in mice. However, the specific effect of Lsh on human cellular senescence remains unknown. Herein, we report that Lsh overexpression delays cell senescence by silencing p16<sup>INK4a</sup> in human fibroblasts. The patterns of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and Lsh expression during cell senescence present the inverse correlation. We also find that Lsh requires histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity to repress p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and treatment with trichostatin A (TSA) is sufficient to block the repressor effect of Lsh. Moreover, overexpression of Lsh is correlated with deacetylation of histone H3 at the p16 promoter, and TSA treatment in Lsh-expressing cells reverses the acetylation status of histones. Additionally, we demonstrate an interaction between Lsh, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC2 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Lsh interacts <italic>in vivo</italic> with the p16 promoter and recruits HDAC1. Our data suggest that Lsh represses endogenous p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression by recruiting HDAC to establish a repressive chromatin structure at the p16<sup>INK4a</sup> promoter, which in turn delays cell senescence.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Senescence is a state during which cells lose the ability to proliferate that is accompanied by specific changes in cellular morphology and gene expression. During the process of cell senescence, senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-&#x003b2;-gal) is activated, the cell cycle is irreversibly arrested at the G1 phase, senescence-associated hetero-chromatic foci form and expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Lymphoid specific helicase (Lsh), also termed as proliferation associated SNF-2-like gene (PASG), was originally found to be expressed only in lymphoid tissue in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). This may have been indicative of the proliferating nature of lymphoid cells rather than tissue specificity, as expression is nearly ubiquitous in the developing mouse embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Lsh has been shown to be linked to cell proliferation and premature aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Imperfect maintenance of genome integrity has been postulated to be an important cause of senescence and premature aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). DNA methylation governs several distinct processes, including genomic stability and gene promoter regulation. Errors in replication of DNA-methylation patterns as observed in mutant Lsh mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) may destabilize the genome and activate cellular self defense mechanisms that prevent cells from entering S-phase. Altered gene expression, reduced cell proliferation and abnormal embryonic development are also consequences. However, other mechanisms may also contribute to the observed senescence phenotypes in Lsh mutant mice. For example, bmi-1, a transcriptional regulator, may provide an alternative mechanism to DNA methylation in regulating the expression of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> which plays essential role in establishing a replicative senescence phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Therefore, it can be concluded that Lsh may play a critical role in aging through multiple regulatory mechanisms. Herein, we report that Lsh delays cellular senescence by repressing the senescence-associated tumor suppression gene, p16<sup>INK4a</sup>.</p><p>Chromatin remodeling and histone modifications have emerged as primary regulatory mechanisms controlling gene expression. Hyperacetylation of histones H3 or H4 is generally associated with transcriptionally active chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), while the chromatin of inactive regions is enriched in deacetylated histones H3 and H4. The acetylation status of histones at specific DNA-regulatory sequences depends on the recruitment of histone acetyltransferases or histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities.</p><p>Lsh is a member of the SNF2 family of helicases that is involved in chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). As described previously, histone acetylation is a marker for transcriptional activation. Huang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) reported that Lsh regulates histone acetylation at repetitive elements. Furthermore, it has been reported that histone H3 acetylation was enhanced in Lsh<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) at the promoters of genes whose expression levels were affected by the absence of Lsh, including HoxA6 and HoxA7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Here, we found that Lsh-mediated p16<sup>INK4a</sup> repression was not due to CpG methylation at promoter, which is in agreement with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), but, is involved in HDAC-mediated histone deacetylation. We report that the endogenous p16 promoter of Lsh-expressing cells is enriched in deacetylated histone H3, and that Lsh-mediated repression is abolished by treatment with trichostatin A (TSA). Lsh interacts directly with the endogenous p16 promoter, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and recruits HDAC1. Moreover, <italic>in vivo</italic> interactions between Lsh, HDAC1 and HDAC2 have also been reported, suggesting that Lsh may mediate p16 repression by recruiting a corepressor complex containing HDAC1 and HDAC2 to the p16 promoter.</p><p>In this study, we examined the role of Lsh in normal cellular senescence by assessing the phenotypes associated with Lsh overexpression and small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated Lsh silencing. We further identified the underlying mechanisms associated with Lsh-mediated repression of p16.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell line, cell culture and treatments</title><p>Human embryonic lung diploid fibroblast 2BS cells (obtained from the National Institute of Biological Products, Beijing, China) were previously isolated from female fetal lung fibroblast tissue and have been fully characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). 2BS cells are considered to be young at PD 30 or below and to be fully senescent at PD 55 or above.

Previous studies have demonstrated that targeted deletion of Lsh in mice leads to developmental growth retardation and premature aging phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Moreover, PASG mutant mice display a significant increase in the expression of senescence-related genes, including p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, p19<sup>ARF</sup>, p53 and p21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). However, the function of Lsh in human cellular senescence has never been described. In the present study, we showed that Lsh delayed cellular senescence in human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), an effect attributed to the repression of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), which is an important cell-cycle inhibitor, and its accumulation triggers the onset of cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). However, a recent publication draws some different conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). We think the different findings were due to the different cell lines. TIG-7 cell is a human fetal diploid cell strain; while 2BS cell is a human embryo diploid cell strain, which stay at earlier developmental stage. It may be the key cause of the different findings between two cell lines upon to PASG knockdown. Secondly the original gender is different. The former comes from male and the latter comes from female.</p><p>2BS cells were previously isolated from human fetal lung fibroblast tissue and have been fully characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The maximum population doubling of human diploid fibroblasts is limited in culture, so they are widely used as a model of cellular senescence. Previous reports have suggested that fibroblast cellular senescence occurs as a consequence of a &#x02018;genetic program&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). This program has been partially characterized by gene expression patterns during the progression of successive passages, such as, the upregulation of senescence-associated tumor suppressor, p16<sup>INK4a</sup>. Here, we found that overexpression of Lsh markedly inhibited p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B). Moreover, the shRNA-mediated silencing of Lsh led to an upregulation of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D). Therefore, we concluded that Lsh could repress the endogenous p16<sup>INK4a</sup>. In addition, we detected the endogenous expression patterns of Lsh and p16<sup>INK4a</sup> in young and senescent 2BS cells or WI-38 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and B), establishing a relationship between p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and Lsh expression and a correlation between Lsh expression and the age of cells. Lsh expression levels significantly declined in senescent fibroblasts, which inversely correlated with p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression, thereby allowing changes in Lsh expression to regulate p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression.</p><p>Since Lsh repressed endogenous p16 expression and delayed cellular senescence in 2BS cells, we next asked whether p16 is required for Lsh-regulated senescence. Experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> showed that p16 deletion could completely rescue the senescent effect and the upregulation of p16 by Lsh-shRNA, suggesting that the p16/Rb pathway is required for Lsh-shRNA-induced premature senescence.</p><p>Lsh, a member of the SNF2 family of chromatin remodeling proteins, is an epigenetic regulator in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). SNF2-like proteins are classified into three subfamilies according to the similarity of their ATPase catalytic domain to either yeast SWI2/SNF2, mammalian Mi-2/CHD or Drosophila ISWI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Chromatin remodeling can be targeted to promoters or other specific regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). More recent genome-wide studies have revealed that several SNF2 family members can function both as positive and negative regulators of gene expression, possibly by altering chromatin modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). For example, Fan <italic>et al.</italic> (2005) found that Lsh specifically controls silencing of the imprinted Cdkn1c gene by a direct association with the 5&#x02032; DMR and alteration of the CpG methylation at the Cdkn1c promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). However, the induction of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> by Lsh mutant was not related to promoter demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Consistent with this finding, we found that Lsh overexpression did not alter the CpG methylation of the p16 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B) and Lsh-mediated repression of p16 was independent of DNMT activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A).</p><p>Covalent modification of the N-terminal tails of chromatin core histone proteins, including acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation, often correlates with transcriptional events, which is to be essential for proper gene expression. Acetylation of histones H3 and H4 relieves structural chromatin compaction, possibly through disruption of interactions between adjacent nucleosomes or by loosening contacts between histones and DNA. It has been reported respectively that INI1/hSNF5, another SWI/SNF family member, represses cyclin D1 and c-fos transcription by inducing Histone H4 deacetylation of the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Moreover, several previous studies have reported that HDAC inhibitor can induce p16 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45">43&#x02013;45</xref>). In the search for the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of p16 by Lsh, overexpression of Lsh was found to induce the deacetylation of histone H3 on the p16 promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>, which can be reversed by treatment with the specific HDACs inhibitor, TSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C and D). Consistent with the findings, both immunoblot and quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that Lsh-mediated repression of endogenous p16<sup>INK4a</sup> could be reversed by low concentrations of TSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). Therefore, for the first time, we reported that histone deacetylation by HDACs may participate in the regulation of p16 by Lsh.</p><p>HDACs are frequently recruited to specific DNA sites through association with corepressor molecules. Moreover, the silencing of tumor suppressor genes through the aberrant targeting of HDACs to their gene promoters may be more common than previously realized. Therefore, we hypothesized that Lsh could recruit HDACs to the p16 promoter, resulting in the propagation of a repressive chromatin state. Coimmunoprecipitation assays verified the association of Lsh with HDAC1 and HDAC2 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A and B). However, GST-Pull down assays demonstrated that the interaction between Lsh and HDAC1 could be indirect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C).</p><p>How does Lsh as well as the associated proteins exert the ability to silence p16<sup>INK4a</sup>? We first hypothesized that Lsh could be targeted to the p16 promoter. ChIP assays indicated that Lsh, HDAC1 and HDAC2 bound the proximal region of the p16 promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A). We further performed Re-ChIP assays to verify the colocalization of Lsh with HDAC1 at the p16 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B). Quantitative analysis of HDAC1 binding to the p16 promoter showed that Lsh overexpression increased the amounts of HDAC1 binding at the p16 promoter, whereas Lsh knockdown blocked this binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C and D), suggesting that Lsh may recruit HDAC1 to the p16 promoter. In conclusion, Lsh may induce the deacetylation of histone H3 by recruiting HDAC1 to the p16 promoter. These findings elicit speculation about mechanisms that Lsh may regulate p16 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). <fig id="F10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p>A model showing how Lsh may regulate p16 silencing.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp533f10"/></fig></p><p>It is well known that p16<sup>INK4a</sup> is an important cell-cycle inhibitor which can induce senescence and repress tumor cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Its loss or inactivation is correlated with cell immortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Although p16<sup>INK4&#x003b1;</sup> plays an important role in cellular senescence and tumorigenesis, its transcriptional control is poorly understood. Here, we report, for the first time to our knowledge, the molecular mechanism by which Lsh regulates the expression of p16<sup>INK4&#x003b1;</sup> in 2BS cells. However, recent studies have proposed p16-regulatory pathways that are distinct from those described here. Jacobs <italic>et al.</italic> reported that the oncogene and polycomb-group gene bmi-1 regulates cell proliferation and senescence through the ink4a locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Ohtani <italic>et al.</italic> proposed a model in which the upregulation of p16<sup>INK4&#x003b1;</sup> depended on the accumulation of Ets1 and the absence of interference by Id1 during senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Zheng <italic>et al.</italic> found that Id1 regulated p16<sup>INK4&#x003b1;</sup> levels through interactions with E47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Wang <italic>et al.</italic> reported that a 24-kDa protein might inhibit the expression of p16<sup>INK4&#x003b1;</sup> by interacting with the INK4&#x003b1; transcription silence element (ITSE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Recently, Gan <italic>et al.</italic> reported that PPAR-gamma promotes cellular senescence by inducing p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>); subsequently, Huang <italic>et al.</italic> found that SIRT1 antagonizes cellular senescence by reducing the expression of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and promoting phosphorylation of Rb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). These findings do not contradict the present conclusions. It is clear that the p16 promoter is subject to multiple levels of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>); therefore, p16 regulation cannot be explained by a single isolated pathway.</p><p>In summary, Lsh is one of the critical factors involved in the regulation of cell senescence. We conclude that the high Lsh expression in young cells represses p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression, thereby maintaining the proliferative state of 2BS cells. Loss of Lsh expression may lead to increased p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression in senescent 2BS cells, which in turn contributes to the onset of cellular senescence. Furthermore, we investigated the molecular mechanism involved Lsh-mediated p16 repression, and established a relationship between chromatin remodeling, gene repression and cell senescence. Future studies will be required to determine the role played by the sequence-specific binding factors to mediate the repression of p16 by Lsh.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp533/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp533_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkp533_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkp533_nar-00562-x-2009-File012.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkp533_nar-00562-x-2009-File013.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>National Basic Research Programs of China [No. 2007CB507400]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [No.30671064].
