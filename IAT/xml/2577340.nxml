Instead, centromere DNA may be interconnected through the formation of certain DNA structures creating topological binding sites for centromeric proteins. DNA topoisomerase II is a protein, which is located at centromeres, and enzymatic topoisomerase II activity correlates with centromere activity in human cells. It is therefore possible that topoisomerase II recognizes and interacts with the alpha satellite DNA of human centromeres through an interaction with potential DNA structures formed solely at active centromeres. In the present study, human topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage at centromeric DNA sequences was examined <italic>in vitro</italic>. The investigation has revealed that the enzyme recognizes and cleaves a specific hairpin structure formed by alpha satellite DNA. The topoisomerase introduces a single-stranded break at the hairpin loop in a reaction, where DNA ligation is partly uncoupled from the cleavage reaction. A mutational analysis has revealed, which features of the hairpin are required for topoisomerease II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage. Based on this a model is discussed, where topoisomerase II interacts with two hairpins as a mediator of centromere cohesion.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The centromere is the central connection point between sister-chromatids in cell division, and it ensures that the replicated DNA is distributed with one copy to each daughter cell. In higher eukaryotes centromeric DNA generally contains stretches of DNA repeats, and in human cells a number of different repetitive elements are found in connection with the centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Among these the alpha satellite DNA repeats may be the only repeat elements, which are found at all conventional human centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>). Alpha satellite DNA ranges from around 200 kb per chromosome to several megabases and has a basic repeat unit with an average size of 171 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>). Comparisons of alpha satellite repeats from a number of primates suggest that they are composed of a variable region and a more conserved region of &#x0223c;117 bp and 54 bp, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The conserved region contains two regions of dyad symmetry, one of which is made from alternating blocks of homopurine and homopyrimidine elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and has a high A/T content. Dyad symmetries, homopurine and homopyrimidine elements, and a high A/T content seem to be common characteristics of eukaryotic centromeric DNA and of the DNA in the so-called neocentromeres that emerge in non-centromeric DNA to take on centromeric function in the absence of a natural centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">8&#x02013;12</xref>).</p><p>Although the centromere is an essential element, relatively little is known about how the underlying DNA supports the centromeric function. In most eukaryotic species the exact centromere boundaries are difficult to define and no interspecies consensus of the DNA sequence exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15 B16">13&#x02013;16</xref>). Furthermore, even within a single species it has often been impossible to identify sequences absolutely necessary and sufficient for centromere function. Considering also that non-centromeric sequences may take on centromere function and form neocentromeres at times when normal centromeres are lost, and that conventional centromeres are seen losing their function when placed on a DNA element, which contains another functioning centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), it has been obvious to speculate that the centromere identity may lie within the DNA structure more than in its primary sequence, and that this function could be propagated by an epigenetic mechanism, whereby centromeric proteins recognize suitable DNA and bring it into a functional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>In line with this, many proteins involved in centromere function are conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Topoisomerase II is one of the proteins associated with the centromeres. It is a highly conserved and essential enzyme, which influences the topological conformation of DNA by creating a transient 4-bp staggered double-stranded break in the DNA backbone, through which it can transport another DNA helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). This ability explains why the enzyme is required for many aspects of DNA metabolism, including DNA replication, transcription, chromosome condensation/decondensation, as well as sister chromatid separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>). Topoisomerase II associates with centromeric DNA in a cell-cycle-specific manner and concentrates at centromeres as they condensate prior to mitotic cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24">22&#x02013;24</xref>). It is consequently one of the first of the non-constitutive centromeric proteins to locate at the centromeres ahead of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In higher eukaryotes the enzyme is active within a sub-region of the centromeric sequences, which coincides with the location of other centromere proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Topoisomerase II seems to have a role in cohesion at centromeres, which is regulated by sumoylation of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27 B28 B29 B30">27&#x02013;30</xref>), and more recently, sumoylation of topoisomerase II has been found to direct the enzyme to the inner centromere to allow accurate chromosome separation prior to anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33">31&#x02013;33</xref>). A functional role of topoisomerase II at the centromeres is also strongly suggested by the fact that the activity of the enzyme is restricted to active centromeres at mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Furthermore, like natural centromeres, neocentromeres, which do not contain any detectable alpha satellite DNA, contain an accumulation of mitotic topoisomerase II activity, whereas topoisomerase II activity is not found at inactive blocks of alpha satellite DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Centromeric topoisomerase II activity at mitosis thus seems to be connected to centromere activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the molecular anatomy underlying the interaction between topoisomerase II and alpha satellite DNA, we have extended our previous <italic>in vivo</italic> study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) by this <italic>in vitro</italic> study using purified human topoisomerase II&#x003b1; and oligonucleotides representing the conserved part of alpha satellite DNA. The nature of the topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage and the effects of different mutations in the alpha satellite DNA sequence on the cleavage were investigated <italic>in vitro</italic>. In contrast to the general cleavage mechanism of topoisomerase II, we find that the enzyme introduces a single-stranded break at the loop of a hairpin structure formed in the alpha satellite DNA. The cleavage is highly dependent on the finer architecture of the centromeric substrate and bears characteristics of suicidal cleavage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligonucleotides</title><p>All oligonucleotides were obtained from DNA Technology A/S.</p><p>TOP83: TTCAGATAAAAACTAGAAAGAAGCTTT CTGAGAAACTTCTTTGTGTTCTGTGAATTCATCT CACAGAGTTACACCTTTCTTTT</p><p>TOP62: TTCAGATAAAAACTAGAAAGAAGCTTT CTGAGAAACTTCTTTGTGTGTTACACCTTTCTTTT</p><p>TOP62-G30C: TTCAGATAAAAACTAGAAAGAA GCTTTCTCAGAAACTTCTTTGTGTGTTACACCTT TCTTTT</p><p>TOP62-C24A: TTCAGATAAAAACTAGAAAGAAG ATTTCTGAGAAACTTCTTTGTGTGTTACACCTTT CTTTT</p><p>TOP62-insG36: TTCAGATAAAAACTAGAAAGAA GCTTTCTGAGAAAGCTTCTTTGTGTGTTACACCT TTCTTTT</p><p>TOP62-delC24insG36: TTCAGATAAAAACTAGAA AGAAGTTTCTGAGAAAGCTTCTTTGTGTGTTAC ACCTTTCTTTT</p><p>BOT83: AAAAGAAAGGTGTAACTCTGTGAGAT GAATTCACAGAACACAAAGAAGTTTCTCAGAAA GCTTCTTTCTAGTTTTTATCTGAA</p><p>BOT62: AAAAGAAAGGTGTAACACACAAAGA AGTTTCTCAGAAAGCTTCTTTCTAGTTTTTATC TGAA</p><p>BOT62-delG39insC28: AAAAGAAAGGTGTAACAC ACAAAGAAGCTTTCTCAGAAACTTCTTTCTAGTTTTTATCTGAA</p><p>TOP64: TTCAGATAAAAACTAGAAAGAAGCTTT CTTGAAGAAACTTCTTTGTGTGTTACACCTTTCT TTT</p><p>TOP66: TTCAGATAAAAACTAGAAAGAAGCTTT CTTTGAAAGAAACTTCTTTGTGTGTTACACCTTT CTTTT</p><p>TOP68: TTCAGATAAAAACTAGAAAGAAGCTTT CTTTTGAAAAGAAACTTCTTTGTGTGTTACACCT TTCTTTT</p><p>TOP70: TTCAGATAAAAACTAGAAAGAAGCTT TCTTTTTGAAAAAGAAACTTCTTTGTGTGTTACA CCTTTCTTTT</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of cleavage substrates</title><p>Most oligonucleotides were purified by preparative polyacrylamide gel-electrophoresis. 3&#x02032;-end labelling of the single-stranded DNA substrates was performed by incubating 10 pmol oligonucleotide with 20 U of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]ddATP in the supplied TdT reaction buffer for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C.

To understand how topoisomerase II differentiates between active and inactive alpha satellite DNA we have investigated the interaction between purified human topoisomerase II&#x003b1; and oligonucleotides representing the conserved part of primate alpha satellite DNA. To this end, two oligonucleotides, TOP83 and BOT83, each representing one strand of the consensus sequence for the most conserved region of the alpha satellite monomer, were constructed. The oligonucleotides contain two regions of dyad symmetry, symmetry 1 and 2, where symmetry 1 comprises a 2-fold dyad symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Based on this, the oligonucleotides are predicted to form hairpin structures as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B for TOP83. The oligonucleotides were incubated with human topoisomerase II&#x003b1; either separately or as a duplex. To discourage that the dyad symmetry sequences of two identical oligonucleotides should make a partial double-stranded duplex in the reaction mixtures, the oligonucleotides were constructed with 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends that were unable to base pair. Furthermore, the substrates were used in low concentrations in the cleavage reaction to favour intra-molecular interactions, thus making hairpin-formation more likely than the formation of partial duplexes. As seen from the cleavage experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A topoisomerase II&#x003b1;&#x02013;DNA cleavage complexes are formed when the top strand alone (TOP83) is used as substrate. TOP83 has two cleavage sites, one major site and one minor site, located 56 and 32 nt from the labelled 3&#x02032;-end, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lanes 2&#x02013;6). Interestingly, no comparable cleavage occurred on the complementary bottom strand (BOT83) (lanes 14&#x02013;18) or on the double-stranded substrate (lanes 8&#x02013;12). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Topoisomerase II&#x003b1; introduces a single-stranded break at the loop of a hairpin structure formed by the conserved part of centromeric alpha satellite DNA. <bold>(A)</bold> Topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage of the 3&#x02032;-end labelled substrates, TOP83 (lanes 2&#x02013;6), TOP83 hybridized to BOT83 (lanes 8&#x02013;12), or BOT83 (lanes 14&#x02013;18).

The strongest site is observed within symmetry 1 and the weaker site within symmetry 2 as schematically illustrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The results thus suggest that topoisomerase II&#x003b1; recognizes a hairpin structure in alpha satellite DNA as opposed to standard B-form DNA. Hairpin structures have earlier been demonstrated to be among the preferred substrates for topoisomerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39 B40 B41 B42">39&#x02013;42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).</p><p>When DNA is incubated with topoisomerase II, a cleavage/religation equilibrium is normally established within seconds, where the level of cleavage complexes that can be trapped by SDS is constant once the equilibrium is reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). As seen from the time-course experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, cleavage complexes accumulate with time when topoisomerase II&#x003b1; is incubated with TOP83. This indicates that the enzyme to some extent allows an uncoupling of the cleavage and religation reactions on this substrate, a characteristic of topoisomerase II-mediated suicidal cleavage, where uncoupling takes place due to a loss of positioning of the two DNA termini for religation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage of alpha satellite DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> is stimulated by VM26 and inhibited by mAMSA</title><p>Topoisomerase II activity in the centromeric regions of human chromosomes has been detected by the use of the topoisomerase II-poisons VM26 and VP16, both belonging to the epidophyllotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). These drugs stabilize topoisomerase II&#x02013;DNA cleavage complexes by inhibiting the DNA religation reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). To examine the effect of this drug type on topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage of alpha satellite DNA in our reaction design, cleavage reactions were performed in the presence of VM26. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, VM26 stimulates topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage of alpha satellite DNA, as it does when normal duplex DNA is used as substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). The fact that more cleavage complexes are trapped in the presence of VM26 demonstrates that some DNA religation must take place upon cleavage of alpha satellite DNA in the absence of drug, so religation is not completely uncoupled from cleavage. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage of the centromeric hairpin is differentially affected by VM26 and mAMSA. <bold>(A)</bold> Topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage of TOP83 in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of VM26 and mAMSA.

When mAMSA was included in the <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage reaction, cleavage was reduced to about 25% of the level observed in the absence of drug. Cleavage inhibition was similarly observed when the DNA intercalator, ethidium bromide (EtBr), was included in the cleavage reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Like EtBr, mAMSA probably inhibits cleavage due to a perturbation of the hairpin structure. Thus, the result strongly supports that a specific hairpin is formed in the conserved part of alpha satellite DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> and that this structure is essential for cleavage by topoisomerase II&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage is determined by the finer architecture of the hairpin formed in alpha satellite DNA</title><p>The finding that topoisomerase II&#x003b1; recognizes and cleaves hairpin structures formed in alpha satellite DNA leaves unexplained why we only observe cleavage in the top strand (TOP83) and not in the bottom strand (BOT83). The two oligonucleotides are very similar in the region containing the cleavage sites, and both are expected to form hairpin structures equally well. However, the differences between the two oligonucleotides must somehow determine the differences in enzyme activity. The deviations between TOP83 and BOT83 in the region around the major cleavage site are, firstly, the base at the top of the hairpin loop, which is a G in TOP83 and a C in BOT83. Secondly, the unpaired base looping out from the middle of the stem is a C in TOP83 and a G in BOT83; and thirdly, the orientation of the unpaired base is different between TOP83 and BOT83. To investigate the importance of each of these differences for the specific interaction of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; with the two oligonucleotides, variant oligonucleotides were designed, containing mutations at these specific positions. To simplify the analysis we first eliminated symmetry 2 from the substrates, resulting in TOP62 and BOT62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). This did not influence the cleavage pattern of symmetry 1, as cleavage still occurs at the same position, in this case 35 nt from the labelled 3&#x02032;-end (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lanes 3 and 9 with lanes 6 and 18 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Therefore, TOP62 and BOT62 were used for the mutational analysis. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage of the centromeric hairpin is determined by an unpaired base in the stem of the hairpin structure. <bold>(A)</bold> Hairpin structures of the oligonucleotides TOP62 and BOT62, which are identical to TOP83 and BOT83, respectively, except for the lack of most of symmetry 2.

This resulted in a significant decrease in DNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lane 6), demonstrating that the unpaired base in TOP62 has a stimulatory effect on topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage. BOT62 also contains an unpaired base. In this case it is a G, which is located on the 3&#x02032;-side of the stem. To determine why this substrate is not recognized by topoisomerase II&#x003b1;, the structure of BOT62 was mimicked by removing the unpaired C in TOP62 and replacing it with an unpaired G at the opposite side of the stem. This abolished topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lane 7). In agreement with this, removing the unpaired G in BOT62 and inserting a C at the opposite position, thus mimicking TOP62, resulted in cleavage of BOT62 at the expected position, 31 nt from the labelled 3&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lane 10). Based on these results it was concluded that topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage of symmetry 1 is dependent upon the orientation of the unpaired base. Experiments were next set up to investigate whether the nature of the unpaired base is important for cleavage. To this end, a substrate was created in which the unpaired C was changed into an A. This base change actually increased cleavage of the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lane 5).</p><p>In conclusion, although the base at the hairpin loop affects topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage of the hairpin structure, what is most important for cleavage is the existence and orientation of the unpaired base in the stem of the hairpin.</p><p>The minimal duplex substrate that gives optimal cleavage with eukaryotic topoisomerase II is a 28-bp DNA fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) and in agreement with earlier footprinting studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49 B50 B51">49&#x02013;51</xref>), a recent structure of the central cleavage/religation domain of yeast topoisomerase II in complex with DNA has revealed that the bound DNA is bent with &#x0223c;26 bp of the DNA helix being within van der Waals distance of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). The hairpin cleaved in the present study is only half the length of the duplex normally bound in the enzyme. Thus, to learn more about how the enzyme interacts with this substrate, oligonucleotides were designed in which the length of the stem was increased by inserting extra base pairs between the unpaired base and the loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Incubation of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; with the smallest of these substrates (TOP64, one additional base pair between the unpaired base and the loop) resulted in cleavage of the oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, lane 5). The cleavage site was again located 4 nt downstream of the unpaired base as seen with TOP62 (lane 6), so TOP64 extends deeper into the enzyme, resulting in the production of a 5 bases long 5&#x02032; overhang upon cleavage. It thus seems that the unpaired base defines the cleavage position. Surprisingly, increasing the distance between the unpaired base and the hairpin loop further practically abolished cleavage of the substrate (lanes 2&#x02013;4). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage of the centromeric hairpin is inhibited if the distance between the unpaired base and the hairpin loop is increased.

Thus, if the enzyme in our assay binds two hairpins located as &#x02018;kissing-loops&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), they will add up to the size of a standard minimum substrate and the single-stranded cleavage observed in the hairpin loop will actually be part of a double-stranded break with the second cleavage site being at the same position in an identical hairpin bound by the other subunit. The &#x02018;kissing-loop&#x02019; model is consistent with the observation that only TOP62 and TOP64, but not the longer hairpins are cleaved, as these two substrates probably are the only ones, which in a loop-to-loop configuration give a reasonably spacing between the two cleavage sites for the enzyme to perform double-stranded cleavage, while presenting the unpaired base in the stem of the hairpin in the appropriate position. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>&#x02018;</bold>Kissing-loop&#x02019; model of two centromeric DNA hairpins bound to topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. <bold>(A)</bold> Two DNA hairpins located loop-to-loop will fulfil the requirement of the enzyme for binding &#x0223c;26 bp of DNA.

If the two monomers belong to two-sister chromatids, the enzyme will bind the sister-chromatids together until DNA religation has taken place.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn640f5"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The aim of the present work has been to elucidate the possible connection between chromosomal centromeres and DNA topoisomerase II, which are both essential for cell propagation. Our present study of topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage of centromeric DNA sequences <italic>in vitro</italic> has revealed that the enzyme only interacts with one of the two complementary hairpins formed in the conserved part of the primate alpha satellite DNA repeat. The enzyme introduces a single-stranded break at the loop of the hairpin, where cleavage is guided by an unpaired base in the stem of the loop.</p><sec><title>Mechanistic considerations concerning topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage of centromeric hairpin structures</title><p>The observed cleavage in alpha satellite DNA is interesting from a mechanistic point of view in that cleavage occurs in a hairpin structure rather than in normal duplex DNA. Our findings demonstrate that the existence and orientation of an unpaired base in the stem of the hairpin is important for the cleavage event and that the base determines the cleavage position. This suggests that the unpaired base interacts with a particular contact point inside the active site of the enzyme, which would explain why we consistently see cleavage four bases distal to the position of this base. The unpaired base thus serves to position the hairpin correctly within the active site of the enzyme. Topoisomerase II has previously been found to recognize and cleave DNA hairpins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), though cleavage in this case was observed at the base of the hairpin stems. Furthermore, strong topoisomerase II recognition sequences have been shown by NMR to form hairpin structures <italic>in vitro</italic>, where the normal topoisomerase II cleavage site is located near the top of the hairpin, in or just next to the hairpin loop, as seen with the hairpins in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39 B40 B41 B42">39&#x02013;42</xref>).</p><p>When topoisomerase II interacts with a duplex DNA substrate it introduces a double-stranded break, but the cleavage observed in the alpha satellite DNA hairpin is apparently a single-stranded break resulting from cleavage by only one of the subunits in the dimeric enzyme. Earlier studies have revealed that cleavage by the two enzyme subunits occurs sequentially and can be fully uncoupled, thus resulting in topoisomerase II-mediated single-stranded breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Uncoupling of the two subunits has been observed under specific reaction conditions, where Ca<sup>++</sup> is substituting Mg<sup>++</sup> as the divalent cation in the reaction mixture. Subunit uncoupling would seem the natural outcome if one subunit lacked a DNA substrate. In case the enzyme binds a single hairpin, an elongation of the hairpin stem will be expected to favour cleavage due to more appropriate substrate binding. However, extensions of the hairpin stem length by more than 1 bp abolished cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). In particular, it is striking that cleavage did not occur with a hairpin having a 4-bp extension, which in principle should make the hairpin long enough to accommodate a double-stranded break. The observed hairpin cleavage pattern may be explained by a simultaneous interaction of the enzyme with two identical hairpins, which will fulfil the substrate requirements for both subunits. Thus, we believe that topoisomerase II&#x003b1; interacts with two hairpins located as &#x02018;kissing-loops&#x02019; in the active site of the enzyme as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A. The &#x02018;kissing-loops&#x02019; will mimic a normal duplex with enzyme&#x02013;DNA contacts throughout the whole DNA-binding pocket of the enzyme, and both enzyme subunits will be able to introduce a break, resulting in a double-stranded break. In support of this, the distance between the two break points, when either TOP62 or TOP64 are used as substrate, approximately matches the distance between the two break points in a normal 4-bp staggered topoisomerase II-mediated double-stranded break. In further support of the &#x02018;kissing-loop&#x02019; model, a guanine is preferred over a cytosine at the top of the hairpin loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In the model these two bases come into close contact, and pairing between the two guanines may occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>).</p><p>According to the nature of topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage, the sizes of the cleaved hairpins as well as the cleavage position will make sure that the subunit binding the hairpin is not the one cleaving it. An interesting feature of the &#x02018;kissing-loop&#x02019; model is therefore that each subunit of the enzyme after cleavage will be covalently attached to the hairpin bound by the other subunit. Such an enzyme&#x02013;DNA interaction will make the normal DNA strand-passage activity of the enzyme impossible, since no gap will exist in the DNA upon cleavage. Instead, the two subunits of the topoisomerase II enzyme become interlinked via a DNA-bridge, and as a consequence the two DNA molecules are bound to each other through a protein-bridge.</p></sec><sec><title>The centromeric DNA hairpins may represent a distinct class of topoisomerase II targets used in centromere cohesion</title><p>The observed topoisomerase II&#x003b1;-mediated cleavage of hairpins formed in centromeric alpha satellite DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> may mimic <italic>in vivo</italic> events since centromeres are believed to be defined by structure rather than primary DNA sequence, and since topoisomerase II cleaves centromeres <italic>in vivo</italic>. The possibility that centromeric sequences form secondary structures including hairpins, has been suggested for budding yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56 B57 B58 B59 B60">56&#x02013;60</xref>), and the fact that topoisomerase II cleaves active but not inactive centromeres could be an indication that only active centromeres contain the right structures for topoisomerase II recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>The mapping of topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage sites at centromeres <italic>in vivo</italic> has been done in the presence of drugs that stabilize the topoisomerase II&#x02013;DNA cleavage-complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In the present study, VM26 was found to stimulate the cleavage of the centromeric alpha satellite repeats <italic>in vitro</italic> as it does <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, mAMSA inhibited cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), suggesting that the hairpin structures are sensitive to mAMSA intercalation. Only a few studies have examined topoisomerase II-localization or cleavage at the centromeres in the presence of mAMSA <italic>in vivo</italic>. The results of these experiments are not consistent, probably partly due to differences in the drug concentrations employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). However, in cells where the localization of topoisomerase II at centromeres seems to be lost upon mAMSA-treatment, the enzyme still remains at chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). This indicates that the topoisomerase II populations at the chromosome axis and at the centromeres interact differently with DNA. Thus, at the chromosomal arms topoisomerase II may interact with normal B-form DNA and cleavage complexes will accumulate in the presence of mAMSA, but at the centromeres a fraction of the enzymes may recognize and interact with specific DNA structures that are removed by mAMSA treatment. The differential interaction of topoisomerase II with the DNA at the two different locations could be mediated and/or regulated by topoisomerase II enzymes bearing different post-translational modifications.</p><p>It has been suggested that a subpopulation of the cellular topoisomerase II plays a role for sister chromatid cohesion in the centromeric region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). If the hairpin cleavage observed in the present study <italic>in vitro</italic> is indeed a reflection of the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, it may be connected to a cohesion role of topoisomerase II at centromeres. If the enzyme simultaneously binds and cleaves two hairpins from alpha satellite repeats belonging to two sister chromatids, the binding may very well function as a kind of cohesion as illustrated in the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B. The covalent bonds formed between the two enzyme subunits and the DNA and the strong connection between the two topoisomerase II subunits may be ideal for the purpose of cohesion. Topoisomerase II is probably the only enzyme able to make such covalent attachment to two different DNA-strands at the same time. Interestingly, the potential existence of alternative systems for linking certain regions of repeated DNA in a cohesin-independent manner has also been proposed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> sumoylation of topoisomerase II has been found to be necessary for the separation of sister chromatid centromeres, and it has been suggested that the modified enzyme regulates a DNA structure, which is required for centromeric cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Interestingly, the decatenation activity of topoisomerase II is not increased by sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), indicating that the potential cohesion function of the enzyme is not associated with its ability to (de-)catenate DNA. The data are in line with the hairpin-to-hairpin cohesion model presented here. Thus, topoisomerase II may have at least two functions during cell division; a decatenation function, which ensures correct segregation of sister chromatids, and a cohesion function, which assists in holding sister-centromeres together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61 B62 B63">61&#x02013;63</xref>). Interestingly, the findings presented here suggest that these two functions of the enzyme may be carried out in two completely different ways.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Danish Cancer Society Grant (DP05009); the Danish Medical and Natural Science Research Counsils; the Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation; and the Novo Nordisk Foundation.
