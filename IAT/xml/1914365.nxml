Expression and transcription have been partially characterised in vitro and four transcripts (NKG5, 519, 520, and 522) were identified. However, only a single protein product of 15 kDa was found, which is subsequently processed to an active 9 kDa protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study we investigated generation of granulysin in lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells and antigen (<italic>Listeria</italic>) specific T-cells. Semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed NKG5 to be the most prominent transcript. It was found to be up-regulated in a time-dependent manner in LAK cells and antigen specific T-cells and their subsets. Two isoforms of 519 mRNA were up-regulated under IL-2 and antigen stimulation. Moreover, two novel transcripts, without any known function, comprising solely parts of the 5 prime region of the primary transcript, were detected. A significant increase of granulysin expressing LAK cells as well as antigen specific T-cells was shown by fluorescence microscopy. On the subset level, increase in CD4<sup>+ </sup>granulysin expressing cells was found only under antigen stimulation.</p><p>Immunoblotting showed the 15 kDa form of granulysin to be present in the first week of stimulation either with IL-2 or with bacterial antigen.

They are armed with cytotoxic granules containing various effector molecules such as granulysin, perforin, and several granzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Granulysin, an antimicrobial protein, was first identified by a subtractive hybridization procedure in functional T cell lines and alloantigen and mitogen stimulated PBL and was initially referred to as 519 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A similar gene product, referred to as NKG5, was found in the NK cell line EDF as well as in different T cell lines and clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, Manning et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] investigated the structure and transcription of the granulysin gene in the functional T cell line AJY and found the alternative spliced transcripts 519, 520, and 522 but no NKG5.</p><p>The granulysin gene is located on the human chromosome 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and comprises 6 exons within a 3.9 kb genomic locus encoding at least four alternatively spliced transcripts (NKG5, 519, 520 and 522), all differing mostly in exon 2. The most abundant transcript in AJY was identified to be 520 appearing late after T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Since 520 has an appropriate Kozak sequence for the initiation of translation, this transcript was thought to be responsible for the majority of granulysin protein produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. NKG5, which is very similar to 520, but is absent in the AJY, would have the same function in NK cells.</p><p>Granulysin is expressed as a 15 kDa protein which is processed by proteolytic cleavage at both N and C termini of the 15 kDa precursor to the active 9 kDa form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Whereas the 15 kDa protein is produced rapidly, has a shorter half-life and is poorly secreted, the secretory 9 kDa form is produced slowly and is relatively stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Recombinant 9 kDa granulysin exhibits cytolytic activity against microbial and tumor targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Overall, the complex transcriptional activity of the granulysin gene was found by studying different cell lines but a comprehensive analysis of the granulysin expression in primary cultured lymphocytes has not been performed. It has been shown that granulysin expression is induced in different lymphocyte subsets in response to bacterial antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we examined the expression and processing of granulysin in non-transformed lymphocytes which were either stimulated with r-IL-2 (lymphokine activated killer cells LAK cells) or primed by autologous dendritic cells (DC). We used two different bacterial antigens, <italic>Listeria innocua </italic>and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, which are presented to the immune system in different ways While <italic>L. innocua </italic>is Gram-positive, non pathogenic, ubiquitous bacterium, which may be processed and presented via the MHC class II pathway, <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>is an intracellular pathogen, which can enter the cytosol of infected host cell allowing processing for presentation on MHC class I molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Both Listeria species have been found to be successfully killed by granulysin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Transcriptional regulation of granulysin in LAK cells</title><p>Transcriptional analysis of the granulysin expression has been assessed in cell lines but not in primary cultured lymphocytes. To address this issue we investigated the transcripts encoded by the granulysin gene in freshly isolated PBMC stimulated with IL-2 for 2 weeks.</p><p>LAK cells showed high expression of NKG5, of two isoforms of 519 mRNA and two novel transcripts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Regarding the transcripts published by Manning et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] two sense primers in exon 1 (primer 2 and 3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>)) were tested but failed to expand the mRNAs corresponding to 520 or 522 (data not shown). However, all tested sense primers in exon 1 (primer 1, 2, 3, 4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>)) and a reverse primer in exon 5 (primer 7) resulted in a single PCR product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) that was identified by sequencing as the published transcript variant NKG5 (GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM 006433">NM 006433</ext-link>). Both products obtained with the 519 primer (primer 5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>)) were also sequenced and identified to be similar to the 519 transcript published by Manning et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Both isoforms differ from the published transcript of 519 by not containing any part of exon 1 (transcripts are called 519i throughout this paper) and one isoform additionally lacks 81 nucleotides at the 3' end of exon 2 (519is, see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic view of known and found granulysin transcripts</bold>.

By this approach two novel short transcripts (ST) were found in LAK cells and in all subsets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, arrows p38, p25). Sequence analysis revealed ST p25 to comprise exon 1 and exon 2 (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and ST p38, comprised of p25 plus the whole intron 1, as published by Manning et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. None of the ST extended to exon 3 (data not shown). Since both ST contain a Kozak consensus translation initiation site, they could be translated into peptides with a length of 25 and 38 amino acids, respectively. The middle band that appears on the agarose gel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) is the hybridization product of the two ST, with loop formation within intron 1. This was proven by 15 repeated denaturation and annealing steps of the extracted middle band resulting again in 3 bands (data not shown).</p><p>Semi-quantitative analysis of the PCR products revealed that in the total population of LAK cells, the NKG5 message increased only slightly by a factor of 1.5 from day 0 to day 15 (p = 0.019), while the two variants of 519 increased by a factor 8.8 (519i; p = 0.002) and 4.4 (519is; p = 0.007), respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><p>The ST did not show an apparent IL-2 dependency. Since each donor exhibited a different regulation pattern, a clear tendency for up- or down regulation in response to IL-2 could not be determined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined the expression of the various longer transcripts in T cell subsets. Using magnetic beads, CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+ </sup>and CD56<sup>+ </sup>cells were isolated at days 4 and 15 of continuous IL-2 stimulation and RT-PCR analysis was performed. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> the highest expressed transcript in all subsets at day 4 is NKG5, while the 519 isoforms are poorly expressed, especially in CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells. During continuous IL-2 stimulation all transcripts analyzed were at least slightly upregulated in the different cell subsets in all donors tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, one representative donor shown).</p><p>Short transcripts were also detected in all subsets at days 4 and 15, but their kinetics of expression were not evaluated (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional regulation of granulysin in antigen specific T-cells</title><p>Host defense mechanisms against intracellular microbes require induction of effector molecules such as granulysin during infection. Therefore, we investigated if granulysin gene expression is induced upon antigen driven stimulation of T cells and if so which of the different granulysin transcripts might be involved. <italic>L. innocua </italic>and <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>were used as antigens in mixed leukocyte culture.

The identical mRNAs found in LAK cells were detected in the T-cells stimulated with <italic>L. innocua </italic>or <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, including the ST (data not shown). Semi-quantitative analysis of the transcripts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) revealed that NKG5 mRNA showed the highest basal expression at day 0 and was upregulated between days 0 and 12 by an average factor of 1.7 (<italic>L. innocua</italic>, x1.68, p = 0.02; <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, x1.7, p = 0.002). Both 519 isoforms showed a more prominent increase between day 0 and day 12 of stimulation by an average factor of 3.8 (519i) and 2.7 (519is), respectively (<italic>L. innocua</italic>, x4 519i, p = 0.004 and x2.7 519is p = 0.006; <italic>L monocytogenes</italic>, x3.6 519i, p = 0.0004 and x2.8 for 519is p = 0.01).

Semi-quantitative analysis of short transcripts did not allow us to see any tendency for up- or down-regulation under bacterial stimulation. OVA specific T cells maintained basal expression levels of NKG5 mRNA during the stimulation period, with no upregulation. The two 519 isoforms remained at very low levels of expression over the whole period of stimulation. Short transcripts showed a slight increase, which was statistically significant (p25, p = 0.039; p38, P = 0.029).

The expression of granulysin within the whole LAK population was not changed after 4 days but a significant increase became apparent after 8 and 15 days of IL-2 stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Granulysin expression in different subsets of LAK cells was investigated by double labeling for CD surface markers and granulysin followed by counting of at least 500 cells. Significant increase in granulysin expression could only been seen in CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells from day 4 to day 15, while CD56<sup>+ </sup>cells expressed granulysin already at day 4 at very high level and no significant alteration was observed until day 15 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Only a few CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells were found to be positive for granulysin over the whole period of stimulation. The phenotypic analysis of LAK cells revealed that especially the number of CD56<sup>+ </sup>and the CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells increased, while the CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells decreased over time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The phenotypic pattern of LAK cells under IL-2 stimulation varied between the different donors. This is consistent with former results obtained by phenotyping PBMC of different donors under IL-2 stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

To a limited extent, 519 expression in response to mitogen and alloantigen stimulation was also studied in PBMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. NKG5 was found only in a NK cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and was therefore thought to be a NK specific transcript. Transcripts 519, 520 and 522 had been found in AJY, a functional T-cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Our newly described variants of 519 as well as the novel short transcripts were not found to be expressed in AJY. On the other side, we could not detect 522 and 520 mRNAs described in AJY. In our system all transcripts detected were expressed both in NK and T-cells. Another striking difference between transcript 519, found in the cell line AJY, and the 519 isoforms in PBMC derived LAK and <italic>Listeria </italic>specific T-cells, is the absence of exon 1. Currently, it can only be speculated if all these differences are due to a different regulation of granulysin gene expression in primary cultured cells. Of longer transcripts, the constitutively expressed NKG5 mRNA has an appropriate Kozak consensus sequence and a putative hydrophobic leader cleavage site and, as we found, it is also expressed in T-cells. It is most likely the transcript encoding the 15 kDa protein form that is then processed to the active 9 kDa secreted protein in NK and T-cells. In contrast to the NKG5 transcript, the two 519 isoform mRNAs had a very low basal expression and were significantly and strictly upregulated by IL-2 and bacterial antigen, indicating possible contribution of these alternative spliced transcripts in the transcriptional regulation of the granulysin gene. The longer form of the 519 isoform has also one potential in-frame initiation codon but it lacks the Kozak consensus as well as a hydrophobic leader sequence which would suggest that little or no secreted protein is encoded by this transcript. It has indeed been shown that transient expression of 519 cDNA in COS-7 cells did not produce a detectable level of protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As the 519 short variant does not have an in-frame start codon, its possible impact is rather unclear. The short transcripts (p25 and p38) have the potential to be translated since they could use the same start codon as NKG5 and could enter the secretory pathway, but no experimental evidence is yet available.</p><p>As experimental evidence is still missing, we can only speculate how the transcriptional regulation of granulysin gene expression is mediated. The granulysin gene shows extensive alternative splicing which is in contrast to other cytotoxic proteins, such as perforin and granzyme B encoded by only one transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. For the vast majority of alternative splicing events, the functional significance is unknown. The potential role of alternative splicing and different protein isoforms in the regulation of transcriptional activity has already been reported in humans e.g. for p53 and GLI2 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Willingham et al. found several functional non coding RNAs. Some of them are essential for cell viability, one repressor of Hedgehog signaling and one that acts as repressor of transcription factor NFAT, which is itself required for T-cell receptor-mediated immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Some possible functions of non-coding transcripts could be stabilizing of coding transcript or post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. To find out whether the two novel transcripts (p38 and p25) are translated in CTLs, their possible roles and the function of the 519 isoforms needs further investigations.</p><p>It has been reported that primary human NK cells constitutively express granulysin whereas CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells express granulysin upon stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Our results revealed a significant increase in protein levels over time under IL-2 or antigen stimulation observed in the whole cell population Monitoring different subpopulations, IL-2 increased protein synthesis only in CD8<sup>+</sup>cells. Recently Zheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] showed that IL-2 induces granulysin expression in isolated CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells. In our system, IL-2 did not induce upregulation of granulysin expression in CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells, but all transcripts were induced in a time dependent manner. Approximately 10&#x02013;15% CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells expressed granulysin between the first and second week of IL-2 stimulation. This discrepancy could be due to the fact that we did not isolate CD4<sup>+ </sup>out of the whole population prior to stimulation. Similar to our results, Liu et al. showed that IL-2 induced expression of perforin and granzyme A and B was mostly seen in CD8<sup>+ </sup>subset, but in CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells they also detected only mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. As expected, the CD56<sup>+ </sup>population showed very high constitutive expression of granulysin protein and messenger. When stimulated with IL-2, CD56<sup>+ </sup>cells proliferate and after 2 weeks constitute around a half of the whole LAK cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Taken together, increased levels of granulysin under IL-2 stimulation, monitored in the whole LAK population is due to an increasing number of CD56<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells as well as due to the induction of the protein synthesis in CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells. The number of CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells decreased under IL-2 stimulation, which could be explained by different expression of IL-2 receptor chains in different T cell subsets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>A slightly different pattern was observed in T cells specific for <italic>L. innocua </italic>or <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, where stimulation with both bacterial antigens revealed a similar phenotype with almost equal proliferation of CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells. This is in agreement with other studies showing that <italic>Listeria </italic>antigens may be presented via MHC class I and class II molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Similar to IL-2 stimulation, the increase in granulysin expression in the whole population was significant over time. In contrast, the percentage of granulysin-expressing cells was rising in both the CD4<sup>+ </sup>and the CD8<sup>+ </sup>populations. On mRNA levels after bacterial or cytokine stimulation all transcripts except NKG5 were upregulated between day 0 and 6 after which a plateau was reached (data not shown). This would mean that granulysin availability is delayed after T-cell activation, but supplies are replenished during Ag-specific responses.</p><p>Our results confirmed a rather slow kinetic of granulysin production similar to those described for other proteins associated with T cell terminal differentiation such as granzyme and perforin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Studying the kinetics of protein processing proved that IL-2 stimulation leads to processing of granulysin to an active 9 kDa form already in the first week, which is in correlation with data shown by Zheng et al. 2007 where granulysin was detected by day 5, whereas processing under bacterial stimulation occures during the second week of stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This first comprehensive study reveals various levels of granulysin gene regulation in human primary lymphocytes under different stimuli. It shows a complex transcriptional expression pattern encoding different mRNA variants through use of alternative splicing, followed by cell type specific translational regulation and slow posttranslational processing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Generation of LAK cells and dendritic cells (DC)</title><p>Human DC and LAK cells were generated <italic>in vitro </italic>from blood-derived precursors as already described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].
