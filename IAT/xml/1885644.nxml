Previously, the characterization of purified exosome complexes from yeast and human cells suggested that C1D and KIAA0052/hMtr4p are associated with the exosome and thus might regulate its functional activities. Subcellular localization experiments demonstrated that C1D and KIAA0052/hMtr4p co-localize with exosome subunit PM/Scl-100 in the nucleoli of HEp-2 cells. Additionally, the nucleolar accumulation of C1D appeared to be dependent on PM/Scl-100. Protein&#x02013;protein interaction studies showed that C1D binds to PM/Scl-100, whereas KIAA0052/hMtr4p was found to interact with MPP6, a previously identified exosome-associated protein. Moreover, we demonstrate that C1D, MPP6 and PM/Scl-100 form a stable trimeric complex <italic>in vitro</italic>. Knock-down of C1D, MPP6 and KIAA0052/hMtr4p by RNAi resulted in the accumulation of 3&#x02032;-extended 5.8S rRNA precursors, showing that these proteins are required for rRNA processing. Interestingly, C1D appeared to contain RNA-binding activity with a potential preference for structured RNAs. Taken together, our results are consistent with a role for the exosome-associated proteins C1D, MPP6 and KIAA052/hMtr4p in the recruitment of the exosome to pre-rRNA to mediate the 3&#x02032; end processing of the 5.8S rRNA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The human exosome is a complex with 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exoribonuclease activity, consisting of nine core components and the stably associated component PM/Scl-100, which is more abundant in but not restricted to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Six of the core components (hRrp41p, hRrp42p, hRrp46p, hMtr3p, OIP2 and PM/Scl-75) contain an RNase PH domain, which assemble into a hexameric ring structure, whereas the three remaining components (hRrp4p, hRrp40p and hCsl4p) containing an S1 (and KH) RNA-binding domain are positioned on top of this ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">3&#x02013;8</xref>).</p><p>A variety of nuclear functions have been described for the yeast exosome, including 3&#x02032; end processing of sn(o)RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and the degradation of aberrant pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>) and pre-tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In the nucleolus of eukaryotes, the 18S, 5.8S and 25S/28S rRNAs are transcribed as a single precursor by RNA polymerase I. After transcription, maturation of rRNAs is achieved by a complex processing pathway in which many nucleotide-modification events occur and in which the two internally transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and two externally transcribed spacers (5&#x02032;-ETS and 3&#x02032;-ETS) are removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In yeast, depletion of exosome components as well as several associated proteins such as Rrp47p and Mtr4p resulted in the accumulation of 3&#x02032;-extended 5.8S rRNAs, elevated levels of 5&#x02032; ETS fragments, and polyadenylated (pre-)rRNAs. Exosome depletion also indirectly affected early pre-rRNA cleavage events at A(0), A(1), A(2) and A(3) leading to a reduction of the mature 18S and 25S rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24 B25">18&#x02013;25</xref>).</p><p>Besides the core exosome components, several cytoplasmic and nuclear exosome-associated proteins have been identified which are most likely required for the recruitment of the exosome to specific substrate RNAs, its association with other processing complexes, or the modulation of its <italic>in vivo</italic> activity. Nuclear exosome-associated proteins include human MPP6, a protein required for the maturation of the 5.8S rRNA, and yeast Rrp47p (also known as C1D and Lrp1p), which functions in sn(o)RNA and pre-rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The putative human homolog of yeast Rrp47p/C1D/Lrp1p is the C1D protein, which has previously been identified as a DNA-binding protein involved in DNA double-strand break repair by activating a DNA-dependent protein kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The putative RNA helicase Mtr4p is another auxiliary protein required for most of the functions of the nuclear exosome in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The Mtr4p protein is also part of the recently identified TRAMP complex, which is required for the activation of the nuclear exosome <italic>in vivo</italic> by polyadenylation of target RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The KIAA0052 protein is the putative human homolog of Mtr4p and was found to co-purify with the human exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the exosome association and function of C1D and KIAA0052, which hereafter will be referred to as hMtr4p, in human cells. Our data indicate that PM/Scl-100 mediates the association of hMtr4p, C1D and MPP6 with the exosome and that hMtr4p and the complex formed by PM/Scl-100, C1D and MPP6 are required for the maturation of 5.8S rRNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>cDNA cloning</title><p>The cDNA of human C1D was obtained by a PCR-based approach using a teratocarcinoma cDNA library and oligonucleotides C1D-forward, 5&#x02032;-CGTCGACTTCTCGAGATGGCAGGTGAAGAAATTAATG-3&#x02032; and C1D-reverse, 5&#x02032;-AGCGGCCGCTTACCCGGGACTTTTACTTTTTCCTTTATTGG-3&#x02032;.

After 24&#x02009;h, the EGFP fusion proteins were visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). In agreement with previous observations, EGFP-PM/Scl-75 and EGFP-MPP6 accumulated in the nucleoli, whereas also a weak but significant staining of the nucleoplasm was observed for both proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) A very similar staining pattern was observed for both EGFP-C1D and EGFP-hMtr4p. Thus, the subcellular distribution of C1D and hMtr4p is consistent with their putative exosome association. </p><p>To investigate this more thoroughly, HEp-2 cells were transfected with either EGFP-C1D or EGFP-hMtr4p and also stained with an antibody to the exosome subunit PM/Scl-100. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, a nearly complete co-localization of EGFP-C1D and EGFP-hMtr4p with PM/Scl-100 in the nucleoli of these cells was observed. In the nucleoplasm, there appears to be less extensive co-localization, which might be due to the low levels of protein present in this subcellular compartment and/or to overexpression of the EGFP-fusion proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of C1D and hMtr4p with the exosome</title><p>To investigate whether C1D is indeed associated with the human exosome, immunoprecipitations with anti-EGFP antibodies were performed with lysates from HEp-2 cells expressing EGFP-tagged C1D, PM/Scl-75 or EGFP alone as a negative control. Co-precipitated material was analyzed by western blotting using a human patient serum (known to be reactive with PM/Scl-100) and a monoclonal antibody to the human exosome component hRrp4p. As expected, both PM/Scl-100 and hRrp4 were co-precipitated with the EGFP-PM/Scl-75 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 3). PM/Scl-100 and hRrp4p also appeared to be co-precipitated with EGFP-C1D (lane 4), although the efficiency of hRrp4p co-precipitation was much lower than that observed with EGFP-PM/Scl-75. With the EGFP protein alone no co-precipitation of hRrp4p and PM/Scl-100 was detected (lane 2). This result suggests that C1D is preferentially associated with exosome complexes containing PM/Scl-100. To substantiate the direct interaction of C1D and MPP6, another protein reported to interact with PM/Scl-100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), with PM/Scl-100, immunoprecipitations were performed using recombinant His-tagged PM/Scl-100 and <italic>in vitro</italic> translated glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), C1D and MPP6. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, precipitation of His-PM/Scl-100 by anti-PM/Scl-100 antibodies resulted in the efficient co-precipitation of C1D (lane 6) and, albeit to a lesser extent, MPP6 (lane 9), but not GAPDH (lane 3). In lanes 2, 5 and 8, anti-PM/Scl-100 antibodies were incubated with the <italic>in vitro</italic> translated proteins in the absence of His-PM/Scl-100 demonstrating that the antibodies are not reactive with either of these proteins. In the reciprocal experiment, precipitation of GST-fusion proteins using glutathione-Sepharose beads resulted in the co-precipitation of <italic>in vitro</italic> translated PM/Scl-100 with both GST-C1D and, although less efficiently, with GST-MPP6, but not with GST alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). </p><p>To identify protein&#x02013;protein interactions of hMtr4p with the exosome, GST pull-down assays were performed using GST-fusion proteins of several exosome components and auxiliary proteins and <italic>in vitro</italic> translated hMtr4p. The only protein found to specifically interact with hMtr4p was GST-MPP6 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, whereas none of the other proteins analyzed (C1D, hRrp4p, hRrp40p, hRrp41p, hRrp42p, hRr46p, hMtr3p, OIP2 and hCsl4p) were able to precipitate hMtr4p (data not shown). Because the <italic>in vitro</italic> translated protein samples contain RNA, the possibility existed that the observed protein&#x02013;protein interactions between GST-MPP6 and hMtr4p as well as GST-C1D and PM/Scl-100 might be RNA-mediated. Similar GST pull-down experiments were performed with <italic>in vitro</italic> translated protein samples that were treated with RNase A and RNase T1. The results demonstrated that these protein&#x02013;protein interactions were not affected by RNase treatment, even though control experiments showed that the RNAs were efficiently degraded (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>PM/Scl-100, C1D and MPP6 form a heterotrimeric complex</title><p>The finding that both MPP6 and C1D interact with PM/Scl-100 prompted us to examine the possibility that MPP6 and C1D bind simultaneously to PM/Scl-100. GST pull-down experiments were performed using GST-C1D and <italic>in vitro</italic> translated C1D, MPP6 and PM/Scl-100 proteins. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, no detectable interaction was found between GST-C1D and <italic>in vitro</italic> translated C1D or MPP6 (lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, GST-C1D efficiently interacted with PM/Scl-100 as observed before (lane 7). When both radiolabeled PM/Scl-100 and MPP6 were incubated with GST-C1D, not only PM/Scl-100 but also MPP6 was recovered in the precipitate (lane 8), demonstrating that C1D, MPP6 and PM/Scl-100 form a heterotrimeric complex <italic>in vitro</italic>. With the control, GST alone, no detectable interaction was observed with radiolabeled C1D, MPP6 or PM/Scl-100 (lane 4). </p></sec><sec><title>PM/Scl-100 is required for the nucleolar localization of C1D</title><p>Both MPP6 and PM/Scl-100 contain a putative nuclear localization signal. C1D on the other hand does not have such a sequence motif raising the question whether PM/Scl-100 and/or MPP6 is/are required for the nuclear localization of C1D. To investigate this possibility, we transfected HEp-2 cells with a C1D-EGFP construct and after overnight incubation the cells were treated with siRNAs directed against PM/Scl-75, MPP6 and PM/Scl-100, or a control siRNA. The reduction in protein levels was monitored by western blotting, which confirmed the efficiency of the siRNAs used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B demonstrate that upon knock-down of PM/Scl-100 the nucleolar accumulation of C1D is abrogated, whereas its localization was not affected upon knock-down of PM/Scl-75 or MPP6. Also, when the HEp-2 cells were transfected with the control siRNA, no change in the localization of C1D was observed. Although these results suggest that PM/Scl-100 is required for nucleolar localization of C1D, it is also possible that PM/Scl-100 knock-down reduced the stability of C1D-EGFP which might result in a cleaved EGFP fragment and the fluorescence pattern as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, panel PM/Scl-100 siRNA. To rule out the latter possibility, cell extracts of the transfected HEp-2 cells were analyzed by western blotting using anti-EGFP antibodies. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C demonstrate that knock-down of PM/Scl-100 did neither result in the detection of EGFP-containing degradation products nor in a significant change of the amount of full-length C1D-EGFP. In this regard, it is also important to note that knock-down of PM/Scl-100 did not result in co-depletion of other exosome components, such as hRrp4, hRrp41, hRrp46 or PM/Scl-75. Taken together, these data show that the nucleolar accumulation of C1D is depending on its interaction with PM/Scl-100. Knock-down of exosome components PM/Scl-75 or PM/Scl-100 had no effect on the subcellular localization of hMtr4p and MPP6 in similar experiments (data not shown). </p></sec><sec><title>C1D and hMtr4p are required for the maturation of the 5.8S rRNA</title><p>The nucleolar accumulation of both C1D and hMtr4p, as well as their association with the exosome, suggested that both proteins might play a role in the processing of pre-rRNAs. In yeast, it has been demonstrated that the maturation of the 3&#x02032; end of the 5.8S rRNA requires the exosome as well as several auxiliary proteins including Rrp47p and Mtr4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Recently, we demonstrated that the exosome and MPP6 are involved in this process in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the involvement of C1D and hMtr4p in pre-rRNA processing, RNAi experiments were performed by transfection of HEp-2 cells with siRNAs directed against PM/Scl-100, MPP6, hMtr4p or C1D. Two days later RNA was isolated and analyzed by northern blot hybridization using a radiolabeled probe specific for the 5.8S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). The results demonstrate that knock-down of all four proteins leads to the accumulation of similar 5.8S rRNA precursors. The size of the faster migrating processing intermediate seemed to differ slightly between the RNAs from the cells in which these proteins were depleted. The same processing intermediates were detected with a probe specific for ITS2, which indicates that these 5.8S rRNA precursors are extended at their 3&#x02032; end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Probing for other ribosomal processing intermediates such as 5&#x02032; ETS fragments did not result in detectable accumulation of processing intermediates corresponding to this part of the primary transcript (data not shown). </p></sec><sec><title>C1D is an RNA-binding protein</title><p>The results of the experiments described above demonstrate that the exosome together with MPP6, C1D and hMtr4p forms a multi-subunit complex involved in the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; processing of nucleolar and possibly also nuclear RNA. This raises the question how these different components cooperate in this process. MPP6 has been shown to contain RNA-binding activity with preference for pyrimidine-rich sequences, which is predicted to be involved for the recruitment of the exosome to RNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The Mtr4p protein is a putative RNA helicase which is most likely required for resolving secondary structures that inhibit nucleolytic processing by the exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The C1D protein has been reported to be a member of the family of non-histone polypeptides involved in higher order chromatin folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), of which some have been found to be associated with highly repetitive DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). We conducted GST pull-down experiments to investigate whether C1D is also able to bind to RNA. GST-C1D was immobilized using glutathione-Sepharose beads, incubated with different <sup>32</sup>P-labeled homopolynucleotides and the bound RNAs were quantified in a scintillation counter. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> show that GST-C1D binds efficiently to poly(G), whereas no binding to poly(A), poly(C), poly(U) or poly(I)&#x02013;poly(C) was observed. Additional experiments showed that C1D indeed binds to G-rich RNAs such as the ITS1, but also to tRNAs, which lack G-rich sequences, suggesting that the structure of the RNA may be important for C1D binding as well (data not shown). </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Although the molecular mechanisms by which the exosome is recruited to different RNA substrates is poorly understood, it is believed that in most cases auxiliary proteins are involved. Also, the processing or degradation of RNAs by the exosome may require additional proteins, such as helicases to resolve stable structures in the substrates. Here, we report the characterization of the association of the human C1D and hMtr4p proteins with the exosome and their involvement in pre-rRNA processing. Our data demonstrate that both C1D and hMtr4p accumulate in the nucleus with the highest concentrations found in the nucleoli. In addition, the results of our experiments provide insight into the way these proteins associate with the exosome. hMtr4p interacts with MPP6, which in turn binds to PM/Scl-100, C1D appeared to bind directly to PM/Scl-100. The binding of MPP6 and C1D to PM/Scl-100 is not mutually exclusive. The involvement of hMtr4p, MPP6 and C1D with exosome-mediated processing of pre-rRNA may be explained by the putative RNA helicase activity of hMtr4p and the RNA-binding capacity of MPP6 and C1D.</p><sec><title>Identification of C1D and hMtr4p as auxiliary proteins for the human exosome</title><p>Strong support for the association of hMtr4p with the human exosome was already obtained several years ago by the co-purification of this protein with the TAP-tagged exosome complex from human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The exosome association of C1D was predicted based on the interaction of its yeast counterpart Rrp47p with the yeast exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The relatively low level of co-precipitation of hRrp4p with EGFP-C1D in comparison with PM/Scl-100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) suggests that C1D is preferentially associated with exosome complexes containing PM/Scl-100. This is further supported by the direct interaction between C1D and PM/Scl-100 in both GST pull-down experiments. Moreover, in a mammalian two-hybrid system C1D interacted with PM/Scl-100, but failed to interact with all other exosome subunits (data not shown). The binding of MPP6 to both hMtr4p and PM/Scl-100 is consistent with previously published yeast two-hybrid data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In combination with the observation that C1D and MPP6 can bind simultaneously to PM/Scl-100, these data strongly suggest that the complex of C1D, MPP6 and PM/Scl-100 interacts with the exosome by virtue of the binding of PM/Scl-100 with the exosome. In this model, hMtr4p associates via its interaction with MPP6, although we have not yet succeeded in demonstrating the simultaneous binding of PM/Scl-100 and hMtr4p to MPP6. In agreement with this mode of assembly, the depletion of C1D or MPP6 did not interfere with the ability of PM/Scl-100 to interact with the core exosome, as monitored by Rrp4p co-immunoprecipitation (data not shown). The PM/Scl-100 protein is a putative 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exoribonuclease with a conserved RNase D and HRDC (helicase and RNase D C-terminal) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Although, no known protein motifs can be identified in the primary structure of C1D, the protein was proposed to bind to the 3&#x02032;-overhanging ends of DNA during repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that the nucleic-acid-binding capacity of C1D is not restricted to DNA, but that it also efficiently binds to structured RNAs including poly(G). Interestingly, we recently reported that MPP6 is also a RNA-binding protein, which preferentially binds to pyrimidine homopolymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Thus, various RNA-binding specificities are associated with the exosome via PM/Scl-100 and therefore it will be interesting to investigate whether these contribute to the selectivity of PM/Scl-100 and/or the exosome for substrate RNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>PM/Scl-100 is required for the nucleolar accumulation of C1D</title><p>Nuclear entry of exosome-associated proteins may be facilitated by protein&#x02013;protein interactions occurring in the cytoplasm and may proceed via a piggyback mechanism. Knock-down of exosome components or one of the auxiliary proteins did not affect the subcellular localization of hMtr4p and MPP6 (data not shown). Thus, these proteins seem to be capable to enter the nucleus independently of their association with components of the exosome. Knock-down of PM/Scl-100, on the other hand, led to reduced expression levels of C1D and abrogated the nucleolar accumulation of C1D. The PM/Scl-100 protein contains a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS; aa 752&#x02013;758, AKKRERA). Since C1D binds very efficiently to PM/Scl-100, it is likely that C1D is dependent on PM/Scl-100 to enter the nuclei and to accumulate in the nucleoli. The MPP6 protein binds less efficiently to PM/Scl-100 <italic>in vitro</italic> and appears to enter the nucleus independently of PM/Scl-100, which might be mediated by the putative bipartite NLS (aa 116&#x02013;132) in MPP6. Taken together, these data suggest that the identified exosome-associated proteins are transported to the nuclei via distinct mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>5.8S rRNA processing requires multiple human exosome auxiliary proteins</title><p>In yeast, the exosome was initially identified as a complex required for the exonucleolytic 3&#x02032; end maturation of the 5.8S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Later, it became evident that even for this relatively simple processing step the core exosome requires additional protein factors, such as Rrp6p, Rrp47p and Mtr4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Here, we have shown that besides the core exosome and PM/Scl-100&#x02009;at least three additional proteins, C1D, MPP6 and hMtr4p, are involved in 5.8S rRNA maturation in human cells. In yeast, the depletion of core exosome components, Rrp6p, Rrp47p or Mtr4p results in the accumulation of different 5.8S rRNA-processing intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In the human system, no major differences in the accumulation of 5.8S rRNA precursors were observed after knock-down of PM/Scl-100, C1D and hMtr4p. Previously, accumulation of similar precursors was also observed after depletion of hRrp41p and the exosome-associated protein MPP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The observed differences between the yeast and human systems may be explained by the depletion of the whole exosome from the site of processing upon knock-down of auxiliary proteins of the exosome in the human system.</p><p>Besides rRNA processing yeast Rrp47p and Mtr4p were shown to be involved in the 3&#x02032; end processing of many small nuclear and nucleolar RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Although we have extensively investigated whether similar defects in 3&#x02032; end processing of such sn(o)RNAs upon knock-down of MPP6, C1D or hMtr4p occur in human cells, we failed to detect any accumulating precursors. In yeast, it has been shown that for several exosome substrates, such as the U4 and U5 snRNA, other 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exoribonucleases can be involved in the 3&#x02032; end maturation of these RNAs as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Currently, it is unknown whether the failure to detect such processing intermediates in human cells is due to processing factor redundancy or to the low abundance of sn(o) RNA precursors in these cells.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank Stijn van Dongen for the mammalian two-hybrid experiments, Wiljan Hendriks (Department of Cell Biology, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands) for the anti-EGFP antibodies and Diarect AG (Freiburg, Germany) for the recombinant PM/Scl-100 protein.
