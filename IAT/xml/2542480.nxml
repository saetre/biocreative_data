We investigate here the involvement of EPB41L5 in epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (EMT) during mouse gastrulation. EPB41L5 expression is induced during TGF&#x003b2;-stimulated EMT, whereas silencing of EPB41L5 by siRNA inhibits this transition. In EPB41L5 mutants, cell&#x02013;cell adhesion is enhanced, and EMT is greatly impaired during gastrulation. Moreover, cell attachment, spreading, and mobility are greatly reduced by EPB41L5 deficiency. Gene transcription regulation during EMT occurs normally at the mRNA level; EPB41L5 siRNA does not affect either the decrease in E-cadherin or the increase in integrin expression. However, at the protein level, the decrease in E-cadherin and increase in integrin are inhibited in both EPB41L5 siRNA-treated NMuMG cells and mutant mesoderm. We find that EPB41L5 binds p120ctn through its N-terminal FERM domain, inhibiting p120ctn&#x02013;E-cadherin binding. EPB41L5 overexpression causes E-cadherin relocalization into Rab5-positive vesicles in epithelial cells. At the same time, EPB41L5 binds to paxillin through its C terminus, enhancing integrin/paxillin association, thereby stimulating focal adhesion formation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: Crb, Crumbs; EMT, epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition; p120ctn, p120 catenin.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals use a succession of tissue transformations between epithelium and mesenchyme to achieve tissue remodeling during embryogenesis. Upon transdifferentiation of epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells (epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition [EMT]), cells detach from neighboring cells and acquire migratory potential. Mesoderm and endoderm cells are formed during gastrulation with EMT of embryonic ectoderm or epiblast cells. A number of genes are known to be either down- or up-regulated at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamaguchi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batlle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carver et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). At the same time, it is believed that post-transcriptional events must also play crucial roles in the EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xue et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zohn et al., 2006</xref>), although the details of such events are still largely unknown.</p><p>The principal mediator of cell&#x02013;cell adhesion in the epithelial cell sheet is the cadherin-mediated adherens junction specialized at subapical surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">D'Souza-Schorey, 2005</xref>). Focal adhesions are the extracellular matrix (ECM)&#x02013;integrin junctions that bring together cytoskeletal and signaling proteins during the process of cell spreading and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mitra et al., 2005</xref>). Upon EMT the disassembly of the adherens junctions correlates with a loss of cell&#x02013;cell contact and an acquisition of migratory potential by the activation of focal adhesions; the two processes must be tightly coordinated. Dynamics of the adherens junctions and focal adhesions are controlled by the assembly and disassembly of adhesion components coupled with cytoskeletal remodeling. It has been suggested that p120 catenin (p120ctn) regulates the stability of E-cadherin in adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ireton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Davis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peifer and Yap, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xiao et al., 2007</xref>). Paxillin is a key factor regulating focal adhesion dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kondo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hagel et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Band 4.1 superfamily members have a FERM domain at their N terminus and an actin-binding domain at their C terminus, and are thought to play crucial roles in the regulation of interactions between integral plasma membrane proteins and cytoskeleton just beneath the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun et al., 2002</xref>). By the presence and absence of characteristic domains at the C-terminal side they are classified into several families: Band 4.1, PTPH, ERM, talin, and novel band 4.1 like (NB41L) families. The NB41L family has unique nonhomologous C termini and lacks an actin-binding domain; the family can be further divided into EPB41L4a and EPB41L5 families by the sequence identity of the FERM domain. In the mouse, the EPB41L5 family includes another member, EPB41L4b/Ehm2, in addition to the EPB41L5 examined in this study; all vertebrates have two members in the EPB41L5 family, whereas <italic>Drosophila</italic> has only one. <italic>Drosophila</italic> Yurt and zebrafish Moe in this family have recently been demonstrated to function as negative regulators of Crumbs (Crb) orthologues, which control epithelial polarity and apical membrane size in embryonic epithelia and photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jensen and Westerfield, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hsu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laprise et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study we demonstrate that mouse EPB41L5 plays essential roles in EMT and cell migration during mouse gastrulation. We propose that EPB41L5 coordinates the down-regulation of E-cadherin&#x02013;mediated cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and activation of integrin-mediated cell&#x02013;ECM adhesion in a post-transcriptional manner during EMT. EPB41L5 may destabilize E-cadherin by binding to p120ctn, predisposing it toward endocytosis. EPB41L5 also binds to paxillin and enhances paxillin/integrin association, thereby activating focal adhesions. The study reveals a new aspect of the function of scaffold band 4.1 superfamily member proteins, which is obviously different from its function as a component of the Crumbs complex, but consistent with the <italic>EPB41L5</italic> activation in oncogenic cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>EPB41L5</italic> in EMT of NMuMG cells</title><p>Erythrocyte band 4.1 superfamily proteins have been suggested to play roles in epithelial integrity, and we had chosen epithelial NMuMG cells to examine EPB41L5 functions. However, EPB41L5 was barely detectable in confluent epithelial NMuMG cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, Ab, c, and Bb</xref>). Epithelial NMuMG cells are transformed into mesenchyme-like cells (&#x0201c;mesenchyme&#x0201d;) by treatment with TGF&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miettinen et al., 1994</xref>).

In ectoderm, EPB41L5 was enriched at both the apical and basal sides, but less abundant on lateral sides (Fig. S2 Bd); details of EPB41L5 expression in early embryogenesis are given in Fig. S2. At E6.5 mutant embryos were proximo-distally reduced in size but histologically almost normal (Fig. S2, Ca and a&#x02032;; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, Aa and b</xref>). At E7.5 the embryos were hypomorphic (Fig. S2, Cb and b&#x02032;); spaces were scarce among three germ layers, and embryonic cells in each layer appeared to be stacked together (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, Ab and b&#x02032;</xref>). <italic>Snail</italic>-positive mesoderm cells were differentiating, but they spread poorly over the embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, Ba and a&#x02032;</xref>). <italic>Brachyury</italic>-positive axial mesoderm developed in the primitive streak, but did not extend anteriorly beyond the node (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, Bb and b&#x02032;</xref>). At E8.5 the rostro-caudal extension was retarded in the mutants (Fig. S2, Cc and c&#x02032;), and development of headfold was meager with minimum mesoderm cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, Ac and c&#x02032;</xref>). The foregut failed to close and neuroectoderm was hypertrophic (Fig. S2, Da, a&#x02032;, c, and c&#x02032;); E8.5 wild-type anterior neuroectoderm was still a single cell layer of the epithelial plate (Fig. S2 Dd), whereas in <italic>EPB41L5</italic> mutants the neural plate was multi-cell layered (Fig. S2 Dd&#x02032;). Presomitic mesoderm was generated but segmented somites were never formed in the mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, Ac and c&#x02032;</xref>; Fig. S2, Db and b&#x02032;).

The effects of EPB41L5 on E-cadherin&#x02013;p120ctn interaction were therefore examined. p120ctn binding to E-cadherin was indeed inhibited by EPB41L5, but not by EPB41L5 lacking the N terminus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 e</xref>).

EPB41L5 plays critical roles in this coordination, and this study proposes a &#x0201c;displacement&#x0201d; model for its function. EPB41L5 post-transcriptionally destabilizes E-cadherin by binding to p120ctn through its N-terminal FERM domain and reducing the association of p120ctn with E-cadherin. At the same time, EPB41L5 facilitates focal adhesion formation by binding to paxillin through its C-terminal domain and enhancing paxillin association with integrin. The study has revealed a new aspect of the function of band 4.1 superfamily members, which are thought to function as scaffolds for integral membrane proteins.</p><p>E-cadherin down-regulation in the EMT during mouse gastrulation is known to be regulated by Fgf signaling; Fgf signaling up-regulates the expression of <italic>Snail</italic>, which acts as a transcriptional repressor inhibiting <italic>E-cadherin</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batlle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cano et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>Fgf8</italic>, <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, or <italic>Snail</italic> mutants fail both to suppress <italic>E-cadherin</italic> and to induce a series of genes of mesoderm development at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamaguchi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cano et al., 2000</xref>). However, in <italic>EPB41L5</italic> mutants, the expression of <italic>Fgf8</italic>, <italic>Snail</italic>, and other mesodermal markers did occur. At the mRNA level, <italic>E-cadherin</italic> expression was also shut off and <italic>integrin</italic> expression was enhanced. However, at the protein level, E-cadherin persisted and integrin did not appear in <italic>EPB41L5</italic>-deficient invaginating cells at primitive streak and TGF&#x003b2;-treated NMuMG cells. Thus, EPB41L5 regulates E-cadherin and integrin expression post-transcriptionally. Because E-cadherin was down-regulated at the mRNA level, E-cadherin was eventually depleted in <italic>EPB41L5</italic> mutant mesoderm cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 c&#x02032;</xref>). On the other hand, &#x003b1;5-integrin was never elevated in the mutant mesoderm cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 e&#x02032;</xref>). EPB41L5 may stabilize integrin by increasing association with paxillin, and in its absence integrin may be readily degraded, despite the fact that integrin expression is seen at the mRNA level in the mutant mesoderm cells.</p><p>Arf6 has been reported to function in both decrease of cell&#x02013;cell adhesions by E-cadherin degradation and increase in integrin-mediated cell&#x02013;ECM adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sabe, 2003</xref>). RohA pathway is also known to play key roles in regulation of cell&#x02013;cell adhesions and cell&#x02013;ECM adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaibuchi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">D'Souza-Schorey, 2005</xref>). We have made intensive efforts to examine the possibility that EPB41L5 functions in these pathways, but no data have been obtained to suggest such possibility. EPB41L5 does not bind to Arf6 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>), nor did EPB41L5 affect p120 catenin binding to RhoA or Rac1 (unpublished data). RhoGTPase activity increases with EMT of NMuMG cells by TGF&#x003b2;; however, <italic>EPB41L5</italic> siRNA did not affect the activities (unpublished data). With the data obtained in this study we have proposed a &#x0201c;displacement&#x0201d; model for EPBL5 functions in cell&#x02013;cell adhesions and cell&#x02013;ECM adhesions. However, the possibility that EPBL5 functions in Arf6, RhoA, or another pathway cannot be excluded.</p><p>A question in the &#x0201c;replacement&#x0201d; model is why EPBL5 does not affect N-cadherin/p120ctn interaction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 g</xref>). Even if EPB41L5 is depleted, N-cadherin expression increases normally in invaginating mesoderm cells and TGF&#x003b2;-treated NMuMG cells at the protein level (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 d&#x02032;</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 Ab</xref>). Although the sequences for &#x003b2;-catenin binding sites are highly conserved, those for p120ctn are conserved only moderately between E- and N-cadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2000</xref>); it is possible that these cadherins have different affinities to p120ctn. Hakai binds to the p120ctn binding site of E-cadherin, but not to this site of N-cadherin; Hakai degrades E-cadherin but not N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fujita et al., 2002</xref>). There is also a report suggesting that an extracellular domain makes N-cadherin different from E-cadherin with respect to functions in EMT and cell&#x02013;ECM interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2000</xref>). This critical issue remains for future studies. Another question is the role of p120ctn in cell&#x02013;ECM interaction; this study suggests that EPB41L5 recruits p120ctn from E-cadherin&#x02013;mediated cell&#x02013;cell adhesions to the integrin/paxillin complex upon EMT. However, the study has not demonstrated any roles of p120ctn in the integrin/paxillin complex for cell&#x02013;ECM adhesions. This is also an issue worthy of further examination.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> Yurt and zebrafish Moe, the members of the EPB41L5 family, are negative regulators of Crb proteins, which control epithelial polarity and apical membrane size in embryonic epithelia and photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nelson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jensen and Westerfield, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hsu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laprise et al., 2006</xref>). In mammal EPB41L4b/Ehm2 and EPB41L5/YMO1 are also reported to be able to bind to Crb proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laprise et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, very recently EPB41L5 has been suggested to function in Crumbs-MPP5 complex for epithelial polarity in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gosens et al., 2007</xref>). However, the defects in the <italic>EPB41L5</italic> mutant ectoderm and endoderm cells were found to include an increase in cell&#x02013;cell contact, multi-cell stratification, and loss of basement membrane. Defects in cell polarity were not apparent in <italic>EPB41L5</italic> mutant epiblast, neuroectoderm, or endoderm. Electron microscopic observations and marker analysis indicated that tight junction, adherens junction, and desmosome form normally in <italic>EPB41L5</italic> mutant epithelia. However, the possibility cannot be excluded that EPB41L5 functions in epithelial polarity is complemented by EPB41L4b, another member of the EPB41L5 subfamily, which is also expressed during gastrulation (unpublished data). The increase in cell number, along with multi-cell stratification, in mutant E7.5 epiblast was not explained by the increase in cell proliferation, nor by the decrease in cell apoptosis; total cell number per embryo was also unchanged. This may also be the case in mutant E8.5 hypertrophic neuroepithelia. It seems likely that the increase in the cell number in epiblast or neuroepithelia is rather brought about by the inhibition of the transition of epiblast or neuroepithelium into mesoderm and endoderm or neural crest cells, respectively.</p><p>In vivo, EPB41L5 is not found ubiquitously in epithelial tissues at later stages as it is not in NMuMG or T47D cells. However, EPB41L5 is expressed in the entire embryonic epithelia in ectoderm and endoderm at peri-gastrulation (Fig. S2 B). Why does it not induce EMT there? Some aspects of EMT, such as increase in membrane ruffling and focal adhesions, were induced by EPB41L5 overexpression in epithelial NMuMG and T47D cells. Even in the epithelial monolayer, E-cadherin molecules dynamically turn over by endocytosis and recycling back to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">D'Souza-Schorey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xiao et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, interactions between the epithelial cells and basement membrane are essential to the maintenance of epithelial integrity. In addition, there must exist crosstalk between these cadherin-mediated cell&#x02013;cell interaction and integrin-mediated cell&#x02013;ECM interactions even in the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakamoto et al., 2006</xref>). EPB41L5 must play roles in these processes in epithelial ectoderm and endoderm, as suggested by the increase in cell adhesion and loss of basement membrane in <italic>EPB41L5</italic> mutant epithelial ectoderm and endoderm cells. However, the output of the EPB41L5-mediated crosstalk is markedly different in epithelial ectoderm and mesenchymal mesoderm. There is no apparent change in the level of the EPB41L5 expression among cells of the three germ layers. It appears probable that EPB41L5 activity is not different in ectoderm and mesoderm cells. In ectoderm, E-cadherin is actively produced, and this may compensate for the E-cadherin destabilization by EPB41L5, whereas in mesoderm cells E-cadherin is not produced at the mRNA level and residual E-cadherin protein in invaginating mesoderm cells may be readily degraded by EPB41L5. In ectoderm, <italic>&#x003b1;5-integrin</italic> is not produced at the mRNA level, and EPB41L5 may be unable to activate focal adhesions, as it can in mesodermal cells which do generate this integrin. However, the possibility remains that an EMT signal activates EPB41L5 by an unknown mechanism.</p><p>Recently NIK (NCK-interacting kinase/Map4k4) and p38IP (p38 interacting protein), which function in MAPK cascades, have been reported to down-regulate E-cadherin at the protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xue et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zohn et al., 2006</xref>). Movement is inhibited in p38IP mutant mesoderm cells, and this is due to the failure in down-regulation of E-cadherin. EMT during gastrulation is also regulated by Activin/nodal signaling. FLRT3 (fibronectin leucine-rich repeat transmembrane 3) and small GTPase Rnd1 have recently been reported to modulate cell adhesion downstream in this pathway, and independent of FGF signaling, by down-regulating cell surface cadherin through endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ogata et al., 2007</xref>). However, p38IP and FLRT3/ Rnd1 do not participate in the enhancement of cell&#x02013;ECM adhesions. In contrast, EPB41L5 not only down-regulates E-cadherin but also activates integrin/paxillin association for cell&#x02013;ECM interaction.</p><p>p120ctn stabilizes E-cadherin at cell&#x02013;cell contact sites, and its deficiency causes rapid degradation of E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ireton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Davis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xiao et al., 2007</xref>). However, the role of p120ctn has never been suggested in the EMT during gastrulation. Molecular details of how E-cadherin destabilized by EPB41L5 is internalized into endosomes remain for future studies. Paxillin is a key component in focal adhesions, presenting integrin on the cell surface and linking it to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kondo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hagel et al., 2002</xref>). EPB41L5 overexpression facilitated focal adhesion formation in T47D cells, while focal adhesions are deformed in NIH3T3 cells treated with <italic>EPB41L5</italic> siRNA, and scarce in <italic>EPB41L5</italic> mutant cells that emerged from the primitive streak. However, molecular mechanisms how the increase in paxillin/integrin association by EPB41L5 enhances focal adhesion turnover also remains for future studies. The details of post-translational coordination between the down-regulation of cadherin-mediated cell&#x02013;cell interaction and the increase in integrin-mediated cell&#x02013;ECM interaction on EMT are largely unknown. The molecular details of how EPB41L5 coordinate these two processes are of particular interest for future study.</p><p>Band 4.1 superfamily members are known to maintain epithelial integrity and to be tumor suppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun et al., 2002</xref>).
