We tested the hypothesis that high levels of FSH during the neonatal period trigger the expression of PPARgamma. To determine when PPARgamma expression is initiated, ovaries were collected from neonatal rats. Messenger RNA for PPARgamma was undetectable on day 1, low from days 5-14, and increased by day 19 pp (p &#x0003c; 0.05). PPARgamma was detected in select granulosa cells in primary/early secondary follicles. Messenger RNA for the FSH receptor was detected as early as day 1 and remained steady throughout day 19 pp. The FSH receptor was detected by immunoblot analysis in ovaries collected 1, 2, and 5-9 days pp. In a subsequent experiment, neonatal rats were treated with acyline (GnRH antagonist) which significantly reduced FSH (p &#x0003c; 0.05) but not levels of mRNA for PPARgamma. The role of FSH in the induction of PPARgamma expression was further assessed in ovarian tissue from FORKO mice. Both mRNA and protein for PPARgamma were identified in ovarian tissue from FORKO mice. In summary, the FSH/FSH receptor system is present in granulosa cells prior to the onset of expression of PPARgamma. Reducing FSH during the neonatal period, or the ability to respond to FSH, did not decrease expression of mRNA for PPARgamma. These data indicate that FSH is not a primary factor initiating the expression of PPARgamma and that other agents play a role in activating its expression in the ovary.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) is a member of the steroid receptor superfamily. This transcription factor heterodimerizes with the 9, <italic>cis</italic>-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) and binds to a short sequence of DNA, a PPAR response element (PPRE), present in the promoter region of target genes. PPAR&#x003b3; is activated by a variety of factors such as fatty acids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] for a review), prostaglandins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], oxidized products of LDL (9-HODE and 13-HODE; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] for a review), and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>TZDs are a family of drugs which are insulin-sensitizers and agonists of PPAR&#x003b3;. They are used to treat people with type II diabetes. Several studies have demonstrated that TZDs are effective therapeutic agents for some women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a leading cause of infertility in premenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Clinically, PCOS is characterized by hyperandrogenism, anovulation, and frequently the women are insulin resistant. Administration of troglitazone to women with PCOS reduced androgen levels, improved hyperinsulinemia, and in some women restored ovulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recent studies have also shown that administration of rosiglitazone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] or pioglitazone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] to women with PCOS restored ovulation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]).</p><p>Initially, PPAR&#x003b3; was identified as an adipocyte differentiation factor (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]). It has since been shown to be involved in a variety of physiological processes, many of which impact ovarian function. For example, activation of PPAR&#x003b3; influences the production of estradiol, progesterone, and prostaglandins (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]). It can also regulate the expression of plasminogen activators and matrix metalloproteinases (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]), proteolytic enzymes involved in ovarian tissue remodeling and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The expression of PPAR&#x003b3; has been identified in ovarian tissue from a variety of species: humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], hamsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In addition, Mohan <italic>et al</italic>. 2002 reported that PPAR&#x003b3; is also expressed in bovine oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Previous work from our laboratory and others has shown that PPAR&#x003b3; is expressed primarily in granulosa cells of developing follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The expression of PPAR&#x003b3; is lower in follicles expressing the LH receptor compared to those that do not express the LH receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and expression of PPAR&#x003b3; is dramatically down-regulated in response to the LH surge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It is not known however, what stimulates the expression of this transcription factor in granulosa cells, nor at what stage of follicular development expression of PPAR&#x003b3; is initiated.</p><p>Since PPAR&#x003b3; is activated by drugs in clinical use and dietary factors, and can impact various processes critical for normal ovarian function, it is important to gain a better understanding of how PPAR&#x003b3; is regulated in the ovary. The following experiments were conducted to determine when the expression of PPAR&#x003b3; is initiated in granulosa cells and to test the hypothesis that its expression is stimulated by FSH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures involving animals were approved prior to use by the Iowa State University or the Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were housed in a controlled environment with a 14:10 light:dark cycle and had free access to food and water.

Chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless specified otherwise.</p><p>To determine when the expression of PPAR&#x003b3; was initiated in ovarian cells, ovaries were collected from neonatal rat pups on days 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, and 19 pp. Tissues were frozen at -80&#x000b0;C or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Frozen tissues were processed for the isolation of RNA or protein; fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemical analysis.</p><p>The effect of FSH on levels of mRNA for PPAR&#x003b3; were studied in both neonatal and immature, juvenile rats. Neonatal animals were treated subcutaneously, daily from days 1-7 pp with vehicle (5% (v/v) mannitol in water; n = 7) or the GnRH antagonist, acyline (100 &#x003bc;g/day; n = 6; kindly provided by Dr. R.

On day 8 pp, ovaries and serum were collected and frozen for later analysis by RT-PCR or RIA, respectively.</p><p>Ovaries were also collected from immature rats after priming with estradiol. Twenty-three day old rats were treated with estradiol (1.5 mg/day in corn oil), subcutaneously, for three days. Granulosa cells were collected and 500,000 cells/well cultured as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] with the following modifications. Cells were cultured in duplicate with or without FSH (50 ng/ml) for 4 or 24 hours (n = 3 experiments). At the end of culture, granulosa cells were subjected to a direct lysate RNase protection analysis.</p><p>The role of FSH in initiating the expression of PPAR&#x003b3; was further investigated by analyzing the levels of mRNA and the expression of protein for PPAR&#x003b3; in ovarian tissue from follitropin receptor knock out (FORKO) mice. Ovaries were collected from mice carrying no alleles (-/-), one allele (+/-) or both alleles (+/+) for the FSH receptor at 3 weeks and 3 months of age (n = 3 animals/genotype/age group). Tissues were placed in RNA Later (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) until processed for RNA and protein isolation.

Normal goat serum (Vector Labs, Berlingame, CA, USA) was used in place of the primary antibody as a control. Serial sections from each of 3-4 animals/time point were analyzed.

Complementary DNA was synthesized from 1-2 &#x003bc;g of total RNA with Oligo dT as recommended for SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. Following quantification of cDNA by spectrophotometry, the transcript for PPAR&#x003b3; and the housekeeping gene, S16, were amplified by PCR. Primers used for PPAR&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and S16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] were published previously. Each reaction amplifying PPAR&#x003b3; and S16 consisted of 1 &#x003bc;M of each primer, 1.25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 &#x003bc;M dNTPs, 1&#x000d7; PCR buffer, 10&#x000d7; bovine serum albumin, and 2 U Taq-polymerase. Concentrations of cDNA used for amplification were 100 ng/reaction for PPAR&#x003b3; and 10 ng/reaction for S16. Reaction conditions were as follows: 35 cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes, 95&#x000b0;C for 1 minute, and 52&#x000b0;C for 1 minute, 72&#x000b0;C for 1 minute, 72&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes. Amplified products were separated by gel electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Densitometry was performed using Alpha Innotech SpotDenso software and levels of mRNA for PPAR&#x003b3; were standardized to levels of mRNA for S16/sample. All reagents used for semi-quantitaive RT-PCR were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA), with the exception of the Taq-polymerase (Bioline, Randolph, MA, USA). Primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA).</p><p>To ensure the semi-quantitative nature of the assay, the number of cycles per program and the amount of cDNA used as a starting template were tested. The number of cycles used in each PCR program was selected from within the range that yielded output in a linear relationship to input as determined by densitometry. Similarly, the amount of cDNA used was determined by selecting from within the linear range of output paralleling changing concentrations of cDNA in the reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Western immunoblot</title><p>Total protein was isolated from ovarian tissues collected at defined times pp (n = 3-4 animals/day) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and from FORKO mice using TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Because the expression of PPAR&#x003b3; was not disrupted in the uterus of these transgenic females the authors concluded that "...ovarian function might not be sufficient to induce implantation" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A recent study by Kim <italic>et al</italic>. 2008 also implicates PPAR&#x003b3; in the process of ovulation in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>The studies described herein are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to investigate when the expression of PPAR&#x003b3; is initiated in the rat ovary. The data presented demonstrate that the expression of PPAR&#x003b3; commences in select, but not all, granulosa cells as early as the primary/secondary stage of development. As follicles continue to develop the number of granulosa cells expressing PPAR&#x003b3; increases. The early stages of follicular development involve long, temporal processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The progressive development of PPAR&#x003b3; expression may reflect an advancement of gene expression patterns associated with the maturation of granulosa cells. These data indicate that PPAR&#x003b3; may be acting as a regulator of follicular development.</p><p>The observed onset of detection of PPAR&#x003b3; in granulosa cells suggested that its expression might be regulated by FSH. During the neonatal period, concentrations of FSH in serum are very high relative to those in immature, juvenile rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Detection of mRNA for the FSH receptor has been reported as early as day 2 post-partum, the earliest time point investigated, in rat ovaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Receptors for FSH were detected on type 2 follicles, those with 1-2 layers of granulosa cells ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]). Binding of FSH to its receptor occurs as early as day 3 post-partum (the earliest time point investigated; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]). Our data illustrating the detection of mRNA and protein corresponding to the FSH receptor as early as day 1 post-partum are in line with these earlier observations. Since mRNA and protein for PPAR&#x003b3; were not measurable by the methods used in these studies until days 5 and 7 respectively, taken together, these results support the conclusion that the FSH/FSH receptor system is present in neonatal rat ovaries prior to the onset of PPAR&#x003b3; expression.</p><p>Despite the temporal relationship between the expression of FSH/FSH receptor and PPAR&#x003b3; in the ovary, reducing circulating concentrations of FSH by 92% following GnRH antagonist treatment did not alter the expression of mRNA for PPAR&#x003b3;. Although not measured in our study, we assume that LH was also reduced but this did not impact PPAR&#x003b3; expression. In addition, although there was a significant decrease in levels of mRNA for PPAR&#x003b3; in cultured granulosa cells 4 hours after treatment with FSH, levels recovered and after 24 hours were not different from control levels after 4 hours of culture. The reason for the initial decrease in mRNA for PPAR&#x003b3; is uncertain, but may reflect an acute response to the relatively high dose of FSH administered. Although not as well understood as signaling mechanisms for LH, the binding of FSH to its receptor activates numerous second messenger systems directly and/or indirectly (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]). The acute accumulation of one or more products (i. e. cAMP; IP<sub>3</sub>) may have caused a reduction in mRNA for PPAR&#x003b3;-mimicking effects of high doses of LH on PPAR&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Catabolism of that second messenger as time in culture progressed may have allowed for the concentration of mRNA for PPAR&#x003b3; to return to levels not different from untreated controls.</p><p>The varied expression of PPAR&#x003b3; in the ovaries of FORKO animals also suggests that the expression of PPAR&#x003b3; is not under the primary control of exposure to FSH. Because the expression of PPAR&#x003b3; in heterozygous knockout animals in relationship to homozygous knockout or wildtype animals varied with age, it might be concluded that ovarian morphology and/or endocrine environment are more critical players affecting the expression of PPAR&#x003b3;. Ovarian morphology in FORKO animals is abnormal as early as day 2 post-partum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The altered population of follicles at various stages of development in these animals, and the fact that when adult they do not cycle, may be the reason for the varied concentrations of mRNA for PPAR&#x003b3; due to its expression being associated with progression of follicular development. Also, at 24 days of age estradiol is undetectable in FORKO mice, whereas testosterone and LH are significantly elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The altered endocrine environment in FORKO females may have affected the expression of PPAR&#x003b3;. Of interest is the observation that although not always significant, there was a trend for higher levels of mRNA for PPAR&#x003b3; in ovaries from animals with reduced concentrations of estradiol (heterozygous and homozyous knockout animals), especially at 3 months of age. Studies are currently underway to investigate the impact of estradiol on the expression of PPAR&#x003b3; and how it, in relation to other hormones (i. e. testosterone and progesterone), is associated with PPAR&#x003b3;.</p><p>The data presented from the current study agree with our previous work investigating PPAR&#x003b3; during the periovulatory period. Its expression is relatively high in granulosa cells prior to the developmental point when granulosa cells express the LH receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. As expression of the LH receptor increases, the relative expression of PPAR&#x003b3; decreases, and is dramatically reduced in response to the LH surge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore, it appears that the primary role of PPAR&#x003b3; is during the early stages of follicular development. Although its expression is down-regulated by one gonadotropin, LH, it does not appear that FSH is a primary player initiating its expression.</p><p>PPAR&#x003b3; is functional in the ovary. It binds DNA in rat granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and results from studies transiently transfecting granulosa cells with reporter constructs demonstrated activity both in the absence and presence of exogenous agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. These latter findings suggest that endogenous agonists of PPAR&#x003b3; are also present and active in granulosa cells. The studies presented herein show that PPAR&#x003b3; expression is initiated very early during folliculogenesis and that expression is associated with the progressive maturation of granulosa cells. Although our hypothesis that FSH regulated the expression of PPAR&#x003b3; was not supported, the findings from these studies indicate that other factors such as estradiol may play an important role. Because agonists of PPAR&#x003b3; have been shown to restore ovulation in some women with PCOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and can improve oocyte quality in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], it is important to understand how this transcription factor is regulated in the ovary.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MJL carried out all experiments involving rats and assisted in study design.
