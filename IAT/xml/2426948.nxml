The Fbw7 locus encodes three protein isoforms that occupy distinct subcellular localizations, suggesting that each has unique functions. We used gene targeting to create isoform-specific Fbw7-null mutations in human cells and found that the nucleoplasmic Fbw7&#x003b1; isoform accounts for almost all Fbw7 activity toward cyclin E, c-Myc, and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1. Cyclin E sensitivity to Fbw7 varies during the cell cycle, and this correlates with changes in cyclin E&#x02013;cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)&#x02013;specific activity, cyclin E autophosphorylation, and CDK2 inhibitory phosphorylation. These data suggest that oscillations in cyclin E&#x02013;CDK2-specific activity during the cell cycle regulate the timing of cyclin E degradation. Moreover, they highlight the utility of adeno-associated virus&#x02013;mediated gene targeting in functional analyses of complex loci.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: AAV, adeno-associated virus; CPD, Cdc4 phosphodegron; P382, proline 382; SREBP, sterol regulatory element binding protein; Y15, tyrosine 15.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>SCFs are multisubunit ubiquitin ligases that catalyze protein degradation by bringing substrates into proximity with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deshaies, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Willems et al., 2004</xref>). F-box proteins are the SCF components that bind to substrates, and this often requires substrate phosphorylation within motifs termed phosphodegrons.

Each isoform is expressed from a distinct promoter, thereby allowing differential isoform expression. Importantly, the 5&#x02032; exons contain signals that direct the isoforms to distinct subcellular compartments (Fbw7&#x003b1; is nucleoplasmic, Fbw7&#x003b2; is cytoplasmic, and Fbw7&#x003b3; is nucleolar; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Welcker et al., 2004a</xref>). Although a few isoform-specific functions have been described (e.g., nucleolar regulation of c-Myc by Fbw7&#x003b3; and recruitment of Pin1 to cyclin E by Fbw7&#x003b1;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Welcker et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">van Drogen et al., 2006</xref>), these studies have used overexpression approaches. In fact, little is known about the roles of the endogenous Fbw7 isoforms in regulating substrates. To clarify these issues, we used a gene-targeting approach using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to create a series of homozygous isoform-specific Fbw7-null mutations in human colon carcinoma cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Fbw7&#x003b1; is the most highly expressed and stable Fbw7 isoform</title><p>We used isoform-specific real-time PCR to quantitate endogenous Fbw7 mRNA in exponentially growing human cells. We examined two transformed cell lines (Hct116 and U2OS) and two primary cell types (foreskin fibroblasts and CD34&#x0002b; umbilical cord blood cells). In each case, Fbw7&#x003b1; was most highly expressed, and was between 8- and 50-fold more abundant than Fbw7&#x003b2; and 67- and 135-fold more abundant than Fbw7&#x003b3; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Transfection of equal amounts of Fbw7 expression plasmids results in much higher amounts of Fbw7&#x003b1; than either Fbw7&#x003b2; or Fbw7&#x003b3; (unpublished data). We thus examined the stability of ectopic FLAG-Fbw7 proteins because we can only detect the endogenous Fbw7&#x003b1; protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Fbw7&#x003b1; was stable (t<sub>1/2</sub> &#x0003e; 6 h), whereas the other two isoforms were labile (t<sub>1/2</sub> &#x0003c; 1 h; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The high amount of Fbw7&#x003b1; mRNA expression and its prolonged protein stability suggested that it is the most abundant protein isoform, and this was confirmed in Western analyses of endogenous protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). However, because the three isoforms reside in distinct subcellular locations, their relative concentrations within these compartments are unknown.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Expression and targeted inactivation of Fbw7 isoforms.</bold> (A) Fbw7 isoform mRNA abundance in the indicated cell types.

The targeting vectors inactivated the isoform-specific exons by the insertion of a selectable marker flanked by LoxP sites. After Cre-mediated excision of the selectable marker, stop codons were left behind in all three reading frames (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). We also made a vector that simultaneously disrupts all three Fbw7 isoforms by targeting exon 2 (termed Fbw7-null hereafter). The targeting efficiency of the various vectors ranged from 0.5 to 10% of the neomycin-resistant clones analyzed (unpublished data). Homozygous-null cells were obtained by two successive rounds of targeting. Cre-adenovirus was used to remove the neo cassette after each recombination. Correctly targeted and recombined clones were confirmed by PCR, Southern blotting, and genomic sequencing (not depicted and Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802076/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802076/DC1</ext-link>).

We could not detect endogenous Fbw7&#x003b2; or Fbw7&#x003b3; protein. We used real-time PCR assays to quantitate the Fbw7 isoform mRNAs in each Fbw7 knockout genotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Each of the isoform-specific targeted insertions led to reduced levels of their cognate mRNAs (but not the nontargeted isoform mRNAs), and this likely resulted from nonsense-mediated decay. This was most apparent with Fbw7&#x003b3; (96% mRNA reduction) and Fbw7&#x003b2; (80% mRNA reduction). Inactivation of either Fbw7&#x003b1; or Fbw7&#x003b3; modestly increased Fbw7&#x003b2; mRNA expression. As Fbw7&#x003b2; is a known target of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kimura et al., 2003</xref>), this may be because of the fact that p53 activity is mildly induced by Fbw7-loss (unpublished data). No similar compensatory increases in the expression of either Fbw7&#x003b1; or Fbw7&#x003b3; were seen in any of the genotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Isoform-specific regulation of Fbw7 substrates</title><p>We examined cyclin E, c-Myc, SREBP1, c-Jun, and Notch in the Fbw7 knockout cell series. Although c-Myc abundance was similar in all five genotypes, its turnover was greatly prolonged in the Fbw7-null and Fbw7&#x003b1;-null cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). We previously found that Fbw7&#x003b3; regulated the nucleolar pool of c-Myc in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Welcker et al., 2004a</xref>); however, we could not detect nucleolar c-Myc staining in any of the Hct116 cell lines (unpublished data), possibly reflecting cell type&#x02013;specific differences. We used real-time PCR to address the paradox that Fbw7&#x003b1;-loss delayed c-Myc turnover but did not elevate its steady-state abundance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). We found that c-myc mRNA was reduced by &#x0223c;60% in Fbw7-null and Fbw7&#x003b1;-null cells but less so in the other cell lines. These findings are consistent with autoregulation, whereby c-Myc protein overexpression represses c-myc transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Grandori et al., 2000</xref>), but other homeostatic mechanisms may also attenuate changes in c-Myc steady-state abundance after Fbw7 inactivation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>c-Myc and SREBP1 regulation in Fbw7-null cells.</bold> (A) Lysates from two independent sets of targeted Hct116 cells were immunoblotted for c-Myc or Grb2 (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref> for Grb2 panel).

Thus Fbw7&#x003b1; accounts for the majority of Fbw7 activity toward both c-Myc and SREBP1 in Hct116 cells. We note, however, that like cyclin E, these proteins are predominantly nucleoplasmic. We also examined c-Jun and Notch in the knockout cell lines. We did not find any consequences of Fbw7 deletion in c-Jun turnover in several contexts in the Hct116 series (unpublished data), possibly reflecting redundant turnover pathways. Moreover, Notch activity was barely detectable in Hct116 cells, and we could not perform further analyses of this pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Isoform-specific cyclin E regulation</title><p>Fbw7 specifically degrades cyclin E that is autophosphorylated and catalytically active, and assays that detect cyclin E&#x02013;associated kinase activity or cyclin E CPD phosphorylations (pT62, pT380, and pS384) are sensitive measures of cyclin E degradation by Fbw7. Cyclin E abundance and kinase activity were elevated in exponentially growing Fbw7-null and Fbw7&#x003b1;-null cells but normal in Fbw7&#x003b2;-null and Fbw7&#x003b3;-null cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Because Fbw7 deletions in mice reduce cyclin E mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tetzlaff et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tsunematsu et al., 2004</xref>), we examined cyclin E mRNA in all five genotypes and did not observe any significant differences between the cell lines (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802076/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802076/DC1</ext-link>). We also measured cyclin E degradation rates in each Fbw7 knockout line by labeling cells after synchronization in S-phase and found that cyclin E half-life was greatly prolonged in the Fbw7-and Fbw7&#x003b1;-null cells but normal in the Fbw7&#x003b2;- and Fbw7&#x003b3;-null cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Thus, Fbw7&#x003b1; accounts for most cyclin E degradation by the Fbw7 pathway. We note, however, that complete Fbw7 loss leads to somewhat higher steady-state cyclin E abundance than Fbw7&#x003b1; loss (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), but the basis of this difference remains unclear.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Isoform-specific cyclin E regulation by Fbw7.</bold> (A) Lysates from two independent clones of each Hct116 genotype were analyzed for cyclin E abundance and kinase activity (Grb2, loading control).

However, a recent study found that both Fbw7&#x003b1; and Fbw7&#x003b3; are sequentially required for cyclin E degradation in 293A cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">van Drogen et al., 2006</xref>). In this work, Fbw7&#x003b1; did not directly ubiquitinylate cyclin E but instead promoted cyclin E proline 382 (P382) isomerization by Pin1, after which cyclin E was ubiquitinylated by Fbw7&#x003b3;. To address this discrepancy, we used siRNA to inhibit each Fbw7 isoform or all three isoforms together in two cell lines. We confirmed the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">van Drogen et al. (2006)</xref> in that Fbw7&#x003b3; knockdown increased cyclin E abundance in 293A cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>, right). In contrast, Fbw7&#x003b3; knockdown did not alter cyclin E abundance in HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>, left). Fbw7&#x003b3; knockdown was verified by using a FLAG-Fbw7&#x003b3; reporter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, unlike the Fbw7&#x003b1; or common region siRNAs, Fbw7&#x003b3; knockdown in 293A cells did not increase cyclin E kinase activity or cyclin E&#x02013;phosphorylated species (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Because Fbw7&#x003b3; was found to target cyclin E for degradation after cyclin E P382 isomerization, we considered the possibility that P382 isomerization inactivates cyclin E and that the cyclin E&#x02013;CDK2 that accumulates after Fbw7&#x003b3; knockdown in 293A cells is P382 isomerized, catalytically inactive, and stable. We thus tested a cyclin E P382I mutant that was found to be degraded by Fbw7&#x003b3; alone and presumably mimics P382 isomerization. This mutant was active and phosphorylated in 293A cells, suggesting that P382 isomerization does not inactivate cyclin E&#x02013;CDK2. Overall, our studies show that Fbw7&#x003b3; is not required for cyclin E degradation in the cell types and assays we have examined. However, both Fbw7&#x003b1; and Fbw7&#x003b3; may regulate cyclin E degradation in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">van Drogen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sangfelt et al., 2008</xref>) and more work is needed to fully understand the complex relationships between cyclin E and Fbw7.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell cycle&#x02013;dependent cyclin E regulation</title><p>Because cyclin E degradation is triggered by autophosphorylation, we had predicted that it would be most severely affected by Fbw7 loss in S phase, when cyclin E&#x02013;CDK2 activity normally peaks. We thus compared cyclin E abundance in asynchronous cells, early S-phase cells, and prometaphase cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Surprisingly, cyclin E abundance in S-phase cells was similar among all five Fbw7 genotypes, and the major difference attributable to Fbw7 deletion was found in prometaphase cells. Deletion of either Fbw7&#x003b2; or Fbw7&#x003b3; did not significantly alter cyclin E abundance in any cell cycle phase.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Cyclin E sensitivity to Fbw7 varies during the cell cycle.</bold> (A) The indicated Hct116 cells were treated with either aphidicolin (S), nocodazole (G2M), or DMSO (A) for 16 h, and lysates were analyzed by Western blot (&#x003b3;-tubulin, loading control).

This was most apparent when we examined the amount of T62- and T380-phosphorylated cyclin E, which are the central phosphorylation sites in the two cyclin E CPDs and specifically accumulate when Fbw7 is inactivated. Cyclin E phosphorylated on T62 and T380 abruptly declined between 6 to 9 h after release in wild-type cells but remained stable in Fbw7-null and Fbw7&#x003b1;-null cells. Cell cycle kinetics was similar in all five genotypes (unpublished data).</p><p>The relative sensitivity of cyclin E to Fbw7 in different cell cycle phases could result from changes in either Fbw7 or cyclin E. However, Fbw7 protein expression did not vary when cells were arrested in aphidicolin or nocodazole (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>) or after release from an S-phase arrest (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Thus, changes in Fbw7 abundance are unlikely to account for cell cycle&#x02013;specific cyclin E degradation.</p><p>Because the synchronization experiments in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 (A&#x02013;D)</xref> used pharmacologic S-phase inhibitors that can trigger checkpoint responses that inhibit cyclin E&#x02013;CDK2 autophosphorylation, we used siRNA to knockdown Fbw7 in HeLa cells (which are readily and synchronously released from nocodazole) and examined cyclin E as cells traversed through G1 and S phase without using S-phase inhibitors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Again, we found that the consequences of Fbw7 inactivation were minimal in S-phase cells (10&#x02013;15 h after release) compared with prometaphase cells (0 time point). The cell cycle kinetics in wild-type and Fbw7-null cells were similar, as demonstrated by the timing of cyclin A expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>) and flow cytometry (not depicted).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Cyclin E&#x02013;CDK2 activity varies during the cell cycle</bold>.

That is, although S-phase cells contain more cyclin E protein than nocodazole-arrested cells, the cyclin E&#x02013;CDK2 immunoprecipitated from prometaphase cells is much more active. Because cyclin E degradation is triggered by autophosphorylation, these differences in specific activity could underlie the differential sensitivity of cyclin E to Fbw7 during the cell cycle.</p><p>CDK2 activity can be regulated by CDK inhibitors or by inhibitory phosphorylations on threonine 14 and tyrosine 15 (Y15). We evaluated both of these pathways in wild-type and Fbw7-null cells. p21 is a major regulator of CDK2 activity in some cell types (e.g., fibroblasts) and is degraded in prometaphase cells by the anaphase-promoting complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amador et al., 2007</xref>). We used siRNA to determine if p21 was preventing cyclin E degradation in S-phase cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). In wild-type Hct116 cells, cyclin E expression, activity, and S384 phosphorylation (an autophosphorylation site that functions as a reporter of cyclin E kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Geng et al., 2007</xref>]) all peaked in S phase and were lowest in G2/M cells, and this was not affected by p21 knockdown. However, cyclin E exhibited an inverse activity pattern in Fbw7-null cells: S-phase cells contained the highest amount of cyclin E protein yet the lowest amounts of kinase activity and S384 phosphorylation. p21 knockdown did not affect either the timing or magnitude of cyclin E activation and/or phosphorylation,</p><p>We next examined the amount of pY15-CDK2 (which is inactive) that is bound to cyclin E in Fbw7-null Hct116 cells. The amount of CDK2 Y15 phosphorylation varied dramatically and was highest in S-phase cells, intermediate in asynchronous cells, and barely detectable in prometaphase cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Thus, the amount of CDK inhibitory phosphorylation correlated closely with cyclin E&#x02013;CDK2-specific activity during the cell cycle. These findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating loss of inhibitory CDK2 phosphorylation as cells enter mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gu et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>These data indicate that when cyclin E&#x02013;CDK2-specific activity is very high, the stoichiometry of cyclin E autophosphorylation is also high and that this likely determines the amount of cyclin E that can bind to Fbw7. To test this idea, we used transfected FLAG-tagged Fbw7&#x003b1; to pull down endogenous cyclin E from Fbw7-null Hct116 cells that were synchronized in either S-phase or prometaphase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). As predicted, the amount of cyclin E that bound to Fbw7 was greatly elevated in the prometaphase cells compared with S-phase cells, even though the abundance of cyclin E protein was similar (because the cells were Fbw7 null).</p><p>In conclusion, our results show the utility of AAV-mediated gene targeting to study complex loci and reveal that a single isoform of Fbw7 is responsible for most Fbw7 functions, at least toward the substrates that we could examine. Furthermore, Fbw7-null cells provide a useful tool to clarify regulation of cyclin E during cell cycle progression. To this end, we found large variations in cyclin E&#x02013;CDK2-specific activity and cyclin E autophosphorylation during the cell cycle. In S phase, cyclin E&#x02013;CDK2-specific activity and the amount of cyclin E that can bind to Fbw7 is low. In contrast, prometaphase cells contain highly active cyclin E&#x02013;CDK2, which leads to increased cyclin E autophosphorylation and Fbw7 binding. Thus, changes in cyclin E autophosphorylation play a critical role in regulating cyclin E periodicity during the cell cycle by determining the accessibility of cyclin E to Fbw7. Indeed, tumor cells with Fbw7 mutations exhibit loss of cyclin E periodicity (including mitotic cyclin E expression; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ekholm-Reed et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, cyclin E is phosphorylated on both T62 and T380 in S phase (although it is not certain that both are on the same cyclin E molecule), and our recent studies indicate that these phosphorylated forms of cyclin E can only be degraded by Fbw7 dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Welcker and Clurman, 2007</xref>). Thus, one possibility is that Fbw7 dimerization is limited in S phase and that this restricts cyclin E turnover. However, our data clearly show that modifications of cyclin E itself during the cell cycle regulate its interactions with Fbw7. In particular, autophosphorylation of S384 appears pivotal, as it stimulates rapid cyclin E degradation when CDK2-specific activity is high. Our data also suggest that inhibitory CDK2 phosphorylation limits S384 phosphorylation until mitosis, providing yet another level of regulation. Finally, because ectopic cyclin E activity causes genetic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Spruck et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Minella et al., 2002</xref>) that may result from aberrant mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rajagopalan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Keck et al., 2007</xref>), robust cyclin E degradation in mitosis is likely to protect cells from these deleterious consequences of inappropriate cyclin E activity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>Hct116 (J.
