We recently reported that an aberrant, alternatively spliced CAPS2 mRNA that lacks exon 3 (CAPS2&#x00394;exon3) is detected in some patients with autism. Splicing variations in mouse CAPS2 and their expression and functions remain unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we defined 31 exons in the mouse CAPS2 gene and identified six alternative splicing variants, CAPS2a-f. CAPS2a is an isoform lacking exons 22 and 25, which encode part of the Munc13-1-homologous domain (MHD). CAPS2b lacks exon 25. CAPS2c lacks exons 11 and 22. CAPS2d, 2e, and 2f have C-terminal deletions from exon 14, exon 12, and exon 5, respectively. On the other hand, a mouse counterpart of CAPS2&#x00394;exon3 was not detected in the mouse tissues tested. CAPS2b was expressed exclusively in the brain, and the other isoforms were highly expressed in the brain, but also in some non-neural tissues. In the brain, all isoforms showed predominant expression patterns in the cerebellum. In the developing cerebellum, CAPS2b showed an up-regulated expression pattern, whereas the other isoforms exhibited transiently peaked expression patterns. CAPS2 proteins were mostly recovered in soluble fractions, but some were present in membrane fractions, except for CAPS2c and 2f, both of which lack the PH domain, suggesting that the PH domain is important for membrane association. In contrast to CAPS2a and 2b, CAPS2c showed slightly decreased BDNF-releasing activity, which is likely due to the C-terminal truncation of the PH domain in CAPS2c.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study indicates that, in mouse, there are six splicing variants of CAPS2 (CAPS2a-f), and that these are subdivided into two groups: a long form containing the C-terminal MHD and a short form lacking the C-terminal MHD. These results demonstrate that the splicing variations correlate with their expression patterns and intracellular distribution, and affect BDNF release; however, whether or not the short forms possess activities other than BDNF release, for example as natural dominant-negative isoforms, remains to be determined.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS/CADPS) family consists of two members, CAPS1/CADPS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and CAPS2/CADPS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. CAPS1 was shown to play a role in the ATP-dependent priming step of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered dense-core vesicle (DCV) exocytosis by binding to both phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate and DCVs in response to Ca<sup>2+ </sup>increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]; it also interacts with the dopamine receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A study of CAPS1-deficient mice suggested that CAPS1 is involved in catecholamine loading of DCVs in embryonic chromaffin cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. On the other hand, CAPS2 is associated with secretory vesicles containing the neurotrophins BDNF and NT-3 in the parallel fiber terminals of cerebellar granule cells, and is involved in the release of BDNF and NT-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. CAPS2 is widely localized across various brain regions, and shows overlapping distribution patterns with BDNF in many areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Our recent studies of CAPS2-deficient mice indicated that CAPS2 plays pivotal roles in BDNF release, cellular phenotypes (e.g., neuronal survival and differentiation, synapse structure and function), and behavioral phenotypes (e.g., water-maze spatial learning, anxiety, circadian rhythm, maternal behavior) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The expression of an aberrant splicing variant of CAPS2 in some patients with autism has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The autistic isoform, CAPS2&#x00394;exon3, is missing exon 3, which encodes the dynactin 1-interacting domain (DID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Exogenously expressed CAPS2&#x00394;exon3 failed to localize to axons but accumulated in somato-dendritic areas in cultured cerebellar and cortical neurons, suggesting a possible disturbance of local CAPS2-mediated neurotrophin release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In this study, we further explore splicing variations in CAPS2 and identified five additional splice isoforms. We characterized the expression patterns and neurotrophin release properties of these isoforms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Using cDNA probes comprising the sequence of both exons 4 and 5 of CAPS2, we screened a P6 mouse cerebellar cDNA library for splicing variants of CAPS2. In addition to the original clone designated CAPS2a [DDBJ: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB098623">AB098623</ext-link>], which was identical to the one that we previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], we isolated five additional variants, probably derived from full-length transcripts, designated CAPS2b [DDBJ: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB291947">AB291947</ext-link>], 2c [DDBJ: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB291948">AB291948</ext-link>], 2d [DDBJ: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB291949">AB291949</ext-link>], 2e [DDBJ: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB291950">AB291950</ext-link>], and 2f [DDBJ: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB291946">AB291946</ext-link>]. Sequence analyses against genome databases showed that these sequences could be produced by the different usage of the 31 exons of the CAPS2 gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). All splicing acceptor and donor sequences of these clones were consistent with the AG/GT rule.</p><p>The full-length CAPS2 protein consists of the following functional domains, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>: a dynactin 1-interacting domain (DID), a C2 domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a Munc13-1-homologous domain (MHD). CAPS2b lacks only exon 25, which encodes a part of the MHD. CAPS2a lacks two exons, 22 and 25, which encode part of the MHD sequence. CAPS2c lacks two exons, exon 11 encoding a C-terminal part of the PH domain, and exon 22. In contrast to these three long isoforms (CAPS2a-c), CAPS2d, 2e and 2f have large C-terminal large truncations from exon 14, 12, and 5, respectively; thus, these isoforms have neither the MHD nor the C-tail domain, which mediates the association of CAPS with DCVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These three short isoforms (CAPS2d-f) have an additional unique exon at their 3' end. The shortest isoform, CAPS2f, has only the first four authentic exons and none of the functional domains identified so far.</p><p>All isoforms (CAPS2a-f) have exon 3, which contains the domain interacting with p150<sup><italic>Glued </italic></sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The mouse CAPS2 exon 3 coding sequence is identical to the human CAPS2 exon 3 coding sequence, which is absent in some autistic patients. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, no exon 3 skipping was observed during the development of the cerebellum, from E18 to P56, provided there were sufficient PCR cycles. Moreover, no exon 3 skipping was observed in whole brain, thymus, lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, or testis from P7 or P21 mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). These results suggest that exon 3 skipping does not normally occur in mouse CAPS2.</p><p>We examined the patterns of CAPS2 splicing during cerebellar development, by RT-PCR using specific primer sets for each isoform. CAPS2b is the only isoform that contains exon 22. Therefore, RT-PCR with a primer pair spanning exon 21-exon 23 resulted in a longer band (267 bp) for CAPS2b in addition to a shorter band (147 bp) for CAPS2a and 2c. Interestingly, there was a peak in the expression of CAPS2a and/or 2c at P7, whereas CAPS2b was up-regulated throughout development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The expression of CAPS2d reached a peak at P7 and decreased thereafter, whereas that of both CAPS2e and 2f reached a peak between P12 and P21.</p><p>Among the eight mouse tissues tested, the brain, lung, kidney, and testis showed expression of all isoforms except for CAPS2b (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Interestingly, expression of CAPS2b was detectable only in the brain. Among these isoforms, the expression level of CAPS2f was the lowest as shown by its requiring the highest cycle number of PCR cycles to detect it (numerals within the parenthesis of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, C</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the cellular distribution of CAPS2 isoform mRNAs in P7 and P21 mouse brains by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization analyses. Exon 11, which contains a part of the PH-domain coding sequence, is skipped in CAPS2c, but is included in CAPS2a, 2b, 2d, and 2e (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The probe for exon 11 showed expression in the hippocampal formation, neocortex, midbrain, and cerebellar granule cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Exon 22, which contains a part of the MHD coding sequence, is skipped in CAPS2a and 2c, but is included in CAPS2b (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The probe for exon 22 showed an expression pattern with the most prominent level in cerebellar granule cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Expression of CAPS2d, 2e and 2f was also observed mainly in cerebellar granule cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E&#x02013;J</xref>). Moreover, there was no apparent difference in the expression patterns of these isoforms in the P7 cerebellar cortex (granule cells in the external and internal granule layers and migrating granule cells in the molecular layer), as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4K</xref>.</p><p>CAPS family proteins are essentially soluble proteins, but a fraction of them is capable of being associated with membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Therefore, we next examined the subcellular fractionation patterns of these splicing variant proteins, exogenously expressed in PC12 cells. All isoforms were stably expressed in transfected PC12 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). CAPS2 isoforms containing an intact PH domain (CAPS2a, 2b, 2d, and 2e) were recovered from the membrane fraction, although a major portion of each isoform was included in the soluble fraction. On the other hand, CAPS2 isoforms lacking a part of the PH domain (CAPS2c) or the entire PH domain (CAPS2f) were not detectable in the membrane fraction, suggesting that the PH domain has a role in the membrane association of CAPS2 protein, as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>We next examined the expression of the endogenous proteins produced from these splice isoform mRNAs in the mouse brain. Immunoreactive bands corresponding to short isoforms (CAPS2d-f) were observed at low to undetectable protein levels in the mouse cerebellum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In addition, the previous report showed that in non-neural tissue such as pituitary, lung, pancreas and kidney, only a 150 kDa band immunoreactive for CAPS2 was detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. At the mRNA level, more reaction cycles and time were needed for the amplification of transcripts encoding the short isoforms by RT-PCR and for the colorimetric detection of transcripts by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization, respectively, indicating that the expression levels of the genes encoding the short isoforms are very low. These results indicate that the function of CAPS2 <italic>in vivo </italic>is apparently due to the long isoforms (CAPS2a-c) rather than the short isoforms (CAPS2d-f). However, the functional role(s) of the short isoforms remain to be studied.</p><p>To analyze functional differences between splicing variants, we carried out a BDNF secretion assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). To investigate the effect of these isoforms on BDNF releasing activity, we exogenously expressed the three long isoforms (CAPS2a-c) together with BDNF in PC12 cells. Short isoforms (CAPS2d-f) were not analyzed because of their large C-terminal truncation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and very low expression levels in mouse brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, the levels of BDNF released into the culture medium in response to high-KCl stimulation were increased approximately two-fold by the expression of CAPS2a or 2b compared with cells without exogenous CAPS2 expression. CAPS2c-expressing cells showed lower BDNF-releasing activity than CAPS2a- or 2b-expressing cells; however, CAPS2c-expressing cells also showed an increase in BDNF release in response to high-KCl stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Moreover, there was no significant difference in basal BDNF release between CAPS2c-expressing cells and cells expressing either of the other two isoforms (CAPS2a and 2b). There was a partial deletion of the PH domain in CAPS2c (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The partial PH domain of PLC-gamma 1 is known to interact with a complementary partial PH-like domain of another protein and elicit its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that CAPS2c has some BDNF-releasing activity, although its activity is lower than that of intact PH domain-containing isoforms.</p><p>Interestingly, expression of the exon 22-containing isoform was up-regulated in the developing mouse cerebellum, whereas exon 22-skipped isoforms were expressed transiently, peaking at P7. Moreover, the exon 22-containing isoform showed higher BDNF-releasing activity than other long isoforms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). On the other hand, as described in our previous report, CAPS2 immunoreactivities are detected in both the soma and axon of cerebellar granule cells at P7, but almost exclusively in the axon at P21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These results suggest that the exon 22 splicing patterns are related to high releasing activity and axonal localization in cerebellar granule cells. CAPS2-mediated regulation of neurotrophin actions in terms of their releasing dose and subcellular localization may be important for normal cerebellar development.</p><p>The splicing of exon 22 is interesting for reasons other than the developmental differences in expression; that is, the exon 22-containing isoform was detectable only in the brain, whereas exon 22-skipped isoforms were widely expressed in various tissues. Exon 22 encodes part of the MHD, specifically a proline-rich domain (8 prolines within 40 residues). Proline-rich motifs occurred often in many protein-protein interaction sites, including one recognized by the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. Our preliminary screening of protein candidates that interact with the exon 22-encoded region, by yeast two-hybrid, isolated five candidates; however, none of these had an SH3 domain (data not shown). Future analyses of CAPS2 proline-rich domain-interacting proteins will clarify the significance of the alternative splicing of exon 22.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We explored the alternative splicing diversity of CAPS2 and identified six CAPS2 isoforms. The alternative splicing of exon 22 (presence or absence) was associated with a difference in tissue distribution and a developmental expression pattern. Our study showed that an intact PH domain is required for the association of CAPS2 with the membrane and efficient BDNF release activity. On the other hand, exon 3-skipping, found in autistic patients, was not observed in the mouse tissues tested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All experimental protocols were approved by the RIKEN Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning of mouse CAPS2 splicing variants</title><p>DNA containing exons 4 and 5 of CAPS2 was used as a probe to clone mouse CAPS2 splicing variant cDNAs.

At 24 h after transfection, PC12 cells were incubated in fresh assay medium (DMEM containing 0.2% BSA) for 10 min. Two different DMEMs were used: standard DMEM (11965; Invitrogen) and high-KCl DMEM (50 mM KCl, 65 mM NaCl based on 11965; specially ordered; Invitrogen). Both DMEMs were fully equilibrated in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere at 37&#x000b0;C before application. Culture media were collected after control and high-KCl stimulation assays, and the neurotrophin concentration (pg/ml) was measured using the BDNF Emax ImmunoAssay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Statcel software (OMS, Saitama, Japan).
