Insertion of the Sec residue occurs through a recoded UGA stop codon which is recognized by a complex machinery involving a secondary structure present in the 3'UTR region of the mRNA (Sec Insertion Sequence, SECIS), which interacts during translation with specific factors, such as SBP2 (SECIS Binding Protein 2) and eEFSec (eukaryote Elongation Factor), leading to Sec insertion rather than termination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In mammals, about 25 selenoproteins have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Most of them are enzymes involved in oxidation-reduction reactions, with the selenocysteine residue(s) usually located in the catalytic site and conferring a strong enzymatic reactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Moreover, most selenoproteins are expressed early during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and for several of them an essential role in embryogenesis has been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Selenium deficiency has been associated with different syndromes, such as Keshan cardiomyopathy, white muscle disease or rigid lamb syndrome, leading to dietary intake recommendations for humans and livestock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Notably, mutations were identified in the <italic>SEPN1 </italic>gene, encoding selenoprotein N (SelN), as the genetic cause for Rigid Spine Muscular Dystrophy (<italic>RSMD1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This pathology is characterized by axial weakness, severe scoliosis usually requiring surgery, and respiratory insufficiency due to respiratory muscles weakness and necessitating mechanical nocturnal ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. <italic>SEPN1 </italic>mutations were subsequently associated with three other neuromuscular disorders: the classical form of Multi-minicore Disease (<italic>MmD</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], rare cases of Desmin-Related Myopathy with Mallory Body-like Inclusions (<italic>MB-DRM</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and of Congenital Fibre Type Disproportion (<italic>CFTD</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These four early onset autosomal recessive pathologies exhibit clinical and morphological overlaps; they are now grouped and termed <italic>SEPN1</italic>-related myopathies (<italic>SEPN1</italic>-RM).</p><p>We showed previously that SelN is a glycoprotein located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In humans, its expression appeared ubiquitous and was down-regulated during myoblast differentiation in culture, and in the transition from foetal to adult tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In zebrafish, an early expression of <italic>sepn1 </italic>was shown during embryogenesis, specifically in somites, the tail bud and the notochord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>sepn1 </italic>zebrafish mutants obtained by morpholino injection, exhibited strong developmental defects such as tail malformations, disorganisation of somite borders, and abnormalities in muscles development and architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These data, as well as the early onset of the human pathology, clearly pointed to a possible role for SelN during muscle development. Interestingly, physical and functional interactions between SelN and ryanodine receptors (RyR) were recently demonstrated, indicating that SelN may regulate RyR activity in muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Here, we characterized extensively the expression pattern of <italic>Sepn1 </italic>in mouse during pre- and post-natal development, in several tissues, particularly in skeletal muscles. We demonstrated that <italic>Sepn1 </italic>is expressed early during mouse embryogenesis and that it is restricted to specific areas, including muscle precursors, at mid-gestation stages. In isolated tissues, mild variations of <italic>Sepn1 </italic>transcripts were detected between ages, whereas the protein expression was strikingly down-regulated during the perinatal period, indicating post-transcriptional regulations of <italic>Sepn1 </italic>expression during development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Spatio-temporal dynamics of <italic>Sepn1 </italic>expression</title><p>In whole embryos, <italic>Sepn1 </italic>expression was detected by qRT-PCR as early as E5.5, with higher levels from E9.5 to E12.5 (six and ten fold increase, respectively).

In parallel, increased levels were detected between E18 and postnatal day 1 in diaphragm, heart and kidney. Lastly, we showed a two fold increase in expression in the brain, between young (1-6 weeks) and adult mice (3-15 months) and a two fold reduction in kidney, between the first week of life and older mice (3 weeks to 15 months) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Interestingly, expression in quadriceps and diaphragm did not exhibit the highest levels and appeared mostly constant.

Nevertheless, quadriceps homogenates displayed an increase of both actin and GAPDH expressions after 15 days of age; for this tissue, no ideal protein normalization could be obtained. For all the tissues considered except liver, we observed a striking reduction in SelN expression between E18 and postnatal day 1 (about three fold reduction), and even more so at adult ages when it became barely detectable (less than 10% compared to E18) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

We showed that <italic>Sepn1 </italic>is expressed early during embryogenesis and strongly down-regulated before birth. We also demonstrated that, in most isolated tissues, <italic>Sepn1 </italic>expression exhibited limited variations at the transcript levels between pre- and post-natal stages, but significant changes at the protein levels were detected, thereby pointing to a major post-transcriptional regulation of this gene. Of particular interest are some specific tissues where a significant increase in the expression of transcript was observed between E18 and postnatal day 1 (for kidney) or older mice (for the brain), whereas an almost 80% decrease in the protein levels was detected between equivalent stages. Despite the lack of data concerning the developmental expression pattern of Sec insertion factors, one regulatory mechanism, inherent to selenoproteins, may be based on the availability of these specific factors. Indeed, this complex machinery may exhibit spatial and temporal regulation, associated with a hierarchy in the synthesis of selenoproteins, leading to potential fine tuning of each selenoprotein in both physiological and selenium deprivation conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It is thus conceivable that SelN expression is modulated depending on its requirements and biological roles in each tissue at the various developmental stages. Notably, we reported recently that the loss of interaction between the SECIS sequence and SBP2 abolished SelN translation and also led to the degradation of <italic>SEPN1 </italic>mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Therefore, modifying the interaction with the translational machinery may also affect <italic>Sepn1 </italic>transcript stability in mouse. Hence, whether the regulation of SelN during development depends on the availability of Sec insertion factors remains questionable.</p><p>Another regulatory pathway could involve microRNAs, recently reported as major factors for translation modulation without mRNA expression perturbation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Their importance in several developmental mechanisms has already been well established in most species, including vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We determined that the <italic>Sepn1 </italic>sequence is a potential target for several microRNAs (PC, PG, personal communication); however, their biological relevance and developmental involvement are not yet established. On the other hand, SelN expression may also be modulated by protein degradation or cleavage, as reported for different proteins located within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Such proteolysis was suggested in the study of Deniziak et al. who observed a potential cleavage product by Western blot that correlates with reduced expression of SelN in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, it was not investigated whether the degradation was physiological, or rather linked to the experimental conditions. Lastly, it is noteworthy that in some tissues, such as kidney and liver, in which similar dynamics were observed for protein and transcript expression, the gene is most likely regulated at the transcriptional level, although the factors involved are not known yet. Taken together, our findings reveal that complex transcriptional and translational regulation networks may be associated with the expression of SelN during development.</p><p>The expression pattern presented herein provides interesting insights into the physiological functions of SelN. Indeed, in all of the tissues examined except liver, high levels of SelN expression were limited to a particular temporal window, with a pronounced and progressive reduction observed between E18 and post-natal stages. These results are consistent with those obtained in zebrafish where a strong reduction of the expression was detected during somites differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and in humans where a decrease was observed between foetal and adult tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This developmental pattern suggests that SelN may participate in the maturation of cells and organs from mid-gestation to perinatal stages. This notion is supported by the observation that SelN expression decreased during both human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and murine myoblast differentiation in culture. To our knowledge, there is no similar expression pattern reported for other selenoproteins but this may be at least partly due to the lack of studies focusing on the expression pattern of these proteins in mammals. Notwithstanding, in mouse, selenoprotein W (SelW) was found to be expressed early during development (E6) and to decrease during myoblast differentiation, but comparisons between pre- and post-natal stages in different tissues were not reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover, in zebrafish, SelM was the only other selenoprotein reported to be expressed at the transcript levels in somites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Based on the previous data obtained in humans and zebrafish, a potential link between SelN and cell proliferation has already been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. At mid-gestation stages, we found that <italic>Sepn1 </italic>is expressed in the mesenchyme located under the ectoderm. Taking into account our previous work showing high expression in fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], we attributed this expression to mesenchymal cells that share the general features of fibroblasts. Moreover, we first hypothesized that this pattern could correlate with a higher proportion of proliferative cells in this area. However, BrdU staining in E11.5 embryos did not reveal a higher mitotic activity in this region (data not shown). Likewise, in mature somites, <italic>Sepn1 </italic>expression was detected in the myotome, mainly composed of post-mitotic cells that have initiated the myogenic program, while its expression was almost undetectable in the dermomyotome where most cells are proliferating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, at least during mouse embryogenesis, there is no straightforward correlation between <italic>Sepn1 </italic>and cell proliferation.</p><p>The early expression detected in somites correlates with ISH results obtained in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, in mice, the restricted expression found in myotome indicates that <italic>Sepn1 </italic>is expressed by muscle precursors and maturating myocytes but less or not by uncommitted cells. Interestingly, in contrast to observations performed on zebrafish embryos knock-down for <italic>sepn1 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], we did not detect any defects in somite organisation nor in myogenic factors expression, at mid-gestation stages, in <italic>Sepn1 </italic>mutant embryos. This suggests that SelN is dispensable for somitogenesis as well as the early waves of myogenesis in mouse. The simplest explanation would be that redundant activities exist in mouse, which may be less active in others animals. Due to the common reactivity of selenoproteins conferred by the Sec residue, one can hypothesize that some functional redundancy may exist within the protein family. Therefore, it would be interesting to further investigate other selenoproteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum, such as Sep15, SelS and SelM, and/or expressed predominantly during embryogenesis, like Gpx6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition, among the selenoproteins expressed in skeletal muscles, SelW is particularly interesting because of its dynamic expression during muscle maturation and its presumed association with white muscle disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Quantification of several selenoproteins expression by qRT-PCR revealed no difference between E12.5 wild-type and mutant <italic>Sepn1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>whole embryos (data not shown). However, additional experiments, including older mice and protein analyses, need to be performed to resolve this issue.</p><p>Lastly, the barely detectable levels of SelN expression found in mature muscles fit with the previous observations in human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and suggest a limited role for the protein at these stages. This contrasts with the progressive evolution of the pathology with age. One reason may be that SelN deficiency during muscle development leads to increased fragility of the tissue that worsens during aging. Another non necessarily exclusive hypothesis is that SelN is required in mature muscles subjected to constant tonic contractions, since the pathology affects more severely the respiratory and postural muscles. However, our data showing similar expression levels in muscles as different as quadriceps and diaphragm do not appear to sustain this hypothesis. The characterization of <italic>Sepn1 </italic>deficient mice, from later developmental stages to adult ages, will constitute a major point of investigation in order to better understand SelN function in muscle physiology and the remaining paradox regarding its almost ubiquitous expression and the specific muscular phenotypes.</p><p>Taking into account the recent studies suggesting a role for SelN in the regulation of ryanodine receptors (RyR) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], it is interesting to try and correlate their developmental activity with the expression pattern of SelN described herein. RyR1 expression was reported in mouse myotome as early as E9.5 by ISH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] but significant protein expression was only detected at late embryonic stages in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In addition, RyR1 expression greatly increases two weeks after birth and becomes predominant in mature muscles, therefore differing from SelN pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In contrast, RyR3 expression strongly decreases at postnatal day 15 and it is almost undetectable in most adult tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, it was reported that its expression is exclusively maintained in highly active muscles, such as diaphragm or neck muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] in which it may amplify calcium signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Interestingly, these tissues correspond to the most affected muscles in <italic>SEPN1</italic>-related myopathies. Taken together, this comparison between RyR channels and SelN weakens the proposed functional link between RyR1 and SelN, but suggests a closer relationship between RyR3 and SelN. This is further substantiated by our ISH results. Indeed, <italic>Sepn1 </italic>staining was detected in the dorsal root ganglia which correspond to neural crest derivatives containing cell bodies of sensitive neurons, where a CICR mechanism was reported and associated with RyR3 channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. We note also that <italic>Sepn1 </italic>was expressed in the sub-ectodermal mesenchyme, a region known to dynamically participate in cell migration during development, with active calcium waves involved in this process. Finally, the precise role of SelN in the regulation of RyR channels and the existence of other substrates remain largely unsolved.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study that establishes the precise spatio-temporal expression pattern of selenoprotein N in mammals, with both transcript and protein analyses at the different developmental stages. We showed that SelN is expressed early during mouse embryogenesis, particularly in somites and muscle precursors. Nevertheless, it appears to be dispensable for correct somitogenesis and expression of myogenic factors at mid-gestation stages. We also demonstrated that SelN expression pattern is wide-spread and is subject to post-transcriptional regulations which lead to the significant reduction of its protein expression levels during the perinatal period. Our results suggest important functions for SelN during the maturation of cells and organs. Further investigations should focus on the particular developmental window when SelN is strongly expressed, to determine the involvement of this selenoprotein in muscle physiology and to unveil the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to muscle alteration in <italic>SEPN1</italic>-related myopathies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Mouse C2C12 cells were grown in an humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, at 37&#x000b0;C, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% foetal calf serum (FCS, Invitrogen), 2 mM gentamycine (Invitrogen).
