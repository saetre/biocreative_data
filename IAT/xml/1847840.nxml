Knowledge of the structural and mechanistic basis of substrate specificity and activity is crucial for understanding steroid and hormone metabolism, drug sensitivity, pharmacogenomics, and response to environmental toxins. We have determined the crystal structures of five hSULTs for which structural information was lacking, and screened nine of the 12 hSULTs for binding and activity toward a panel of potential substrates and inhibitors, revealing unique &#x0201c;chemical fingerprints&#x0201d; for each protein. The family-wide analysis of the screening and structural data provides a comprehensive, high-level view of the determinants of substrate binding, the mechanisms of inhibition by substrates and environmental toxins, and the functions of the orphan family members SULT1C3 and SULT4A1. Evidence is provided for structural &#x0201c;priming&#x0201d; of the enzyme active site by cofactor binding, which influences the spectrum of small molecules that can bind to each enzyme. The data help explain substrate promiscuity in this family and, at the same time, reveal new similarities between hSULT family members that were previously unrecognized by sequence or structure comparison alone.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>We metabolize many hormones, drugs, and bioactive chemicals and toxins from the environment.

We have studied the human SULT family of enzymes to profile which small molecules are recognized by each enzyme. We also visualized and compared the detailed structural features that determine which enzyme interacts with which molecule. By studying the entire family, we discovered new ways in which chemicals interact with each enzyme. Furthermore, we identified new inhibitors and inhibitory mechanisms.

In doing so, SULTs modulate the activities of a large array of small endogenous and foreign chemicals, including drugs, toxic compounds, steroid hormones, and neurotransmitters. Because sulfonated molecules are highly soluble in water and easily excreted from the organism, SULTs are often referred to as enzymes of chemical defence. In some cases, however, SULTs activate certain compounds from food and the environment into mutagenic and carcinogenic metabolites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>To date, 13 human cytosolic sulfotransferase (hSULT) genes have been identified; they partition into four families &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;: SULT1, SULT2, SULT4, and SULT6. Although the family members share considerable sequence and structural similarity, they appear to have different biological functions. The SULT1 family comprises nine members divided into four subfamilies (1A1, 1A2, 1A3, and 1A4; 1C1, 1C2, and 1C3; 1B1; and 1E1). The SULT1A3 and SULT1A4 genes appear to have arisen from a segmental duplication and encode the same protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Members of the SULT1 family have been shown to sulfonate simple phenols, estradiol, and thyroid hormones, as well as environmental xenobiotics and drugs. The SULT2 family has two genes, encoding three proteins (SULT2A1, SULT2B1a, and SULT2B1b), which catalyze sulfonation of hydroxyl groups of steroids, such as androsterone, allopregnanolone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). SULT4A1 is the only member of the SULT4 family. The fact that it is highly conserved and expressed primarily in the brain suggests an important function; however, no activity or function has been identified for this gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Finally the SULT6B1 gene is expressed in the testis of primates, but neither the protein nor its enzymatic activity has been characterized &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Recent progress in the structural biology and characterization of the catalytic mechanism of hSULTs has established that many family members have distinct, but overlapping, substrate specificities and that the enzymes have a sequential catalytic mechanism that is susceptible to substrate inhibition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Nevertheless, only a few of the human enzymes have been subjected to detailed structural and mechanistic studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, and there are no reports of a systematic comparison among all the hSULTs. Understanding the structural and mechanistic basis for specificity among hSULTs is essential to elucidate their role in the metabolism of regulatory hormones, drugs, and carcinogens, and may assist in chemical risk assessment and the design of more-effective therapeutics. Here we report the crystal structures of five of the 12 structurally unique hSULTs. These structures, combined with those previously reported for six other hSULTs, allowed a comprehensive comparison of both global and local structural features. We further screened nine hSULTs for binding activity toward a set of 90 potential substrates and inhibitors, and eight hSULTs for enzymatic activity toward 31 potential substrates in order to better understand the relationship between binding specificity, activity, and structure within the hSULT family. These data, combined with detailed structural analysis of substrate binding sites, reveal relationships between family members not previously apparent from sequence analysis. &#x0201c;Chemical fingerprints&#x0201d; of the spectrum of small molecules that bind in the presence and absence of the cofactor product, 3&#x02032;-phosphoadenosine 5&#x02032;-phosphate (PAP), demonstrate a marked change in the small molecule binding profile upon PAP binding. This result, combined with the structural data, suggests PAPS has a strong influence on which compounds may bind in the substrate binding site and raises the possibility that the enzymes might be inhibited by chemically related compounds that are not productive substrates. The binding studies also provide insight into potential functions of the under-characterized SULT1C subfamily and of SULT4A1, an orphan member of the SULT family expressed primarily in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Completion of the Structural Coverage of hSULTs</title><p>The crystal structures of SULT1C3 bound to PAP, apo SULT1C2, a ternary complex of SULT1C2 bound to PAP, and the environmental toxin, pentachlorophenol (PCP), and SULT4A1 were solved at 3.2, 2.0, 1.8, and 2.2 &#x000c5;, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050097-sg001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050097-st001">Table S1</xref>). We also recently reported the structures of SULT1B1 and SULT1C1 bound to PAP at 2.1 and 1.8 &#x000c5;, respectively &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. The structures of a single subunit of each of these normally dimeric proteins are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g002">Figure 2</xref> along with a representative structure of each of five other SULT family members previously reported in the literature &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b010">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Six additional SULT structures, which are available in the Protein Data Bank, are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050097-sg002">Figure S2</xref>. As expected, all SULTs share the same basic fold: a central four-stranded parallel &#x003b2;-sheet surrounded by &#x003b1;-helices and three loops that are often disordered (dashed lines) in the absence of PAP and/or substrate. These disordered segments comprise a 13-residue loop (shown in gold), a 4~10 residue loop (cyan), and a large 32~46 residue loop (green and magenta). These loops have been mapped onto the aligned protein sequences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g003">Figure 3</xref> using the same colouring scheme. The degree of disorder and the exact conformation of these loops vary considerably across the family, but in general, the presence of ligands (cofactor and/or substrate) is coupled with increased order, namely, the formation of helices &#x003b1;4-&#x003b1;5 (gold), and &#x003b1;14-&#x003b1;15 (green). In some cases, partial stabilization can be attributed to molecular packing in the crystal, as in, for example, the stabilization of &#x003b1;14 (green) in apo SULT1C2. The binding site for PAP or PAPS (PAP(S)) is nearly identical in all structures bound to these ligands, with highly conserved residues contributing to the binding pocket (highlighted in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g003">3</xref>). It is interesting to note that the SULT6B1 sequence in the protein databases lacks the N-terminal region, which encodes a &#x003b2;-sheet thought to be an important structural component of the SULT fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We note that the recombinant SULT6B1 did not express in our attempts to purify it from bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Structural Comparison Supports a Role for PAPS in Priming the Conformation of Substrate Binding Loops</title><p>It is generally agreed that sulfonation takes place via a sequential mechanism in which a ternary enzyme complex is first formed, followed by reaction and release of products &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. However, both random and ordered binding of the substrate and cofactor molecules have been reported, and the detailed kinetic mechanism (or mechanisms) of the sulfonate transfer reaction is the subject of continuing research (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;). Comparison of all the available structural data provides insight into the order of substrate and cofactor binding. The structures provide evidence for both binary complexes (enzyme/substrate and enzyme/cofactor) consistent with a random bi-bi mechanism and ruling out an ordered mechanism in which binding of substrate requires binding of cofactor (or vice versa). This is in agreement with a detailed kinetic analysis for SULT1E1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. However, a closer inspection of the structures also suggests that binding of substrates may not be completely uncoupled from binding of the cofactor. In all the structures with the co-factor product, PAP, &#x003b1;14-&#x003b1;15, and the C-terminal segment of the largest flexible loop (green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g002">Figure 2</xref>) are ordered. This region contributes three absolutely conserved residues necessary for PAPS binding, T228, R258, and G260 (SULT1A1 numbering and red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Importantly, although the other loops (cyan, gold, and magenta) do not contribute directly to PAPS binding, they are more likely to be partially ordered in the presence of PAP(S). The PAP(S)-induced ordering of &#x003b1;14-&#x003b1;15 and residues 256&#x02013;262 (green and red) may also restrict the conformations available to the intervening substrate-binding magenta loop when PAP is bound. Thus, the structural data suggest that PAPS binding tends to prime the cyan, gold, and magenta loops for binding to the substrate.</p><p>On the other hand, the structure of SULT2A1 bound to androsterone &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g002">Figure 2</xref>L) hints that binding of substrates does not prime the PAPS binding loops. In this structure, the substrate-binding cyan and gold loops are ordered, but the magenta loop and adjacent PAPS binding residues (green and red portion of the loop) are disordered. Thus, although in this case, substrate and PAP(S) molecules can each bind independently to the enzyme as in a random bi-bi mechanism, there may be some degree of cooperativity between substrate binding and prior cofactor binding, but not vice versa. Given that the estimated cellular concentration of PAPS is well above that of most substrates, this may be relevant to the catalytic mechanism.</p><p>The family-wide structural comparison also suggests an additional or alternative explanation for the well-documented substrate inhibitory effect. Previously reported cases of substrate inhibition have been attributed either to two substrate molecules occupying the active site at the same time &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; or to the ability of substrates to bind in unproductive orientations at higher concentrations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Examination of the structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g002">Figure 2</xref> suggests a third or alternative mechanism; at high concentrations, substrates may bind in a mode in which the binding loops are incompatible with PAPS binding. This case is exemplified by the structure of SULT2A1 with DHEA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g002">Figure 2</xref>J, this structure can accommodate two substrate orientations at roughly 30&#x000b0; to one another. Comparison with other hSULT structures strongly suggests that SULT2A1 in this structure adopts a non-productive conformation. A portion of the green-and-magenta loop that contributes two residues for PAP(S) binding is folded into a helix, orienting the crucial PAPS binding residues away from the cofactor binding pocket. This helix conformation is not an intrinsic feature of SULT2A1, because in the SULT2A1&#x02013;PAP complex, this region adopts a conformation similar to that in other SULT&#x02013;PAP structures (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g002">Figure 2</xref>K and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g002">2</xref>J with this region highlighted by a question mark). Thus, it appears that the structure adopted by SULT2A1 with two molecules of DHEA is incompatible with PAP(S) binding and that this conformation is induced by the substrate. This is further evidence of &#x0201c;communication&#x0201d; between the substrate binding site and the PAPS binding site.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Ligand Binding and Activity Profiles Reveal Enzyme-Specific Chemical Fingerprints</title><p>In order to predict and understand the fate of xenobiotics and drug candidates in humans, it is essential to better understand the selectivity and specificity of binding and activity within the hSULT family. Although detailed analyses of individual structures have been very informative in this regard &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, we sought to compare all active sites relative to the spectrum of small molecules that can bind to each site. However, several of the proteins whose structures were solved in this study have not been previously characterized, and it was difficult to directly compare data from the literature due to differences in experimental conditions. Therefore, in order to evaluate specificity and selectivity in a consistent manner, nine purified, recombinant hSULTs were screened for binding to a library of 90 small molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050097-st002">Table S2</xref>) that comprised known substrates, inhibitors, related hormones, bioamines, and drugs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. In order to profile the entire hSULT family, we made use of the well-known fact that equilibrium binding of a ligand increases the thermal stability of a protein in a manner proportional to the concentration and binding affinity of the ligand &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. In a multi-well format, the thermal stability of each hSULT was monitored as a function of temperature and in the presence or absence of compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In the absence of compounds, well-behaved, sigmoidal thermo-denaturation/aggregation profiles were obtained for hSULTs 1A1, 1A3, 1B1, 1E1, 1C1, 1C2, 1C3, 2A1, and 4A1. SULT2B1b did not denature within the range of temperature used for this type of analysis (up to 80 &#x000b0;C). In this screening format, compounds that stabilize a protein by more than 2&#x000b0; C are scored as positives (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050097-t001">Table 1</xref>). It was not possible to assay binding to ligands in the presence of the sulfonated co-factor, PAPS, because the sulfonate transfer reaction would have taken place. However, except for SULT4A1, PAPS and PAP had equivalent stabilizing affects on all hSULTs. Thus, PAP was used as a substitute for PAPS in considering the effect of cofactor upon substrate binding, and screens for the binding of ligands were performed in the absence and presence of a saturating amount of PAP.</p><p>Based on these binding results, a set of 20 compounds that bound to at least one hSULT plus 11 additional related compounds or known substrates were used as a pool of potential substrates for enzymatic activity of hSULTs 1A1, 1A3, 1B1, 1C1, 1C2, 1C3, 1E1, and 2A1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050097-t002">Table 2</xref>). We monitored the conversion of PAPS to PAP by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as a tractable method of screening multiple proteins against multiple substrates (eight proteins and 31 substrates in this study), and the results serve as a convenient first approximation of enzymatic activities. We note that due to the relatively low sensitivity of this method, we were not able to reliably assay substrates at nanomolar concentrations, and therefore, some of the results may be complicated by substrate-mediated inhibition. Indeed, inspection of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050097-t002">Table 2</xref> shows that in some cases, the highest levels of activity were observed at lower substrate concentrations. This is especially true of SULT1A1, an enzyme for which significant substrate inhibition has been noted previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The combined ligand binding and activity screens revealed a unique &#x0201c;chemical fingerprint&#x0201d; for each hSULT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050097-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050097-t002">2</xref>). First, as expected from previous studies, there was considerable overlap in the substrate specificity for enzymatic activity. For example, all hSULTs assayed here were able to sulfonate a number of phenolic compounds such as naphthols and/or alkylphenols. However, within each substrate profile, there were also elements of specificity. For example, SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 were the only two hSULTs that showed significant activity toward catecholamines compared to other substrates, with SULT1A3 being more specific for dopamine, as expected from previous studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b022">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;.

It is interesting to note that in the past, SULT1A1 and 1A3 have been distinguished from one another in tissue fractions by the higher sensitivity of SULT1A1 to inhibition by 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol (DCNP) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Although we did not measure inhibition by this compound, we note that SULT1A1 bound DCNP in the presence of PAP, whereas SULT1A3 did not (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050097-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Six hSULTs (1C1, 1C2, 1E1, 1B1, 1A1, and 1A3) had enzymatic activity toward resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound present in grapes and wine, with possible anticancer and cardioprotective activities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. The activity profiles for resveratrol also displayed evidence of substrate inhibition by this compound for SULTs 1C1, 1C2, 1A1, and 1E1. Acetaminophen was a substrate for SULTs 1A1, 1E1, 1A3, 1C2, and 1B1, but not SULT1C3 and SULT2A1. Substrates for SULT1C3 have not been reported previously.

SULT1C3 appeared to be most active with &#x003b1;-zearalenol (4.1 nmol/min/mg) and 2-ethylphenol (2.2 nmol/min/mg). These data suggest SULT1C3 may contribute to the metabolism of steroid and phenolic compounds.

These data show that despite the limitations of our rapid screening method, the enzymatic activity data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050097-t002">Table 2</xref> reflects, to a first approximation, the expected relative substrate activities reported in the literature and reveal new activities toward pharmacologically important compounds.

Some known substrates for the well-characterized SULTs appeared to bind only in the presence of PAP&#x02014;for example, dopamine for SULT1A3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, and 1-naphthol for SULT1B1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;&#x02014;whereas many previously unreported compounds bound to these and other family members in the absence of PAP. It is interesting to note that not all known substrates, nor all of those with reactivity in our activity screens, were found to <italic>bind</italic> to the enzyme in the presence of PAP. For example, resveratrol was a substrate for SULT1A3 and SULT1C2, but did not stabilize either protein in the binding assays, either in the presence or absence of PAP. There are several reasons that may account for these observations. First, the enzymatic screen is likely more sensitive than the ligand binding assay in which compounds with K<sub>m</sub> or K<sub>d</sub> values in the high micromolar range are less likely to be detected &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Second, some ternary complexes may not be significantly stabilized relative to the PAP&#x02013;enzyme complex (especially at elevated temperatures). Finally, the presence of the sulfonate group of PAPS may also contribute to binding of substrates, and these cases may not be detected in our binding assay. Interestingly, binding of SULT1C1, 1B1, and 1E1 to resveratrol was only observed in the absence of PAP, but all are active toward this substrate. Nevertheless, the radically different binding profiles observed in the presence and absence of PAP are consistent with the structure-based mechanisms proposed above. Specifically, PAP (and presumably PAPS) appears to prime the substrate binding loops for subsequent binding to certain substrates, whereas in the absence of cofactor, the loops are free to bind alternative ligands (perhaps only at high concentrations), or non-productive ligand-bound conformations may exist. This priming of the substrate binding loops is likely made possible by flexibility of the binding loops observed in the structure. This structural plasticity may allow a reconfiguration of substrate binding loops in the absence of PAP(S) in order to bind a different chemical class of compound. For example, both SULT1C3 and SULT1B1 were stabilized by catecholamines in the absence of PAP, but neither showed significant activity toward this class of compounds. This raises the possibility that certain endogenous and/or exogenous compounds, such as those that bind in the absence of PAP, may act as competitive inhibitors of SULTs by occupying the substrate binding pocket and preventing a productive PAPS binding conformation, as for SULT2A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g002">Figure 2</xref>J).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Screening and Structural Analysis Reveals Novel Mechanism of Inhibition</title><p>Excluding SULT4A1, three compounds bound to all hSULTs: adenosine 5&#x02032;-(&#x003b2;,&#x003b3;-imido) triphosphate (AMP-PNP), a non-hydrolysable ATP analog; pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP), a competitive inhibitor for sulfotransferases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;; and quercetin, a potent inhibitor of SULT1A1 and SULT1E1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. These compounds had been known to inhibit one or more sulfotransferases, but our data suggest that they may be universal SULT inhibitors. AMP-PNP and PLP bound only in the absence of saturating amounts of PAP, suggesting that they occupy the PAP binding site, as might be expected from their structural similarity to PAP. Quercetin, found in many fresh fruits and vegetables, is a flavonoid with anti-tumour and anti-inflammatory activities. It is possible that some of its favourable physiological effects may be related to inhibition of hSULT activity. Additional inhibitors bound to only a subset of the hSULTs, including 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxy-benzoic acid (6,8-dichloro-4-oxo-4<italic>H</italic>-chromen-3-ylmethylene) hydrazide (DBHD), 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxy-benzoic acid (6-chloro-4-oxo-4<italic>H</italic>-chromen-3-ylmethylene)-hydrazide (DBHM), and PCP.</p><p>The binding profiles in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050097-t001">Table 1</xref> raise the possibility that compounds that bind to hSULTs only in the absence of PAP may inhibit hSULT activity. In order to investigate this possibility, we assayed the activity of SULT1B1 in the presence of increasing concentrations of five compounds found in our screens. These five include known inhibitors (quercetin, DBHD, PLP, and PCP), as well as isoprenaline, which binds to SULT1B1 only in the absence of PAP and is a poor substrate for this enzyme (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050097-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050097-t002">2</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g005">Figure 5</xref>, PCP and DBHD were strong inhibitors of SULT1B1, whereas PLP and quercetin had intermediate effects. Isoprenaline, however, had no inhibitory effect on the activity of SULT1B1 with 1-naphthol, and it was sulfonated by SULT1B1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050097-t002">Table 2</xref>), indicating that not all compounds that bind in the absence of PAP are necessarily inhibitors.</p><p>PCP is a significant environmental toxin due to its common use as a wood preservative and its use in the pulp and paper industry.

Our binding data suggest that PCP may be a competitive inhibitor of SULTs 1B1, 1C2, and 1A1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050097-t001">Table 1</xref>). For 1C2 and 1A1, PAP was required for binding; and for 1B1, PCP binds much better in the presence of PAP, suggesting that PCP binds in a substrate-like conformation facilitated by PAP(S). In order to better understand the mechanism of inhibition by PCP, we determined the structure of SULT1C2 bound to PAP and PCP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050097-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). The structure reveals that the protein undergoes a disorder&#x02013;order transition upon PCP and PAP binding. Helices &#x003b1;4, &#x003b1;5, and &#x003b1;&#x00131;5, and loops &#x003b1;5-&#x003b1;6 and &#x003b1;15-&#x003b1;16 are ordered only in the ternary complex, but not in the apo SULT1C2 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g002">2</xref>H). PCP is found in the substrate binding pocket and therefore appears to be a competitive inhibitor, consistent with crystallographic analysis of SULT1E1 bound to PAP and 3,5,3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-tetrachlorobiphenol &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Comparison of the SULT1C2-PAP-PCP and SULT1E1-PAP-estradiol structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g006">Figure 6</xref>) revealed two structural features that may be relevant in explaining the mechanism of PCP inhibition. In the co-crystal structures, the phenol moieties of PCP and estradiol share the same relative position and orientation, positioning the phenolic OH within hydrogen-bond distance of the catalytic histidine. This histidine is thought to be deprotonated and made catalytically competent to accept the phenolic hydrogen from estradiol, facilitating nucleophilic attack on the sulfonate of PAPS. Our structure shows that PCP appears to be in a catalytically competent conformation. However, PCP and estradiol differ dramatically in the acidity of their hydroxyl groups; the estimated pKa for estradiol is approximately 15, whereas that for PCP is 4.5. Thus, although PCP appears to bind in a catalytically competent conformation, the phenolic oxygen of PCP may be too weak a nucleophile to attack the sulfonate of PAPS.</p><p>The inhibitory effects of OH-PCBs and PCP have been interpreted previously in terms of variations in the bound conformation of the halogenated compounds relative to that of estradiol &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Although steric and conformational factors clearly play a role, our structure of SULT1C2 with PCP and PAP suggests a key role for the electronic nature of the halogenated phenols.

In order to rule out the possibility that SULT4A1 simply has a much weaker affinity for PAP, we performed titration experiments for several of the proteins with increasing concentrations of PAP ranging from 90 &#x003bc;M to 90 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). SULT1C1, SULT1C2, SULT1C3, and SULT1B1 showed similar saturation binding curves, reaching saturation at about 100 &#x003bc;M. However, PAP when added at concentrations as high as 90 mM did not stabilize SULT4A1. SULT4A1 is one of the hSULTs that is most divergent in sequence, and examination of the binding pocket revealed two significant differences that are predicted to affect PAP binding. First, a Trp in &#x003b1;3 that is conserved in all other hSULTs and stacks with the adenine ring of PAPS (Trp53 in SULT1A1) is replaced with a Leu in SULT4A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Second, the magenta PAP binding loop is much shorter in SULT4A1 than in the other hSULTs, and lacks the conserved Lys residue that separates the key PAPS binding residues Arg258 and Gly260 (SULT1A1 numbering), which results in these residues being out of register. Taken together, SULT4A1 has a slightly smaller PAPS binding pocket that is predicted to be unable to accommodate the cofactor. Interestingly, some residual electron density was observed in the PAP binding pocket of recombinant SULT4A1. Presumably this derives from a bound small molecule that was co-crystallized, although we were not able to identify it either by modelling atoms into the electron density or using mass spectrometry.</p><p>To test the possibility that SULT4A1 might use an alternate sulfonate donor, we tested several potential alternates such as adenosine phosphosulfate, 4-nitrocatechol sulfate, 4-acetylphenyl sulfate, estrone 3-sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, and 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate. None of these compounds stabilized SULT4A1 against thermal aggregation (unpublished data). These data strongly suggest that SULT4A1 may not have significant catalytic activity in vivo. Indeed, although very weak activity has been reported in one case &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;, other groups have failed to observe activity for human SULT4A1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Significantly, this protein, which is expressed primarily in the brain, binds to 2-hydroxylestradiol, thyroid hormone, T4 (3,3&#x02032;,5,5&#x02032;-tetraiodo-L-thyronine), and the catecholamines norepinephrine, epinephrine, and isoprenaline (but not dopamine), suggesting that SULT4A1 may modulate the bioactivity of these compounds via a mechanism distinct from sulfonation. Of note, SULT4A1 did not bind any simple phenolic compounds under the conditions tested here.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Binding Profiles Suggest Alternative Classifications of hSULTs</title><p>Examination of the chemical fingerprints reflected in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050097-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050097-t002">2</xref> suggests that subsets of the hSULTs can be clustered based on the chemical properties of the compounds that they bind&#x02014;relationships that are not evident from global sequence comparison. To explore alternative activity or structure-based classifications of hSULTs in more detail, we performed average hierarchical clustering on the experimental data in an attempt to identify correlations between the <italic>local</italic> sequence or structural features of the substrate binding pockets and activity profiles among the hSULTs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g008">Figure 8</xref> shows the clustering of similarity matrices for each parameter, viewed using trees. Considering only global sequence similarity, the hSULTs cluster according to their nomenclature and phylogenetic relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). Considering only the nine proteins for which we have binding or enzymatic data, SULTs 1A1 and 1A3 are most closely related, with a global sequence identity of 95&#x00025;. The three SULT1C proteins cluster with average sequence identities close to 55&#x00025;, as do SULT1E1 and 1B1. SULT2, &#x02212;4, and &#x02212;6 subfamilies are relative outliers with sequence identities to all other SULTs considered here around 35&#x00025; or less. It is well known that related enzymes with sequence identities below 40&#x00025; have often evolved to have different substrate specificities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;, and therefore, we would expect most of the SULTs to sulfonate different substrates, except perhaps 1A1 and 1A3. In keeping with this concept, the closely related SULTs 1A1 and 1A3 are clearly the most similar within the substrate binding site, as measured by both local sequence and structure comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g008">Figure 8</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g008">8</xref>C). However, the clustering of the other more distantly related SULTs is sufficiently different at the level of local sequence and structure, such that the SULT1C proteins are no longer clustered together and the outliers are different. These comparisons show that the local sequence and structures of the substrate binding sites do not correspond to the global sequence relationships.</p><p>These results also illustrate why members of the same subfamily do not metabolize the same classes of compounds. Although the clustering of hSULTs presented here is likely influenced by the limited subset of compounds used in our binding and activity assays, the results provide an initial view of the family-wide activity-based classifications. The trees that cluster the eight or nine proteins according to their binding and activity profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g008">Figure 8</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g008">8</xref>F) show a remarkably different clustering from the sequence- and structure-based trees. First, 1A3 and 1A1 no longer cluster together, despite their strong global sequence similarity (95&#x00025; identity). Inspection of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050097-t001">Table 1</xref> shows that 1A1 strongly binds most of the phenols and acidic compounds, once PAP is bound, whereas 1A3 shows absolutely no binding of these substrates. These SULTs are also distinguished by their differential reactivity toward catecholamines, with SULT1A3 able to bind dopamine and having higher relative activity toward catecholamines compared to phenols, as previously noted &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Comparison of the residues in the substrate binding loops of SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 revealed that all residues are identical (and in identical positions in the structures) except for the eight residues shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g009">Figure 9</xref>. These changes map to two loops (residues 84&#x02013;89 and 143&#x02013;148) and residue 247 (SULT1A1 numbering). Importantly, SULT1A3, which does not bind acidic compounds, has acidic instead of hydrophobic residues at three of these positions. The net result is a much more negatively charged pocket for SULT1A3 compared to SULT1A1. This difference would disfavour binding of compounds with a net negative charge to SULT1A3 and favour interactions with the amino group of catecholamines. Thus, the strong local sequence and structure similarities in 1A1 and 1A3 are manifested in their similar ability to bind similar inhibitors and sulfonate catecholamines (as a class), but small, local sequence changes in the substrate binding site have enhanced the ability of SULT1A3 to bind catecholamines such as dopamine &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, and completely changed its ability to bind acidic compounds. The influence of residue 146 on the specificity of SULT1A1 compared to SULT1A3 (Ala vs. Glu) has been previously noted &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050097-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;; however, the results presented here suggest that additional differences in the binding loops also contribute to specificity.</p><p>SULT1B1 and 1C2 cluster together in the trees of local structure, activity, and binding in the presence of PAP. These groupings reflect their common ability to bind acidic compounds (and the acidic phenols PCP and 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol), with promiscuous activity profiles toward phenols. Thus, SULT1B1 and 1C2 appear to be much more closely related in terms of structure and activity than their global sequences would indicate.</p><p>Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g008">Figure 8</xref>F shows that the clustering of hSULTs again differs when considering the binding of compounds in the absence of PAP. In this case, none of the previously noted similarities is evident. Many of the compounds in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050097-t001">Table 1</xref> are inhibitors of hSULT activity. The differential clustering in the absence of PAP may reflect possible unrelated configurations of binding-site residues when bound to these compounds or the tendency for more disorder in the absence of PAP. The clustering of both binding profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g008">Figure 8</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g008">8</xref>F) places SULT4A1 as the furthest outlier, analogous to its position in the global sequence comparison. Although this is consistent with the inability of SULT4A1 to bind PAP and catalyze sulfonation, it is interesting to note that this is not due to a radical difference in local binding-site sequence or structure, because SULT4A1 clusters with SULT1C1 when considering these local factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g008">Figure 8</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g008">8</xref>C). As noted above, apparently small differences of one to two residues in the PAP binding site are likely responsible for this behaviour.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>An important challenge in structural biology, chemical biology, and drug discovery is to relate changes in local sequence and structure to the binding and activity profiles of homologous enzymes in order to better predict or explain substrate and inhibitor specificity within an enzyme family. In the case of the hSULTs, this is particularly desirable in order to predict the fate of xenobiotics, hormones, and drug candidates in humans. Like other phase II detoxification enzymes, hSULTs are known to have broad and overlapping substrate specificities. We and others have shown that this promiscuity derives from the considerable flexibility or plasticity of the hSULT binding sites and therefore, a full understanding of specificity will require multiple three-dimensional structures for each hSULT in complex with substrates and inhibitors, as well as knowledge of the full spectrum of small molecules that bind in both productive and non-productive conformations. Our structural and chemical profiling data prepare the foundation for such detailed studies.</p><p>Here we also reveal a previously unrecognized structural role for the cofactor PAP(S); namely priming of the often disordered substrate binding loops for interaction with substrates. The &#x0201c;magenta loop&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050097-g002">Figure 2</xref>), which contributes to both PAPS and substrate binding pockets, can also, in some instances, adopt an inactive conformation and may explain substrate-induced inhibition and/or inhibition by compounds that bind in the absence of PAPS, as well as by known inhibitors. The flexibility of the substrate binding loops in hSULTs likely contributes to the wide repertoire of compounds that can be accommodated in the substrate binding pocket, only a subset of which lead to productive sulfonation.</p><p>Our results provide insight into mechanisms of inhibition of hSULTs. In addition to structural mechanisms of substrate inhibition (above), we identified three compounds (PLP, AMP-PNP, and quercetin) that appear to be broad-spectrum hSULT inhibitors, and may also inhibit other non-cytosolic sulfotransferases. We have also provided insight into how PCP and possibly other polychlorinated phenolic compounds can inhibit hSULTs. These compounds, which are known endocrine disruptors, appear to bind in a manner very similar to other productive substrates, but are unreactive, at least in part, due to their weakly acidic properties.</p><p>Our analyses have also provided insight into the functions of the less well-characterized SULT1C subfamily and SULT4A1. We have identified a number of novel substrates, inhibitors, and compounds that bind to these SULTs in the absence of PAP. These data combined with activity assays revealed that SULT1C3 can bind catecholamines and phenolic compounds, but only the latter are substrates. SULT4A1 is inactive as an enzyme in our experiments, likely due to its inability to bind PAPS or other sulfonate donors. This orphan SULT likely has an important function in the brain, nevertheless, because it is highly conserved and binds well to the neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine.</p><p>The approach outlined here in which simple, medium throughput binding and activity screens can be used to profile properties of purified enzymes has proven extremely useful for identification of novel substrates and analysis of specificity across a human protein family. We demonstrate that the relationship between sequence/structure and function within this small family is remarkably complex, and differences in activity can reflect just a few amino acid changes at critical locations within the protein's active site. Global sequence/structure comparisons provide good clues for broad functional classification, but cannot simply define an enzyme's cognate substrate or class of substrates. For the sulfotransferases, which have a large and flexible binding site, it is clearly necessary to perform much more detailed studies to understand both the binding and catalytic activities in terms of local structure. The actual cellular activity of hSULTs will depend on the spectrum of compounds available to a given enzyme and their relative concentrations. The tissue-specific and developmental variation in both hSULT expression and the cellular milieu of small molecules complicates further attempts to <italic>predict</italic> activities. Ultimately, detailed enzymatic characterization of all purified hSULTs, as well as cellular assays, will be needed to fully understand this family. The data presented here form a basis for further detailed biochemical and structural studies of both active and inactive enzyme&#x02013;small molecule complexes in order to fully understand the role of hSULTs in the metabolic fate of endogenous substrates, as well as drugs and toxic compounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Protein purification and crystallization.</title><p>The SULT1B1, SULT1C1, SULT1C2, SULT1C3, and SULT4A1 genes were amplified by PCR from the Mammalian Gene Collection clones and subcloned into a modified pET28a-LIC vector.
