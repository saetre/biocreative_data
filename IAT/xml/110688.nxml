Pur&#x003b1; has been implicated in diverse cellular functions, including transcriptional activation and repression, translation and cell growth. Moreover, this protein has been shown to be involved in regulating several human viruses which replicate in the central nervous system (CNS), including human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) and JC virus (JCV). Pur&#x003b1; exerts part of its activity by interacting with cellular proteins, including pRb, E2F, cyclin A, Sp1 and members of the Y-box family of proteins, including YB-1 and MSY1, as well as viral proteins such as polyomavirus large T-antigen and HIV-1 Tat. The ability of Pur&#x003b1; to interact with its target DNA sequence and to associate with several viral and cellular proteins is modulated by RNA. Pur&#x003b1; has also been shown to be involved in cell growth and proliferation. Its association with pRb, E2F and cyclin A coupled with its fluctuating levels throughout the cell cycle, position Pur&#x003b1; as a crucial factor in the cell cycle. Moreover, microinjection studies demonstrate that Pur&#x003b1; causes either a G<sub>1</sub> or G<sub>2</sub> arrest depending on the cell cycle time of injection. The gene encoding Pur&#x003b1; has been localized to a human locus which is frequently deleted in myelogenous leukemias and other cancers and Pur&#x003b1; gene deletions have been detected in many cases of lymphoid cancers. The following review details the structural characteristics of Pur&#x003b1;, its family members and the involvement of this protein in regulating various cellular and viral genes, viral replication and cell growth.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>PUR&#x003b1;: STRUCTURE, GENE FAMILY AND EVOLUTIONARY CONSERVATION</title><p>Since the initial cloning of human Pur&#x003b1; (GenBank accession no. M96684) in 1992 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c1">1</xref>), several laboratories have cloned genes encoding proteins homologous to Pur&#x003b1; (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd461tb1">1</xref>). Analysis of the predicted 322 amino acid human Pur&#x003b1; protein reveals a modular structure with a central region composed of three 23&#x000a0;amino acid class I repeats interspersed with two 26 amino acid class II repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c1">1</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd461f1">1</xref>A). Although not completely identical, each repeat preserves several identical and conservatively substituted amino acid residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd461f1">1</xref>B). The central repeat region of Pur&#x003b1; is important for binding to its single-stranded DNA target sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c3">3</xref>). This region also contains sequences important for its interaction with several regulatory proteins, including T-antigen and YB-1, as well as its oligomerization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c6">6</xref>). The class II motifs have been shown to be involved in the interaction between Pur&#x003b1; and the HIV-1 Tat protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c7">7</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the repeat modules located in the central region of the protein, Pur&#x003b1; contains several other notable structural features. The N-terminus contains a glycine-rich region including a stretch of 18 glycine residues broken only by a single serine residue. The region from residue 261 to 274 contains a potential amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix with opposing basic and aromatic side chains. Within this amphipathic helix of Pur&#x003b1; is a region of limited homology to the large tumor antigens of several polyomaviruses, including simian virus 40 (SV40), JC virus (JCV), BK virus (BKV) and several other viral as well as yeast proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c8">8</xref>). Since the consensus sequence derived from alignment of Pur&#x003b1; and these various other proteins contains PSY and C, this domain has been termed the &#x02018;psycho&#x02019; motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c8">8</xref>). Interestingly, the homology of Pur&#x003b1; to T-antigen spans a region of T-antigen necessary for its interaction with the product of the human retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene, pRb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c9">9</xref>). Moreover, studies have demonstrated that Pur&#x003b1; binds the hypophosphorylated form of pRb and that this interaction involves the region of Pur&#x003b1; encompassing the psycho motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c3">3</xref>).</p><p>The region from Lys203 to Lys229 contains a characteristic PEST (proline&#x02013;glutamate&#x02013;serine&#x02013;threonine) sequence which is thought to facilitate protein turnover in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c10">10</xref>). The C-terminus of Pur&#x003b1; contains a glutamine&#x0002f;glutamate-rich domain with half of the residues from amino acid 276 to 321 being either glutamine or glutamate. Within this region, there is a stretch of seven glutamine residues as well as a sequence of five glutamate resides broken by a single glycine. Glutamine-rich sequences are thought to function as transcriptional activation domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c11">11</xref>) and Pur&#x003b1; has been shown to be a transcriptional transactivator of several genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c14">14</xref>).</p><p>The sequence of Pur&#x003b1; is highly conserved among species. Amino acid sequence alignment of human and murine (U02098) Pur&#x003b1; reveals only two amino acid differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c8">8</xref>). Mouse Pur&#x003b1; lacks Gly49 and includes an Ala306&#x02192;Thr substitution. In addition to mammalian cells, Pur&#x003b1; sequences have also been cloned from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (AF02159), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (U70852), <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> (AF254148) and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (AF136152). The various protein sequences share a high degree of homology, particularly in the class I and, to a lesser degree, class II repeats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd461f2">2</xref>).</p><p>Pur&#x003b1; is one member of the Pur protein family; Pur&#x003b2; and Pur&#x003b3; are other family members which have been identified. Murine Pur&#x003b1; and Pur&#x003b2; (AF017630) possess 71&#x00025; sequence identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c15">15</xref>). Mouse Pur&#x003b2; exhibits the same modular structure as Pur&#x003b1; and the basic 23 amino acid class I repeats and acidic 26 amino acid class II repeats are highly conserved between murine Pur&#x003b1; and Pur&#x003b2;. There are, however, several notable differences between these two Pur proteins. More specifically, Pur&#x003b2; possesses a glycine-rich stretch which interrupts the second class II repeat and lacks the potential casein kinase II phosphorylation site present in the C-terminal region of the &#x02018;psycho&#x02019; motif of Pur&#x003b1;. Other striking differences between Pur&#x003b1; and Pur&#x003b2; lie in the N- and C-terminal ends of the proteins. While the N-terminus of Pur&#x003b1; exhibits an almost uninterrupted stretch of glycine residues (17 of 18), the glycine-rich stretch of Pur&#x003b2; (19 of 26) is interrupted by a six amino acid sequence (23FQPAPR28). Moreover, the C-terminal glutamine-rich stretch of Pur&#x003b1; is absent in Pur&#x003b2;.</p><p>A sequence for the Pur family member Pur&#x003b3; has been entered in the GenBank database (AF195513). Human Pur&#x003b3; possesses 54&#x00025; sequence identity to human Pur&#x003b1;. The class I and II repeats are conserved between Pur&#x003b1; and Pur&#x003b3;. Notable differences between these two human Pur family members include a dissimilar N-terminus, a 23 amino acid insertion within the first class II repeat of Pur&#x003b3; and the absence of the C-terminal glutamine-rich stretch in Pur&#x003b3;. The gene encoding Pur&#x003b3; is located head-to-head with the gene encoding the Werner syndrome helicase, <italic>WRN</italic>, at chromosome band 8p11. <italic>PURG</italic> had previously gone undetected in a sequence for the promoter region of <italic>WRN</italic> (AB003173). The first exon of <italic>WRN</italic> is separated from <italic>PURG</italic> by &#x0223c;1 kb, raising the prospect of genetic co-regulation.</p><p>It is interesting that there are three members of the Pur family identified to date. Although there is little functional evidence addressing the question of whether these protein family members are functionally redundant or biologically unique, several structural features suggest that they likely possess different functions. While the central repeat region is highly conserved between these Pur family members, there are various structural differences in other regions of the proteins. For example, a potential casein kinase phosphorylation site which is present in the Rb-binding domain of Pur&#x003b1; is absent in the other family members. There are many other structural differences between these Pur family members. Moreover, it is currently unclear if these proteins are differentially expressed. Additional studies are necessary to address these questions and elucidate the cellular necessity of each family member.</p><p>In 1999, Yano <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c16">16</xref>) sequenced two proteins that were reported as binding to DNA CAG or CGG triplet repeat elements. The sequences corresponded to Pur&#x003b1; and Pur&#x003b2;. These workers named their proteins CAGER-1 and CAGER-2, claiming that the original cDNA clones for Pur&#x003b1; and Pur&#x003b2; were &#x02018;misassigned&#x02019; and that Pur&#x003b1; actually encodes a 28 kDa protein. Both of those claims are in error, however, and it is very likely that the CAGERs are Pur&#x003b1; and Pur&#x003b2;. Pur&#x003b1; was originally identified as a protein of 322 amino acids, the cDNA of which was cloned from both HeLa cells and fetal liver libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c1">1</xref>). That paper was the first instance in which the terms &#x02018;Pur&#x003b1;&#x02019; and &#x02018;Pur&#x003b2;&#x02019; were used. The name Pur&#x003b1; was never used to refer to a 28 kDa protein as erroneously stated by Yano <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c16">16</xref>). In an earlier paper a protein had been identified as a Pur factor based on its ability to bind to a purine-rich single-stranded DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c17">17</xref>). When UV crosslinked and bound to an oligonucleotide, that protein migrated as a band of 28 kDa. That protein was never referred to as Pur&#x003b1;. Nor was it ever claimed that 28 kDa would be an accurate molecular weight for that protein. Based on its properties, it is most likely a Pur family member or a breakdown product of a Pur family member, but it was never given the name Pur&#x003b1;. Yano <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c16">16</xref>) wished to distinguish the putative CAGER proteins from Pur&#x003b1; and Pur&#x003b2; on the basis of tissue distribution, noting that CAGER levels are particularly high in postnatal mouse brain. The observation has been published that Pur&#x003b1; levels are high in postnatal mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c18">18</xref>). This is not inconsistent with their observations of putative CAGERs. Considerable evidence indicates, however, that Pur&#x003b1; is virtually ubiquitous, in contrast to the claim for CAGERS. Many other workers concur. The sequence for human Pur&#x003b1; is unchanged today from its originally published version in 1992 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c1">1</xref>). Various workers have sequenced true Pur&#x003b1; cDNA clones, as distinct from Pur&#x003b2; or Pur&#x003b3;, from the following human cells and tissues: HeLa cells (M96684); fetal liver (M96684); leiomyosarcoma (AW452746); germ cell tumors (AI63208); testis (AI223140); prostate (AI417720); kidney tumor (AI672340); B cells from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient (AI082370); carcinoid tumor (AA976072); lung tumor (AI829930); parathyroid tumor (AI022564); colon adenocarcinoma (AW084098); ovarian tissue (AW298527). Pur&#x003b1; cDNA has also been sequenced from the following mouse tissues: vascular smooth muscle (AF02159); spinal cord (AI85069); pineal gland (AI845412); mammary gland (AI647004); bone (AW744672).</p></sec><sec><title>PUR&#x003b1; AND NUCLEIC ACIDS</title><p>Pur&#x003b1; binds both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA in a sequence-specific fashion, but has a preference for the purine-rich single-stranded form of its recognition sequence which is composed of repeats of (GGN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c26">26</xref>). Moreover, various studies have demonstrated that the interaction between Pur&#x003b1; and its target PUR sequence elements results in the formation of multimeric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c26">26</xref>). The interaction between Pur&#x003b1; and its target sequence is modulated by several different proteins, including pRb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c3">3</xref>), YB-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c5">5</xref>), T-antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c19">19</xref>) and MyEF-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c26">26</xref>).</p><p>Pur&#x003b1; also interacts with RNA and RNA molecules have been shown to modulate the activity of Pur&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c28">28</xref>). A Pur&#x003b1;-associated cellular RNA, named PU-RNA, with significant homology to 7SL RNA has been shown to inhibit the interaction between Pur&#x003b1; and its target DNA sequence within the myelin basic protein gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c18">18</xref>). In contrast, other studies have demonstrated that the DNA-binding activity of a Pur factor is RNA-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c29">29</xref>). This Pur factor, however, while binding to a GC-rich sequence, had a molecular mass (29&#x000a0;kDa) different from that of Pur&#x003b1;. Pur&#x003b1; has also been shown to interact with the HIV-1 TAR RNA and this interaction modulates HIV-1 gene transcription via a TAR-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c27">27</xref>). Another Pur&#x003b1;-associated cellular RNA has been shown to mediate the interaction between Pur&#x003b1; and the HIV-1 Tat protein and enhance transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 promoter in the presence of Pur&#x003b1; and Tat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c28">28</xref>). RNA is also important in the self-association of Pur&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c6">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PUR&#x003b1; AND GENE TRANSCRIPTION</title><p>Pur&#x003b1; has been implicated in the transcriptional control of many cellular genes, including myelin basic protein (MBP), murine vascular smooth muscle (VSM) &#x003b1;-actin, neuron-specific FE65 gene promoter, neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine (nAch) receptor and the single-stranded cAMP response element. In addition, this protein has been implicated in the control of several viral promoters, including the JCV early gene promoter and the HIV-1 long terminal repeat.</p><p>MBP represents the first cellular gene which was shown to be transcriptionally regulated by Pur&#x003b1;. Expression of MBP, which is restricted to glial cells within the CNS, is differentially regulated during brain development. The cell type and developmental expression of MBP is regulated at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c30">30</xref>) and a proximal element, termed MB1, which contains the Pur&#x003b1; binding motif, dictates cell type-specific expression of MBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c32">32</xref>). Purification of a 39 kDa MB1-binding protein from mouse brain at the peak of myelination identified MEF-1 (myelin enhancing factor 1), with amino acid identity to Pur&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c13">13</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of MEF-1&#x0002f;Pur&#x003b1; and its interaction with the MB1 sequence occurs in a developmental stage-specific manner which coincide with the pattern of MBP gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c22">22</xref>). Functionally, Pur&#x003b1; stimulates transcription of the MBP promoter in glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c33">33</xref>), and the GC&#x0002f;GA-rich domain within the MB1 region which is necessary for binding of Pur&#x003b1; is required for this activity.</p><p>Pur&#x003b1; interacts with other cellular regulatory proteins, including MyEF-2 and Sp1, which regulate MBP gene transcription. MyEF-2 is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein which decreases transcription of the MBP gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c34">34</xref>). It was shown that the interaction bewteen Pur&#x003b1; and MyEF-2 can determine the binding of these proteins to their target DNA sequences within the MB1 motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c26">26</xref>). Evidently, both proteins can exert a negative effect on each other&#x02019;s DNA binding activity. Based on the programmed expression of Pur&#x003b1; and MyEF-2 during myelination and the interplay between these two proteins, a model for their involvement in the transcriptional regulation of the MBP gene during the course of brain development has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c26">26</xref>). According to this model, the association of MyEF-1 with MB1 in the early phase of brain development when the level of Pur&#x003b1; is minimum suppresses MBP gene transcription. In the later stages, when the level of Pur&#x003b1; increases, the interaction between Pur&#x003b1; and MB1 displaces MyEF-2 from the MBP promoter and results in stimulation of the MBP gene.</p><p>Pur&#x003b1; also associates with the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1, which has been shown to regulate MBP gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c33">33</xref>). Sp1 interacts with the MB1 DNA motif at a region that partially overlaps with the Pur&#x003b1; binding site. Sp1 enhances the interaction between Pur&#x003b1; and MB1 without the formation of a Pur&#x003b1;&#x02013;MB1&#x02013;Sp1 complex. Functionally, overexpression of Pur&#x003b1; and Sp1 in CNS cells results in synergistic stimulation of the MBP promoter.</p><p>Mouse VSM &#x003b1;-actin is another target gene regulated by Pur&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c15">15</xref>). Transcriptional regulation of the VSM &#x003b1;-actin promoter in both fibroblasts and undifferentiated myoblasts is mediated, in part, by an asymmetrical polypurine&#x0002f;polypyrimidine tract containing an inverted muscle-specific MCAT (AGGAATG) enhancer motif which has been shown to interact with at least three distinct DNA binding activities. The double-stranded form of this sequence serves as a binding site for a transcription enhancer factor 1-related protein which has&#x000a0;been implicated in transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c36">36</xref>). Two distinct single-stranded DNA binding activities, called <underline>v</underline>ascular <underline>ac</underline>tin <underline>s</underline>ingle-<underline>s</underline>trand <underline>b</underline>inding <underline>f</underline>actors, VACssBF 1 and 2, have been implicated in transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c37">37</xref>). VACssBF 2, which consists of two distinct polypeptides (p44 and p46), was shown to be necessary and sufficient for repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c38">38</xref>). Further experiments revealed the identity of the p46 and p44 components of VACssBF2 as Pur&#x003b1; and Pur&#x003b2;, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c15">15</xref>). This group also demonstrated that Pur&#x003b1; and Pur&#x003b2; interact with each other and can bind as hetero- and homodimers to the purine-rich strand of the MCAT enhancer and that both Pur proteins interact with the mouse Y-box protein MSY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c39">39</xref>). MSY1 is highly homologous to the human protein YB-1, previously reported to interact with Pur&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c5">5</xref>). These Y-box proteins bind to pyrimidine-rich elements that could be the complementary sequence of many PUR elements. The finding that Pur&#x003b1; associates with Y-box proteins in two different systems highlights the potential significance of this interaction in gene regulation.</p><p>Interestingly, Pur&#x003b1;, Pur&#x003b2; and MSY1 also interact with an mRNA sequence derived from the coding region of VSM &#x003b1;-actin which has similarity to the MCAT enhancer in the 5&#x02032; promoter of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c40">40</xref>). Furthermore, this sequence suppressed mRNA translation when placed in the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region of a reporter mRNA. Translational efficiency was restored by mutations within this sequence which impaired the binding of Pur&#x003b1;, Pur&#x003b2; and MSY1, suggesting that these proteins may also participate in translation.</p><p>Pur&#x003b1; has been suggested to play a role in the transcriptional regulation of the neuronal nAch receptor gene, specifically the &#x003b2;4 subunit gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c21">21</xref>). A sequence element in the promoter region of the rat &#x003b2;4 subunit gene (termed E1) was used in a purification scheme to isolate nuclear proteins which interact with this element. Four polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 31, 43, 65 and 114 kDa were detected. Peptide sequence analysis of the 43 kDa polypeptide indicated that it was the bovine homolog of Pur&#x003b1;. Functionally, a mutation within the E1 sequence, which abrogated the interaction with Pur&#x003b1;, resulted in a 70&#x00025; reduction in promoter activity, suggesting a functional role of Pur&#x003b1; in transcriptional control of the nAch receptor gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c41">41</xref>). Additionally, Sp1 and Sp3 have been shown to be involved in &#x003b2;4 gene expression via their interactions with E2, which is located immediately downstream of E1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c42">42</xref>). As Pur&#x003b1; both functionally and structurally interacts with Sp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c33">33</xref>), the interaction between these two proteins may regulate expression from the &#x003b2;4 subunit of the nAch receptor gene as well.</p><p>Pur&#x003b1; has also been implicated in transcriptional regulation of the FE65 gene. FE65 is a 90 kDa adaptor protein that interacts with the Alzheimer &#x003b2;-amyloid precursor protein. The FE65 gene has a TATA-less promoter that drives expression mainly in neurons. The minimal promoter region which is functional in neural cells forms three major DNA&#x02013;protein complexes, termed BI, BII and BIII, when incubated with rat brain nuclear extract. Purification of BI and BII revealed that both proteins were Pur&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c14">14</xref>). In Chinese hamster ovary cells, where the activity of the FE65 promoter is very low, transient overexpression of Pur&#x003b1; increased expression from the FE65 minimal promoter. Interestingly, purification of the BIII protein revealed identity to the YYI transcription factor. Although YY1 also activated the FE65 minimal promoter, no cooperation was observed between Pur&#x003b1; and YY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c14">14</xref>).</p><p>Pur&#x003b1; has also been implicated in chronic morphine dependence. Osugi <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c44">44</xref>) demonstrated that the DNA binding activity of a nuclear single-stranded cyclic AMP response element (ssCRE)-binding protein (ssCRE-BP) is decreased after chronic morphine administration. Subsequent purification of murine ssCRE-BP revealed identity to mouse Pur&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c45">45</xref>). Interestingly, the levels of ssCRE-BP&#x0002f;Pur&#x003b1; mRNA or protein were not changed by chronic morphine treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c45">45</xref>). The DNA binding activity of Pur&#x003b1;, however, was shown to be enhanced by the addition of a heat stable activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c46">46</xref>). Purification of this activator revealed identity to calmodulin (CaM) and CaM was shown to enhance the interaction between Pur&#x003b1; and various PUR elements derived from the 5&#x02032;-non-coding regions of various genes, including the myelin basic protein gene, the nAch receptor &#x003b2;4 subunit gene, the somatostatin ssCRE and the CaM response element of the neuropeptide Y gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c47">47</xref>). These data suggest that Pur&#x003b1; may regulate transcription of various genes through Ca&#x0002f;CaM and subsequent characterization of the physiological role of Pur&#x003b1; and Ca&#x0002f;CaM in control of transcription and replication via PUR elements represents exciting prospects in signaling mechanisms involved in Pur&#x003b1; function.</p><p>Pur&#x003b1; has been implicated in control of expression of various other cellular genes, including the transforming growth factor &#x003b2;-1 (TGF&#x003b2;-1) promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c24">24</xref>) and the <italic>A.thaliana</italic> translation elongation factor eEF1A via its interaction with interstitial telomere sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c25">25</xref>). Other studies suggest that Pur&#x003b1; may be increased in allergic airway inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c48">48</xref>). Additionally, a Pur element has been shown to function as an enhancer for the clusterin gene in Rous sarcoma virus-infected avian fibroblasts (v-src) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c49">49</xref>).</p><p>In considering mechanisms by which Pur&#x003b1; family members may influence transcription through binding to DNA promoter elements, parallels may be found in the far upstream element (FUSE)-binding protein (FBP) family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c50">50</xref>). As do the Pur proteins, FBP proteins bind specifically to a single strand of their DNA recognition elements, FUSE. Although there is little homology between Pur and FBP proteins, there are certain functionally significant similarities. Both FBP proteins and Pur&#x003b1; possess a prominent poly(G) motif near their N-termini, as do several other single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. In both protein families, the most conserved sequence is in the central DNA-binding region. FBP proteins and Pur&#x003b1; also possess sequences of known transcriptional activation capacity near their C-termini. The ability of FBP to bind its melted DNA element upstream of the c-<italic>myc</italic> gene <italic>in vivo</italic> has been related to the degree of c-<italic>myc</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c51">51</xref>). It has been proposed that the single-stranded nature of FUSE is created by supercoiling resulting from transcription and that by binding the torsionally strained DNA, FBP can directly measure promoter activity. The melted DNA at FUSE can serve as a flexible hinge, facilitating interaction between FBP and other protein factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c52">52</xref>).</p><p>As mentioned earlier, in addition to its role in regulating varied and diverse cellular genes, Pur&#x003b1; is also involved in regulating several human viruses which replicate in the CNS, including JCV and HIV-1. Expression of JCV is tissue-specific and is determined primarily at the level of viral gene transcription (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c53">53</xref>). The transcriptional control region of this virus is composed of a bidirectional 98 bp promoter&#x0002f;enhancer repeat which has a pentanucleotide repeat sequence (AGGGAAGGGA) designated the lytic control element (LCE). This motif, which affects viral gene expression and replication, has been shown to interact with a nuclear factor termed the lytic control element binding protein (LCP-1) which bears remarkable similarity to Pur&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c54">54</xref>). Subsequent studies demonstrated that this PUR sequence element does indeed interact with Pur&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c2">2</xref>).</p><p>Pur&#x003b1; has been shown to stimulate JCV early gene transcription and decrease the ability of the viral regulatory protein, T-antigen, to increase the level of JCV late gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c12">12</xref>). The functional antagonism between Pur&#x003b1; and T-antigen is mitigated by their physical interaction with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c4">4</xref>). A mutant Pur&#x003b1; which is unable to interact with T-antigen is incapable of abrogating T-antigen-mediated transcriptional activation. The complementary strand of the LCE and similar PUR sequences in JC variant strains contain a polypyrimidine stretch which has been shown to interact with the Y-box binding protein YB-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c5">5</xref>). Moreover, Pur&#x003b1; interacts with YB-1 and this interaction regulates JC viral early and late gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c5">5</xref>). This is reminiscent of the interaction between Pur&#x003b1; and MSY1, suggesting that members of the Pur and Y-box families can combinatorally regulate various cellular and viral genes.</p><p>Interestingly, there is a high incidence of the JCV-induced demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) among individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), suggesting that the presence of HIV-1 in the brains of infected individuals induces JCV gene transcription and replication. In support of this synergism, the transregulatory protein of HIV-1, Tat, has been shown to activate the JCV late gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c56">56</xref>). Tat is a transcription activator that interacts with a <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA sequence called TAR and several DNA-binding transcription factors to stimulate transcription of the HIV genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c57">57</xref>). Interestingly, the Tat-responsive sequence of JCV contains a PUR element and Pur&#x003b1; and Tat synergistically activate the JCV late gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c7">7</xref>). Results from protein&#x02013;protein interaction studies revealed that Pur&#x003b1; has the ability to interact with the HIV-1 Tat protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c28">28</xref>). This interaction is dependent on RNA molecules, as treatment with RNase abrogates their interaction. Several RNA species involved in the interaction between HIV-1 Tat and Pur&#x003b1; have been cloned and these molecules specifically reconstitute the interaction between these two proteins. Furthermore, co-expression of the RNA in the sense orientation results in increased transcriptional activity of Pur&#x003b1; and Tat on the HIV-1 LTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c28">28</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PUR&#x003b1; AND CONTROL OF CELL GROWTH</title><p>There is mounting evidence that Pur&#x003b1; is integrally involved in cell growth. Pur&#x003b1; was originally cloned by its affinity for the PUR element adjacent to a region of stably bent DNA 1.6 kb upstream of the human c-<italic>myc</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c1">1</xref>). This element is near the center of an initiation zone of chromosomal replication. Moreover, PUR elements are present at eukaryotic origins of DNA replication. Pur&#x003b1; has also been shown to interact with viral origins of DNA replication, including the JCV and bovine papillomavirus origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c23">23</xref>). The first functional indication of Pur&#x003b1;&#x02019;s role in replication emerged from studies utilizing the JC viral origin of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c19">19</xref>). These studies demonstrated that Pur&#x003b1; suppresses JC viral DNA replication in human glial cells. Interestingly, when an antisense RNA was expressed, JCV DNA replication was stimulated, suggesting that the endogenous Pur&#x003b1; exerts a negative effect on replication. In addition to the location of PUR elements and the effect of Pur&#x003b1; on viral DNA replication, additional evidence supporting a role for Pur&#x003b1; in the control of cellular growth and proliferation is derived from alterations in Pur&#x003b1; levels and intracellular localization during the cell cycle, the association of Pur&#x003b1; with key cell cycle regulatory proteins and viral oncoproteins, protein microinjection studies and identification of gene deletions in human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c63">63</xref>).</p><p>Alterations in the intracellular levels of Pur&#x003b1; have been demonstrated in CV-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c58">58</xref>). Levels of Pur&#x003b1; decline precipitously in the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle, just prior to the onset of S phase, and remain low in early S phase. Levels subsequently recover throughout the late S and G<sub>2</sub> phases of the cell cycle to peak at mitosis. Pur&#x003b1; levels remain maximal through cytokinesis and re-entry into early G<sub>1</sub>. Earlier studies demonstrated that Pur&#x003b1; interacts with the hypophosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product, pRb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c3">3</xref>). pRb is an integral protein involved in progression of the cell cycle (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c64">64</xref>). The hypophosphorylated form of pRb complexes with a variety of proteins in the G<sub>0</sub> and G<sub>1</sub> phases of the cell cycle, including transcription factors such as E2F. Hyperphosphorylation of pRb in late G<sub>1</sub> results in the release of these transcription factors from pRb and allows E2F to activate genes necessary for progression through G<sub>1</sub> and entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. Co-immunoprecipitation studies have demonstrated that the association between Pur&#x003b1; and pRb is restricted to the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c58">58</xref>). Moreover, during the late S and G<sub>2</sub> phases of the cell cycle, Pur&#x003b1; co-immunoprecipitates with cyclin A and co-localizes with cyclin A in replication foci in the nucleus. These observations suggest a role for Pur&#x003b1; in mediating cell cycle events in the late S and G<sub>2</sub> phases of the cell cycle. In addition, the decline in Pur&#x003b1; levels at the beginning of S phase could itself play a regulatory role representing a positive signal for the onset of DNA replication. These studies were performed in CV-1 cells. Additional studies in other cell lineages investigating the cell cycle-dependent alteration in intracellular levels are necessary to determine if this trend occurs in other cell systems.</p><p>Interestingly, Pur&#x003b1; has also been shown to interact with E2F-1 and this interaction decreases the ability of E2F-1 to exert its transcriptional activity upon the dihydrofolate reductase gene (DHFR) promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c20">20</xref>). This suppression is due to the ability of Pur&#x003b1; to inhibit the interaction of E2F-1 with its target sequence. Interestingly, Pur&#x003b1; and E2F-1 bind to the same region of pRb, suggesting that the association of Pur&#x003b1; with pRb may liberate E2F-1. These observations indicate that Pur&#x003b1; may play an important role in the activity of E2F-1 during the cell cycle. Future studies detailing the phase(s) during which Pur&#x003b1; interacts with E2F-1 will help clarify Pur&#x003b1;&#x02019;s emerging relationship with these key cell cycle regulators.</p><p>Evidence from protein microinjection studies provides perhaps the most direct evidence of Pur&#x003b1;&#x02019;s role in cell cycle progression. Stacey <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c59">59</xref>) microinjected Pur&#x003b1; into NIH 3T3 cells and employed a video time-lapse technique to determine the cell cycle position. Approximately 80&#x00025; of cells injected with Pur&#x003b1; were inhibited from passing through mitosis, with most cells blocked in the G<sub>2</sub> phase, although a lesser block was seen in G<sub>1</sub>. In this study, cells were also injected with a mutant Pur&#x003b1; protein which contains the first 215 amino acids. This mutant contained two of the three DNA-binding repeats, but importantly lacked the Rb-binding and glutamine-rich domains. Interestingly, microinjection of this mutant had no effect upon cell cycle progression. These observations provide substantial evidence that Pur&#x003b1; is involved in cell cycle progression. Additional experiments are necessary to fully decipher the molecular mechanism(s) involved in this process.</p><p>As noted above, Pur&#x003b1; also interacts with large T-antigen from several polyomaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c65">65</xref>). One well-characterized function of viral oncoproteins, including T-antigens, is cellular transformation. One mechanism by which these proteins are able to cause cellular transformation is via their interaction with the products of tumor suppressor genes, such as p53 and pRb. The interaction between Pur&#x003b1; and these viral oncoproteins raises interesting questions as to the cellular role of Pur&#x003b1;. This is particularly noteworthy in the light of several observations regarding Pur&#x003b1;. <italic>PURA</italic>, the gene encoding Pur&#x003b1;, has been localized to human chromosome band 5q31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c60">60</xref>). Loss of heterozygosity at this locus is frequently associated with hematological malignancies, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c62">62</xref>). Moreover, <italic>PURA</italic> gene deletions have been demonstrated in many cases of myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd461c63">63</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Since its first description 8 years ago, much has been learned about Pur&#x003b1;. This sequence-specific DNA- and RNA-binding protein is involved in diverse cellular functions, including transcription, translation and cell growth. Additionally, it is involved in regulating HIV-1 and JC viruses. Although the exact mechanism of its involvement in the cell cycle is as yet undescribed, Pur&#x003b1; plays a role in control of the cell cycle. Moreover, the fact that Pur&#x003b1; is highly conserved among various eukaryotic organisms suggests that Pur&#x003b1; is a critical protein. Future experiments dissecting the role of this founding member of the Pur family as well as other family members will ultimately unravel the diverse functions of this protein.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd461f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Structural organization of human Pur&#x003b1; protein.
