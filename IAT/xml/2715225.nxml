On the other hand, human PSF was originally identified as a component of spliceosomes, and its multiple functions in RNA processing, transcription and DNA recombination were subsequently revealed. In the present study, we found that PSF directly interacted with RAD51. PSF significantly enhanced RAD51-mediated homologous pairing and strand exchange at low RAD51 concentrations; however, in contrast, it inhibited these RAD51-mediated recombination reactions at the optimal RAD51 concentration. Deletion analyses revealed that the N-terminal region of PSF possessed the RAD51- and DNA-binding activities, but the central region containing the RNA-recognition motifs bound neither RAD51 nor DNA. These results suggest that PSF may have dual functions in homologous recombination and RNA processing through its N-terminal and central regions, respectively.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Homologous recombination functions in accurate chromosome segregation during meiotic cell division I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Defects in meiotic homologous recombination in mice cause infertility, indicating its required function in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). Homologous recombination also has essential functions in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and the rescue of stalled replication forks during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>). The homologous-recombination defects in mitosis cause instability of the genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), leading to chromosomal aberrations and tumorigenesis. Therefore, homologous recombination is essential for both meiotic and mitotic cell divisions.</p><p>RAD51, a eukaryotic homologue of bacterial RecA, is a central DNA recombinase, which functions in both meiotic and mitotic homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). During the homologous-recombination process, RAD51 promotes the key recombination reactions, homologous pairing and strand exchange, in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14 B15">11&#x02013;15</xref>). To promote homologous pairing, RAD51 first binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which is produced at the DSB site, and forms helical nucleoprotein filaments. The RAD51&#x02013;ssDNA filaments then bind to intact double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The homologous sequences are aligned between ssDNA and dsDNA, and new Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs (heteroduplex) are formed between the ssDNA and the complementary strand of the dsDNA within the RAD51&#x02013;ssDNA&#x02013;dsDNA filament. This step is called homologous pairing. The heteroduplex region formed by homologous pairing is further expanded by the RAD51-mediated strand exchange reaction. RAD51 requires cofactors for efficient promotion of the homologous-pairing and strand-exchange reactions. In humans, RAD52, RAD54, RAD54B, RAD51B&#x02013;RAD51C, RAD51AP1 and BRCA2 have been reported as such cofactors for the RAD51-mediated homologous pairing and/or strand exchange reactions <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10">7&#x02013;10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>).</p><p>Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF) was first identified as a component of the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). A tandem repeat of RNA-recognition motifs was found in the central region of PSF, suggesting that PSF functions in RNA processing through its RNA-binding activity. Subsequently, the DNA-binding activity of PSF and its regulatory function for transcription were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23 B24">20&#x02013;24</xref>). PSF was also identified in a complex form with its paralog, p54(nrb). The PSF&#x02013;p54(nrb) complex reportedly binds to mRNAs, and functions in pre-mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). A biochemical study revealed that the PSF&#x02013;p54(nrb) complex also stimulates the DNA end joining reaction by Ku70/80, DNA ligase IV and XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). These facts suggest that PSF may be a multifunctional protein, which functions in RNA processing, transcription regulation and DNA recombination.</p><p>Interestingly, PSF alone reportedly promotes homologous pairing between ssDNA and dsDNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), suggesting that PSF may also be involved in homologous recombination. To evaluate the functions of PSF in homologous recombination, in the present study, we tested whether PSF affects the recombination reactions promoted by RAD51, which is an essential recombinase in both meiotic and mitotic homologous recombination. We found that purified human PSF directly binds to RAD51. Biochemical analyses revealed that PSF synergistically stimulates RAD51-mediated homologous pairing and strand exchange under low RAD51 conditions. In contrast, the RAD51-mediated recombination reactions were significantly inhibited by PSF, when the RAD51 concentrations were optimal for the homologous-pairing and strand-exchange reactions without PSF. Domain mapping analyses showed that the N-terminal region (amino acid residues 1&#x02013;266) of PSF and the central ATPase domain (amino acid residues 82&#x02013;339) of RAD51 are involved in the PSF&#x02013;RAD51 binding. The PSF central region (amino acid residues 267&#x02013;468), containing a tandem repeat of RNA-recognition motifs, did not bind to DNA, while in contrast, the N-terminal 1&#x02013;266 fragment of PSF bound to ssDNA and dsDNA. Therefore, the N-terminal region of PSF may be the functional domain for binding RAD51 and regulating the RAD51-mediated recombination reactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein purification</title><p>The human <italic>PSF</italic> gene was isolated from a human cDNA pool by polymerase chain reaction, and was cloned into the pET-15b vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany).

Therefore, we tested whether PSF affects strand exchange between ssDNA and an RNA/DNA hybrid, which may be formed when transcription stalls. To do so, we performed a strand exchange assay with short oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). In this assay, the 32-mer dsDNA and RNA/DNA hybrid were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Consistent with the results from the D-loop formation assay and the strand-exchange assay with long DNA substrates, PSF stimulated the RAD51-mediated strand exchange with oligonucleotides under the suboptimal RAD51 conditions.

These PSF deletion mutants were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, and PSF(1&#x02013;266) and PSF(267&#x02013;468) were successfully obtained in the soluble fractions. However, PSF(469&#x02013;707) was only found in the insoluble fraction, suggesting that it did not fold properly. Therefore, we purified PSF(1&#x02013;266) and PSF(267&#x02013;468) as recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). The purified PSF deletion mutants did not contain the His<sub>6</sub> tag. The predicted molecular masses of PSF, PSF(1&#x02013;266), and PSF(267&#x02013;468) are 76, 26 and 23 kDa, respectively.

A mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the molecular masses of purified PSF, PSF(1&#x02013;266), and PSF(267&#x02013;468) were 76, 26 and 23 kDa, respectively. Therefore, the abnormal migrations of PSF and PSF(1&#x02013;266) on the SDS-denaturing polyacrylamide gel may be a consequence of their basic pI values, 9.45 and 12.01, respectively. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Purification of the PSF deletion mutants.

In addition to these functions, interestingly, PSF was purified from a HeLa cell extract as a protein that promotes homologous pairing between ssDNA and dsDNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). This finding suggested that PSF may also function in homologous recombination, and prompted us to test whether PSF affects the recombination activity of RAD51, which is a central protein for homologous recombination in eukaryotes.</p><p>In the present study, we purified human PSF as a recombinant protein, and found that PSF directly binds to RAD51. Interestingly, PSF stimulates RAD51-mediated homologous pairing and strand exchange at low RAD51 concentrations, but inhibits these reactions at high RAD51 concentrations, which are optimal for the reactions without PSF. These findings suggest that PSF may be a novel recombination factor, which has both activator and suppressor functions for the RAD51 recombinase activity. During the initial period of homologous recombination in cells, PSF may function as activator, perhaps because the RAD51 accumulation at the recombination sites is not yet sufficient. The RAD51 concentration at the recombination sites is supposed to increase during the homologous recombination processes. Excess RAD51 accumulation on chromosomes at later stages of homologous recombination may induce undesired recombination, which may cause the chromosomal aberrations frequently found in tumor cells. PSF may then function as an inhibitor of RAD51, to suppress such inappropriate recombination reactions by removing RAD51 from ssDNA during homologous recombination. We found that PSF competes with RAD51 for ssDNA binding, and removes RAD51 from ssDNA. This fact indicated that PSF does not form a three-component complex with RAD51 and ssDNA, although the PSF&#x02013;RAD51 complex is formed in the absence of ssDNA. Therefore, PSF may be recruited to the recombination sites as a complex form with RAD51, and may be released from RAD51 to free the ssDNA region when RAD51 is assembled on the recombination site.</p><p>We and others found that PSF alone (i) binds to ssDNA and dsDNA, (ii) promotes D-loop formation between ssDNA and dsDNA, and (iii) anneals complementary ssDNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In this study, we also found that (iv) the N-terminal domain of PSF directly binds to the central ATPase domain of RAD51, and (v) PSF modulates the RAD51-mediated homologous pairing and strand exchange reactions. These biochemical characteristics of PSF partially overlap with those of RAD52, which is an important activator for RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10">7&#x02013;10</xref>). In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the <italic>rad52</italic> mutation reportedly exhibits significant sensitivity to DSB inducing agents, such as ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). However, the <italic>RAD52</italic>-knockout chicken DT40 cells did not show significant defects in DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). This discrepancy may explain the functional redundancy of RAD52 with other factors in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). PSF may share a common function with RAD52 in vertebrates.</p><p>PSF was also purified from a nuclear extract of HeLa cells, as a complex form with p54(nrb). Intriguingly, the PSF&#x02013;p54(nrb) complex stimulated a non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) reaction by Ku70/80, DNA ligase IV and XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). NHEJ is a rapid, error-prone DSB repair pathway. On the other hand, homologous-recombinational repair (HRR) is an accurate, error-free DSB repair pathway. The present study has provided new evidence that PSF physically and functionally interacts with RAD51, which is the central enzyme for the homologous recombination reactions. Therefore, PSF may be involved in both DSB repair pathways, NHEJ and HRR, with different partners, p54(nrb) and RAD51, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Grants-in-Aid from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.
